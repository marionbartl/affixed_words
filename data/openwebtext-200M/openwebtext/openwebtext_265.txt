On Monday , DIA inspectors obtained search warrants and made four simultaneous raids on Christchurch properties , seizing 22 computers and boxes of documents .
On Tuesday , they spoke to two men who they described as " businessmen " but declined to identify .
They were now assessing the evidence before deciding what action to take .
The raids were the first since New Zealand 's anti-spam law took effect in September , bringing in fines of up to $ NZ500,000 for an organisation or $ NZ200,000 for an individual .
In August 2003 , the Christchurch businessman named by the Danish spambuster told The Press the spamming business paid well , and claimed to have had sales of $ NZ300,000 in the previous eight months .
" When you look at it , most men are willing to spend a couple of hundred bucks if they think it will give them a few more inches down there , " he said , referring to penis - enlargement products .
" What man does n't want that ?
So , yes , it is a good business . "
The alleged spammer , then described as a father of two and former hospitality worker , said he had 15 different types of American - made penis - enlargement pills , with the spam emails being channelled through servers in Poland and Pakistan .
He said he had had " plenty of death threats " , but was unapologetic about the impact on recipients , adding : " If you do n't want to receive spam , do n't connect to the internet , or do n't have an email address . "
The same man last week was identified as the Christchurch spamlord by Danish IT consultant Henrik Uffe Jensen , who said he had been plagued by spam emails and decided to fight back by getting through the concealment methods used to hide the originating address .
The BBC claimed the method he used was to place an order for penis - enlargement pills , but to include a secret piece of computer code that would get through the slave or zombie computers used to hide the originator .
The BBC made contact with the alleged spammer , who denied the allegations .

French transit workers back on job Nine - day strike cost the economy billions of dollars
Most striking French transportation workers returned to their jobs Friday , ending the most damaging public transit strike in a dozen years and restoring normalcy to the streets of Paris and other major cities .
President Nicolas Sarkozy said the nine - day strike , which frustrated the public and cost the French economy hundreds of millions of dollars a day , did not diminish his determination to reduce expensive worker benefits and trim the French bureaucracy .
" I have no intention to stop the reform movement , no intention to slow it down , no intention to forget my promises , " he said .
" I made commitments .
They will be kept . "
Both sides claimed some victory in the strike , and the main issues remain unresolved .
Although the unions have agreed to discuss eliminating special pension programs , as Sarkozy advocated , union leaders said they will make new demands for salary and bonus increases .
Unions also have said they might call strikes in time for the Christmas holidays if negotiations with the government fail .
Prime Minister Francois Fillon praised the French public on Thursday for its perseverance during the strike .
" Some people had to make incredible efforts to go to work , " he told a group of French mayors .
" They gave the image of a France that does n't give up , that wants to work , that deserves respect and esteem .
Believe me , the government heard this France . "
The strike clogged city streets with traffic , cut off some rural towns from train passenger and freight service , and inconvenienced workers who struggled to get to their jobs on foot , bicycles and children 's scooters .
The strike was the first major threat to Sarkozy 's announced plans to change a French social structure that gives generous benefits to many public employees , limits the hours public - and private - sector employees may work , and imposes steep charges on private businesses for employee benefits .
The government and train , subway and bus unions will have negotiations in coming weeks to debate Sarkozy 's plan to require transport , energy , opera and other employees to work 40 years instead of 37.5 before retiring with full pensions .
All but 2 percent of the striking workers returned to their jobs Friday .
Disruptions remained on nationwide railways because of sabotage during the strike and the failure of some drivers to work .
The train service said on its
Web site that delays and cancellations will continue through the weekend , but that full service is likely to be restored by Monday .
KEEPING track of tires is no problem for most motorists , even if they own more than one car and switch between sets of winter and summer treads .
But for commercial fleets that operate hundreds of trucks with 18 tires each , knowing the history and location of individual tires is more pressing .
Engineers at Michelin have developed electronic tire - tracking systems that use batteryless radio - frequency identification tags  microchip devices working on the same principle as an E - ZPass tag  to log important information that stays with the tires .
Image ID Michelins tag .
For commercial truckers , tires are valuable assets ; they must be properly inflated to avoid the costly downtime required when they wear out prematurely .
Tires used on 18 - wheelers are retreaded when they wear down  a service life of 700,000 miles , with three retreads , is typical .
Jisp - a dialect of Lisp in JavaScript
Brian Morearty
May 10 , 2006 ( with major additions July , 2007 )
Jisp is a new dialect of Lisp that I invented .
I realized that JavaScript has so many similarities with Lisp that it would be easy to write a JavaScript - based Lisp language that uses the browser 's JavaScript parser rather than writing my own parser .
It turned out to be even easier than I expected -- it took me an evening to create the basic language .
( It 's not a complete Lisp implementation , of course . )
It looks a little different from most Lisp dialects .
( Uses brackets instead of parentheses and uses commas between list elements ) because of its basis in JavaScript .
Here is a sample Jisp expression that adds two numbers .
This expression does not have side - effects ( such as UI output ) -- it just returns a result :
[ plus , 7 , 3 ]
I have tested it in IE6 , IE7 , and Firefox 1.5 and 2.0 .
To evaluate a Jisp expression or sequence of expressions , call the jisp ( ) function from JavaScript .
Here are some more samples .
In December 2006 , Dr. Mark Trexler authored a controversial paper called A Consumer ’s Guide to Retail Carbon Offset Providers .
He studied and ranked the numerous firms selling carbon offsets - also known as carbon credits - and named several firms with credible products .
However , some of the most popular companies in the fledgling industry came out smelling , well , rather bad .
The report caused quite a flap .
Dr. Trexler is Managing Director of EcoSecurities Global Consulting Services , an international carbon trading and consulting firm .
I caught up with him at the noisy EUEC Energy and Environment Conference held at the end of every January in the foothills of Tucson , Arizona .
Scientists , policy makers and business leaders from around the world gathered to tackle the fabulously difficult issues of climate change and energy .
Here are Dr. Trexler ’s thoughts on topics including whether the Federal Trade Commission will find fraud in the carbon market during its ongoing investigation , when he thinks carbon credits work , and whether to buy them .
A couple of notes in case you ’re not familiar with terms used in this piece .
Additionality describes whether a project that is the beneficiary of carbon credit funds objectively reduces atmospheric CO 2 or not .
The Chicago Climate Exchange is one of a number of groups that 's similar to a stock exchange for the carbon market .
HFC - 23 is a greenhouse gas almost 12,000 times more potent than CO 2 .

Ann Arbor is on its way to being the first U.S. city to light up its downtown with 100 % LED - based streetlights .
The city expects to install more than 1,000 LED streetlights beginning next month .
The city anticipates a 3.8 - year payback on its initial investment .
The LED lights typically burn five times longer than the bulbs they replace and require less than half the energy .
The LED streetlights currently installed in Ann Arbor are by Lumecon , which contain LED light engines from Relume Technologies .
The light engines are based on the Cree XLamp LED .
Full implementation of LEDs is projected to cut Ann Arbor ’s public lighting energy use in half and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2,425 tons of CO2 annually , the equivalent of taking 400 cars off the road for a year .
Detroit Edison , Ann Arbor ’s local utility provider , will meter the new LED streetlights with the intent to gather sufficient information to develop new LED - based tariffs .
Other North American cities like Raleigh , N.C. , and Toronto , have started installing LED streetlights too .
Above is a diagram of the Relume streetlight by Lumecon .

My friend Eric called me up late the other night from somewhere outside of Barcade , panting breathlessly in the cold .
“ Dude , do n’t go to bed yet , ” he said .
“ I ’m bringing something over for you . ”
And what a something it was !
In its heyday , he looked like this , functioning as an expensive karaoke toy .

This is a photo of my friend Eliza interacting with the Elvis - bot in better times :
I imagine there was either a messy breakup or a drunken kickboxing match , and Elvis - bot here took one right in the grill , then got dumped in the road .
The thing is , covered in grime and with part of his face missing , it ’s MILLIONS of times cooler than it ever was brand - new .
Sure , it took a little trauma and a lot of scarring , but that ’s what builds real character in humans and robots alike .
This thing exists at the crossroads of all my favorite things :
Japanese pop culture , zombies , robots and rock ‘n roll .
I left him on the kitchen table for my sleeping roommate to discover when she woke up at dawn .
She said that first she was petrified , thinking that there was a man in the kitchen quietly staring .
Then that terror gave way to an entirely different kind of terror when she realized that it was n’t a man at all , but an Elvis robot with his face half tore off .
Now he sits in a place of honor on my dresser , quietly shedding synthetic hair and freaking the cat out .
I still get a little jolt of terror when I get up in the night .
It ’s delicious , a shot of espresso - flavored freon shooting through my veins .
Of course I took a million photos of it , and I ’m not done by a long shot .
I distract myself from daydreams of Antarctica by dreaming about getting this guy working again and starting up a band to play in subway tunnels around the world .
If any of you guys know where I can get an adapter or the remote control that runs this thing , please let a guy know — I ’m dying to get him running again .
Here ’s the best of the latest batch of photos :
This one really reminds me of Stephen Blickenstaff ’s cover of the Cramps ’ “ Bad Music for Bad People , ” a perfect album if there ever was one :

When explaining his position on Iraqi reconciliation , John McCain told an audience last year , “ One of the things I would do if I were President would be to sit the Shiites and the Sunnis down and say , ‘ Stop the bullshit . ’ ”
As Brendan Nyhan noted , McCain ’s approach to the debate over surveillance laws is awfully similar , though less vulgar .
Senator John McCain of Arizona , the Republican presidential hopeful , weighed in on the debate .
When Mr. McCain learned that the House had voted down a 21 - day extension and that the powers were likely to lapse at midnight Friday , he said : “ That ’s too bad .
That ’s very unfortunate .
It ’s symptomatic of the gridlock of partisanship here in the Congress . ”
To break the gridlock , Mr. McCain said , “ people that are patriotic Americans need to sit down together and work this out . ”
Oh , is that all .
Why did n’t anyone else think of that ?
Remember , when McCain went after Barack Obama earlier this week , he told reporters , “ I respect him and the campaign that he has run , but there ’s going to come a time when we have to get into specifics . ”
The irony is rich .
LSD  The Problem - Solving Psychedelic
P.G. Stafford and B.H. Golightly
Chapter III .
Creative Problem Solving
It is a highly significant , though generally neglected fact that those creations of the human mind which have borne pre-eminently the stamp of originality and greatness , have not come from within the region of consciousness .
They have come from beyond consciousness , knocking at its door for admittance : they have flowed into it , sometimes slowly as if by seepage , but often with a burst of overwhelming power . [ 1 ]

External Conditions :
When I took the Rorschach there - was just nothing there .
I tried very hard to find something to say , but there was just very little there to be said .
Only Card VIII was definitely something .
I wanted to say " Squirrels , " and I tried a long time but I could n't get the word out .
Finally , I gave up and decided to try " Animals . "
Before I had worked on that word very long , I figured out vaguely that " Animals " would n't do because then the psychologist would ask me what kind , and I would have to say " Squirrels , " and I just could n't .
So I said " Bears . "
They did n't look like bears but it was better to say " Bears " than not say " Squirrels . "
One of our engineers , who was a subject , could get 100 per cent under LSD in certain of the tests we used , which he never did without LSD ...
There was another subject , a young woman , who was a technician working at Columbia , who was determined to get all her mathematics examples correct , and practiced at home .
Although she was very disturbed [ over other matters ] ... under 100 mcg. of LSD , she got 100 per cent on her mathematics test .

Looking at the same problem with ( psychedelic ) materials , I was able to consider it in a much more basic way , because I could form and keep in mind a much broader picture .
I had great visual ( mental ) perceptibility ; I could imagine what was wanted , needed , or not possible with almost no effort .
Ideas came up with a speed that was breathtaking .
I dismissed the original idea entirely , and started to approach the graphic problem in a radically different way .
That was when things began to happen .
All kinds of different possibilities came to mind .
Diminished fear of making mistakes or being embarrassed .
I was impressed with the intensity of concentration , the forcefulness and exuberance with which I could proceed toward the problem .
In what seemed like 10 minutes , I had completed the problem , having what I considered ( and still consider ) a classic solution .
... brought about almost total recall of a course that I had had in thermodynamics ; something that I had never given any thought about in years .
Technical Problems :
For over five years one man engaged in Naval Research , worked with a team under his direction on the design of an anti-submarine detection device , without success .
Hearing about a small research foundation investigating LSD , this man got in touch with its directors and mentioned that he had been told that the drug had been used successfully in problem solving Subsequently he was given the drug under their supervision .
He had informed them in advance that he could not divulge the nature of the problem because it was classified information .
Nevertheless , the LSD session bore fruit .
After a few exercises to allow him to control the fluidity of the LSD state how to stop it , how to start it , how to turn it around he directed his attention to the problem , and within ten minutes he had the solution he had been searching for during all of those years .
Since then , the device has been patented by the U.S. Navy and Naval personnel working in this area have been trained in its use .
Creative Design Problems :
A furniture designer who was given the drug by the Institute for Psychedelic Research recounts the following :
I had two specific problems , both in furniture design .
The primary problem was to find a method for making an integral drawer pull design which complemented an existing group of furniture that I had designed a few years ago .
This group was successful both in design and in sales .
I needed a solution that combined the same kind of good looks with economy in production .
Case goods , that is , cabinets and chests of drawers , are basically boxes distinguished primarily by surface and edge treatments .
Case goods always seem to look best when the design seems to be a natural outgrowth of the materials used .
I try to avoid " applied " design elements .
I 'd already designed a line or series of case goods that embodied these elements but it seemed to lack a certain spark which both I and the manufacturer felt was needed .
I had gone over and over this problem trying new tacks but nothing seemed to come of it .
I really did n't expect to be able to do anything new since my feeling was that all possibilities were exhausted .
What actually happened was a complete surprise .
I found that as soon as I began to visualize the problem one possibility immediately occurred .
A few problems with that concept occurred which seemed to solve themselves rather quickly .
This was quickly followed by another idea based on this first thought but with a variation that gave it another look .
Visualizing the required cross section was instantaneous .
I then decided to do something that always takes a lot of time .
Doing a good dining chair that is both elegant and inexpensive is very difficult .
Chairs are always seen as sculpture and seldom in pure profile .
Chairs also require a discipline in shape and structure unnecessary in other furniture .
Discipline in shape because of the human anatomy , and structure because of the hard usage it gets .
I had not been able to do an original design for some time .
I very rapidly ascertained what the basic structure should be and the basic details also quickly followed .
I did no refining , because this kind of thing is best done in three dimensions though I could visualize the finished product .
I decided that I had the chair and then went on to think of a type that I 'd never done before .
This one too seemed to present no difficulty .
Even when I look at this today it all seems so obvious .
I looked at the paper I was to draw on .
I was completely blank .
I knew that I would work with a property 300 ' square .
I drew the property lines ( at a scale of 1 " = 40 ' ) and I looked at the outlines .
I was blank .
Suddenly I saw the finished project .
I did some quick calculations ... it would fit on the property and not only that ... it would meet the cost and income requirements .
It was contemporary architecture with the richness of a cultural heritage ... it used history and experience but did not copy it .
I began to draw ... my senses could not keep up with my images ... my hand was not fast enough ...
I was impatient to record the picture ( it had not faded one particle ) .
I worked at a pace I would not have thought I was capable of .
I completed four sheets of fairly comprehensive sketches .
I was not tired but I was satisfied that I had caught the essence of the image .
I stopped working I ate fruit ...
I drank coffee ... it was a magnificent day .
" Dynamiting " Creative " Log Jams " :
At the Josiah Macy LSD Conference in 1959 , which brought together twenty - six prominent psychiatrists and researchers who had worked with LSD , one of the most exciting matters to arise was the evidence that a number of patients in psychotherapy could begin to paint after having been given the drug .
Most of them had not previously done any painting at all , and yet the quality of the work was far above average for the ordinary beginning art student .
One of the most singular cases of artistic achievement was that of a girl who had actually had art training but , in the words of her therapist , Dr. R. A. Sandison , " could n't paint properly . "
After LSD her style changed entirely and she found meaning in things that previously had had none to her .
She had never been able to express herself through painting , but after the drug , " she began to paint in the style she wanted to , which was imaginative , something like John Piper 's work . "
There are any number of such cases which have reached the LSD annals , some relating purely to unjamming the block and others to the acceleration of the artistic facility .
As an instance of the latter , a teacher at the Massachusetts College of Art comments that , previous to taking LSD , he used to spend a great deal of time in his studio before he felt he was really working , and he had to spend five to eight hours before he felt he accomplished anything .
" Now all I have to do is go into my studio and start working and I 'm right up there ....
It 's a matter of having better control over your sensibilities ....
Things that you knew before , you now understand . "
Asked whether he thought that LSD would become a commonly used adjunct to artistic performance among others , he said , " I suspect that anyone who 's interested in seeing more , hearing more , thinking more is going to try it . "
LSD has also proved to be a superior agent for ending the notorious " writer 's block . "
The following account is from a well - known European writer whose major work , written after LSD therapy , has been translated into twelve languages and has a wide audience among Americans and the English .
Prior to taking LSD , he had had a " burning desire " to write but had been unable to finish a manuscript .
Initially in his LSD session , he felt he was able to turn away from " the turmoil of the world " and had " time to meander in my mind about things that were more important than the outer world . "
But before long , he felt he was dying :
I felt I could really die , not just as an illusion , not just in the drama of other people , but my own life would have a very normal end .
I know now I never wanted to face this but realize there is such a thing as really living ....
With this horror of death realized , I started to experience a most fantastic happiness with the realization that after all I do not have to die now .
I felt I was no longer with my neck under the guillotine .
This was the very feeling I have been living under all my life .
My mind was suddenly dragged into the situation and I think the cure , from someone who did not write successfully , to someone who does write successfully , came this very moment when I felt that this mind of mine was part of me .
It has become harmonized with the rest of my feelings ....
I am no longer afraid of putting one letter after the other to say what I want and this is linked with an enormous number of things , such as speechlessness and inarticulateness .
The feeling of being dumb , not being able to express myself was probably one of my most unpleasant inner feelings ....
I seem capable of expressing what many people would love to express but for which they cannot find the words .
I did not find the words before because I tried to avoid saying the essential things .
The thing that was important was something that might be called a cosmological commitment .
It was a powerful motive to create meaning and to leave a testament of the meaning which that individual found in the world , and in himself in relation to the world .
This motive emerged in many ways , but we came across it over and over again when we compared highly creative individuals with those of equal intellectual ability as measured by the IQ tests but of less actual creative ability .
The intense motivation having to do with this making of meaning or finding meaning and communicating it in one form or another was the most important difference between our criterion and control groups ...
I think that as a result of the psychedelic experience there 's a heightened sense of the drama of life , including its brevity , and a realization both of the importance of one 's individual life and of the fact that a sacred task has been given to the individual in the development of the self ...
Footnotes
As has been widely reported , Hillary Clinton ’s top guru , Mark Penn , is leading the charge within the Clinton campaign to go aggressively negative against Obama .
Besides the fact that Penn is the architect responsible for Hillary ’s presidential aspirations going from “ inevitable ” to being on life support , he is reportedly obsessed with destroying Obama .
While it is understandable that Clinton ’s top adviser wants his client to win at all costs , going massively negative against Obama ( or Hillary for that matter ) risks damaging our candidate in the fall election against McCain .
Unfortunately , this is something another “ client ” would welcome .
That client is named John McCain .
Penn is the CEO of Burson - Marsteller , a DC public relations ( PR ) firm .
Burson - Marsteller owns a subsidiary , BKSH .
BKSH is run by Charlie Black .
Black is a longtime Republican politico , and a top adviser for John McCain for President .
And , as Think Progress notes , while Black is a volunteer on the McCain campaign , he views Mcain as his client and continues to take a paycheck from BKSH .
JedReport dissected these relationships in a diary on Daily Kos last night .
Much more after the jump …
And , Ari Berman wrote about this last spring :
A host of prominent Republicans fall under Penn ’s purview .
B - M ’s Washington lobbying arm , BKSH & Associates , is run by Charlie Black , a leading GOP operative who maintains close ties to the White House , including Karl Rove , and was a partner with Lee Atwater , the consultant who crafted the Willie Horton smear campaign for George H.W. Bush in 1988 .
In recent years Black ’s clients have included the likes of Iraq ’s Ahmad Chalabi , the darling of the neocon right in the run-up to the war ; Lockheed Martin ; and Occidental Petroleum .
In 2005 he landed a contract with the Lincoln Group , the disgraced PR firm that covertly placed US military propaganda in Iraqi news outlets .
Black is only one cannon in B - M ’s Republican arsenal .
Penn works for Clinton .
Black works for McCain .
And Black works for Penn .
Keep this in mind as you read some of the guiding principles for Penn ’s and Black ’s firm , courtesy of the Burson - Marsteller website :
# We , the directors and employees of all companies in WPP recognize our obligations to all who have a stake in our success including shareowners , clients , employees , and suppliers ; … #
We will not for personal or family gain directly or indirectly engage in any activity which competes with companies within WPP or with our obligations to any such company ; #
We will not have any personal or family conflicts of interest within our businesses or with our suppliers or other third parties with whom we do business ;
So , again , we have to ask :
Why is Mark Penn on a mission to destroy Obama ?
It ’s clear that Penn benefits if Hillary wins — she ’s his client , his firm ’s client .
His company benefits if McCain wins — he ’s the client of one of Penn ’s top employees .
Penn has an obligation to his shareholders and clients .
And his firm seems to have clients on both sides of the aisle , on both sides of this fight .
If Obama wins the presidency , Penn gets nothing .
He was helping the other guy , or gal .
But if McCain wins , Penn ’s firm has one hell of a contact with the new president – heck , one of his top employees had the new president as a client and did n’t even charge him !
Is it a conflict of interest ?
Not with his clients .
But how about with the Democratic party and our interests ?
While everything Hello Kitty freaks me out , there are definitely some Hello Kitty items that freak me out more than others .
It ’s stuff like this that is definitely on the high end of freaking me out list – Hello Kitty contacts :
While it is fairly obvious that Sanrio has figured out a way to possess Hello Kitty fanatics , these contacts give that possession much too much reality .
Seriously , this is something right out of a horror movie .
Of course , my wife thinks they are “ the cutest thing ever ” and wants a pair .
I already have an image of me happily dreaming away about life free of the evil feline when my wife comes to wake me up , I sleepily open my eyes and I instantly have the &*& % $ #@@ hell scared out of me — and this happened each and every morning for the rest of my life .
And that is just the first moment of the day which would pretty much guarantee that Hello Kitty Hell moves to yet another unthinkable level …

Judge Andrew Napolitano gave a speech for Reason Magazine in Washington D.C. in October of last year on the history of Constitutional infidelity .
Virtually every president from George Washington to George W. Bush has broken his oath of office to defend the Constitution .
President John Adams , the nation ’s second president , was the first president who tried ( and succeeded for a time ) in curtailing free speech rights with the Alien and Sedition Acts .
These blatantly unconstitutional laws made it a crime for anyone to publicly criticize members of congress , the president , or his cabinet .
Interestingly , there was no prohibition for criticizing the vice president , who happened to be Adams ’ political rival – Thomas Jefferson .
Jefferson was adamantly opposed to the acts and allowed them to expire whenever he became president .
Since John Adams , there have been many , many other Constitutional violations from all three branches of government which continue to this day .
Much has been said in recent years about how President George W. Bush has trampled on the Constitution by passing such laws as the U.S.A. PATRIOT Act .
Of the 43 presidents of the U.S. , where does George W. Bush rank when it comes to violating the Constitution ?
Napolitano answers :
George W. Bush has shown less fidelity to the Constitution than any president since Abraham Lincoln .
Worse than Woodrow Wilson , FDR , LBJ , or Richard Nixon ?
Now that ’s a bold statement !
Whether it ’s Hillary Clinton , Barack Obama , John McCain , or Mike Huckabee as our next president , one thing seems to be certain : our civil liberties protected by our constitution will be further compromised .
It ’s really only a question of to what degree they will be compromised .
The man has gone but his spirit lives on .
Tony Blair 's determination to turn the war on terror into a permanent undeclared state of emergency in Britain , where the " rules of the game have changed " , ended in defeat two years ago when he failed to raise the limit on detention of terrorist suspects without charge from 14 to 90 days .
With a parliamentary compromise of 28 days in the bag - already far longer than any other state in the western world - it might have been expected that his successor would be content to leave well alone .
Not a bit of it .
Gordon Brown is back for more , pressing the case this week for the right to imprison people without charge for 56 days , or however close to that figure he can manage .
What started a generation ago as a two - day limit on detention without charge , as exists for American citizens in the US , was fixed at seven days in 2000 ; ratcheted up to 14 in 2003 ; raised again to 28 in 2006 ; and is now heading for two months of effective internment .
The arbitrariness of this ratcheting - up is obvious : in spite of the fact that we 're talking about the country 's most basic civil liberties , it has clearly been a matter of think of a number and double it .
Perhaps that 's not so surprising , as nobody has been able to offer any evidence whatever that police investigations have been undermined by having to release or charge a suspect within four weeks .
Indeed , despite much talk of the growing complexity of terror cases , the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , has now conceded that no circumstance had yet arisen where " it has been necessary up to this point to go beyond 28 days " .
To all intents and purposes , the police and government case is simply that it might be a useful precaution for the future - or even a helpful " disruptive mechanism " when there is no real chance of a charge .
And now that the human rights organisation Liberty and the opposition parties have offered an alternative of post - charge questioning ( which carries its own dangers ) , ministers have pocketed the concession and pressed on regardless with their longer detention plans .
Most shamefully , it 's widely acknowledged in Westminster that a key motivation for this latest assault on long - established rights and freedoms is Brown 's determination to wrong - foot the Tories tactically and portray them as soft on terror .
Given the trauma endured by Muslim prisoners - because of course that 's who we 're talking about , at least for now - locked up for weeks and then released without charge , it might seem to be a bit of rather costly political point - scoring .
But then it follows the chaotic and counterproductive saga of prisoners locked up indefinitely without charge in Belmarsh in the same spirit , and the draconian control orders that the law lords last week called to be marginally watered down : the regime of 18 - hour curfews , bans on phone , internet and personal contacts imposed on suspects without charge , or access to any evidence against them .
This week 's Queen 's speech proposal to press ahead with yet another extension of the power to lock people up without charge came hard on the heels of the lurid warm - up act from the new MI5 director general , Jonathan Evans , whose organisation will have doubled in size by 2011 .
In an inflammatory and highly ideological speech , he warned that 15 - year - olds were being " groomed " for terror and that the number " we are seeing involved in terrorist - related activity " was now 2,000 - followed by the bizarre rider that " there are as many again that we do n't yet know of " .
Both figures should probably be taken with a pinch of salt , in the light of the British security and intelligence agencies ' erratic record with intelligence over the years .
Of course , there are underground jihadist elements prepared to stage violent attacks in Britain , as has already been brutally demonstrated .
But the real surprise is how few attempts there have been since Blair joined George Bush 's war on terror : one serious atrocity , two bungled outrages , and a series of unsuccessful plots of varying credibility does not even begin to match the scale of the IRA campaign of the previous three decades .
Naturally the security services would like to claim credit for that , but given how easy it is to get hold of guns in Britain or bomb soft civilian or political targets , it is obvious that the numbers seriously committed to launching such attacks are fewer than Evans 's figures suggest .
What is clear is that the assault on basic liberties represented by repeated extensions of pre-charge detention and control orders is out of all proportion to the reality of what is actually taking place .
It also makes a mockery of the government 's claim to be defending our freedom and way of life against al - Qaida , when in fact it is trading away another bit of freedom for every bomb attack or terror scare .
The danger is not only that we lose valuable liberties , but that we create more terrorists in the process , by further alienating Muslim youth already radicalised by British and American aggression in the Muslim world .
That was the message of last week 's highly effective Channel 4 drama Britz , denounced by a government spokesman for ignoring the views of " moderate Muslims " .
In fact , as polling shows , the kind of concerns expressed in Peter Kosminsky 's film - about the impact of anti-terror laws and western foreign policy - do reflect mainstream British Muslim opinion , and it is the government which is failing to face up to that .
In an increasingly Islamophobic climate , the support given by some ministers to those in the media and rightwing thinktanks arguing against engagement with representative organisations like the Muslim Council of Britain and non-violent Islamist groups is bound to backfire .
Last week , for example , the Blairite cabinet minister Hazel Blears championed the former Islamist Ed Husain - who follows the neocon line on " Islamofascism " and criticises MI5 's boss for " pussyfooting around " - as a " new voice " who " understands what needs to be done " .
Picking people who are off the map of Muslim opinion to speak on British Muslims ' behalf is a dangerous game that will do nothing to increase public safety .
The biggest contribution this government could make to reduce the threat of jihadist terror attacks in Britain would be to withdraw occupation troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and end its support for dictatorships in the Muslim world .
In the meantime , it could make a start by letting Muslims speak for themselves , instead of locking more of them up for longer without charge .

In the sophisticated popular culture of the Edo period ( 1603 - 1868 ) , much attention was devoted to Japan 's rich pantheon of traditional monsters and apparitions , known as yokai .
Sometimes frightening , sometimes humorous , these compelling Japanese folk creatures were the subject of numerous artistic and literary works .
One such work was Hyakkai Zukan , a collection of picture scrolls completed in 1737 by Sawaki Suushi , a relatively unknown artist who studied under master painter Hanabusa Itcho ( 1702 - 1772 ) .
Hyakkai Zukan 's colorful depictions of Japan 's most notorious creatures inspired ( and were copied by ) yokai artists for generations .
Here is a peek inside .
Ushi-oni [ Enlarge ]
Ushi-oni ( lit. " cow devil " ) is a malevolent sea monster with the head of a bull and the body of a giant spider or crab .
It is most often encountered in the coastal waters of western Japan , particularly in Shimane prefecture , where it is feared for its vicious attacks on fishermen .
[ More ]
Ushi-oni is usually seen in connection with a related monster , called Nure - onna .
Nure - onna
Nure - onna ( lit. " wet woman " ) is a fast - swimming amphibious creature with the head of a human female and the body of a gigantic snake .
Her appearance varies slightly from story to story , but she is usually described as having beady , snake - like eyes and long , sharp claws and fangs .
Nure - onna is typically seen at the water 's edge , washing her long , flowing hair .
In some stories , she carries a small child , which she uses to attract potential victims .
When a well - intentioned person offers to hold the baby for Nure - onna , the child attaches itself to the victim 's hands and grows heavy , making it nearly impossible to flee .
In some stories , Nure - onna uses her long , powerful tongue to suck all the blood from her victim 's body .

Uwan
In ancient Aomori prefecture legends , Uwan is a disembodied voice that inhabits old , abandoned temples and homes .
When a person enters a haunted building , the formless spirit belts out an ear - piercing " Uwan ! " ( hence the name ) .
The voice is only audible to people inside the building -- those standing outside hear nothing .
Uwan consists only of sound and poses no physical danger .
Ancient Japanese legends are rife with examples of formless yokai like Uwan , which consist of nothing but sound , light or other natural phenomena .
In the Edo period , however , these yokai assumed physical bodies as artists incorporated them into their work .
Nurarihyon ( left ) , Mehitotsubou ( right )
Another yokai that got a facelift in the Edo period is Nurarihyon , pictured here as as a well - dressed old man with an elongated bald head .
Ancient Okayama prefecture legends describe Nurarihyon ( lit. " slippery strange " ) as a marine creature found in the Seto Inland Sea , often seen bobbing around on the surface of the water like some sort of giant jellyfish or octopus .
Nurarihyon eludes capture by diving underwater when people approach to investigate .
In the Edo period , Nurarihyon came to be known as a mysterious old man with the uncanny ability to sneak into homes and " take over . "
When the residents of a home encounter him sitting around drinking tea , they are unable throw him out and cannot help but treat him as the head of the household .
Nurarihyon is said to be a highly respected figure in the world of yokai .
Mehitotsubou ( above right ) , a large monk with a cyclopean eye , is a variant of the large shape - shifting monks commonly found in Japanese folk tales .
Mikoshi-nyudo
Another monster monk is Mikoshi-nyudo ( a.k.a. Miage - nyudo ) , a large , cross-eyed mendicant encountered on mountain passes or on lonely roads at night .
Mikoshi - nyudo grows taller when you look up at him -- and the higher you look , the taller he grows .
Look up for too long and you will die , goes the legend , but say " mikoshita " ( " I see higher " ) and he disappears .
Mikoshi - nyudo 's true identity is unknown , but in some areas he is believed to be a shape - shifting weasel , fox or tanuki .
Yama - warau
Yama - warau ( a.k.a. Yama - waro ) are hairy , one - eyed Garappa ( a variety of Kappa found in Kumamoto prefecture ) who have gone into the mountains for the winter .
These child - sized creatures are known to provide assistance to lumberjacks in the mountains , and they eagerly return again and again to help , as long as they are rewarded with liquor and rice balls .
Like other varieties of Kappa , Yama - warau are fond of playing tricks on people , and they enjoy sumo wrestling .
They sometimes break into people 's homes to take a bath , and they have a sixth sense for danger , which allows them to escape from people with evil intentions .
At the spring equinox , Yama - warau return to the rivers to live as Garappa .
They travel in groups , jumping from one rooftop to the next , all the way down to the water .
If , along the way , they come across a new home under construction , they get angry and poke holes in the walls .
Legend has it that anyone who goes to the river to catch a glimpse of a returning Yama - warau will become sick .
Inugami
An Inugami ( lit. " dog god " ) is a familiar spirit that looks like a dog and acts as a protective guardian .
Inugami are extremely powerful and loyal , and they are known to carry out acts of revenge on behalf of their " owners . "
They can also exist independently , and under some circumstances they may turn against their owners .
Inugami also have the ability to possess humans .

Ouni
Ouni is a mountain hag with a mouth stretching from ear to ear and a thick coat of long , black hair covering her entire body .
According to an old Niigata prefecture legend , Ouni appeared one day to a group of women as they were spinning hemp into yarn .
After accepting the hairy hag 's offer to help , the women watched in surprise as she repeatedly placed raw hemp fiber into her mouth and pulled out finished yarn .
After quickly producing a large quantity in this way , Ouni stepped outside and suddenly disappeared .
Legend has it that she left footprints in the nearby rocks , which can still be seen to this day .
Kami-kiri [ Enlarge ]
Kami-kiri ( lit. " hair - cutter " ) are ghostly spirits known for sneaking up on people and cutting all their hair off , particularly when they are unknowingly engaged to marry a yokai , spirit or other supernatural creature posing as a human .
These hair - cutting attacks are intended to delay or prevent weddings between humans and otherworldly beings , which are typically doomed to failure .

One of the few Americans to see action during the Bug Wars of the nineteen - nineties was Robert J. Lang , a lanky Californian who was on the front lines throughout , from the battle of the Kabutomushi Beetle to the battle of the Menacing Mantis and the battle of the Long - Legged Wasp .
Most combatants in the Bug Wars — which were , in fact , origami contests — were members of the Origami Detectives , a group of artists in Japan who liked to try outdoing one another with extreme designs of assigned subjects .
They engaged in the Bug Wars after one of the Detectives displayed what the group ’s Web site calls “ an incredible secret weapon ” — a horned beetle with outspread wings , which he had folded from a single sheet of paper .
“ Then the origami insect war got full - scale , ” the English translation of the Web site continues .
“ They compared their confident models with others at their monthly meetings , and losers left with chagrin . ”
During the Bug Wars , Lang was not yet a professional origami artist ; he was a research scientist at Spectra Diode Labs , in San Jose , who did some paper folding on the side .
He was busy at work — in 1993 , the year of the Menacing Mantis , for instance , he patented a self - collimated resonator laser and worked on fibre - optic networks for space satellites — so he usually was n’t able to travel to Japan to hand - deliver his bug of the month .
Instead , he would e-mail his design to an ally in Tokyo , who would fold it and present it to the Detectives on Lang ’s behalf .
At the time , Lang was in his thirties .
He had been doing origami — that is , shaping sheets of paper into figures , using no cutting and no glue — for twenty - five years and designing his own models for twenty .
He has always considered himself very much a bug person , but his earliest designs were not insects ; in the nineteen - seventies , he invented an origami Jimmy Carter , a Darth Vader , a nun , an inflatable bunny , and an Arnold the Pig .
He would have liked to have folded insects , but , in those years , bugs , as well as crustaceans , were still an origami impossibility .
This was because no one had yet solved the problem of how to fold paper into figures with fat bodies and skinny appendages , so that most origami figures , even television characters and heads of state , still had the same basic shape as the paper cranes of nineteenth - century Japan .
Then a few people around the globe had the idea that paper folding , besides being a pleasant diversion , might also have properties that could be analyzed and codified .
Some started to study paper folding mathematically ; others , including Lang , began devising mathematical tools to help with designing , all of which enabled the development of increasingly complex folding techniques .
In 1970 , no one could figure out how to make a credible - looking origami spider , but soon folders could make not just spiders but spiders of any species , with any length of leg , and cicadas with wings , and sawyer beetles with horns .
For centuries , origami patterns had at most thirty steps ; now they could have hundreds .
And as origami became more complex it also became more practical .
Scientists began applying these folding techniques to anything — medical , electrical , optical , or nanotechnical devices , and even to strands of DNA — that had a fixed size and shape but needed to be packed tightly and in an orderly way .
By the end of the Bug Wars , origami had completely changed , and so had Robert Lang .
In 2001 , he left his job — he was then at the fibre - optics company JDS Uniphase , in San Jose — to fold paper full time .
Lang is accustomed to being surprising .
Some years ago , he was the mystery guest on the television game show “ Naruhodo !
Za Warudo ” — the Japanese version of “ What ’s My Line ? ” — and he amazed the audience and the contestants , because they could n’t believe that an American could be an origami expert .
People who know him as a scientist are flabbergasted when they hear that he is one of the world ’s foremost paper - folding artists , and are often surprised that such a thing as a professional origami artist even exists .
People expecting him to be kooky — or , at the very least , Japanese — find his academic accomplishments and his white male Americanness puzzling .
Recently , he was commissioned by Lalique , the French crystal company , to demonstrate folding at a launch for its new collection of vases , which are rippled and creased in an origami - like way .
The launch was at a Neiman Marcus in Troy , Michigan , on a cold night just before Christmas .
It was intended for Neiman Marcus ’s favorite customers , and there was music playing and waiters offering hors d’oeuvres and glasses of wine .
Lang was set up in the china - and - crystal department , behind a Regency - style desk .
On one side of the desk was a stack of thin , square sheets of Japanese origami paper , as brightly colored as a roll of Life Savers .
He had with him a laptop computer , and during a break he showed me software that he was designing with his brother , a botany professor , which simulates the growth of cherry trees and will allow farmers to test pruning and fertilizing techniques on a computer , rather than in their orchards .
Lang is now forty - five .
He is tall , with slim , fine - looking hands , a tidy Silicon Valley - style beard , and the clean , comfortable good looks of a park ranger .
That evening , he was wearing a Glen - plaid sports jacket , a tie , and slacks .
He settled into his chair and began creasing a sheet of paper into what would become perhaps a bird or a dinosaur or a tarantula .
A woman in a knee - length shearling coat wandered over to watch .
She stared at Lang ’s hands and then took fuller stock of him .
After a moment , she nudged her husband , who was standing beside her , slightly bent under the weight of four shopping bags .
“ My God , look , ” she said , pointing to Lang .
“ He ’s in a suit ! ”
Lang stopped folding and looked up at her .
“ It ’s just . . . to see an artist all clean and dressed , and in a suit , ” she sputtered .
Lang smiled and said , “ Well , my kimono was at the cleaners . ”
He resumed folding .
“ You ’re good at the origami , ” the woman said .
“ Have you done other jobs ? ”
Lang said , “ Yes , in fact , I have .
For years , I was a physicist . ”
The woman grabbed her husband ’s arm again and gasped , “ Oh , my God ! ”
While she was recovering , two men ambled up .
“ Do people , like , pay you ? ” one of them asked .
Before Lang could answer , the other guy , brandishing a baby lamb chop , asked if he knew how to make the Statue of Liberty .
“ Yes , I do , ” Lang said .
“ I ’m not going to make it right now , but I do know how to do it . ”
He put aside the piece he was working on , and took a new sheet of paper from the stack .
He creased it , flipped the paper over , creased it again , lined up the edges , smoothed the sides together , pinched it here and there , and tugged on one edge .
He did this with quick , meticulous movements , his hands crossing back and forth over the sheet as if they were tracing a melody .
Suddenly , the sheet of paper crumpled and then opened into a shape — a tiny violinist , sawing away at a violin .
“ That ’s just crazy , man , ” the guy holding the lamb chop said .
“ I mean , wow . ”
Lang grew up outside Atlanta .
He was given an origami book when he was six by a teacher who had run out of ways to keep him entertained during math class .
Lang took to origami immediately .
He was fascinated by the infinite possibilities within the finite - seeming — the characters and the creatures that could almost magically come to life from an ordinary square of paper .
He worked his way through the designs in one book and then another and another .
He had many interests — stamps , coins , plants , bugs , mud — and he was , as his father , Jim Lang , says , “ a super - duper math whiz , ” hooked on Martin Gardner ’s recreational math column in Scientific American .
But paper folding engaged him most .
He started designing his own origami patterns when he was in his early teens .
He diagrammed them in detail on letterhead from the Chrysler Corporation Airtemp Division , where his father was in sales .
Lang went to college at Caltech , where he studied electrical engineering .
“ Caltech was very hard , very intense , ” he told me recently .
“ So I did more origami .
It was a release from the pressure of school .
I ’d fold things , record the design , and then throw the model away . ”
He had never met anyone else who did origami , and he did n’t tell people about his pastime .
His wife , Diane , whom he met at Caltech when they both had roles in a campus production of “ The Music Man , ” remembers visiting his apartment in Pasadena for the first time and finding little paper ants lining the shelves .
“ I guess I thought it was a kid ’s pastime that I had n’t grown out of , ” Lang said .
“ I was a little embarrassed about it . ”
In the back of one of his origami books , he noticed the name and address of the Origami Center of America , which was founded by Lillian Oppenheimer , and was the precursor to OrigamiUSA , the national organization for paper - folding enthusiasts .
Through the group , which is based in New York and now has close to two thousand members , Lang met other recreational folders and also people known in the origami world as “ masters , ” including Michael LaFosse , John Montroll , Joseph Wu , and Paul Jackson .
LaFosse trained as a marine biologist but left his job in environmental management in 1994 to open the country ’s first origami-only gallery , in Haverhill , Massachusetts , and was getting as much as twenty thousand dollars for such commissions as a Pegasus for an Hermès window display on Madison Avenue .
Wu was a commercial illustrator , in Canada , who did origami most of the time , and Jackson , now in Israel , was an artist working with folded paper .
Montroll , the son of a well - known physicist , had quit his job as an electrical engineer and become an origami- book publisher to support his folding habit .
Montroll , in particular , inspired Lang : his animals were elegant and meticulous and his approach to design was totally original .
He also made origami models of complex polyhedra that no one had thought possible .
“ John has done models in origami of all the Archimedean solids !
All the Platonic solids !
All the Johnson solids ! ” Lang said excitedly .
“ He did all the polyhedra ! ”
Lang kept folding while earning a master ’s in electrical engineering at Stanford and a Ph.D. in applied physics at Caltech .
As he worked on his dissertation — “ Semiconductor Lasers : New Geometries and Spectral Properties ” — he designed an origami hermit crab , a mouse in a mousetrap , an ant , a skunk , and more than fifty other pieces .
They were dense and crisp and precise but also full of character : his mouse conveys something fundamentally mouse - ish , his ant has an essential ant - ness .
His insects were especially beautiful .
While in Germany for postdoctoral work , he and Diane were taken with Black Forest cuckoo clocks ; the carved casings , pinecone - shaped weights , pendulums , and pop -out birds would n’t seem to be a natural for origami , but Lang thought otherwise .
He started a job at NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory , in Pasadena , in 1988 , shortly after he had finished folding a life - sized cuckoo clock .
It had taken him three months to design , and six hours to fold , and it made Lang a sensation in the origami world .
The Japanese have been folding paper recreationally for at least four hundred years .
For the first two hundred of those years , designs were limited to a few basic shapes : boxes , boats , hats , cranes .
Folding a thousand cranes — all of white paper , which was the only kind then used — was thought to bring good luck .
The principle was simple .
The sheet of paper was the essence : no matter what shape it became , there was never more paper and never less ; it remained the same sheet .
Japanese folding probably did n’t spread directly to the West .
There is no definitive history , although David Lister , a retired solicitor in Grimsby , England , and the author of more than a hundred essays on the subject , suggests that paper folding developed independently in countries all over the world .
In the nineteenth century , schoolchildren in Germany , France , and England made paper horses with riders , and boxes to trap flies , and it is reported that paper folding flourished in Spanish villages and prisons .
In 1837 , a German educator , Friedrich Fröbel , introduced the radical idea of early - childhood education — kindergarten .
The curriculum included three kinds of paper folding —
“ The Folds of Truth , ” “ The Folds of Life , ” and “ The Folds of Beauty ” — to teach children principles of math and art .
The kindergarten movement was embraced around the world , including in Japan , where Fröbel ’s simple folds merged with traditional origami .
Japanese magicians of the time also began doing paper tricks as part of their conjuring .
By the eighteen - sixties , Japan ’s isolationism was ending , and in the following decades those magicians travelled to Europe and the United States to perform .
Suddenly , the kindergarten exercise appeared mysterious and wonderful .
A square of ordinary paper creased and crinkled could come to life as a flapping gull ; a sheet of parchment could take shape as a lion or a swallowtail .
Professional magicians in Europe and the United States loved origami , and a number of them wrote books about it .
In 1922 , Harry Houdini published “ Houdini ’s Paper Magic : The Whole Art of Performing with Paper , Including Paper Tearing , Paper Folding and Paper Puzzles . ”
( He regularly did a trick known as “ the troublewit , ” turning a piece of paper into an endless number of different shapes without any cuts . )
In 1928 , the stage magicians William Murray and Francis Rigney published “ Fun with Paperfolding , ” with chapters on square folding , diagonal folding , and a complete paper - folding stage routine titled “ How Charlie Bought His Boat . ”
In the mid-nineteen - forties , the American folklorist Gershon Legman began studying origami .
Legman was a man of diverse inclinations : he collected vulgar limericks , wrote a book about oral techniques in sexual gratification , and is credited with having invented the vibrating dildo when he was only twenty .
After becoming interested in origami , he made contact with paper - folders around the world — most significantly , Akira Yoshizawa , a Japanese prodigy who , before being recognized as an extraordinary talent , made a meagre living by selling fish appetizers door - to - door in Tokyo .
What made Yoshizawa extraordinary was that he presented the art for the first time as a medium that could be creative and expressive — he devised tens of thousands of models , and was particularly famous for his gorillas .
In 1955 , Legman organized an exhibition of Yoshizawa ’s work at the Stedelijk Museum , in Amsterdam .
Yoshizawa got even more notice the following year , when Robert Harbin published his book “ Paper Magic . ”
Harbin was the preëminent British magician — he was the first to appear on television , and he developed the now classic “ Zig - Zag Girl ” illusion , in which the magician puts his assistant into a cabinet and saws her into thirds .
His book , a best - seller , praised Yoshizawa , whose work was such a departure that it might have seemed that there was no further you could go with a single piece of paper and some folds .
One clear , chilly day not long ago , I met Lang at Squid Labs , a high - tech research - and - development company headquartered in an enormous concrete building that used to be part of the Alameda Naval Air Station , near Oakland .
Lang and his wife and their teen - age son live about twenty miles east of Oakland , in a comfortable ranch - style house that has a separate studio building in the back yard , where Lang works amid a clutter of math books , seashell guides , computers , and a menagerie of paper animals .
He was spending the day at Squid Labs to use its industrial laser cutter to help him crease paper for some complex folds .
He said that he may be the first origami artist to use a laser cutter , which he dials down to a smidgen of its power , so that it scores the paper rather than slices it .
Lang was working on paper prototypes for two commissions — one for an interior - design piece to be made of metal , another for a leather fashion accessory — and on a design he was making for himself , which he did n’t want to describe , in case he jinxed it .
All three of the designs were so intricate that it would have taken him hours just to crease the paper in preparation for the final folds .
He was using large squares of tweedy - looking mauve Hanji paper from Korea , which is sturdy but still slightly translucent , like the flesh of a fish .
It is one of his favorite papers ; he buys it in bulk from an online supplier .
Other papers he likes , which he gets from art stores in San Francisco and Japan , when he visits , are lokta , from Nepal ; unryu , from Thailand ; and kozo and gampi , from Japan .
When he makes his most complex insects , he uses handmade paper from Michael LaFosse ’s studio .
For a while , in fact , LaFosse had a paper in stock called Robert Lang Insect Paper .
Lang was , by all accounts , good at his science jobs : he wrote more than eighty technical papers and holds forty - six patents on lasers and optoelectronics .
All the while , he was plotting how he would find time to write origami books .
He published several while he was still in the laser world , starting with “ The Complete Book of Origami , ” in 1989 , but he knew that it would require all his time to write the one he had in mind , which , instead of providing patterns for folders to follow — the typical origami book — would teach them how to design their own .
The bad luck of the dot - com bust turned out to be good timing for him .
Beginning in 2000 , JDS Uniphase , which supplied components to computer companies , lost much of its business , so Lang ’s duties shifted from overseeing research and development to managing pay cuts and plant closings .
“ Laying people off was a lot less fun than inventing things , ” he said .
“ There were plenty of people doing lasers .
The things I could do in origami — if I did n’t do them , they would n’t get done .
Deciding to leave was a convergence of what I wanted to do plus what was happening at my company . ”
Given his personality — composed , moderate , painstaking — it seems like an unimaginably audacious move .
A lot of people , throughout history , have walked away from respectable careers to become , say , poets or jazz musicians , but there are viable markets , albeit small and competitive , for those pursuits .
Becoming a professional paper - folder is chancier , since there is still no established market for origami as a collectible art form , and , until recently , it was not much promoted as one : Yoshizawa published books of his designs but never sold any of his pieces .
I wondered if Lang ’s family wanted to kill him when they heard of his career plans .
What he did , after all , is analogous to , perhaps , quitting a job as a neurosurgeon to take a shot at becoming a professional knitter .
Diane has said that even though the transition seems as if it should have been scary , it was n’t .
His parents were also sanguine .
They ’d had a somewhat similar experience when Lang ’s sister , who had been studying for a master ’s in microbiology , left her field to become an interior designer .
Lang ’s mother , Carolyn , recalls , “ I think I jokingly said , ‘ Are you going to be able to feed your family ? ’
But I know Robert , and I knew he would have had it all planned . ”
The first part of his plan was to write the book he ’d been contemplating while still at JDS Uniphase — “ Origami Design Secrets , ” which was published in 2003 and lays out the underlying principles of origami and design techniques .
He then set to work full time on designing new models and refining his old ones .
In truth , Lang is not entirely out of the science world : he was just named the editor - in - chief of the Journal of Quantum Electronics , published by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers_ , _ and he does part - time laser consulting for Cypress Semiconductor .
He has also had a number of origami assignments that are specifically scientific .
Most are for products that need to fold and unfold in a predictable and compact way .
He was commissioned to design a pouch for sterile medical instruments that could be opened without having a non-sterile surface touch any sterile surface , and a cell - phone antenna that had to fit inside the body of the phone .
One medical manufacturing company hired him to figure out how to fold a heart implant — a mesh heart support designed for people with congestive heart failure — so that it was compact enough to be implanted via a skinny tube but , when released from the tube , would unfurl properly around the heart .
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory had him work on a similar folding problem , but this time the thing being folded was a telescope with a lens a hundred metres in diameter which had to be packed into a rocket so it could be sent into space .
Many of Lang ’s commissions are less technical .
He recently designed toilet - paper origami animals for a Febreze commercial , which were folded by a fellow origami artist , Linda Mihara , and last year , again assisted by Mihara , he created an origami world — forest , fields , deer , Victorian houses , a dragon — for a thirty - second Mitsubishi spot .
He was hired to make a life - size Drew Carey for “ The Drew Carey Show ” and some airplane seats for the cover of Onboard , an aircraft - seating magazine , and to fold dollar bills into any shape he wanted ( a birthday gift for a well - known fashion designer ) .
He sells quite a few pieces to origami lovers — his most popular piece is a Hanji - paper bull moose , which is about nine inches tall and is available through his Web site for eight hundred dollars .
Lang ’s favorite commission was to fold an endangered Salt Creek tiger beetle for an entomologist who collects Salt Creek tiger beetle art .
“ For me , that commission was like manna from Heaven , ” he said .
“ I ’ll never be done with bugs . ”
The laser cutter was growling away , scoring one of Lang ’s Hanji sheets .
He twiddled with his computer .
On the screen was a lacy geometric pattern .
Lang had designed it with software he started writing in 1990 called TreeMaker , which is well known in origami circles ; it was the first software that would translate “ tree ” forms — that is , anything that sort of resembles a stick figure , such as people or bugs — into crease patterns .
Another program he wrote , ReferenceFinder , converts the patterns into step - by - step folding instructions .
This secured his position as the most technologically ambitious of the origami masters .
In 2004 , he was an artist - in - residence at M.I.T. , and gave a now famous lecture about origami and its relationship to mathematical notions , like circle packing and tree theory .
Brian Chan , a Ph.D. candidate in fluid dynamics at M.I.T. , told me recently , “ That was a huge lecture .
It got everyone talking . ”
It inspired Chan to put his hobby of blacksmithing on hold and take up origami ; he and Lang are now regular participants in an annual competition that is a friendly continuation of the Bug Wars .
Last year ’s theme was a sailing ship .
Lang was n’t happy with his entry — a sailboat with its sails down , revealing its skeletal masts — but talks enthusiastically about Chan’s .
From a single sheet , Chan created a brig under full sail being attacked by a giant squid .
Something about origami ’s simplicity and its apparently endless possibilities appeals to people .
In 2003 , the Mingei International Museum , in San Diego , mounted an exhibition called “ Origami Masterworks , ” which included several of Lang ’s pieces .
It was supposed to run six months , but attendance was so robust that the show was extended for six months , then for eight more .
In Japan , the “ Survivor ” - style show “ TV Champion ” has often featured contestants engaging in extreme origami — folding with their hands in a box , or while balanced on stools with the paper suspended above them , or while snorkelling in a fishtank .
A surprising number of countries have origami organizations ; the Origami Society of the Netherlands has more than fifteen hundred members — probably the highest per-capita membership in the world .
There is a soothing element in the monotony of folding and unfolding .
In fact , origami as therapy has its proponents : in 1991 , at the Conference on Origami in Education and Therapy , a mental - health professional presented a paper detailing her origami work with prisoners .
“ The most rewarding of experiences , ” she wrote , “ was that of observing the effect that Origami had on psychopathic killers . ”
A few months ago , I went to a meeting of the Orange County offshoot of the West Coast Origami Guild , which is one of several groups near Los Angeles .
( Its motto is “ We fold under pressure . ” )
Lang was active in the group when he was at Caltech , and members talk about him in the most admiring tones , but with comfortable familiarity .
One of the interesting things about origami is its egalitarianism — experts consort with hobbyists , and share the secrets of their work .
The meeting was held in the craft room at the home of Carol Stevens , a tall , jolly woman who teaches paper arts in schools and senior centers ; I had been sent directions to her house by a guild member who signed her e-mail “ Merry Creasemas ! ”
When I arrived , Carol was setting out refreshments .
A few people were working from a book titled “ Multimodular Origami Polyhedra : Archimedeans , Buckyballs , and Duality ” ( “ We can fold them , ” one of the folders said to another , “ but we do n’t know how to pronounce them ” ) ; another group was flipping through “ Jewish Holiday Origami ” ; and a retired computer engineer named John Andrisan was creating a bra out of a dollar bill to illustrate a story he was telling about a lunch he once had at Hooters .
At a back table , an older Japanese man was teaching four people how to make a twisted box .
“ Madam , ” he chided one of the students , “ you may know how to handle men , but you do n’t know how to handle paper . ”
During a break , I asked the instructor how long he had been doing origami , and he said , “ In 1986 , I lost my son , I got divorced , my life . . . ” He stopped and winced .
“ Origami was my savior . ”
Lang believes that there is still much more to do in origami .
“ It ’s like math , ” he said to me one day , as we were having lunch at a burger joint near his studio .
“ It ’s just out there waiting to be discovered .
The exciting stuff is the stuff where you do n’t even know how to begin . ”
He wants to improve his human figures , work with curved folding , and keep refining his insects .
He wants to fold a better mousetrap and a better mouse .
His primary interest is in the art of origami , but he has great faith in its expanding practical potential — solar sails , air bags , containers , shelters , medical implants .
He had a recent message on his voice mail from someone who wanted to discuss using origami in the manufacture of plastics .
We were about to leave the restaurant and head back to his studio .
Before we left , I could n’t help but ask him to do something pretty with his placemat .
It was just a flimsy rectangle and had a few grease spots from his sandwich , but he flipped it and folded it and did some magic , and left the waitress with a perfect white boat . ♦

The Edwards camp shot a campaign memo around to reporters today explaining Edwards ’ “ path to the nomination . ”
“ Ultimately , we expect the race to narrow to one of the two celebrity candidates and us , ” it says , “ and when that happens , we are confident that the remaining contests will break in our direction as voters are finally offered the choice the national media has ignored all year — the most progressive , most electable candidate in the race , John Edwards . ”
That last phrase — ” the most progressive , most electable candidate ” — is used throughout the memo .
The campaign goes on to mention that only a handful of delegates have actually been awarded ( counts vary , but the Edwards people identify about 130 ) , while there are over 4,000 total to be awarded in primaries nationwide .
That means that a candidate needs to take over 2,000 delegates to win .
The point is , Edwards has time to make a comeback .
So that ’s the plan ( or , that ’s the plan they ’ll make public ) — stick around and hope that one of the “ celebrity ” candidates stumbles so badly that he or she has to get out of the race .
Not a great bet , but the only one Edwards can make .
The problem is , there is n’t a whole lot of retail politics from here on out .
As the Edwards people point out , “ once people have a chance to hear directly from John Edwards , the numbers move . ”
But on Super Tuesday , Edwards will not be able to work the small towns of any particular state , the way he did in Iowa and South Carolina .
He has to rely on big ad buys and free media ( aka press coverage ) .
Neither of those things are really within Edwards ’ reach right now .
Online retailing can be a rough sport .
The competition is rabid , customer loyalty is fickle , and IT expenses can go through the roof .
That 's why The Register can appreciate an e-tailer with a unique business model .
A hawk - eyed El Reg reader points out that UK online retailer Ebuyer.com appears to be cutting costs by running its site on servers dating back to the late Cretaceous period - roughly speaking .
According to internet monitoring company Netcraft , the e-tailer has bypassed run-of - the - mill legacy servers for some serious heirlooms .
Take a gander at the Netcraft site report for Ebuyer.com :
Ebuyer server report
For starters , there 's a Toshiba HX - 10 , built in 1983 .
The HX - 10 features 64KB of RAM , a 3.6MHz CPU , and a stunning 256x192 , 16 - color hi-res mode .
Next , you 'll find not one but two Commodore 64s .
The Commodore debuted in 1982 with 64KB RAM , a 1.02MHz MOS Technology 6510 processor , and a 16 - color , 320x200 resolution monitor .
Not to mention a creamy BASIC 2.0 operating system .
Then comes the Dragon32 , a machine that arrived in 1982 featuring partial compatibility with the Tandy TRS 80 color series .
Its Motorola 6809E processor clocks in at 0.89 MHz and runs Microsoft Extended BASIC .
But clearly the real workhorses of the operation are the three ZX Spectrums .
These babies were also made in 1982 , used a Z80 processor running at 3.5 MHz , and offered up 128KB of memory - a great way to run that Sinclair BASIC operating system .
The Commodore 64c

$ 3 billion takeover bid for Diebold
Unsolicited offer by United Technologies 66 % over stock price
United Technologies Corp. made public Sunday an unsolicited $ 3 billion bid for Diebold , one of the largest makers of automated teller machines and voting machines .
United Technologies , which first approached Diebold two years ago , initially made the offer in private Friday .
The bid amounts to $ 40 a share in cash , or a 66 percent premium over Diebold ’s closing price Friday of $ 24.12 , United Technologies said .
Several unsolicited or hostile offers have been made this year despite an overall slowdown in dealmaking activity .
Among companies making unfriendly advances are Microsoft , which is pursuing the wounded Internet giant Yahoo , and Electronic Arts , which made a bid for Take - Two Interactive , the maker of the “ Grand Theft Auto ” video games .
In Diebold , United Technologies sees a chance to expand its electronic security business with one of the field ’s largest players .
Last year , United Technologies bought Initial Electronic Security Systems for about $ 1.2 billion .
In addition , Diebold ’s presence in the ATM market is strong in China , where United Technologies ’
Otis elevator business also has produced strong revenue , said James Geisler , United Technologies ’ vice president for finance and the head of its mergers and acquisitions team .
United Technologies ’ network of sales and maintenance for the elevators can be adapted to the ATM business , he said .
“ This transaction creates significant and immediate value for Diebold shareholders with no operational risk , while creating long - term value for UTC shareholders , ” George David , United Technologies ’ chairman and chief executive , said in a statement Sunday .
Geisler said Sunday that the company contacted Diebold about a possible deal two years ago but was rebuffed .
On Feb. 19 , David sent Diebold ’s board a letter proposing talks about a deal .
Two days later , Diebold ’s chairman , John Lauer , responded that the company ’s board had rejected any possible combination .
He also said a deal would not serve Diebold ’s interests and requested that United Technologies refrain from contacting its directors .

For the record , I do not condone this kind of behaviour .
Personally , I would have wished for a pony .
He referred to recent comments by the British politician and diplomat Paddy Ashdown , who this week said the NATO - led forces were in disarray and " defeat is now a real possibility " .
" What a tragedy failure in Afghanistan would be for all of those who have given their lives for the cause or have been badly injured , " Mr Fitzgibbon said .
" What an ominous development it would be for global security and for the Afghan people .
What a tragedy it would be if all the good work done so far in the end were to count for nought . "
Before the election Labor signalled a strong commitment to Afghanistan , and the Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , told the US President , George Bush , that Australia would consider " further reasonable requests " for additional troops .
But Mr Fitzgibbon has resisted recent calls by the US for other countries to increase troop levels , saying Australian forces have been hampered by a failure by their " political masters " to develop a clear plan .
" What surprised me most was the extent to which Australia had been denied access to important war information and excluded from the strategic - planning processes , " he said .
" Our people have been going to war , some to make the ultimate sacrifice , but it seems their political masters have been happy to sit on the sidelines . "
However , the claim drew fierce interjections from the former foreign affairs minister Alexander Downer , who said it was disgraceful and " cheap " .
Mr Downer said he had always insisted that success in Afghanistan would be difficult and dismissed Mr Fitzgibbon 's comment that Australia had been left in the dark on the war planning .
" This idea that we were not being shown NATO plans or intelligence is a preposterous lie , " Mr Downer told the Herald .
" It is incredibly irresponsible to make that point .
No intelligence was kept from Australia .
We were in constant contact over America 's and NATO 's plans …
That guy is quite puerile . "
Australia has about 1000 soldiers in Afghanistan and is the biggest non-NATO contributor to the NATO - led forces .
Mr Fitzgibbon , who recently attended a meeting of NATO defence ministers in the Lithuanian capital , Vilnius , said this week he was concerned that Australia was being excluded from planning processes because it was not a NATO member .
" The [ NATO ] secretary - general made a personal commitment to me that he would do all he could to right this wrong , " Mr Fitzgibbon said yesterday .
But Mr Downer said he had repeatedly had meetings with the secretary - general and other NATO officials .
He said Mr Fitzgibbon had only been able to attend recent NATO meetings because the Howard government , with several other governments , had called for greater access for non-NATO countries .
Cherry Valley , N.Y .
MY parents were not hippies .
We were a deeply conventional , middle - class American family , but my clean - cut mother and father tried to embrace , in a haphazard and innocent way , the values of the counterculture — at least enough to send me , their moody 14 - year - old daughter , alone on a four - week bike trip through Greece .
My parents always approached my sister and me with an open - mindedness that was part idealism and part indulgence .
So even when we were tiny , they let us stay up with the adults .
We drifted off to sleep on various laps amid the murmur of late - night conversation .
We attended an experimental school that , in sixth grade , gave us the option of studying math or doing book reports .
( To this day , I do n’t really understand fractions . )
We were the only ones in our suburban neighborhood who ate brown bread and made yogurt .
My housewife mother was never without makeup and high heels , but she wanted to be sure I was raised with the hard - won feminist insistence on limitless possibility .
So we listened to Marlo Thomas ’s record “ Free to Be You and Me , ” her effort to instill women ’s lib in the coming generation .
Later , we sang along to Carole King and “ Jesus Christ Superstar . ”
My sister and I would perform the entire rock opera during car rides on our summer vacations .
George W. Bushâ€™s approval rating has now reached the political equivalent of absolute zero .
Why , people are wondering all over the media , doesnâ€™t the man do something about it ?
At least make an effort , for Christâ€ ™s sake .
Donâ€™t just stand there .
Fire Gonzales , for instance .
Get out of Iraq , even .
Anything .
But no , he goes and gives a get - out - of jail card to Libby instead .
Doesnâ€™t he care about his place in history ?
Actually he does .
Bush cares very deeply about that very thing .
He just has a different place in mind than we do .
Most of us presume , very naturally , that the president must prefer success over failure .
This is what makes it so puzzling , so incomprehensible , to watch the man cling so stubbornly to failed policies and people .
But this presumption ignores the entire arc of Bushâ€™s life .
For him , success is failure .
For him , victory never meant surpassing his father ; it meant letting him down .
The younger Bushâ€™s career can only be understood as a lifelong obsession with disappointing the father he so plainly hates .
Bush followed his fatherâ€™s footsteps through Yale , as a pilot , as a candidate for Congress , and as a Texas businessman .
Unable to fill any of those footprints , he made each one seem unimportant by pretending contempt for it .
He got Câ€™s where his father got Aâ€™s ; he dodged the combat flying that made his father a hero ; he burned through the seed money his fatherâ€™s friends gave him ; he failed in the oil business which had made his father rich .
Time after time daddy bailed him out ; time after time , he failed again until the last bail - out left him as the front man for the investors in a baseball team .
Then , with no effort on his own part , Bush was taken in hand by a sleazy political op who realized that the fatherâ€™s name and money would be enough to elect the wayward son governor of Texas .
( In fact , a significant percentage of Texas voters thought the son was his father . )
And next thing you know , Rove had hand - carried his meal ticket into the White House .
Take that , you old fart , junior must have told himself as he took the oath of office .
You ainâ €™t so hot .
Any asshole can get to be president .
But that wasnâ€™t enough .
Deep inside , where the snakes writhed in the wayward sonâ€™s unconscious , there was still work to do .
What better way to humiliate his father than to degrade the supreme office the old man had spent his life to reach ?
What sweeter revenge than to slime , like a slug , the presidency itself ?
And so he enlisted Rumsfeld and Cheney , his fatherâ€™s ancient enemies , to help in the symbolic killing of his father .
A successful presidency , the junior Bush must have known in his heart , was beyond his limited capacities .
Just as well , too , since becoming a better president than his father would have had the wrong effect entirely .
It would have made the old bastard proud .
The point had never been to make his father proud â€ ” that would have required effortâ€ ” but to make him sad and angry .
His role wasnâ€™t the good son , it was the black sheep .
And now George W. Bush had been given the power to put his father through the greatest disappointment of them all .
He would become , and nobody could stop him , the worst president in history .

Former newspaperman and diplomat ; speechwriter for President Carter ; author of the Tom Bethany mystery series .
As first lady , Hillary Rodham Clinton jaw - boned the authoritarian president of Uzbekistan to leave his car and shake hands with people .
She argued with the Czech prime minister about democracy .
She cajoled Roman Catholic and Protestant women to talk to one another in Northern Ireland .
She traveled to 79 countries in total , little of it leisure ; one meeting with mutilated Rwandan refugees so unsettled her that she threw up afterward .
But during those two terms in the White House , Mrs. Clinton did not hold a security clearance .
She did not attend National Security Council meetings .
She was not given a copy of the president ’s daily intelligence briefing .
She did not assert herself on the crises in Somalia , Haiti and Rwanda .
And during one of President Bill Clinton ’s major tests on terrorism , whether to bomb Afghanistan and Sudan in 1998 , Mrs. Clinton was barely speaking to her husband , let alone advising him , as the Lewinsky scandal sizzled .
In seeking the Democratic presidential nomination , Mrs. Clinton lays claim to two traits nearly every day : strength and experience .
But as the junior senator from New York , she has few significant legislative accomplishments to her name .
She has cast herself , instead , as a first lady like no other : a full partner to her husband in his administration , and , she says , all the stronger and more experienced for her “ eight years with a front - row seat on history . ”
Detroit first - grader takes six bullets to save mom Detroit girl , 7 , takes six bullets to save mom
DETROIT — A 7 - year - old - girl is being hailed as an " angel from heaven " and a hero for jumping in front of an enraged gunman , who pumped six bullets into the child as she used her body as a shield to save her mother 's life .
Alexis Goggins , a first - grader at Campbell Elementary School , is at Children 's Hospital in Detroit recovering from gunshot wounds to the eye , left temple , chin , cheek , chest and right arm .
" She is an angel from heaven , " said Aisha Ford , a family friend for 15 years who also was caught up in the evening of terror .
The girl 's mother , Selietha Parker , 30 , was shot in the left side of her head and her bicep by a former boyfriend , who police said was trying to kill Parker .
The gunman was disarmed by police and arrested at the scene of the shooting .
Police identified him as Calvin Tillie , 29 , a four - time convicted felon who Parker had dated for six months before breaking off the relationship .
Parker , who was treated at Detroit Receiving Hospital and released , is at her daughter 's bedside .
She declined to comment Tuesday .
The drama began to unfold just before midnight Saturday , when Parker called Ford and asked if she and Alexis could spend the night at Ford 's home .
" She said she had no heat and they were very cold , and I said , sure I 'll come and get you , " Ford said .
Ford said she drove her burgundy 1998 Ford Expedition to Parker 's home on Dwyer .
She said as Parker and Alexis walked up to her vehicle she saw a man on the porch , who she assumed was a furnace repairman .
She said Alexis , who walks with a limp , slipped momentarily on the icy sidewalk and as she helped the girl up , she saw the man and recognized him as Tillie .
He was holding a gun .
Tillie ordered them into the vehicle , cursed at the women and angrily told Ford to drive him to Six Mile Road , she said .
" He looked like he was enraged and did n't care what he did .
I knew if we went to Six Mile , he would kill us , " Ford said .
Instead , she told him she needed gas and drove to the Fast Stop Gas station in the 5000 block of East Seven Mile Road , a station that requires customers to pay the attendant inside .
" I figured if he got out to pump the gas , I was going to take off , " Ford said .
Instead , Tillie gave her $ 10 and told her put in $ 5 worth of gas .
Ford said she dialed 911 on her cell phone as she walked into the station .
" The first operator clicked off and I dialed again and told that operator a guy with a gun was holding me hostage with a mother and baby and threatening to kill us .
I told her the name of the gas station and then she said they did n't have a unit to send . "
Ford said she paid for $ 5 of gas and slowly returned to the vehicle , stalling for time as she handed Tillie the change .
She said she kept stopping and starting the pump , hoping the police would show up .
" I told him I needed more gas and took money out of my purse and went back into the station , " she said .
The attendant , Mohammad Alghazali , 30 , said he noticed Ford was crying and she told him what was happening .
He called 911 as he heard shots coming from the vehicle .
" It was very scary .
She ( Ford ) was scared and screaming when the guy was shooting .
I was scared , too .
I was on the phone talking to the police when he started shooting , " he said
Parker told police that Tillie said Ford was taking too long
She said she pleaded with him but he pointed the gun at her and shot her in the side of the head .
She told police she was shot in the arm as she lunged at Tillie .
Before Tillie could fire again , Alexis jumped over the seat between her mother and the gunman and begged him not to shoot her mother .
The police report said Tillie " without hesitation " pumped six shots into the child .
As police arrived , they saw Parker , covered in blood , running from the truck , screaming , " He just shot my baby . "
The officers said Tillie came out to the vehicle holding a blue steel 9 mm semi automatic and dropped the weapon when ordered to do so .
Officers said they found Alexis huddled on the floor under the steering wheel , covered in blood , surrounded by spent cartridge casings , a spent bullet on the floor and teeth on the seat .
There were bullet holes in the windshield and blood inside .
Alghazali said a police car on a street nearby arrived in less than a minute after his call .
Marvin Bodley , a Detroit Public Schools attendance agent , spent two days at Alexis ' hospital bedside and said it 's miraculous that she 's alive .
" What a courageous , courageous little girl , " he said .
" You see more bandages than child , " he said .
" It 's a horrific sight . "
Bodley said Alexis receives special education services at school , in part because of a weak left eye , which is the result of a massive stroke she suffered as an infant .
Ford said doctors at the time had predicted that when Alexis got older she would have trouble with tasks such as writing , but she is now able to write her name .
" She is a good little girl who is very protective of her mother , " said Tonya Colbert , Parker 's cousin .
Tillie is being held in the Wayne County Jail facing kidnapping , assault with intent to murder , child abuse , felony firearms and habitual criminal charges .
A preliminary examination is scheduled for Dec. 13 .
Congratulations to Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban .
As confirmed by their grammatically - challenged rep , the pair is expecting a baby .
" The couple are thrilled , " Catherine Olim says in a statement .
As relayed in this old Vanity Fair article , Nicole Kidman has wanted a child with Keith Urban for many years .
Mission accomplished !
George Clooney , meanwhile , quickly chimed in with his thoughts on how Kidman will do as a mother .
" She 'll be great , " he said of the actress , already mother to Isabella , 15 , and Connor , 12 , her adopted children with ex-husband Tom Cruise .
" She 'll be a tall mother . "
Kidman now joins other , younger , far less appropriate mothers - to - be in Hollywood .
They include Jamie Lynn Spears and Nicole Richie .

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Neoconservative godfather Norman Podhoretz has written that " as an American and as a Jew " he prays that President George W. Bush will attack Iran .
He rests his case on his belief that 2007 is really 1938 , that Iran is Nazi Germany , and that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is Hitler .
His most recent book , World War IV : The Long Struggle Against Islamofascism , was described by a reviewer as " a hectoring , often illogical screed based on cherry - picked facts and blustering assertions ( often made without any supporting evidence ) , a book that furiously hurls accusations of cowardice , anti-Americanism , and sheer venality at any and all opponents of the Bush doctrine , be they on the right or the left . "
Unlike people who subscribe to the view that a war with Iran would be a catastrophe for the United States , Podhoretz reportedly has regular access to the White House to promote his insightful historical analysis .
But as Podhoretz is not in government and he controls no carrier groups , he has only a limited capability to bring about his dream of an emasculated Iran to take its place alongside an emasculated Iraq and a presumably soon - to - be emasculated Syria .
But while Podhoretz cannot start a war alone , there are plenty of others in the government , including Vice President Dick Cheney and the National Security Council ’s Elliott Abrams , who share his enthusiasm for a preemptive attack on Iran .
The leader of Congress ’ Iran hawks is undoubtedly Sen. Joe Lieberman of Connecticut .
Lieberman , currently an independent , has long been regarded as a " conservative Democrat , " but his voting record reveals that his conservatism is largely limited to foreign policy and more specifically to the Middle East , where he is a strong and uncritical defender of Israel .
When he successfully ran for reelection as an independent in Connecticut in 2006 , he accused his Democratic opponent Ned Lamont of not being a forceful enough advocate for Israel , claiming that Lamont was " surrounded by people who are either naïve or are isolationists or , frankly , some more explicitly against Israel . "
A former senior official of the pro-Israel lobby AIPAC also endorsed that view , stating that " the pro Israel community will stick with Joe Lieberman . "
Lieberman has never counted the costs to the United States of pursuing Israeli objectives in the Middle East .
He continues to be a vocal supporter of the invasion and occupation of Iraq , frequently mentioning Saddam ’s alleged links to terrorists and invoking a variation of the White House line that if the U.S. does not fight terrorists in Iraq it will be necessary to fight them in New Haven .
In 1998 he co-sponsored the Iraq Liberation Act , which made regime change in Baghdad official U.S. policy .
His regular forays to Baghdad have convinced him that Iraq has been transformed from " primitive , killing tyranny " into " modern , self - governing , self - securing nationhood . "
He saw clear evidence by 2005 of the democratization of Iraq : " Progress is visible there are many more cars on the streets , satellite television dishes on the roofs , and literally millions more cell phones . "
More recently , he enthusiastically supported last summer ’s Israeli invasion of Lebanon and has tried to make Syria the newest member of the axis of evil , claiming without any evidence that it is Syria " through which up to 80 percent of the Iraq - bound extremists transit .
Indeed , even terrorists from countries that directly border Iraq travel by land via Syria to Iraq , instead of directly from their home countries , because of the permissive environment for terrorism that the Syrian government has fostered . "
Lieberman has also been front and center in taking on the thorny problem of Iran , promoting a military response as the most effective option .
In an April 2006 interview in the Jerusalem Post , he freely discussed using military force to disarm Iran , noting that the U.S. had learned a lesson from both Osama bin Laden and Hitler that " sometimes when people say really extreme things they may actually mean it . "
In December 2006 , Lieberman followed up by explaining that he opposed direct talks with Iran because it would be like going to " your local fire department asking a couple of arsonists to help put out the fire .
These people are flaming the fire .
They are extremists . "
On Dec. 29 , 2006 , Lieberman wrote a Washington Post op - ed in which he explained the situation in the Middle East in simple terms : " On one side are extremists and terrorists led and sponsored by Iran , on the other moderates and democrats supported by the United States . "
On June 10 , 2007 , Lieberman told Face the Nation , " I think we ’ve got to be prepared to take aggressive military action against the Iranians to stop them from killing Americans in Iraq .
And to me that would include a strike into over the border into Iran where they are training these people coming back into Iraq to kill our soldiers . "
He later stated that " By some estimates , they have killed as many as 200 American soldiers , " and , for good measure , he added that if Iran is not willing to live " according to the international rule of law and stopping , for instance , their nuclear weapons development , we ca n’t just talk to them . "
On the following day , Weekly Standard editor William Kristol said " It sure does , " after being asked if the Lieberman statement would make it easier for the White House to consider an attack against Iran .
On July 6 , 2007 , Lieberman wrote an op -ed for the Wall Street Journal in which he claimed , " The Iranian government , by its actions , has all but declared war on us and our allies in the Middle East .
American now has a solemn responsibility to utilize the instruments of our national power to convince Tehran to change its behavior , " employing " credible force " because Iran is bringing " about the death of American service members in Iraq . "
He described , without providing any evidence , how the " Iranian government has been using the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah to train and organize Iraqi extremists , who are responsible in turn for the murder of American service members . "
He called Iran ’s role as " hostile and violent " and complained that Tehran ’s " fanatical government " demonstrates " expansionistic , extremist behavior . "
After again referring to Iran ’s " fanatical regime , " he cited " attacks on American soldiers " as a reason why Iran " must be confronted head on . "
Lieberman was the co-sponsor of the Kyl - Lieberman amendment to the recently passed defense appropriations bill , which passed by a Senate vote of 76 to 22 on Sept. 26 , 2007 .
The amendment stated that " the murder of members of the United States Armed Forces by a foreign government or its agents is an intolerable act of hostility against the United States . "
Lieberman ’s press release on the subject , dated July 11 , 2007 , accused Iran of " murdering our troops " and quoted Sen .
John Kyl , who blamed Iran for " actively supporting terrorists who are killing our troops in Iraq . "
When the Kyl - Lieberman amendment was debated in the Senate , James Webb of Virginia said , " At best , it ’s a deliberate attempt to divert attention from a failed diplomatic policy .
At worst , it could be read as a backdoor method of gaining congressional validation for military action , without one hearing and without serious debate . "
Webb also called the amendment " Dick Cheney ’s fondest pipe dream " and noted correctly that the attempt to categorize the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary guard as a " foreign terrorist organization " would mandate military action against Iran : " What do we do with terrorist organizations ?
We attack them . "
There is hardly any point in identifying Lieberman ’s numerous errors in fact in an attempt to refute his assertions , as he is ideologically driven and not interested in the truth .
His sloganeering is more in the nature of propaganda than a careful consideration of policy options or the U.S. ’ national interests .
He twists and embroiders the facts to enable him to rule out speaking to Iran while at the same time blaming it for all of the problems in the region .
Lieberman also disregards the reality in Iraq , which is that Iran is deeply embedded there as a result of the United States ’ invasion , which removed Tehran ’s traditional rival and empowered the Shia .
Lieberman repeats over and over again that American soldiers are being killed by Iran .
Apparently , the neocons have found it too difficult to make the case that Iran is actually seeking a nuclear weapon .
That American soldiers are being killed through the active intervention of the Iranian government is in any event debatable , and most of the international media appears to believe that the allegations lack hard evidence .
That many Americans do not see the need to attack Iran does not faze Sen.
Joseph Isadore Lieberman , a man of self - proclaimed principle who obviously has clearer vision and knows better than his fellow countrymen what is right and what is wrong .
If Iran turns into a major catastrophe not only for the U.S. and Iran but also for the entire region , will Lieberman take the blame as a principal enabler of the war so desired by Norman Podhoretz ?
If Lieberman ’s lack of contrition over Iraq is anything to go by , almost certainly not .
TheGardenLady received this question from Sally :
Are there any other Christmas themed plants other than the mistletoe ?
There are numerous Christmas themed plants and there is a long and interesting history of the reasons for the use of these plants during the holiday season .
Many of these holiday themed plants are used in the US today .
The GardenLady will touch on some of the most popular Christmas plants .
Common holiday plants are listed in this website , where there is a lot of interesting information given besides the list of holiday plants .
In other parts of the world they may also use different plants .
The first Christmas plant materials , as told in the New Testament , were Frankincense and Myrrh .
Both are resins of trees used as incense or fragrances .
They were the most expensive substances in early history and were therefore the highest tribute offered .
Both were and are used today as fragrances .
Franckincense is from the Boswellia sacra tree and Myrrh is from the Camphor tree , Commiphora myrrha .
They are are found in Oman , Yemen and the Northeast part of Somalia .
Oman still produces perfumes made of Frankincense or on Amazon.com you can get soap made of Frankincense and Myrrh - All Natural Bath Soap – Frankincense & Myrrh Zum Bar Soap by Indigo Wild , 3oz. or Frankincense and Myrrh can be bought as fragrant oils or for incense .
Some of the plants used in the Christmas celebration today were used originally by pagans .
Some of the themed plants , like the Christmas tree , came about during the early Christian period .
Many of the Christmas plants used in the US were brought to the US by the immigrant settlers .
And some Christmas plants , like the Christmas Cactus ( Schlumbergera x buckleyii ) or the Poinsettia ( Euphorbia pulcherrima ) , which were discovered in the New World , have become relatively new symbols of Christmas because they bloom at Christmas time .
The Poinsettia which was discovered in Mexico where it is known as the Flores de Noche Buena , Flowers of the Holy Night not only blooms around Christmas time but were basically red and green , ( now the newer hybrids come in other colors ) so it is easy to see why it became associated with the
Christmas holiday .
Poinsettia , Christmas Cactus and Cyclamen Holly How to Grow
Mistletoe and Holly – see here and here and here .
Myths and legends have grown up about the use of the plants for the Christmas holiday .
Some of the plants have more than one myth associating it to the Christmas story .
Mistletoe
Mistletoe closer up by Martin LaBar
Traditions involving mistletoe date back to ancient times .
Druids believed that mistletoe could bestow health and good luck .
Mistletoe also played a role in a superstition concerning marriage where it was believed that kissing under the mistletoe increased the possibility of marriage in the upcoming year .
American mistletoe ( Phoradendron serotinum ) can be found growing in deciduous trees from New Jersey and southern Indiana southward to Florida and Texas .
It is the state flower of Oklahoma .
Most mistletoe is harvested in Oklahoma and Texas .
Holly
The pointed leaves of the evergreen Holly ( Ilex aquifolium found in Europe or Ilex opaca found in the US ) represent the thorns of Christ ’s Crown .
The green leaves represent eternal life , and the red berries represent the blood of Christ .
It is said that holly was used to make the crown of thorns .
Ivy ( Hedera spp. ) is another old Christmas symbol .
The significance of ivy , like holly and mistletoe , is based on pagan rituals .
Ivy was a symbol of everlasting life in pagan religions .
The Celts and Druids thought that just like ivy , the earth was everlasting and would persevere .
It was a symbol of hope that spring would soon arrive .
Ivy has the same meaning in Christian symbolism .
It represents the everlasting life of Christ .
The Laurel plant ( Laurus nobilis )
“ Laurus nobilis ” flowers ( Alloro ) by Luigi FDV
is another Christmas plant whereby both the pagan and Christian meanings are similar .
Early Christians adopted the laurel leaf - also known as bay leaves - as their own , altering the meaning slightly to mean the triumph of humanity through the birth of Jesus .
Both ivy and laurel leaves continue to be used in Christmas decorations , especially wreaths and garlands .
Rosemary ( Rosmarinus officinalis )
is another plant with extensive holiday traditions , symbolism , and legends .
Floors of churches and homes were strewn with the herb and the traditional boar ’s head for the Christmas feast was decorated with rosemary .
Christmas Trees
Though today many different evergreen trees are used as Christmas trees - usually those from the Pinaceae – Pine family or the Cupressaceae – cypress family , local additions may use other plants .
( How to pick the best evergreen tree for your area .
The first tree used for Christmas decorations is believed to be the fir tree , probably pinus sylvestris that grows in Europe ; but what is called the fir tree , the common name , can be one of between 45 - 55 species of evergreen conifers in the family Pinaceae that is in the genus Abies .
See the history of xmas tree .
Medieval Christmas Tradition
The Christmas tree originally came from Latvia or Germany .
In the early 16th century , Martin Luther is said to have decorated a small Christmas Tree with candles , to show his children how the stars twinkled through the dark night .
The early trees were biblically symbolic of the Paradise Tree in the Garden of Eden .
Decorations were food items , like apples , symbols of Plenty , and flowers , originally only red ( for Knowledge ) and White ( for Innocence ) .
The tree custom traveled to England and became especially popular under the reign of Queen Victoria .
Trees had decorations that included cranberry garlands .
Around this time , the Christmas tree was spreading into other parts of Europe .
The Mediterranean countries were not too interested in the tree , preferring to display only a Creche scene .
Italy had a wooden triangle platform tree called a ‘ CEPPO ’ .
This had a Creche scene as well as decorations .
Immigrants brought the tradition to the US though it was not until communications really got going in the 19th century that the custom of the Christmas tree began to spread from isolated German communities throughout the country .
Thus references to decorated trees in America before about the middle of the 19th century are very rare .
Apples
Apples are a symbol of the holiday season that is used during the holiday .
They are used in the wassail bowl drink .
Wassailing is the tradition of going from house to house caroling , eating , drinking , and socializing with friends and relatives .
Wassailing , however , was originally an important part of a horticultural ritual .
In England , it focused on the apple orchards .
The purpose was to salute the trees in the dead of winter to insure a good crop for the coming year .
The date varied across the 12 days of Christmas .
If done formally , the wassail procession visited the principal orchards of the area , caroling as it went .
In each orchard , major trees were selected and cider or liquor was sprinkled over their root systems .
What trees were used for Yule log
The use of the Yule Log spread all over Europe .
A tree is chopped down and the bark is removed .
It is brought into the house to burn .
In England they use / d the oak tree or a bunch of ash twigs that burn .
In Scotland they use / d the birch tree and in France they use /d the cherry tree .
The Cherry Tree
In central and northern Europe it is the custom to break off a branch of a cherry tree at the beginning of Advent ( Advent from the Latin word adventus , means “ coming ” and is the period immediately preceding Christmas . ) and keep it in water in a warm room .
The flowers burst into bloom at Christmas time .
Hawthorn
Glastonbury thorn ( Crataegus monogyna ‘ Biflora ’ )
The Glastonbury thorn is connected with Christ ’s death as well as his birth .
Legend has it that Joseph of Arimathea came to Britain to spread the message of Christianity .
As he lay down to rest from his weary journey , he pushed his staff into the ground beside him .
When he awoke , he found that the staff had taken root and begun to grow and blossom .
From that day onwards – every Christmas
Eve the white thorn buds and blooms .
There is a tradition in England that a branch of the Glastonbury Thorn is taken and displayed each year in Buckingham Palace .
Other Christmas Themed Plants
The Christmas Rose is n’t a true rose , but is the helleborus nigra which traditionally flowers in December at Christmas time , thus its name .
It is considered another Christmas plant .
In Greek the Chrysanthemum means “ golden flower , ” but today many German families bring white chrysanthemums into their homes on Christmas Eve , following the tradition based on a German legend of sheltering the Christ Child .
In Lebanon families plant seeds of grain in small pots a month before Christmas so that when Christmas arrives the families have little pots of green to place around their Christmas tree .
In the Ukraine they bring a sheaf of wheat or didukh into their houses for decorations .
Paperwhite narcissus are thought of as Christmas plants because they can be forced to bloom for the holiday .
They are especially enjoyed in Chinese dwellings as harbingers of spring .
In Australia where there are many plants not known in the Northern hemisphere , unusual plants are used as Christmas themed plants .
December is summer in Australia so many of these plants are now in bloom .
It would be interesting to learn about some of the legends and myths associated with these plants .
See Christmas plants in Australia .
And even with all the traditionally themed plants for Christmas , horticulturalists are still creating new ones for the holidays .
Ornamental Peppers are now being bred in brilliant holiday colors .
The ones bred at New Mexico State University , the red and green pepper plants , are particularly appealing since the peppers can also be used in Christmas cooking .

You would n’t know it if you just watch TV news or read the corporate press , but this past Tuesday , something remarkable happened .
Despite the pig- headed opposition of the Democratic Party ’s top congressional leadership , a majority of the House , including three Republicans , voted to send Dennis Kucinich ’s long sidelined Cheney impeachment bill ( H Res 333 ) to the Judiciary Committee for hearings .
The vote was 218 to 194 .
Now the behind - the - scenes partisan maneuvering that preceded that vote was arcane indeed , with Kucinich first exercising a member ’s privilege motion to present his stymied impeachment bill to the full House , only to have Speaker Nancy Pelosi arrange for a colleague ( Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , D - MD ) offer a motion to table it .
The Republicans , anxious to embarrass the Speaker , threw a wrench into that plan , though , by voting as a bloc to oppose tabling .
Since Kucinich already has 22 co-sponsors for his bill , it was clear that the tabling gambit would fail .
As soon as that became apparent , rank - and - file Democrats , unwilling to be seen by their constituents as defending Cheney , rushed to change their votes to opposing the tabling motion .
In the end , tabling failed by 242 to 170 with 77 Democrats supporting a pleasantly surprised Kucinich .

DESPITE the rosy claims of the Bush administration , the No Child Left Behind Act of 2002 is fundamentally flawed .
The latest national tests , released last week , show that academic gains since 2003 have been modest , less even than those posted in the years before the law was put in place .
In eighth - grade reading , there have been no gains at all since 1998 .
The main goal of the law — that all children in the United States will be proficient in reading and mathematics by 2014 — is simply unattainable .
The primary strategy — to test all children in those subjects in grades three through eight every year — has unleashed an unhealthy obsession with standardized testing that has reduced the time available for teaching other important subjects .
Furthermore , the law completely fractures the traditional limits on federal interference in the operation of local schools .
Unfortunately , the Congressional leaders in both parties seem determined to renew the law , probably after next year ’s presidential election , with only minor changes .
But No Child Left Behind should be radically overhauled , not just tweaked .
Under the law , the states devise their own standards and their own tests .
Based on the test results , every school is expected to make “ adequate yearly progress ” in grades three to eight so as to be on track to meet that goal of universal proficiency by 2014 .
Schools that do not meet their annual target for every group of students — as defined by race , poverty , language and disability status — are subject to increasingly onerous sanctions written into the federal law .
Frankfurt ( TGW ) - Mercedes - Benz will begin limited serial production within three years of a small car powered by a zero-emissions hydrogen fuel cell , the company said yesterday .
Production of the B - Class F - Cell will begin in early 2010 , the carmaker said at a car show in Frankfurt .
It is still deciding how to market the car , said Thomas Weber , the group 's research head and development chief at Mercedes .
" We will have this auto at the starting line and bring it to market at whatever conditions ( we determine ) .
We will certainly not be able to sell it in normal showrooms , " he told Reuters .
" A fuel cell car will be far removed from the cost position of a traditional car in 2010 , but it is emissions free , it goes 400 km ( 240 miles ) , it has sensational acceleration from 0 to 100 ( km/ hour ) and it consumes less than the equivalent of three liters " of diesel fuel per 100 km driven , he added .
The car 's top output will be 136 horsepower , and will be on par with a two - liter petrol engine .
Commercially available cars have been a goal for years , but costs have held the goal back .
DaimlerChrysler , the company which owns Mercedes - Benz , is a market leader in hydrogen fuel cell cars ; they have 100 fuel cell vehicles on the streets already .
Rival BMW has already leases hydrogen powered cars .

The Trouble With the ’ 64 Civil Rights Act
by Ron Paul
Recently by Ron Paul : More Blank Checks to the Military Industrial Complex
On June 4 , 2004 , Congress hailed the 40th anniversary of the 1964 Act .
Only the heroic Ron Paul dissented .
Here are his comments .
Mr. Speaker , I rise to explain my objection to H. Res. 676 .
I certainly join my colleagues in urging Americans to celebrate the progress this country has made in race relations .
However , contrary to the claims of the supporters of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the sponsors of H. Res. 676 , the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 did not improve race relations or enhance freedom .
Instead , the forced integration dictated by the Civil Rights Act of 1964 increased racial tensions while diminishing individual liberty .
The Civil Rights
Act of 1964 gave the federal government unprecedented power over the hiring , employee relations , and customer service practices of every business in the country .
The result was a massive violation of the rights of private property and contract , which are the bedrocks of free society .
The federal government has no legitimate authority to infringe on the rights of private property owners to use their property as they please and to form ( or not form ) contracts with terms mutually agreeable to all parties .
The rights of all private property owners , even those whose actions decent people find abhorrent , must be respected if we are to maintain a free society .
This expansion of federal power was based on an erroneous interpretation of the congressional power to regulate interstate commerce .
The framers of the Constitution intended the interstate commerce clause to create a free trade zone among the states , not to give the federal government regulatory power over every business that has any connection with interstate commerce .
The Civil Rights
Act of 1964 not only violated the Constitution and reduced individual liberty ; it also failed to achieve its stated goals of promoting racial harmony and a color - blind society .
Federal bureaucrats and judges cannot read minds to see if actions are motivated by racism .
Therefore , the only way the federal government could ensure an employer was not violating the Civil Rights
Act of 1964 was to ensure that the racial composition of a business ’s workforce matched the racial composition of a bureaucrat or judge ’s defined body of potential employees .
Thus , bureaucrats began forcing employers to hire by racial quota .
Racial quotas have not contributed to racial harmony or advanced the goal of a color - blind society .
Instead , these quotas encouraged racial balkanization , and fostered racial strife .
Of course , America has made great strides in race relations over the past forty years .
However , this progress is due to changes in public attitudes and private efforts .
Relations between the races have improved despite , not because of , the 1964 Civil Rights Act .
In conclusion , Mr. Speaker , while I join the sponsors of H. Res. 676 in promoting racial harmony and individual liberty , the fact is the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did not accomplish these goals .
Instead , this law unconstitutionally expanded federal power , thus reducing liberty .
Furthermore , by prompting raced - based quotas , this law undermined efforts to achieve a color - blind society and increased racial strife .
Therefore , I must oppose H. Res. 676 .

The Best of Ron Paul
Today the government begins its long - awaited consultation process into the need for a third runway at London 's Heathrow Airport .
Strangely enough , given Gordon Brown 's recent public declarations that tackling climate change is right at the top of his agenda , it 's already looking as though Heathrow expansion will be given the go - ahead .
But then documents we 've been given by Justine Greening MP show just how closely the government has been working with BAA on preparing the consultation .
This move towards a third runway is despite the fact that it will mean a 70 per cent increase in flight numbers and the resulting rise in climate change pollution will be equivalent to the entire annual emissions of Kenya .
Worse still , the bulk of the additional 500 flights a day from Europe 's busiest airport will be short - haul hops to cities like Paris , Brussels , Edinburgh and Newcastle - all easily reached by rail .
There 's only one reason for a third runway - to increase the profits of the BAA and the major airlines , in particular British Airways , who operate these routes .
And documents we 've obtained from BAA under the Freedom of Information
Act show just how closely the company and the Department for Transport ( DT ) have been working together to ensure the runway gets built .
Here are just some of the highlights :
BAA officials have written parts of the consultation .
BAA supplied the data for calculations of noise and pollution that inform the premise of the consultation document .
No opposition groups have been permitted to challenge the data .
The DT and BAA have drawn up a ' risk list ' of threats to the building of the third runway .
The list includes the 2 M campaign , the group comprising councils representing 2 million people opposed to the plans .
They 've even set up a joint body – the Heathrow Delivery Group – aimed at steering the plans through the consultation process .
Honestly , this kind of duplicity almost beggars belief .
Flying is the fastest growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the UK - unless we bring it under control we have no chance of meeting the ambitions CO2 reduction targets that the PM only this week pledged to reach , or even exceed .
And Heathrow is only one of more than 20 airports around the country in the process of submitting expansion plans .
The Tyndall climate research centre has calculated that if aviation continues to expand as projected , Britain will have to totally decarbonise the rest of its economy by 2050 to effectively tackle climate change .
What you can do
Let Gordon
Brown know that he 's a public servant and that we expect him to act in our interests , not help big business maximise its profits .
There are two ways you can do this - send him a video message or write him a letter .
In fact , to ram the point home why not do both ?
It should n't take you more than a few minutes .
Join the thousands who want to stop Heathrow expansion by adding your comments to our video wall .
Make your voice heard !
Write to Gordon Brown and tell him that minimising the effects of climate change is more important than increasing British Airways ' profits !
Watch last Tuesday 's Newsnight debate about Heathrow between Greenpeace 's John Sauven and energy minister Malcolm Wickes .

" Shields up ! " barks Captain James T Kirk as the Starship Enterprise braces itself for another blast from the Klingon cruiser , referring to that essential accessory without which the crew could never have ventured beyond the final frontier .
And while real astronauts are not thought to face quite the same risk from alien species , engineers are developing a similar shield to protect them from the solar wind , a stream of high - energy charged particles from the sun travelling faster than the speed of sound .
They say protecting crew members on long - term missions to Mars or the moon will be essential because the stream of particles causes mutations to DNA which can lead to cancer .
UK researchers have created a scaled - down version of the solar wind in a lab in Oxfordshire to study how to use magnetic shielding to protect astronauts .
" We now have actual measurements that show a ' hole ' in the solar wind could be created in which a spacecraft could sit , affording some protection from ' ion storms ' , as they would call them on Star Trek , " said Dr Ruth Bamford , a physicist at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Chilton .
The question of how to fend off the solar wind has been given some urgency by an international plan - the Global Exploration Strategy , signed by 14 space agencies including those of Britain , China , France and the US - to return to the moon and send astronauts further into space .
George Bush has committed the US to a return trip to the moon by 2020 and the ultimate aim is to send people on the eight - month voyage to the red planet .
Bamford and her colleagues took a tip from our own planet when designing their " ion shield " .
Earth 's magnetic field produces a magnetic shell called the magnetosphere which deflects charged particles in the solar wind .
" We would n't have life on Earth if we were fully exposed to the radiation coming from the sun , " she said .
" It 's our first layer of defence . "
The team simulated the solar wind in the lab using an intense beam of charged high - energy particles .
They placed a powerful magnet in this beam to investigate how effective it was at deflecting the particles .
Bamford said it worked perfectly .
The pinky glow of the plasma beam curved around the magnet just as the team had predicted .
" It seems like quite a simple thing to do and it is , but what we are trying to do is put numbers on how effective this is , " said Bamford .
" I think a lot of people in space science did n't necessarily believe it could work as well as it did - and it worked superbly well . "
Now that the team have demonstrated the principle , their next challenge is to make a device energy - efficient enough to be powered by a spacecraft , Bamford said .
PHILADELPHIA 
A few years ago , Dennis DeTurck , an award - winning professor of mathematics at the University of Pennsylvania , stood at an outdoor podium on campus and proclaimed , " Down with fractions ! "
" Fractions have had their day , being useful for by - hand calculation , " DeTurck said as part of a 60 - second lecture series .
" But in this digital age , they 're as obsolete as Roman numerals are . "
The speech started a firestorm , particularly after the university posted it online .
" There were blogs and rants , and there were some critical e-mails , " said DeTurck , who is now dean of the college of arts and sciences at Penn .
" They 'd always boil down to : ' What would we do in cooking and carpentry ? ' " DeTurck is stirring the pot again , this time in a book scheduled to be published this year .
Not only does he favor the teaching of decimals over fractions to elementary school students , he 's also taking on long division , the calculation of square roots and by - hand multiplication of long numbers .
" Mathematicians are always questioning the axioms .
Everybody knows that questioning those often results in the most substantial gains in terms of progress , " he says .
Questioning the wisdom of teaching fractions to young students does n't compute with people such as George Andrews , a professor of mathematics at Pennsylvania State University and president - elect of the American Mathematical Society .
" All of this is absurd , " Andrews said .
" No wonder mathematical achievements in the country are so abysmal .
" Arithmetic is the basic skill .
If children do not know arithmetic , they can't go on to algebra , which leads to calculus .
From there you go on to other things , " Andrews said .
" It 's fine to talk about it , but this is not a good pedagogy . "
Others see value in both fractions and decimals .
To Janine Remillard , associate professor of education at Penn , the decimal system is " incredibly powerful . "
And fractions can be a powerful steppingstone to understanding decimals , she says .
" Fractions , if taught well — and that 's a huge caveat — can actually help kids understand the value of the size of the pieces , " Remillard says .
DeTurck does not want to abolish the teaching of fractions and long division altogether .
He believes fractions are important for high - level mathematics and scientific research .
But it could be that the study of fractions should be delayed until it can be understood , perhaps after a student learns calculus , he said .
Long division has its uses , too , but maybe it does n't need to be taught as intensely .
Penn State mathematician Andrews says he believes DeTurck 's ideas will " unfortunately " gain traction because of the misguided belief that math education can somehow be made easy : " Math is hard .
The idea that somehow we 're going to make math just fun is just a dream . "
Milford reports for The News Journal in Wilmington , Del. Enlarge By Emily Varisco , The ( Wilmington ) News Journal University of Pennsylvania math professor dennis DeTurck says fractions are 'as obsolete as roman numerals . '

ダイエット薬にもいくつか種類があり、例えば脳の中枢神経系に作用して食べてもいないのに満腹感を与える薬もあります。
しかし、そのように脳の中枢神経系に働きかける薬というのは麻薬と同じような効果があるために使用方法によっては危険であるために医師の管理が必要となっています。
しかし、ゼニカルの場合はそのように中枢神経系に作用する事もなく安全であり、個人輸入も認められているために病院で処方してもらう必要はないです。
ゼニカルは日本では認可されていませんが、海外ではモデルも使っているダイエットで定番の薬であり、日本の厚生労働省にあたるアメリカのFDAで認可されているために安全性が高いという事で人気のあるダイエット薬となっています。
ゼニカルの正規品を通販で購入する方法もネット上には載っているため、初めての方でも安心です。
ゼニカルがどのようにダイエット効果があるのかというと、通常は脂肪分は胃の中でリパーゼという酵素によって分解されて体内に吸収されますが、ゼニカルを服用するとリパーゼの働きを阻害する作用があるために脂肪の吸収を抑える事が出来ます。
全ての脂肪分の吸収を抑えるという訳では無く、約30%程度の脂肪分の吸収を抑える事が出来て、脂肪分が多い食事をしている人ほどダイエット効果が期待できます。
ダイエットをするのにも食欲をあまり抑えなくても痩せる事が出来、好きなものを食べながらでもダイエットをする事が可能です。
アメリカの治験では1年間で60%程度の人が5%程度の体重の減少があり、27%程度は10%程度の体重減少効果があったとされています。
これだけだとダイエット効果としてはそこまで大きく感じられないかもしれません。
しかし、安全性の高さと食事をしながら痩せる事が出来るという事を考慮すれば効果がかなりあると判断できますし、他のダイエットとうまく組み合わせればより高い効果も期待できます。
Home improvement is the best way to make things more useful in your home or more aesthetically pleasing .
There are some home improvement projects you can do on your own .
This helps you save time while at the same time allows you to achieve the improvement you have been thinking of .
While your work may not result with professional quality , as long as you put your time and effort into them , they are definitely worthy projects .
At some point , you 've probably thought to yourself " I 'd love to write some code , but the keywords in my language of choice are just so pedestrian . "
Your vocabulary is more embiggoned than that of your colleagues .
While they 're content with DROPping a database object , you 'd prefer to efface it .
A contractor that Charles I.'s worked with was one of these elite .
His first order of business ?
Get rid of those ( ugh ) " while " loops that his mouth - breathing coworkers used .
With the belief that elegant code should embody every aspect of the word " elegant , " he wrote all of his " while " loops as " whilst " loops .
The day before his contract expired , he checked in all of his changes .
And needless to say , it would n't compile anymore .
" The problem has to be on your end , " he insisted .
" It works on my system . "
For good measure , he compiled it and demonstrated that it worked .
Charles did the sensible thing — a find / replace to change all " whilst "s to " while "s , rebuilt , and everything was fine .
Still , it was odd that it worked on the contractor 's computer .
A few months later , they figured out why :
# define whilst while
The compiler they used had a common header file that it'd include in each compilation .
The file is in the local installation directory , and just specifies directives and things to configure the compiler .
The only person who knew about the file was the clever contractor .
The end of the politically explosive , decadelong ethical battle over human embryonic stem cells may finally be in sight .
Two groups of researchers report today that washing human skin cells in similar cocktails of four genes enabled them to reprogram the cells to resemble those harvested from embryos .
The finding potentially paves the way for scores of labs to generate new stem cell lines without cloned embryos , which had long been considered the only realistic way of making human stem cells in the short run .
" The long run 's getting a lot closer , " says stem cell biologist James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison , a senior author of one of the studies .
" I do believe this is the beginning of a great change . "
He is not alone .
British newspapers reported this weekend that Ian Wilmut , the University of Edinburgh biologist who led the team that in 1997 cloned Dolly the sheep , is getting out of the cloning business in light of the new findings , which seem to offer researchers a likely new source of stem cell lines for basic research that could one day lead to new treatments and perhaps cures for spinal injuries , diabetes and debilitating disorders such as multiple sclerosis and Parkinson 's disease .
In the nearer term , reprogrammed cells may improve the screening drug candidates for harmful side effects .
" That 's the writing on the wall right now , " says biologist Arnold Kriegstein , director of the Institute for Regeneration Medicine at the University of California , San Francisco , who was not involved in the research .
Although both groups ' reprogrammed cells were able to differentiate into the three main tissue types when injected into mice , Thomson cautions that they may harbor subtle , yet to be found quirks , and will need considerable tweaking before they could be safely transplanted into humans .
Importantly , researchers must still study existing embryonic stem cell lines — the gold standard — to rule out any hidden risks in the lab - made cells , he says .
" People want to rush and say , 'we do n't need embryonic stem cells anymore , ' and over time that might be true , but right now that 's premature . "
The results help fill in the scientific puzzle kicked off by Dolly 's cloning , which proved that mammalian egg cells were capable of dissolving the genetic roadblocks that limit the potential of most adult cells to give rise to only a single type of tissue — that of the organ from which they hail — whereas embryonic stem cells have the potential to become virtually any kind of body tissue .
So researchers began testing genes that were only active in embryonic stem cells to try to pin down those capable of triggering the change .
One such group , led by biologist Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University in Japan , reported last year that four genes , delivered to mouse cells by a retrovirus , were sufficient to induce pluripotency ( the ability to differentiate into a multitude of cell types ) .
The genes — Oct 3/4 , Sox2 , c- Myc and Klf4 — are molecular switches called transcription factors , which activate other genes in series like a power strip .
Yamanaka 's group and two others followed up earlier this year with firmer evidence that these induced pluripotent stem ( iPS ) cells faithfully mimicked the patterns of gene activity and cellular differentiation observed in embryonic stem cells .
Now Yamanaka and his colleagues report in the journal Cell that the same combination of genes induced pluripotency in commercially available human fibroblasts ( connective tissue cells that play a crucial role in healing ) derived from the facial skin of a 36 - year - old woman , the joint tissue of a man , aged 69 , and a newborn , respectively .
The researchers report they were able to transform about one in 5,000 cells — enough to get several iPS cells from a single culture dish — and then coax them to become nerve cells or heart tissue on the benchtop .
Genetic scans indicated that the cells were more similar to embryonic tissue than to the original fibroblasts .
" What I find remarkable , " Kriegstein says , " is essentially the same steps that worked in the mouse were able to work with human cells … .
Everybody assumed that it'd be a different story in reprogramming the human cells . "
Thomson 's team reports producing a similar cellular alchemy using two of the same genes — Oct4 and Sox2 — and two different ones — Nanog and Lin28 , — making it less likely that the Japanese finding was a fluke .
Thomson , who in 1998 became the first scientist to extract human stem cells from embryos , says his group began seeking these factors four years ago , but chose to work with human cells .
As of last spring , he says , his group , led by lab member Junying Yu , had pared an initial list of 100 - plus genes to 14 .
Then came Yamanaka , who Thomson says beat him to the punch because mouse cells grow much faster than human cells do , allowing more rapid experimentation .
" We thought , 'oh no , it 's already been done ; we 've been beaten , ' " he recalls .
As many as a dozen major labs , he says , have since tried but failed to make reprogramming work in human cells .
His team plugged along , testing gene combinations in four cell types in varying degrees of differentiation , hopeful that this would eventually lead to the correct genetic recipe .
In the online edition of Science , he and his colleagues report that Oct4 and Sox2 were capable of converting neonatal foreskin fibroblasts into cells similar to Yamanaka's , whereas Nanog significantly boosted the frequency of reprogramming and Lin28 upped it by a moderate amount .
Although Oct4 and Sox2 were well - known players in embryonic cells , " we thought this would be such a complicated problem , we never tested those genes up front , " Thomson says .
" It 's kind of remarkably lucky that three or four [ genes ] are sufficient .
I was n't optimistic it would work . "
The new results still leave researchers with the task of double - checking that reprogrammed cells are safe and truly have the same potential as the embryonic variety .
They also have to figure out how to circumvent problems with the viral delivery system , which may disrupt important genes , resulting in cancer .
Kriegstein notes that the hunt will likely commence for small molecules capable of activating the key genes .
Thomson predicts that companies such as Madison - based Cellular Dynamics International , which he co-founded , that test drug candidates for dangerous heart toxicity , could begin using cells derived from reprogramming in their assays within a year .
Whatever the source of pluripotent cells , Thomson says , researchers face the same scientific challenges — namely , understanding how to convert them into key tissues such as the beta islet cells that are impaired in diabetics , and then how to introduce them safely and effectively into humans .
Opponents of research on human embryos might contend that reprogramming happened because of the federal restrictions on embryonic research , but Thomson believes the stigma on the field made researchers wary and delayed the discovery of reprogramming by several years .
" I 'm cautiously optimistic " about reprogrammed cells , he says .
" The worry is the politics will get involved again and squash caution . "

About the Book
( excerpts from my proposal for the book )
Anyone who has explored the history , technology , or theory of computers has likely encountered the concept of the Turing Machine .
The Turing Machine is an imaginary — not even quite hypothetical — computer invented in 1936 by English mathematician Alan Turing ( 1912 –1954 ) to help solve a question in mathematical logic .
As a byproduct , Turing also founded the field of computability theory — the study of the abilities and limitations of digital computers .
Although the concept of the Turing Machine is well known , Turing ’s original 1936 paper is only rarely read .
This neglect may have something to do with the paper ’s title —
“ On Computable Numbers , with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem ” — and perhaps the paper ’s extensive use of a scary German gothic font .
That ’s too bad , because the paper is not only a fascinating read but a milestone in the history of computing and 20th century intellectual thought in general .
This book presents Turing ’s original 36 - page paper ( and a follow - up 3 - page correction ) with background chapters and extensive annotations .
Mathematical papers like Turing ’s are often terse and cryptic .
I have elaborated on many of Turing ’s statements , clarified his discussions , and provided numerous examples .
Interwoven into the narrative are the highlights of Turing ’s own life : his years at Cambridge and Princeton , his secret work in cryptanalysis during World War II , his involvement in seminal computer projects , his speculations about artificial intelligence , his arrest and prosecution for the crime of “ gross indecency , ” and his early death by apparent suicide at the age of 41 .
The book is divided into four parts : Parts I and II together are about 200 pages in length and cover the first 60 % of Turing ’s paper , encompassing the Turing Machine and computability topics .
This part of the book is entirely self - contained and will be of primary interest to most readers .
Part III is a faster paced look at the remainder of Turing ’s paper , which involves the implications for mathematical logic .
Some readers might want to skip these chapters .
Part IV resumes the more " popular " presentation showing how the Turing Machine has become a vital tool in understanding the workings of human consciousness and the mechanisms of the universe .
Although I expect the primary readers of the book to be programmers , computer science majors , and other “ techies , ” I have tried my best to make the book accessible to the general reader .
There is unavoidably much mathematics in the book , but I have tried to assume that the reader only has knowledge of high - school mathematics , and probably a foggy one at that .
Tentative Table of Contents
Page numbers shown in bold refer to the pages of Turing 's original paper discussed in that chapter .
Part I. Foundations
Chapter 1 . This Tomb Holds Diophantus
In Ancient Alexandria an old man grieves for his dead son , and he consoles himself by writing a book of math problems and solutions .
Diophantus 's problems always have solutions , but many Diophantine problems do not .
How can we tell the difference , and what 's this thing infinity that gets in our way ?
Chapter 2 . The Irrational and the Transcendental
Georg Cantor explores infinity with surprising results .
Some infinities are more infinite than others .
This concept is to have profound influences on 20th century mathematics , and still makes people uneasy .
Chapter 3 . Centuries of Progress
A century before the Y2 K scare , David Hilbert asks whether a generalized procedure can be found to determine the solvability of Diophantine problems .
He later formulates the Entscheidungsproblem — the decision problem — which asks whether arbitrary well - formed formulas in 1st - order logic can be determined to be provable .
" Wir müssen wissen .
Wir warden wissen , " Hilbert says .
Good luck with that !
Part II .
Computable Numbers
Chapter 4 . The Education of Alan Turing
Alan Turing reads books , gets smart , goes to Cambridge , gets smarter , and decides to tackle the Entscheidungsproblem .
As a tool , he invents an imaginary computing machine .
Alas , Alonzo Church beat him to the proof , but Turing 's paper is published anyway .
[ Turing , 230 - 233 ]
Chapter 5 . Machines at Work
Turing ’s paper shows several examples of simple computing machines and several ways to notate what they do .
[ Turing , 233- 235 ]
Where is he going with this ?
Chapter 6 . Addition and Multiplication
While Turing goes to Princeton to earn his PhD in mathematics , Petzold takes a break from Turing ’s paper to present a more complex
Turing machine that calculates the square root of two .
Watch out !
Here there be hairy stuff !
Chapter 7 . Also Know as Subroutines
Turing next shows how certain common routines can be isolated and reused — a concept familiar to today ’s programmer as subroutines or functions .
Turing builds an arsenal of tools for a big project coming up in the paper .
[ Turing , 235 - 239 ]
Chapter 8 . Everything is a Number
Turing returns to England and reports to Bletchley Park in 1939 to help figure out Germany ’s Enigma code - making machine .
Turing ’s paper continues by showing how each computing machine can be represented by an integer .
Computing machines are infinite but enumerable .
[ Turing , 239 - 241 ]
Chapter 9 . The Universal Machine
Turing next shows how a computing machine could be made to read coded instructions and perform the job of any dedicated machine .
[ Paper , 241 - 246 ]
It ’s a general - purpose computer , although it takes many years for Turing ’s contribution to the principles of computers to be recognized .
Chapter 10 .
Computers and Computability
While exploring the concept of enumerability of computing machines , Turing ’s paper seems to uncover a paradox .
[ Turing , 246 - 248 ]
The resolution of this paradox leads to the most profound result of his paper :
You ca n’t design a computing machine to determine if other computing machines work correctly or not .
Chapter 11 .
Of Machines and Men
Turing explores the relationship between human and machine calculators [ Turing , 249 - 254 ] and later becomes interested in artificial intelligence .
He runs afoul of the law with serious consequences .
Part III .
Das Entscheidungsproblem
Chapter 12 . First - Order Logic
The remainder of Turing ’s paper requires a familiarity with first - order predicate logic .
This chapter provides the basics .
Chapter 13 .
Computability , Continued
Turing ’s paper continues by introducing imaginary machines that can solve problems in mathematical logic [ Turing , 254 - 258 ] and implement functions as well .
Chapter 14 .
The Major Proof
With the help of his previous demonstration , Turing shows that there can be no machine to determine the provability of arbitrary statements in first - order logic .
The Entscheidungsproblem has no solution .
[ Turing , 259 - 263 ]
Chapter 15 .
The Lambda Calculus
Alonzo Church used his λ-calculus for his paper about the Entscheidungsproblem .
Turing shows that the two methods are equivalent .
[ Turing , 263- 265 ]
Part IV .
And Beyond
Chapter 16 .
Consciousness , the Universe , and Turing Machines
With the Turing Machine as a springboard , biologists , cosmologists , and philosophers explore the depths of human consciousness and the very structure of the universe .
Chapter 17 .
Diophantus Awakes !
With the help of Turing Machines , Yuri Matiyasevich builds on the work of Julia Robinson , Martin Davis , and Hilary Putnum to show that there is no general process for determining the solvability of Diophantine equations .

The next thing in greener cars does n’t need hydrogen , lithium - ion batteries or even a power cord .
In fact , it ’s based on century - old technology that ’s been used on trucks since before World War II : the turbo .
Under pressure to reduce emissions and increase fuel - efficiency , automakers are quietly turning to turbocharging as a relatively cheap , easy - to - implement technology that could soon be a permanent staple on internal combustion engines .
That ’s because turbos , high - velocity fans that recirculate and compress exhaust gases back into the motor ’s cylinders , can increase fuel - efficiency by as much as 30 % while increasing power output .
Thanks to that increased power , smaller engines can be used , reducing weight and further increasing efficiency .
And because it ’s a proven technology , the research and development costs are enticingly low .
FOR THE RECORD :
Turbochargers :
An article in Business on Saturday about turbochargers described them as compressing exhaust gases back into an automobile motor ’s cylinders .
A turbocharger uses exhaust gases to drive a compressor that in turn delivers pressurized air into the engine intake .
“ There is n’t a dynamometer in Detroit that does n’t have a turbocharged engine being tested on it right now , ” says Eric Noble , president of Carlab , an automotive consultant in Orange .
“ There ’s still a lot of fuel savings that can be gotten out of a traditional engine . ”
Automakers are cagey about announcing how many cars will get the turbo boost , but General Motors executives say they are considering putting turbos on even their largest passenger vehicles .
Hyundai just announced its first turbocharged car -- the Genesis coupe -- for the U.S. market in a dozen years .
Volkswagen and Mercedes - Benz are preparing to hit the American market with new turbocharged diesels starting next year .
And last week at the L.A. Auto Show , Ford Chief Executive Alan Mulally announced a major initiative to begin putting turbochargers and a related technology -- direct fuel injection -- on a large portion of its fleet in the near future , calling the move a “ cornerstone of Ford ’s near - term plan . ”
The first Ford vehicle to get the boost will be the new Lincoln MKS , which will be introduced next spring with a standard engine but will go turbo by early 2009 .
The new engine will be smaller -- 3.5 liters versus 3.7 liters -- yet have better performance .
“ This is not something on the drawing board .
Turbos are here , ” said Adriane Brown , president and chief executive of Honeywell Transportation Systems , the leading turbo manufacturer , with $ 2.5 billion in turbo sales last year .
As turbos gain more acceptance , she expects sales to grow three times faster than the automotive segment in the next few years , or about 8 % .
Turbos are hardly new .
After finding a place on ships , locomotives and airplanes in the first half of the last century , they were adopted for passenger cars in the 1970s when BMW , Mercedes , Mitsubishi and even Buick bolted them on manifolds .
Despite popularity among car tuners , they quickly lost acceptance among the general population , which saw them as unreliable , expensive and , with their sudden bursts of acceleration , dangerous .
Older turbos delivered great amounts of torque , yet frequently there was a short time gap between stepping on the pedal and feeling the power .
That gap , called turbo lag , could cause unsuspecting drivers to crash .
New turbo technology has essentially eliminated that gap while providing variable boost depending on the engine velocity , turbo manufacturers say .
And turbos add only slightly to the cost of a car , they say , between $ 1,000 and $ 3,000 -- part of which can be offset by using a smaller engine .
And though some carmakers are just now embracing the technology ( and a very few still shun it ) , others have been pressing the turbo button for years .
GM ’s Saab , for example , has long used turbocharged engines and Subaru has had them in cars for 25 years , including four current models .
In Europe , turbocharger - equipped diesel engines are far and away the most common engine type , approaching 50 % market penetration .
Yet in the U.S. , said Honeywell ’s Brown , only 6 % of cars and truck are “ boosted . ”
That gap , experts say , is largely due to American tastes -- and prejudices .
Simply put , Americans want big , heavy motors , and they associate displacement ( the volume of air and gas drawn in by an engine ) with power .
Turbos , on the other hand , are seen as accouterments for tin-can sports cars and low - slung street rodders , hardly something useful for towing , say , or even lugging children to soccer practice .
The reality , however , is that turbochargers have been on heavy - duty trucks in the U.S. for years ; the Big Three automakers had 19 turbocharged diesel truck models in their 2007 lineups , according to edmunds.com .
“ The U.S. is probably the last market to look at the upsides of downsized turbo engines , ” said Mary Brevard , spokeswoman for supplier Borg Warner , which saw sales of its turbos increase 17 % last year , to $ 825 million .
“ Americans think bigger is better , but if they drive a turbo , they find out it ’s a [ powerful , high - performing ] car . ”
They may be finding out , whether they like it or not .
With government fuel consumption standards expected to rise significantly in the near future , many automakers see turbos as the cheapest and easiest short - term way to increase efficiency .
In July , a few months prior to revealing its experimental , 68 - mpg hydrogen fuel - cell car at the L.A. Auto Show , Honda unveiled a clean diesel with a turbocharger that gets 63 mpg .
Unlike the clean diesel , which could be on the market in no time , hydrogen cars cost as much as $ 1 million each and are at least a decade away , most experts say .
That kind of thinking is sinking in , even with the most conservative carmakers ; that ’s why analysts expect turbo penetration of the U.S. market to reach 15 % by 2012 .
“ We ’re looking at equipping very , very large cars with very small four - cylinder , turbocharged engines , ” GM Vice Chairman Bob Lutz said , mentioning the Cadillac DTS and the soon - to - be available Pontiac G8 , both of which have eight - cylinder motors .
The notion that a high - efficiency , carefully tuned four - cylinder could seamlessly replace the big - block monsters that have defined American roading for decades is practically blasphemy in some circles .
Yet for Jake Fisher , an engineer at Consumer Reports , it ’s an unavoidable step .
He describes being amazed driving a turbocharged BMW 535i , and even more so when he learned that it got three miles per gallon more than the nonturbo Infiniti M35 .
“ It has 300 horsepower and still gets 22 miles per gallon , ” he says .
“ That ’s what a turbo does . ”

DON'T LOSE THAT SNOOZE DON'T LOSE THAT SNOOZE The American Academy of Sleep Medicine , the National Sleep Foundation and other sleep experts offer these tips on getting a good night 's sleep : - Do not stay up late to talk on the phone or surf the Internet .
- Keep computers and TVs out of the bedroom .
- Stick with a regular bedtime .
- Avoid food or drinks with caffeine , especially at night .
Such stimulants can keep you awake .
- Do n't stay up all night to cram for a big work project or to finish homework if you 're in school .
- Avoid vigorous exercise within a few hours of bedtime .
ADULTS NEED LESS SLEEP -- UP TO A POINT ADULTS NEED LESS SLEEP -- UP TO A POINT Sleep needs vary , depending on age and other factors .
On average , here 's how many hours of sleep a night the experts recommend : - Preschoolers , 11 to 13 - School - age kids , 10 to 11 - Teens , 8 to 9 - Adults , 7 to 8 Source : The National Sleep Foundation " The ability to compensate for lost sleep is itself lost , which is damaging mentally and physically . "
- Fred Turek , sleep researcher , Northwestern University
You 've got a long list of e-mails to return , bills to pay and , oh , yeah , you do n't want to miss the latest episode of The Office .
By the time you crawl into bed , it 's nearly midnight .
The alarm goes off at 6 the next morning , and bingo !
You 've just joined the legions of Americans who are bleary - eyed and flat - out tired most days of the week .
For years , sleep researchers have been preaching the dangers of lost sleep : People who are fatigued can't pay attention to routine tasks , have trouble learning and are prone to a laundry list of health problems , from depression to high blood pressure .
New research suggests an added risk to losing sleep day after day : Humans and animals that have chronic sleep deprivation might reach a point at which the very ability to catch up on lost sleep is damaged , says Fred Turek , a sleep researcher at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill .
His research on sleep patterns in rats appeared this summer in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
That , together with findings from a human study , suggests people who lose sleep night after night might not recover the alertness they need to perform well during the day .
So far the studies do n't tell researchers whether the damage is permanent .
But they do suggest that people who go to work fatigued day after day might perform consistently at a subpar level .
" They may say , ' Hey , I 'm doing fine .
I do n't need more sleep , ' even as their performance on memory and attention tests goes down , " Turek says .
People who lose sleep because of a single all - nighter typically make up for it by boosting the amount of deep sleep they get the next night , says study co-author Aaron Laposky , also from Northwestern .
Deep sleep is thought to restore alertness and helps keep memory and other brain functions in top form .
People also make up for the occasional bout of insomnia by sleeping in on weekends , Laposky says .
But is that capacity lost when sleep deprivation becomes a fact of life ?
At Northwestern , researchers kept lab rats awake for 20 hours and then let them sleep for four hours .
After the first night , the rats recovered ; when they were allowed to sleep , the rats fell into a deep sleep more frequently than they did when well - rested .
But after three nights of sleep deprivation , the rats failed to show an increase in deep sleep .
And at the end of the five - day study , the animals were given a chance to sleep in , but the rats recovered almost none of the lost sleep .
" The ability to compensate for lost sleep is itself lost , which is damaging mentally and physically , " Turek says .
Sleep expert David Dinges says people seem to respond to a chronic lack of sleep the same way .
Dinges , a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia , and his colleagues studied 48 healthy people .
Some got eight hours of sleep a night while others stayed up , losing from two to four hours of sleep a night .
By the end of two weeks , the people who had lost sleep at night said they no longer felt tired during the day .
But test scores revealed a different story , according to the 2003 study published in the journal Sleep .
The sleep - deprived group had trouble paying attention , had slower reaction times and developed impairments in memory , Dinges says .
The ability to fend off sleep might have evolved to help animals and humans survive a natural disaster .
People forced to evacuate during a fire or hurricane often lose sleep for a short period , but they 're more likely to make it through a crisis alive , Turek says .
The trouble is humans have built a society that runs round the clock , Turek says .
Cellphones , laptops and other electronic devices make it easy to stay connected at all hours .
All - night TV and an extended workday also can rob sleep , says James Walsh , executive director of sleep medicine at St. Luke 's Hospital in St. Louis .
Surveys now show that most people in the USA get less than seven hours of sleep a night , about an hour less than the average sleep time 40 years ago .
No one really knows the full effect of the steady erosion of sleep time .
Only a study that keeps track of lots of sleepy humans for a long time would answer that question , Turek says .
But even if the damage can be reversed , there 's plenty of scientific evidence suggesting that sleep loss is bad for your health .
For example , fatigue might play a role in obesity .
And there 's no question that sleep loss plays a role in fatalities on the highway .
The National Sleep Foundation says drowsy driving is the likely cause of more than 100,000 car crashes each year in the USA .
For that reason alone , Dinges and other experts recommend getting seven to eight hours of sleep on most nights .
Losing just an hour night after night can lead to foggy thinking and slow reaction times .
" The deficits can become severe , " Dinges says .
People who put off bedtime to get more done might find it 's wiser to make their sleep a priority .
" You need to make sure sleep time is protected , " he says .

An absurdly large number could hold the key to universal mysteries .
This unimaginably large number keeps popping up in descriptions of the Universe .
The secret of the Universe is not 42 , according to a new theory , but the unimaginably larger number 10 122 .
Scott Funkhouser of the Military College of South Carolina ( called The Citadel ) in Charleston has shown how this number — which is bigger than the number of particles in the Universe — keeps popping up when several of the physical constants and parameters of the Universe are combined1 .
This ‘ coincidence ’ , he says , is surely significant , hinting at some common principle at work behind the scenes .
The number first turned up when , more than a decade ago , physicists discovered that the expanding Universe is accelerating .
This implies that there is a force that opposes gravity on very large scales , which physicists call dark energy .
It is quantified by a parameter called the cosmological constant .
One interpretation of dark energy is that it results from the energy of empty space , called vacuum energy .
The laws of quantum physics imply that empty space is not empty at all , but filled with particles popping in and out of existence .
This particle ‘ fizz ’ should push objects apart , just as dark energy seems to require .
But the theoretical value of this energy is immense — so huge that it should blow atoms apart , rather than just causing the Universe to accelerate .
Physicists think that some unknown force nearly perfectly cancels out the vacuum energy , leaving only the amount seen as dark energy to push things apart .
This cancellation is imperfect to an absurdly fine margin : the unknwon ' energy ' differs from the vacuum energy by just one part in 10 122 .
It seems incredible that any physical mechanism could be so finely poised as to reduce the vacuum energy to within a whisker of zero , but it seems to be so .
Five more times
Now Funkhouser says that this is not the only appearance of this vast number among the parameters of the Universe .
He lists five other instances in which the ratios between various cosmic quantities turn out to be equal to 10 122 , give or take a factor of ten ( which matters very little at such huge scales , and could be due to errors in our understanding of the numbers involved ) .
For example , the ratio of the mass of the observable Universe to that of the smallest possible ‘ quantum ’ of mass is about 6x10 121 .
And the number of ways in which the particles of the current Universe can be arranged throughout space ( a measure of entropy ) is 2.5x10 122 .
This is n’t just numerological number juggling .
“ If you take the basic parameters of the Universe there are only so many ways you can put them together to make ‘ pure numbers ’ with no units , ” Funkhouser says — and less still ones that have any obvious physical interpretation .
So the fact that even a handful of these give ratios that are so huge and yet so similar seems significant .
“ It is unlikely for chance alone to be responsible for generating so many pure numbers from just several fundamental parameters , ” says Funkhouser .
Logic behind the scenes
“ For the same basic set of parameters to produce two large - number coincidence problems is essentially preposterous .
Scott Funkhouser ”
A similar ‘ large - number coincidence ’ was noted in the 1930s by the astronomer Arthur Eddington and the physicist Paul Dirac .
They saw that several other combinations , such as the ratio of the electrostatic attraction between an electron and a proton to the gravitational attraction , are equal to about 10 40 .
Like Dirac , Funkhouser thinks that these large - number coincidences can’t be accidental .
All the instances of 10 122 , he argues , must stem from the same basic reason .
It ’s rather like noticing that the recurrence of spring and neap tides coincides with the phases of the Moon : both are due to the motions of the Moon and Earth .
At the root of the issue , Funkhouser says , is the fact that the current density of matter in the Universe is about the same as the observed vacuum energy density — a puzzling fact that he calls the ‘ cosmic coincidence ’ .
The vacuum energy density is thought to be constant , but the mass density changes as the Universe expands .
Why they happen to be equal right now — a balance that helps us to detect dark energy amidst matter — is not known .
Some have suggested explanations based on the anthropic principle : basically , it ’s only under these conditions that life becomes possible , so if things were otherwise , we would n’t be here to see it .
Given this single coincidence , Funkhouser shows , all the 10 122 ratios inevitably follow from the standard laws of physics and cosmology .
“ The major parameters of the Universe are the cosmological constant and the total mass and radius , ” he says .
“ Due to the cosmic coincidence , they are related . ”
He has shown previously that similar reasoning accounts for the Eddington - Dirac large - number coincidence2 .
Too many coincidences
The existence of two large - number coincidences ( 10 40 and 10 122 ) now presents a puzzle in itself .
“ It is remarkable enough that the parameters of nature should somehow produce one large - number coincidence , ” says Funkhouser .
“ For the same basic set of parameters to produce two large - number coincidence problems is essentially preposterous — unless the two problems are related . ”
But how ?
Funkhouser notes that 10 122 is about equal to the cube of 10 40 .
Is there some reason why the two sets of large numbers should be linked in that way ?
It would follow , Funkhouser says , if there happens to be a certain mathematical relationship linking the mass of a nucleon ( a proton or neutron ) with the speed of light , the gravitational constant , Planck ’s constant and the cosmological constant .
That sounds pretty exotic , but in fact such a link was proposed in 1967 by the Russian physicist Yakov Zel ’ dovich based on an entirely separate argument .
And he ’s not the only one to suggest this .
“ The interesting thing is that the relationship has been proposed before by several different authors , each with a different explanation , ” says Funkhouser .
And in a separate paper3 , he ’s come up with yet another justification for it .
“ I have shown that a simple model for the origin of our Universe involving ten spatial dimensions leads naturally to this relation , ” he says .
It follows if seven of the dimensions shrank while the other three “ puffed out ” to form the reality we observe today .

Mice appeared immune to cancer
The new breed , created with a more active " Par - 4 " gene , did not develop tumours , and even lived longer , said the journal Cancer Research .
University of Kentucky researchers said a human cancer treatment was possible .
Cancer Research UK said that more research would be needed to prove it did n't just work in mice .
We are thinking of this as a holistic approach that not only would get rid of the tumour , but not harm the organism as a whole
Dr Vivek Rangnekar
University of Kentucky
Par - 4 was originally discovered in the early 1990s working inside human prostate cancers , and is believed to have a role in " programmed cell death " , the body 's own system for rooting out and destroying damaged or faulty cells .
The Kentucky team used an existing mouse breed known to be more vulnerable to cancers to test whether Par - 4 could be used to fight them .
They introduced the gene to mouse eggs , and it was active in both the resulting pups - and their own offspring .
The mice with active Par - 4 did not develop cancers , and lived slightly longer than those without the gene .
Dr Vivek Rangnekar , who led the research , said that the gene offered a potential way , unlike most other cancer treatments , of destroying cancer cells without harming normal cells .
" When a cancer patient goes to the clinic , they undergo chemotherapy or radiation and there are potential side effects associated with these treatments .
" We are thinking of this as a holistic approach that not only would get rid of the tumour , but not harm the organism as a whole . "
Early stages
He said that much more research would be needed , however , before a human treatment could be launched .
A spokesman for Cancer Research UK said : " Although at an early stage , research like this allows us to understand more about the faulty genes involved in cancer and throws open new avenues to explore for cancer treatment .
" It 's important to remember that this work has only been done using genetically engineered mice , and more research is needed before we 'll know if it can be translated to humans . "
DES MOINES  Mike Huckabee used the volatile situation in Pakistan Friday to make an argument for building a fence on the American border with Mexico and found himself trying to explain a series of remarks about Pakistanis and their nation .
On Thursday night he told reporters in Orlando , Fla . :
“ We ought to have an immediate , very clear monitoring of our borders and particularly to make sure if there ’s any unusual activity of Pakistanis coming into the country . ”
On Friday , in Pella , Iowa , he expanded on those remarks .
“ When I say single them out I am making the observation that we have more Pakistani illegals coming across our border than all other nationalities except those immediately south of the border , ” he told reporters in Pella .
“ And in light of what is happening in Pakistan it ought to give us pause as to why are so many illegals coming across these borders . ”
In fact , far more illegal immigrants come from the Philippines , Korea , China and Vietnam , according to recent estimates from the Department of Homeland Security .

For some reason , DRY and " type less " seem to have become equivalent to many in the the Ruby community .
I believe that the essence of DRY is when an application change is localized to one area of the codebase .
While DRY is important , it 's no more important than maintainability and readability .
Therefore , if logic is stored in one and only one location , but that location cannot be found or understood , you 've traded maintainability and as a result have gained nothing .
But , I 've grown tired of this debate .
No one ever wins , instead people just get tired of listening so they stop interacting .
If you want to define methods of a module in a loop that later gets included in 3 classes that have nothing else in common , you have the right to do that .
In fact , I 'm excited about helping you .
Here 's how DRY your code could be .
That 's some DRY code , perhaps even Extremely DRY ( EDRY ) .
Code is n't any good unless it runs .
It runs without problem .
Dying for the implementation ?
No worries , here it is .
Of course , any EDRY code will be write only .
It would be painful to try to actually read code written in this way , but that 's already true of the 150 modules that each contain only one method definition .
The difference is generally it 's not immediately obvious when you first look at a codebase that has been DRYed up for the sake of keystroke savings .
If the implementer instead chose to utilize EDRY , I 'd know what I was getting into from the first file opened .

With a writers strike set to be announced Friday , the question looming over digital Hollywood is : Can the Web become the cable of 2007 ?
The answer might be as murky as the politics of the strike itself .
Creators may be drawn to the Web as other avenues are sealed off .
While strike rules at the moment seem to limit writers ’ latitude , some television veterans are calling for a rethinking of writers ’ relationships with online platforms .
“ There is an opportunity , if there is a protracted strike , to create channels of development on the Internet that are outside the big companies , and I wonder if the guilds are thinking about that , ” said Marshall Herskovitz , the veteran TV creator behind “ Quarterlife , ” the television - style drama that will air exclusively online .
In a prolonged stoppage , new - media experts say , viewers certainly will be looking for alternative platforms , and initial traffic numbers could be expected to spike .
Such sites as Revver , DailyMotion , GoFish and My Damn Channel could become the TNTs and HBOs of today -- unknown before the 22 - week walkout in 1988 , a part of life after it .
“ Viewers have already been watching on the Web , writers are writing for the Web , and networks are looking for programming on the Web , ” said an executive at one online - content site .
“ The strike will speed all of that up . ”
As NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker warned this week , a strike could be a “ watershed event ” that “ drives more people away from primetime . ”
But to keep those viewers , Web sites will have to offer content that consumers feel improves on the reruns and low - cost programming on the air .
And that might be the tricky part .
Online content sites and the agents who sell to them are seeking to stake out a delicate strike position .
They hope to capitalize on the immense opportunities the strike offers .
But they also want to preserve relationships that could be more critical in the long term ; if agents and sites are seen as too aggressive , they could jeopardize their standing with the WGA -- and future deals along with it .
That means a conservatism when it comes to signing new deals .
The latest strike rules from the WGA make clear that the guild will consider writing for Web sites a violation of strike rules .
Members who do so could be penalized , and those who are n’t yet members could be prevented from ever joining the guild .
Still , there may be more wiggle room than those rules indicate .
The WGA reportedly has told some members which Web sites are considered signatory companies and which ones are n’t , potentially loosening the work rules for the latter firms .
And it ’s an open question whether the WGA ’s restrictions are posturing or policy .
“ The purpose of the rules is different for the two weeks leading up to a strike than it might be three months into a strike , ” Herskovitz said .
“ All along the guilds have been a bit overwhelmed by Internet production and at the same time winking at it because it ’s too small and too invisible to be worth policing . ”
The real fear for the WGA may not be that writers pen material for the Internet -- it ’s that such material will find its way onto network airwaves .
So far , the WGA restrictions have n’t stopped some sites from mapping out a plan to seek out creators .
“ We think the strike will give us many more opportunities to sign new talent in the coming weeks and months , ” said Rob Barnett , the former MTV executive who now runs original - content site My Damn Channel , which features series from “ The Ten ” director David Wain and “ The Simpsons ” veteran Harry Shearer .
“ The dark times for old media are definitely good times for new media . ”
And unlike a more binary split on television , the Web is home to content that crosses genres , which might leave room for many creators .
“ This is much grayer than the rules on television , ” one agent said .
“ If I ’m a man on the street asking funny questions and getting goofy responses , is that considered written or not ? ”
Agents said younger writers who are hungry to work have been talking to them about finding work on the sites , WGA rules be damned .
Revver ’s Angela Gyetvan said that the site “ welcomes an increase ” of viewers and creators if a strike takes hold .
But she expressed concerns that the rules could tie the site ’s hands as much as it did the networks .
The original content sites connected to networks -- notably Viacom new - media properties such as AtomFilms and News Corp . ’s MySpace -- find themselves in a double bind :
Not only do they have the relationships to manage , but they also need to fight the perception that they ’re simply extensions of the same networks showing recycled content .
Agents expressed hope that the WGA will loosen some rules , both to win goodwill for members and encourage the alternative platforms to increase their leverage in contract negotiations with the studios .
If they do , the Web might become the cable of the future ; if they resist , Web content might look no better or more appealing than the cable networks of yesterday -- or today .

Stanislav Petrov died on May 19 , 2017 , in Fryazino , Russia
More about the 1983 incident :
Stanislav Petrov Honored at the United Nations
Stanislav Petrov was honored in a meeting at the United Nations in New York City Jan. 19 , 2006 , which he described as his happiest day in many years .
At the United Nations meeting , The Association of World Citizens , an international peace organization with branches in 30 countries , presented Stanislav Petrov with a special World Citizen Award .
This is the second such award he has received from that organization ( both awards are described further down on this page ) .
The following day Stanislav Petrov met with renowned American journalist Walter Cronkite at his CBS office in New York City .
That interview , in addition to other highlights of Stanislav Petrov ’s trip to the United States , were filmed for The Man Who Saved the World , a documentary film by the Danish motion picture company Statement Film .
The film premiered Oct. 17 , 2014 , at the Woodstock Film Festival in Woodstock , New York .
In addition to Stanislav Petrov and Walter Cronkite , The Man Who Saved the World features Kevin Costner , Ashton Kutcher , Matt Damon and Robert De Niro .
This is a trailer for the film :
During his travels for The Man Who Saved the World , Stanislav Petrov was accompanied by his interpreter ,  Galina . 
In the film , translator Alexandra Khaimenova interviews Stanislav Petrov .
Altogether Stanislav Petrov was in the United States Jan. 14 - 28 , 2006 , participating in many meetings and interviews .
Stanislav Petrov revisited the United States in the spring of 2007 , traveling to New York , to missile silos in South Dakota , to Las Vegas and the Nevada Test Site , and to San Francisco ( all part of filming for the documentary The Man Who Saved the World ) .

Democrats do n’t come much more traditional than Teddy Kennedy , the grand man of the Democratic Party .
So his endorsement of Barack Obama–implicitly an anti-endorsement of Hillary Clinton –has punch .
Endorsements routinely do n’t matter much in presidential campaigns –with a few exceptions .
A politician who controls a machine–say , a governor–can come in quite handy on Election Day .
In this case , Kennedy brings two piping hot dishes to the Obama potluck .
By awarding him the Kennedy Seal of Approval –with Caroline Kennedy ( daughter of John ) and Representative Patrick Kennedy ( son of Ted ) chiming in–Kennedy makes it official : Obama is the Next Generation leader of the Democratic Party and , in that role , has a lock on the vision thing .
And by pledging to campaign arduously for Obama in the coming days , Kennedy will be assisting Obama ’s efforts to reach out to traditional Democratic voters : working - class Dems .
Clinton has been faring better among that core demographic chunk of the Democratic electorate .
Kennedy is no white knight who will rescue Obama on this front .
But if Kennedy pulls a few votes here and there , it could be significant–only if Obama on his own can close the gap between him and Clinton on blue - collar Democrats and Latinos .
It is too late for any candidate–or any set of endorsements –to change the fundamentals of the presidential race in time for Supersaturated Tuesday on February 5 .
And Ted Kennedy on the campaign trail is no match for Hillary Clinton ’s hit man : her husband .
Yet any bit of Kennedy magic dust the Massachusetts senator sprinkles for Obama can only help .
Kennedy ’s endorsement speech–held before an enthusiastic crowd at an auditorium at American University –was a roar .
He noted that Clinton and John Edwards were fine people and his friends .
“ But I believe , ” he said , “ there is one candidate who has extraordinary gifts of leadership and character , matched to the extraordinary demands of this moment in history . ”
He completely adopted Obama ’s own arguments : “ He is a leader who sees the world clearly without being cynical .
He is a fighter who cares passionately about the causes he believes in , without demonizing those who hold a different view . ”
That last line , an echo of a remark Obama made on Saturday night after winning the South Carolina primary , was a dig at the Clinton camp .
Other digs followed : “ We know the true record of Barack Obama .
There is the courage he showed when so many others were silent or simply went along .
From the beginning , he opposed the war in Iraq .
And let no one deny that truth . ”
The Clinton crew has been trying to undermine Obama ’s natural advantage on the war .
( He opposed voting for it : she did not . )
Kennedy was calling them out on this matter and essentially telling them to shut up .
And then Kennedy passed the torch :
With Barack Obama , there is a new national leader who has given America a different kind of campaign–a campaign not just about himself , but about all of us .
A campaign about the country we will become , if we can rise above the old politics that parses us into separate groups and puts us at odds with one another .
I remember another such time , in the 1960s , when I came to the Senate at the age of 30 .
We had a new president who inspired the nation , especially the young , to seek a new frontier .
Those inspired young people marched , sat in at lunch counters , protested the war in Vietnam and served honorably in that war even when they opposed it .
Obama can be the new Kennedy – John or Robert , take your pick .
Who says so ?
Their brother .
Such rhetoric might be easily dismissed by the cynical , but it is heady stuff .
And Kennedy probably did not make the decision to anoint Obama in this manner lightly .
He compared Obama to Clinton and found one inspiring , the other merely commendable .
“ What counts in our leadership , ” Kennedy thundered , “ is not the length of years in Washington , but the reach of our vision , the strength of our beliefs , and that rare quality of mind and spirit that can call forth the best in our country and our people .
With Barack Obama , we will turn the page on the old politics of misrepresentation and distortion . ”
Kennedy ’s red - hot endorsement can be read as something of a pushback to the Clinton gang ’s assault on the junior senator from Illinois .
“ Let us reject the counsels of doubt and calculation , ” Kennedy said loudly before the American University crowd .
Whose doubt and calculation ?
The Clintons ’ , of course .
And he was not indirect :
There was another time , when another young candidate was running for President and challenging America to cross a New Frontier .
He faced public criticism from the preceding Democratic President , who was widely respected in the party .
Harry Truman said we needed “ someone with greater experience ” — and added : “ May I urge you to be patient . ”
And John Kennedy replied : “ The world is changing .
The old ways will not do …
It is time for a new generation of leadership . ”
So it is with Barack Obama .
In other words , take that Bill Clinton !
Truman was wrong about JFK , and you ’re wrong about BHO .
Kennedy did not step over any line in his speech .
But while handing the family crown to a new prince , he was chastising the old king –perhaps warning the Clinton bunch it ought not go too far .
Kennedy , the old liberal lion , might not be able to hand - deliver many votes to Obama .
But he can bellow on his behalf and provide a countervailing force to the former president , who has emerged as Obama ’s detractor - in - chief .
Kennedy and his son and niece have bolstered Obama ’s narrative of change and vision .
The question is whether Obama has sufficient time to put this anointment to full use .
Switching from one search engine to another is simple , right ?
Well , I thought I ’d try a couple new options , but it was difficult .
I had to consciously remind myself that I was going to use new ( for me ) search engines .
If I did n’t think about it , Google is always where I ended up .
First on the list , the other two of the big three : Yahoo and Microsoft / MSN / Live ( come on , Microsoft , I still do n’t know what you want to be called here ) .
Honestly , I could find no compelling reason to switch .
Both of them look very much like Google in design , layout , and even color scheme .
The results are practically the same , and all three sites often throw in a few pictures at the top of the results for whatever it is you ’re searching ( if showing you pictures seems relevant ) .
If I had been using Yahoo the past few years , then maybe I ’d have a hard time switching to Google .
The point is , they all seem noticeably similar ; I ’m just used to Google .
Next up : Ask .
This is the search engine I have been impressed with as of late .
It has a nice , slick look and presents information in a time - saving fashion .
Ask gives up most of the valuable advertising real estate on the right side of the screen to bring you a snapshot of generally useful information .
So you have your standard search results on the left and a column on the right with information organized in boxes that often include pictures , videos , dictionary definition , Wikipedia entry , current news , etc .
One quick scan of the screen , and I often learn more about whatever I ’m searching for than had I left the site by clicking on a result .
Speaking of leaving the site , Ask has the binocular feature which allows you to hover over a link and see a preview of the site without clicking through .
And just yesterday , Ask announced new “ unmatched ” privacy control features that seem promising .
All in all , I can safely say Ask is a real contender to Google for my search needs .
But the problem ?
I ’m hooked on Gmail , Google Maps , and Google Reader .
Ask competes in some of these areas but not quite in the same marvelous way it appears to be competing in search .
Bottom line : I think I actually prefer
Ask now but am still likely to use Google just because it ’s where I am for other services .
But that ’s exactly what Google wants : users happy enough with all the superior freebies that we stay content with the plain - Jane search .
I think I ’ll start using what I think is better … if only I remember !

If you have two methods in subclasses that perform similar steps in the same order , yet the steps are different , get the steps into methods with the same signature , so that the original methods become the same .

5. RickRoll'D :
The sad thing about the internet is that for so long , it lacked the equivalent of that thing where you point to a spot on someone 's shirt and when they look down , you flick their nose .
But thanks to the magic of YouTube and the power of Rick Astley 's " Never Gonna Give You Up , " that omission has been corrected .
It 's pretty simple : Just go on a discussion board and create a link that says something like " Lindsay Lohan Nipple Slip ! " or " New Iron Man Trailer ! " or even " Ivory - Billed Woodpecker Sighting ! " ( if you hang out with a bunch of ornithologists ) .
But when they excitedly click through : Rick Astley !
It 's not side - splittingly hilarious ; it 's not knee - slappingly hilarious ; it 's more back - clickingly hilarious .
Casey Aldridge hit the spotlight as Jamie Lynn revealed he is the daddy of her unborn child .
But according to a report , Casey Aldridge is n’t the father of Jamie Lynn ’s baby .
The real baby daddy is some older executive at her TV show “ Zoey 101 . ”
The report indicates , “ Casey is being paid off to be the family ’s fall guy while the real father remains unidentified .
The man many suspect is the father , however , would face charges and probably prison time if he were to come forward and admit he had sex with her . ”
One source revealed , “ Jamie Lynn has been working on Zoey since she was 13 .
In Hollywood , little girls grow up fast , and she is no exception . ”
Another family source added , “ Some of us have doubts as to the legitimacy of the claim that Casey is the father .
When news first broke of Jamie Lynn ’s pregnancy , initial reports suggested that the couple had broken up over the summer .

An experimental helmet which scientists say could reverse the symptoms of Alzheimer 's disease within weeks of being used is to be tried out on patients .
The strange - looking headgear - which has to be worn for ten minutes every day - bathes the brain with infra-red light and stimulates the growth of brain cells .
Its creators believe it could reverse the symptoms of dementia - such as memory loss and anxiety - after only four weeks .
Alzheimer 's disease charities last night described the treatment as " potentially life - changing " - but stressed that the research was still at the very early stages .
Scroll down for more ...
Around 700,000 Britons have dementia , with around 500,000 suffering from Alzheimer 's disease .
The helmet is the creation of Dr Gordon Dougal , a director of Virulite , a medical research company based in County Durham .
It follows a study at the University of Sunderland which found infra-red light can reverse memory loss in mice .
Dr Dougal claims that only ten minutes under the hat a day is enough to have an effect .
" Currently all you can do with dementia is to slow down the rate of decay - this new process will not only stop that rate of decay but partially reverse it , " he said .
Low level infra-red red is thought to stimulate the growth of cells of all types of tissue and encourage their repair .
It is able to penetrate the skin and even get through the skull .
" The implications of this research at Sunderland are enormous - so much so that in the future we could be able to affect and change the rate at which our bodies age , " he said .
" We age because our cells lose the desire to regenerate and repair themselves .
This ultimately results in cell death and decline of the organ functions - for the brain resulting in memory decay and deterioration in general intellectual performance .
" But what if there was a technology that told the cells to repair themselves and that technology was something as simple as a specific wavelength of light ? "
The study at Sunderland found that exposing middle - aged mice to infrared light for six minutes a day for ten days improved their performance in a three - dimensional maze .
In the human trials , due to start this summer , the scientists will use levels of infra-red that occur naturally in sunlight .
Neuroscientist Paul Chazot , who helped carry out the research , said : " The results are completely new - this has never been looked at before . "
An Alzheimer 's Society spokesman said : " A treatment that reverses the effects of dementia rather than just temporarily halting its symptoms could change the lives of the hundreds of thousands of people .
We look forward to further research to determine whether this technique could help improve cognition in humans . "
NASA will land shuttle before satellite shoot down
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : February 15 , 2008
The shuttle Atlantis is scheduled to land Wednesday at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida but NASA officials said today they will staff the agency 's backup landing site in California to get the shuttle down as soon as possible and " give the military the biggest possible window " for destroying a falling satellite .
Pentagon planners are fine tuning plans to fire a missile from a Navy cruiser in the Pacific Ocean in a bid to break up the crippled NROL - 21 satellite , which malfunctioned shortly after launch in December 2006 .
The out - of - control satellite has been slowly descending ever since and barring intervention , it is expected to plunge back into the thick lower atmosphere early next month .
Because the satellite failed so soon after launch , it is carrying a virtually full load of now - frozen hydrazine rocket fuel , a good portion of which could be expected to reach the ground after a normal atmospheric breakup .
The Pentagon announced plans Thursday to fire a missile at the spacecraft in an attempt to break it apart and disperse the toxic fuel before it can pose a threat .
Marine Gen. James Cartwright , vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said Thursday the unprecedented intercept would not be attempted until after Atlantis returns to Earth on Wednesday to minimize the risk of debris that might pose a threat to the orbiter .
Normally , NASA would not staff its backup landing site at Edwards Air Force Base , Calif. , for the shuttle 's first landing attempt .
If the weather or some other problem prevented a Florida landing , the crew would simply remain in orbit another 24 hours and try again the next day .
In that case , Edwards would be an option .
But space station Flight Director Sally Davis today read a prepared statement during an afternoon briefing saying Edwards will be staffed for the first landing attempt Wednesday .
" The shuttle is scheduled to land on Feb. 20 , " she said .
" We 're going to open up Dryden ( Flight Research Center ) at Edwards Air Force Base to ensure we land at the earliest opportunity .
The reason is to give the military the biggest possible window and maximum flexibility to ensure the success of the satellite intercept . "
It typically costs nearly $ 2 million to service a shuttle at Edwards and ferry it back to the Kennedy Space Center atop a 747 jumbo jet .
It also adds a week or more to the time necessary to prepare a shuttle for its next flight .
But NASA managers are hopeful it wo n't come to that .
The preliminary long - range forecast for Wednesday calls for acceptable conditions in Florida and the crew will have two shots at Kennedy on successive orbits before any diversion to Edwards .
NASA 's second alternate landing site near White Sands , N.M. , will not be staffed .
Atlantis , currently docked to the international space station , is in a roughly circular orbit at an altitude of about 210 miles .
Pentagon planners want to hit the falling satellite at an altitude of about 160 miles .
Depending on the timing of the shot and the relative positions of the spacecraft , the shuttle could interfere with those plans or be exposed to potentially dangerous debris if the ship was still in orbit .
A landing Wednesday would take the shuttle out of the equation and give military planners a longer window to deal with the errant satellite .
The space station , NASA officials say , is not in any danger .
While a successful strike would create a cloud of debris , including some that might reach or exceed the station 's altitude , most of it would quickly re-enter and burn up .
" We 've analyzed it and it has negligible additional risk to the space station , " said Kirk Shireman , deputy space station program manager at the Johnson Space Center in Houston .
" So we 're not concerned at all about any risk to the space station and at this point in time have no plans to do any operations in conjunction with that activity . "
Focus on Hallucinogens :
This is a little gem I 've held onto since my friends Ken and Glen mailed it to me as part of a care package when I was working in Alaska after high school .
It 's from 1991 and out of print but still in near - perfect condition .
I wrote children 's science books for two years but never wrote one as fun or useful as this .
It explains to 9 - year - olds everything from neurons to shamans .
Rad !
It 's basically a My First Reader version of D.M. Turner 's The Essential Psychedelic Guide , minus the special section on how much ketamine to inject when you 're on DMT and nitrous .
The prose is lucid , but the pictures crack me up .
Take the cover .
Look kids , in a drug free zone , you can do all kinds of things , like play tic - tac - toe .
Or watch people play tic - tac - toe .
And remember , friends do n't let friends wear non -footie pants .
In some cases the book might be counterproductive : " Have you ever looked at yourself in an amusement park mirror ?
Look what happened to you !
Now , try to imagine that the whole world looked that way to you . "
Awesome !
Where can I get some ?
The best pictures are in the chapter on LSD .
The text above this one reminds me of an Ali G interview with a drug expert :
Ali G :
And what is its effects ?
Guy :
You can go paranoid , which means you think people or things are coming at you .
It makes your heart race .
Your blood pressure can go low , so you can feel a bit woozy sometimes .
It ’s got a lot of medical effects on the body .
Ali G :
And is there any negative effects ?
Ali G :
Which is the type of acid that actually make you fly ?
Guy :
No acid makes you fly .
Acid can make you think you fly .
Ali G :
But ai n't there one , cause me mate Dave said that he took this type , and he flew all around the room and then his mum told him to get some ciggies from the shop , and he actually flew there and flew back and was back in like five seconds or whatever , but he 'd forgotten to buy ciggies .
This picture just makes me wonder what 's wrong with this dude 's friends .
I mean , he 's obviously flipping out about something , and they 're just standing there waving at him with those shit - eating grins .
Seriously kids , that is your brain on tic - tac - toe .
Assuming that it ’ll be a while before most browsers attempt to implement most of HTML 5 ( a perfectly reasonable assumption ) we need to start thinking of ways to tackle the creation and rendering of HTML 5 components in the meantime .
Obviously , using the tools of JavaScript and CSS we can accomplish a lot .
However , there is one notch in our weapon : Internet Explorer does n’t know how to render CSS on elements that it does n’t recognize .
For example , the following “ blah ” element ( a fictional element ) does n’t have any styling :
< html > < head > < style > blah { color : red ; }</style > </head > < body > < blah >
Hello!</blah > </ body > </html >
Result :
Thankfully , Sjoerd Visscher mentioned an interesting technique that could be used to force IE to use the specified CSS styling .
Specifically , once you create a new DOM element ( of the same name as the one in the document ) all styling is applied .
You do n’t even have to inject the element in order for this to occur .
Observe the following :
< html > < head > < style > blah { color : red ; }</style > < script>document.createElement ( " blah " ) </ script > </ head > < body > < blah >
Hello!</blah > </ body > </html >
Result :
This is very important .
This now means that we can provide CSS styling for undefined HTML 5 element and allow Internet Explorer to handle it gracefully .
< figure / > element
Let ’s take a look at a simple example .
Pretending that we wanted to set about implementing the HTML 5 figure element .
The element is quite simple , only requiring some basic CSS markup ( I ’m not completely sure how a figure is supposed to look so I took some liberties here ) .
< html > < head > < style > figure { border : 1 px inset # AAA ; padding : 4 px ; } </style > < script>document.createElement ( " figure " ) ;</ script > </ head > < body > < figure > < img src= " https://johnresig.com/files/jeresig-wordpress-sm.jpg " /> </ figure > </ body > </html >
Result :
Using some basic CSS , and a single JavaScript DOM statement , we ’ve now implemented at least part of the HTML 5 spec .
While it wo n’t solve everything , it is a promising technique , at the very least .
I did have some issues when I was testing this technique , especially with the styling of elements that are already defined elsewhere in the structure .
For example , let ’s say you wanted to implement the legend child element of a caption .
This ends up being really hard since the functionality and styling of legends are already defined for fieldsets by Internet Explorer .
In my simple tests they became unstylable outside the context of a fieldset .
This is definitely a decent start , building our HTML 5 shiv , but it needs some more work and much more exploration .
I hope to see this continued in the upcoming months as interest in , and availability of , HTML 5 begins to heat up .
It has long been known that dyslexics are drawn to running their own businesses , where they can get around their weaknesses in reading and writing and play on their strengths .
But a new study of entrepreneurs in the United States suggests that dyslexia is much more common among small - business owners than even the experts had thought .
The report , compiled by Julie Logan , a professor of entrepreneurship at the Cass Business School in London , found that more than a third of the entrepreneurs she had surveyed  35 percent  identified themselves as dyslexic .
The study also concluded that dyslexics were more likely than nondyslexics to delegate authority , to excel in oral communication and problem solving and were twice as likely to own two or more businesses .
“ We found that dyslexics who succeed had overcome an awful lot in their lives by developing compensatory skills , ” Professor Logan said in an interview .
“ If you tell your friends and acquaintances that you plan to start a business , you ’ll hear over and over , ‘ It wo n’t work .
It ca n’t be done . ’
But dyslexics are extraordinarily creative about maneuvering their way around problems . ”
The study was based on a survey of 139 business owners in a wide range of fields across the United States .
Professor Logan called the number who said they were dyslexic “ staggering , ” and said it was significantly higher than the 20 percent of British entrepreneurs who said they were dyslexic in a poll she conducted in 2001 .
February 2008
A user on Hacker News recently posted a comment that set me thinking : Something about hacker culture that never really set well with me was this — the nastiness .
... I just do n't understand why people troll like they do .
I 've thought a lot over the last couple years about the problem of trolls .
It 's an old one , as old as forums , but we 're still just learning what the causes are and how to address them .
There are two senses of the word " troll . "
In the original sense it meant someone , usually an outsider , who deliberately stirred up fights in a forum by saying controversial things .
[ 1 ]
For example , someone who did n't use a certain programming language might go to a forum for users of that language and make disparaging remarks about it , then sit back and watch as people rose to the bait .
This sort of trolling was in the nature of a practical joke , like letting a bat loose in a room full of people .
The definition then spread to people who behaved like assholes in forums , whether intentionally or not .
Now when people talk about trolls they usually mean this broader sense of the word .
Though in a sense this is historically inaccurate , it is in other ways more accurate , because when someone is being an asshole it 's usually uncertain even in their own mind how much is deliberate .
That is arguably one of the defining qualities of an asshole .
I think trolling in the broader sense has four causes .
The most important is distance .
People will say things in anonymous forums that they 'd never dare say to someone 's face , just as they 'll do things in cars that they 'd never do as pedestrians — like tailgate people , or honk at them , or cut them off .
Trolling tends to be particularly bad in forums related to computers , and I think that 's due to the kind of people you find there .
Most of them ( myself included ) are more comfortable dealing with abstract ideas than with people .
Hackers can be abrupt even in person .
Put them on an anonymous forum , and the problem gets worse .
The third cause of trolling is incompetence .
If you disagree with something , it 's easier to say " you suck " than to figure out and explain exactly what you disagree with .
You 're also safe that way from refutation .
In this respect trolling is a lot like graffiti .
Graffiti happens at the intersection of ambition and incompetence : people want to make their mark on the world , but have no other way to do it than literally making a mark on the world . [ 2 ]
The final contributing factor is the culture of the forum .
Trolls are like children ( many are children ) in that they 're capable of a wide range of behavior depending on what they think will be tolerated .
In a place where rudeness is n't tolerated , most can be polite .
But vice versa as well .
There 's a sort of Gresham 's Law of trolls : trolls are willing to use a forum with a lot of thoughtful people in it , but thoughtful people are n't willing to use a forum with a lot of trolls in it .
Which means that once trolling takes hold , it tends to become the dominant culture .
That had already happened to Slashdot and Digg by the time I paid attention to comment threads there , but I watched it happen to Reddit .
News .YC is , among other things , an experiment to see if this fate can be avoided .
The sites 's guidelines explicitly ask people not to say things they would n't say face to face .
If someone starts being rude , other users will step in and tell them to stop .
And when people seem to be deliberately trolling , we ban them ruthlessly .
Technical tweaks may also help .
On Reddit , votes on your comments do n't affect your karma score , but they do on News .
YC .
And it does seem to influence people when they can see their reputation in the eyes of their peers drain away after making an asshole remark .
Often users have second thoughts and delete such comments .
One might worry this would prevent people from expressing controversial ideas , but empirically that does n't seem to be what happens .
When people say something substantial that gets modded down , they stubbornly leave it up .
What people delete are wisecracks , because they have less invested in them .
So far the experiment seems to be working .
The level of conversation on News .
YC is as high as on any forum I 've seen .
But we still only have about 8,000 uniques a day .
The conversations on Reddit were good when it was that small .
The challenge is whether we can keep things this way .

I ’ve had the pleasure of interviewing a number of people to work for Mozilla and plenty of developers for the jQuery core team .
There ’s a lot that I ’ve learned about what makes a good candidate and I ’d like to point it out , as it ’s generally quite different from most organizations looking to hire .
Also , even between the two Open Source projects , the qualifications for a good candidate shift wildly – however there ’s a lot that ’s quite similar , and should be outlined .
Education , grades in school , extracurricular activities , and age have very little bearing on what makes for a good candidate .
None of those have ever been a factor in any of my choices for an interviewee .
We ’ve had contributors to jQuery aged all the way from 15 to 65 .
Stuart was hired by Netscape to work on the Mozilla project straight out of high school ( which was actually detailed in the documentary Code Rush ) .
Age is rarely relevant , as long as you can produce good code and work well with your teammates .
I do n’t think education has ever been a deciding factor , for me , in an Interview .
Due to my location ( in Boston ) I end up talking with lots of MIT students ( both under - grad and graduate ) .
It ’s almost a given that their grades are good and that they ’ve done well in all the required classes .
This means that everyone knows Scheme , Java , and some C++ – which does n’t help you tremendously when shooting for a position developing the Firefox frontend ( which is JavaScript , CSS , XUL – maybe a pinch of C++ – and is generally what I interview candidates for ) .
Because of this I tend to look for candidates who ’ve put a lot of effort into extra research positions or side projects .
I ’m always surprised by the number of irrelevant extracurricular activities that people put on their resumes – and the number of “ awards ” they ’ve received .
These mean virtually nothing to me .
I ’m glad that you competed in a virtual robot battle competition , but how does that effect your ability to create good JavaScript code ?
This ends up weighting very poorly against outright experience .
Conversely , experience and initiative have a huge amount of power over an applicant .
If you ’re able to demonstrate that you ’ve devoted large amounts of time to building side projects ( especially when they ’re Ajax-y web applications – PHP , Ruby , Python , Perl – all good ) .
Since most of the people that I talk to for Mozilla are coming from MIT they all end up being amazingly similar .
The deciding factors for a candidate come down to how they ’ve gone beyond the basic program and excelled .
This is especially important since good web development skills are n’t seemingly taught in the MIT curriculum , which is a shame .
Location and native language can matter , depending on the project .
Mozilla , for example , is a highly distributed organization , however some teams ( like the platform team ) tend to work mostly in Mountain View , CA .
Additionally , due to frequent meetings and communication , being able to speak and understand English is incredibly helpful .
On the other hand , for jQuery , location is not a factor at all .
The jQuery team has only met once ( and there ’s some team members whom I still have n’t met ) .
Much like Mozilla , we ’re distributed across the globe – Germany , Florida , China , California , Romania , Colorado , Australia , and on , but we do n’t have a central base .
Being able to speak English is much less of a concern for us – we ’re more open to letting your code speak for itself .
Manning the booth at a recent MIT Career Fair .
Since I end up looking at , primarily , most candidate ’s JavaScript skills I tend to break down the topic into a couple areas :
JavaScript Language : Good knowledge of the language – an understanding of its functional aspects and prototypal inheritance are usually the most that I can hope for .
Cross -Browser Code : Writing effective cross - browser code is incredibly difficult and can be a good way of marking a proficient JavaScript developer .
One of my favorite questions to figure this out is “ What is your favorite cross - browser bug ? ” – either the candidate has like 20 answers or does n’t know what I ’m talking about .
Testing : Having test - backed code is pretty common in software development but still in its relative infancy in the land of JavaScript .
Developing JavaScript tests , using a test suite – or even having written your own suite – score big .
For Firefox Frontend Engineers , in particular , I also tend to look at the two other core aspects : CSS and XUL .
CSS : It ’s surprisingly easy to weed out people who do , or do n’t , know CSS .
Ask the question “ What ’s the syntax for making all paragraphs on a page red . ”
If they are n’t able to give you some combination of “ p color colon red ” then it ’s time to move on .
If they handle that then it ’s good to explore CSS property manipulation in JavaScript , making sure they have a good grasp of that .
XUL : By far the most challenging skillset to find .
Oftentimes when I actually interview a candidate that has XUL knowledge they ’re more proficient than I am .
However , most people are n’t familiar with XUL so I tend to explore topics like XML , XPath , XSLT , and SVG .
Having good knowledge of any of those is a big win .
If nothing else it should be noted that I care a lot about hands - on experience , especially when it comes to JavaScript and web - related technologies .
Showing that you ’ve proven yourself through hard work is immensely more valuable than having gotten good grades in some un-related programming class .
I tend to think that this emphasis on producing real results is sort of the cornerstone of Open Source development and is one reason why I am especially happy to be completely immersed in it .
By the way , at Mozilla , we ’re always looking for awesome developers .
If you ’re a top - notch web developer , maybe you should consider taking the leap into Firefox development .
The territory is completely familiar ( JavaScript , CSS , XML ) but the output is absolutely different :

But the public and media outcry over the attack has fueled concerns that people who are dangerously unstable are wandering the streets , and the random nature of the assault reminds New Yorkers of the schizophrenic who pushed a woman into the path of a subway train last January .
Of the attack on Ms. Barrett , Mr. Giuliani said on his radio show that '' the presumption is that this was done by a mentally ill person . ''
He added that '' you 're going to have a lot of fear , you 're going to have a lot of reaction , and you 're going to have a lot of over - reaction . ''
Mr. Safir said the police would probably not be stepping up efforts to roust the homeless from the streets had the brick attack not occurred .
Mr. Giuliani , who is a likely candidate for the United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton , has taken credit for the dramatic drop in crime over the last several years .
He is broadcasting television commercials upstate that stress his achievements , including the reduction in crime that he considers a cornerstone of his administration .
Although Mr. Giuliani said on his radio show that he did not agree with the Daily News headlines , he said he did agree with the substance of the editorial , which said that while not all mentally ill people on the streets were dangerous , ''a few of them are murderous . ''
The editorial urged the city to '' get them off the street .
Now . ''
The police began rounding up the homeless in a series of Manhattan sweeps in the mid-1990's , and many either moved out of tourist areas and went to less patrolled places -- or faced arrest and court summonses for such public nuisance violations as impeding the flow of pedestrian traffic .
Police officials said yesterday that the homeless could be arrested on charges of disorderly conduct or trespassing .
Advocates for the homeless said yesterday that Mr. Safir 's announcement would be the first time that the city had threatened the homeless with arrest as a broad policy .
Police officials said it was simply a ' ' re - emphasizing ' ' of existing policy .
SAN FRANCISCO  Yahoo said Tuesday that it would cut 1,000 jobs from its 14,300 - member work force by mid-February in an effort to cut costs and focus on its most important businesses .
The company disclosed the cuts during a discussion of its fourth - quarter earnings and a forecast of continued tough times ahead .
The company did not specify which areas of the company would suffer layoffs .
Yahoo executives also said that the company planned to invest heavily in some areas , and that laid - off employees would be allowed to apply for jobs in those areas .
The net effect on head count at the company was not clear .
“ We are going to have to see how that is going to play out , ” said John Aiken , an analyst with Majestic Research , a New York investment analysis firm .
A supporter of Sen. John McCain , a Republican presidential candidate , asked him at a Monday campaign event :
How do we beat the bitch ?
By “ bitch , ” the supporter mean Sen. Hillary Clinton , a Democratic presidential candidate .
( See the video . )
Please supply your own opinion about whether calling Sen. Clinton a “ bitch ” in public is appropriate and whether Sen. McCain responded appropriately .
At issue here is how CNN ’s Rick Sanchez exploited the video , manufactured a controversy and demonstrated his inability to correctly use the word “ most . ”
Mr. Sanchez led his Tuesday prime - time “ Out in the Open ” show with the video clip .
( Read the transcript . )
After showing the video , Mr. Sanchez asks :
No matter what you think of Hillary Clinton , is John McCain done as a result of this ?
Is this going to become a viral video ?
This is the kind of questions that we got to examine at this point .
We ’re going to be looking at a lot of these issues .
[ emphasis added ]
“ Done ” ?
Because a supporter â€ ” not Sen. McCain â€ ” said Sen.
Clinton ’s a bitch means the McCain campaign is “ done ” ?
Mr. Sanchez over - dramatizes this ( as usual ) .
Surely Sen. McCain ’s weakened fund - raising , cowtowing to the religious right , and his stance on the Iraq War will have much more to do with whether Sen.
McCain is “ done . ”
“ Kind of questions ” ?
Such as what ?
Mr. Sanchez implies that Sen. McCain ’s response belies some evil intent , intellectual shortcomings or , worse , sexist attitudes .
But the transcript shows Mr. Sanchez provides no evidence .
“ [ W ]e got to examine ” ?
Why ?
So Mr. Sanchez ’s program can amplify its meager ratings ?
And “ a lot of issues ” ?
What are they ?
Where ’s the evidence of them â€ ” and whether they ’re pertinent ?
And at what “ this point ” are we ?
He speaks before his mind can create coherent meaning .
Mr. Sanchez frames the McCain campaign through this imperfect lens prior to interviewing a regular CNN talkfester , Amy Holmes , a Republican who identifies herself as conservative and serves as a CNN political analyst .
He walks her through questions designed to demonstrate how offended Ms. Holmes is as a woman ; whether Sen.
McCain made a mistake in his response , and whether Sen. McCain was embarrassed by the question .
Then Mr. Sanchez broadens the audience and stereotypes their reactions .
Said Mr. Sanchez :
Well , I got to tell you , most people who have seen it are looking at it as a real mistake on his part in terms of the way he handled it .
[ emphasis added ]
“ Most ” implies at least 51 percent .
That means Mr. Sanchez had to identify all those who saw the video , undertake a census of them and determine what percentage both saw it and found it to a “ real mistake . ”
He provides no evidence for “ most ” and he does not define the characteristics of the “ real mistake ” in the eyes of those who saw the video .
In other words , Mr. Sanchez shamelessly pandered .
Reactions were swift :
McCain castigated CNN for its â€œbiased reportingâ€ and CNN ’s own media critic , Howard Kurtz , agreed â€œhis campaign has a point .
That little incident was pretty badly hyped by Rick Sanchez.â€ 
But overlooked was a reaction from actor Whoopi Goldberg .
Ms. Holmes had compared the McCain incident with one associated with Ms. Goldberg .
Said Ms. Holmes : “ [ D ] o n’t forget , back in 2004 , John Kerry was in the audience at Radio City Music Hall when Whoopi Goldberg took to the stage and called the commander in chief , President Bush , the C - word . ”
That incensed Ms. Goldberg , who has denied saying it .
She called the program and , to Mr. Sanchez ’s credit ( or his anticipated and unexpected ratings boost ) he put her on .
Said Ms. Goldberg :
Yes , but see , here ’s the problem with that , Rick .
When you are trying to stir people up , people will say anything .
Now , I do n’t mind if you do n’t like my politics or you do n’t like my hair or you do n’t like my skirt .
But make it about really what I ’ve done .
And do n’t use me to illustrate a point that you ’re trying to make .
Now , you know , it did n’t happen that way .
And I do n’t want to be dragged into it .
And so that ’s why I ’m calling .
Ms. Goldberg nailed it .
Mr. Sanchez was willing to say anything â€ ” without compelling evidence â€ ” to “ stir people up . ”
This , folks , ai n’t journalism .
All that ’s “ Out in the Open ” is Mr. Sanchez ’s ineptitude .
The body of an elderly woman was discovered Sunday in the front passenger side of a crumpled car in a San Fernando Valley towing company ’s yard -- a day after paramedics had removed her son from the same vehicle after a crash , authorities said .
The woman , whose identity was not released , had apparently been left in the car at the accident scene in Tarzana even as her son was taken to a hospital , police said .
Investigators began looking for her after family members reported that two relatives -- not one -- were missing , Officer Mike Lopez of the Los Angeles Police Department said .
“ We conducted a follow - up to the tow yard , and we discovered the woman inside the vehicle , ” Lopez said .
“ She was dead . ”
LAPD detectives and officials on Sunday afternoon and evening swarmed the vehicle lot at Howard Sommers Towing Inc. , an official police impound and tow yard in Canoga Park , trying to determine how city paramedics and traffic officers had failed to spot the woman in the damaged vehicle .
The slightly built woman had been concealed beneath an air bag that had deployed during the accident , police said .
The vehicle was badly banged - up after crashing into a building .
The Los Angeles County coroner ’s office dispatched investigators late Sunday to examine and remove the body .
“ There are a lot of questions and we do n’t have all of the answers , ” Lopez said , adding that authorities are “ conducting an investigation surrounding this unfortunate incident . ”
The incident began about 10 a.m.
Saturday when the vehicle driven by the woman ’s son hit a parked car in a bank parking lot and then crashed into the building at 19255 W. Ventura Blvd .
Los Angeles Fire Department paramedics removed the driver from the vehicle and took him to Northridge Hospital Medical Center , said spokesman Brian Humphrey .
He did not release the driver ’s name , age or medical condition .
The car was then towed about seven miles to the impound yard , where it sat overnight .
The city ’s Department of Building and Safety , meanwhile , was called in to check for structural damage at the bank after the car was pulled from the building .
On Sunday afternoon , authorities called the impound yard and asked an employee to look in the vehicle for anything unusual , a source said .
About 3:15 p.m. , the Fire Department ’s emergency medical technicians were summoned by the towing yard , Humphrey said .
“ We had one person declared deceased at the scene .
. . .
“ Obviously , there is interest in our department in what happened .
We are awaiting the results of the LAPD investigation .
It ’s purely a law enforcement investigation at this time . ”
The coroner ’s office dispatched investigators late Sunday to examine and remove the woman ’s body .
They did not reach an immediate conclusion as to the precise time or cause of death , said coroner ’s spokesman Lt. John Kades .
Such details will come after a more thorough examination of the body .
“ The doctors may have a conclusion after the autopsy if this person died instantly or not , ” Kades said .
“ That ’s a possibility , but there ’s no way to tell or predict . ”

This news article sums up the recent terrorist attacks against the UN :
In 2007 , Al - Qaeda and its affiliates have threatened or targeted U.N. officials and peacekeepers in conflict zones in Afghanistan , Iraq , Somalia , Sudan and southern Lebanon , where six U.N. peacekeepers were killed in a bombing in June .
Even before the Algiers attack , the United Nations was already investing millions of dollars in fortifying its facilities and convoys in response to threats in Afghanistan and Iraq .
But the Algiers attack -- the deadliest for the United Nations since insurgents bombed its Baghdad headquarters in August 2003 -- provided a blunt reminder of how vulnerable the international organization is . (...)
Since the bombing of the UN headquarters in Baghdad , I have always believed that we , international humanitarian organisations , will become the soft targets .
As the " hard targets " , e.g. the UK and US foreign missions , isolate themselves , lock themselves up behind walls of concrete , we - humanitarians - can not .
While often the streets of US embassies are barricaded , our work is on those streets , in the field , working with the people .
We -humanitarians - are working in the most remote places , often as the only expats around .
How easy does that make us as a target ?
Any malicious group who wants international press , only needs to kidnap or kill one of us , and they get plenty of international press ...
And that was only talking about terrorism .
How about just plain crime and banditry ?
To give you an idea , WFP ( UN World Food Programme ) had 36 people killed , injured or detained this year only ...
That is a sharp raise from the previous years .
We 're in for a rough ride ...
How much do we protect ourselves ?
With what financial implication ?
For example , a typical field 4x4 vehicle costs about US $ 25,000 .
But working in a high risk area will easily add US $ 15,000 in ballistic blankets and HF / VHF radios for security measures .
How much risk is acceptable , to the organisations , and to the staff themselves ?
How much do those security measures isolate us , and disables us from doing the work we are set to do : work with the people .

A scientist escaped a speeding fine after a mobile phone system he devised showed that a police speed camera clocked him at 12 mph more than he was going .
The new tracking system , likened to an aircraft 's black box , could now be used to challenge the controversial issue of speed cameras .
Dr Phillip
Tann was hauled before magistrates after police claimed he was doing 42 mph in a 30 mph limit but records from his own invention convinced prosecutors he was doing less than the permitted 30 mph .
The case has now been discontinued and the 45 - year - old technology firm boss said the ruling could open the floodgates for other hapless motorists accused of speeding .
Scroll down for more
Central to the accuracy of the system is that it can measure data over distances of less than half a metre compared to traditional GPS devices which work on distances of around five metres .
After a number of pre-trial hearings the Crown Prosecution Service has now told his solicitor , Peter Thubron , that the case is being discontinued and he does not have to attend a planned trial on October 18 at Sunderland Magistrates Court .
Dr Tann , who has been working on the global positioning device for two years was driving through Sunderland collecting road data for the system when he was clocked by a police mobile speed camera .
Knowing his speed was an exact 29.177196 mph he did not give it a second thought until he received a letter and fine from Northumbria Police .
Knowing he could prove his speed through the tracking system he has designed he challenged it through the courts .
Scroll down for more
The system , which can be installed on a mobile phone , records the location and speed of the handset on a computer database .
The design has already received government funding , with an NStar proof of concept award .
Dr Tann , whose business Autopoietic Systems ( Tann Ltd ) is based in Birtley , Gateshead , said : " When I received the fine , I checked the database . "
" The system I was testing is more accurate than anything else on the market .
It said I was only doing 29.177196 mph at that time . "
Dr Tann , from South Shields , then turned up to a magistrates hearing with a CD containing his evidence and pleaded not guilty .
He said : " My solicitor , Peter Thubron , stood up and told them the exact speed I was travelling at that time . "
" The Crown Prosecution Service requested to view the system and has now agreed that the Autopoietic System was more accurate than the police laser gun . "
" I knew when I received the fine I could n't have been exceeding the limit because I 'd seen the van with the camera .
So I was surprised to receive a fine .
" The cameras used are not 100 per cent accurate , but my system is . "
" It can track a GPS phone within half a metre of where it is , whereas devices currently on the market can , at best , only track a phone within five metres . "
" In the past people have had to rely on the accuracy of the police cameras and they can be subject to error but this information can be downloaded as used as proof . "
Dr Tann will also be releasing a product this December as an aid to people suffering from such conditions as Alzheimer 's Disease and any parents who want to know the location of their child .
Dr Tann added , " With this accuracy we can provide many new services , including sending an alarm if a phone travels outside an area or at a speed greater than 15 mph . "

yield_debugger
Debugger support is available in Ruby - a command line debugger has been shipped with it for a long time .
Speed , however , was a problem .
Ruby debuggers were implemented using Ruby's , i.e. a callback Block or function is called before a line of Ruby code is executed .
This callback checked if the thread was suspended or if a breakpoint exists on this line .
The defaultis implemented in Ruby , with a Ruby block simply set with .
Faster versions of this approach were implemented in C ( ruby - debug Cylon debugger ) and Java ( jruby - debug ) .
However , no matter how fast the callback is executed , the problem of this solution remains : as soon as the debugger is started , every line of Ruby code incurs an overhead .
An ideal solution for this has no overhead and simply suspends the thread when a breakpoint is hit .
I.e. a breakpoint has no cost ( in CPU cycles ) until it 's hit .
This is the approach that Rubinius ' full speed debugger uses - with " full speed " meaning that a program runs at it 's normal speed even if it 's being debugged . ' full speed debugger is made possible by these characteristics :
With this functionality in place , on a certain line of a method is simple :
This functionality has been around for some time ( see InfoQ 's interview with Evan Phoenix on topics such as debugging ) .
However , the full speed debugger has now become usable for regular users with work from , who added a command line user interface for the Rubinius debugger and necessary commands .
Not just that , he implemented the code that allows the user toline by line .
This involved simply setting a breakpoint on the next line after the current one .
Of course , this also needs to know if the current line is the last in a method - but this is also possible in Rubinius by getting a handle to the method that called the current one .
The context object , i.e. the activation frame or stack frame of the method , has amethod doing just that .
Using the debugger is simple .
Once you have Rubinius ( see how to check out and compile Rubinius ) , startby running : Then execute this : ( Note : just typingalso works at the moment ) .
This will put you in the debugger 's text interface - available commands can be seen with the " ? " command , and include managing breakpoints and features like looking at the op_codes and the Ruby source of methods among others .
The full speed debugger gives Rubinius a big edge versus Ruby implementations that need to rely on tracing based debuggers ( no matter how fast these implementations are ) .
It 's also important to note : the complete debugger functionality was written in - with the exception of the handful of lines of C code for theinstruction .
Have you tried Rubinius yet ?
Do you have ideas what you could do with Rubinius ' transparency and accessible internals , i.e. accessing and modifying bytecode at runtime , inspecting the call stack etc .?

Extracts from the eagerly awaited book ‘ The Bible – Testament 3.0 ’ filled the internet last week , and several websites posted what appeared to be copies of the complete manuscript , which has been kept in a tightly sealed cave of secrecy leading up to its Sunday release .
Eager fan Archbishop Rowan Williams , downloaded a copy of the wildly anticipated threequel and revealed details in his Sunday sermon .
‘ Without giving too much away ’ , he preached , ‘ I can confirm rumours that a major character is killed off about half way through the book .
However , he comes back to life again before disappearing for several years , and after a triumphant return he dies again , rises from the dead and once again disappears with a promise to return later . ’
The new book , which has been dubbed ‘ the most exiting yet ’ , will feature all of the thrills and spills of the first two testaments , including walking on water , flying , and water - to - wine magic .
Jesus Christ and his twelve friends will also encounter a host of new sins to tempt them , including smoking in a public building , using a mobile phone when driving , and many old favourites like betrayal , adultery and ox-coveting .
Catastrophes including floods , locusts and Chris Moyles will hinder the thirteen friends on their quest , and fans will be pleased to note that old adversary The Devil will return , this time as an evasive Afghan terrorist .
If the online material is genuine , it would represent a major breach of security that God Inc. have been working feverishly to protect .
The publishers of the blockbuster fantasy series released a statement saying ‘ Thou shalt not read our book on thy internet ’ , at which lots of excited fans were alerted to the fact that it was on the internet .

地震や水害など、多くの天災リスクに囲まれている国、日本。毎年少なからぬ数の人命が奪われているにもかかわらず、災害に関する警報発令を聞いて迅速に行動を取る人は少数派だ。防災研究者で、群馬大学工学部教授の片田敏孝氏は、その理由を「人の持つ特性」にあると言う。
「 津波が危険なこと、地震が来たらすぐに避難しなくてはならないことなど、みんな百も承知だ。ただ、それが行動につながらないだけ。けっして防災意識が低いわけではなく、『避難するぞ』という意志決定ができないでいるだけだ」（片田氏）――。
このことは、情報セキュリティの世界にもそのまま当てはまらないだろうか？
ちょっと言葉を変えてみよう。
「 ウイルスが危険なこと、脆弱性が発見されたらすぐに対応しなくてはならないことなど、みんな百も承知だ。ただ、それが行動につながらないだけ。けっしてセキュリティ意識が低いわけではなく、『対策するぞ』という意志決定ができないだけだ」
情報セキュリティ専門家らはこの数年間、ユーザーに向けて「こんな脅威が登場しているので注意せよ」「脆弱性を修正し、セキュリティ対策を実施せよ」と呼び掛けてきた。しかしそれが具体的なアクションにつながっているかというと、どうも心許ない。これまでセキュリティ業界が取ってきたアプローチは有効なのだろうか、もっと別のやり方があるのではないか――。
片田氏は防災の世界で模索を続ける中で、人間の特性を踏まえた上で、相手の理解を得ながら情報を伝えていくことが重要であることが見えてきたという。自らを「逃げる」専門家と表現する片田氏の談話をまとめた。
地震が来たらその後に津波が来るということは、皆、知識としては知っています。避難しなければならないことも分かっています。しかし、「分かっている」ことと「実際に対応できる」ということは違うのです。
「 いざとなっても自分は大丈夫」と思ってしまうのが、人の「さが」というものです。そもそも人間は、自分にとって嫌なこと、起こってほしくないことはあまり考えないようになっています。これは、人の心の安定にとって必要なことなのです。毎日にこやかに暮らせるのは、嫌なことを忘れているから。もしも自分の寿命が分かってしまえば、その日が近づくにつれ、とても平静にしていられなくなるかもしれませんね。
も う1つ、人間には、いい話と悪い話とで、受け取り方が非対称だという特性もあります。客観確率が同じでも、主観的な確率が異なってくるのです。最もわかりやすい例が、交通事故と宝くじでしょう。客観的に見ればどちらも同じ確率でも、誰も、自分が今日交通事故に遭うなどとは考えません。しかし宝くじだと「そろそろ一等が当たるんじゃないかな」と考え、売り場に行列を作ります。
つまり、人は、自分が被害に遭うということを前提に考えられないのです。例えば「今、地震が来たらどうしますか？
5分後はどうしていますか？」と皆さんに尋ねると、だいたい「机の下に隠れている」「建物の外に逃げる」「下敷きになった人を助ける」といった答えが出てきます。けれど誰も「自分ががれきの下でつぶれている」とは想定しません。
人の心にはそういう特徴があるのです。だからといって、それを放っておいていいのかというと、そうはいきません。津波というのは、「確率」現象ではなく「確定」現象です。特に日本の場合、海溝型津波は繰り返し繰り返しやってきて、そのたびに多くの人が亡くなられています。
被害を少しでも減らすためには、こうした人間のさがを乗り越えていける手法を開発していかなければなりません。いま申し上げた特質を踏まえ、「人間はこういうものだ」という前提の基で、策を考える必要があるのです。
もう1つ、風化という現象も挙げられるでしょう。一般に、災害が起こっても、その記憶は30年でほぼ薄れてしまうと言われています。阪神淡路大震災でさえ、10年経った今、記憶の風化が始まりつつあります。市役所職員の4割が新しい職員で、震災の経験がないんですね。こうした忘却の過程というのも、いかんともしがたいものがあります。こうした条件を前提に、策を考えていかなければなりません。

Countries with less oil to sell do not have the same options .
In Syria , where oil production is drying up , prices have also risen sharply .
Although it has begun to liberalize its rigid socialist economy , the government has repeatedly put off plans to eliminate the subsidies that keep prices artificially low for its citizens , fearing domestic reprisals .
Even so , the inflation of the past few months has taken a toll on all but the rich .
Thou al - Fakar Hammad , an employee in the contracts office of the Syrian state oil company , has a law degree and earns just less than 15,000 Syrian pounds , or $ 293 , a month , twice the average national wage .
His salary was once more than adequate , and until recently he sent half of it to his parents .
But rising prices have changed all that , he said .
Now he has taken a second job teaching Arabic on weekends to help support his wife and young child .
Unable to buy a car , he takes public buses from his two - room apartment just outside Damascus to work .
He can afford the better quality diapers for his son to wear only at night and resorts to cheaper ones during the day .
He can not send anything to his parents .
“ I have to live day to day , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t budget for everything because , should my child get sick , I ’d spend a lot of what I earn on medication for him . ”
At the same time , a new class of entrepreneurs , most of them with links to the government , has built gaudy mansions and helped transform Damascus , the Syrian capital , with glamorous new restaurants and cafes .
That has helped fuel a perception of corruption and unfairness , analysts say .
On Wednesday the state - owned newspaper Al Thawra published a poll that found that 450 of 452 Syrians believed that their state institutions were riddled with corruption .
“ Many people believe that most of the government ’s economic policies are adopted to suit the interests of the newly emerging Syrian aristocracy , while disregarding the interests of the poor and lower middle class , ” said Marwan al - Kabalan , a political science professor at Damascus University .
The same attitudes are visible in Jordan .
Even before the subsidies on fuel were removed this month , inflation had badly eroded the average family ’s earning power over the past five years , said Mr. Tawil , the former economic minister .
Although the official inflation rate for 2007 was 5.4 percent , government studies have shown that middle - income families are spending far more on food and consuming less , he added .
Last year a survey by the Economist Intelligence Unit found that Amman was the most expensive Arab capital in cost of living .
HML5の最初の草案が公開されたが、まともに印刷すると400ページ以上になる分量を読むのはなかなか大変。それなのに仕様は、
First , it should be read cover - to - cover , multiple times .
Then , it should be read backwards at least once .
Then it should be read by picking random sections ... なんてことを要求している。まぁそれはともかく、こんな巨大な仕様は、モジュール化するのが吉というのが、HTML4実装の教訓だったんじゃないのかな。適切に設計すれば、「HTML5の○○が気に入らない」という相反する意見も、モジュールの組み合わせでうまく行くかもしれないのに。
さまざまな機器でウェブにアクセスするようになり、またその利用目的もオンライン取引からソーシャルネットワーク、小説の発表など多岐にわたる。これら全てをひとつの仕様で完全にまかなおうとすると、どうしても内容は膨大になり、また異なる要件が相反したりして、簡単にはいかない。小さなデバイスで実装するのも難しくなってくる。だからXHTMLの仕様をいくつかのグループに分割して、そこから必要なものを選んで目的に合った言語を構成しようというのがモジュール化の狙いだった。
HTML5で新たに追加するとしている要素や機能は、HTML4を丸ごと再定義しなくても、こうしたモジュールの設計によって可能になるものが多いように見える。XではないHTMLのモジュール化はやりにくいかもしれないが、XHTML版V5をモジュールベースで定義した上で、そこからHTML版V5をつくることはできるだろう。
こんなことぐらい普通なら思いつくだろうに、新HTML部会で検討されたことはないのかと調べてみたら、2007年3月22日のIRCログに次のようなやり取りがあった。
[ 17:42 ] < schnitz > XHTML Modularization is the answer to the statement that HTML5 is heavily intertwined and cannot be modularized , not true , we did it in M12N [ 17:42 ] < schnitz > and XHTML M12N is very close to HTML 4.01 [ 17:43 ] < schnitz > so no magic XHTML2 stuff here ... [ 17:55 ] < anne >
WHATWG has been thinking about HTML for over two years now ... [ 17:55 ] < bewest > except that future vision is much worse than hindsight [ 17:55 ] < anne > ( and many on the WHATWG for a longer period ) [ 17:56 ] < anne > why do we need modularization anyway ? [ 17:56 ] < anne > on the web you do n't want profiles etc .
< schnitz >こと Sebastian SchnitzenbaumerはXHTMLモジュール化仕様（1.0）のエディタでもあったから、その方法論やメリットを踏まえて発言しているわけだが、他のメンバーは、もうここまで進んでいるのに何で今頃そんなこというの？という雰囲気のようだ。最後の発言に見られるように、モジュール化やプロファイルはむしろウェブを分断するから、仕様は一体化する方がいいのだという考えもあるらしい。そうかなぁ。
確かに部会憲章 で
This will be a complete specification , not a delta specification .
と宣言しているので、追加モジュールだけの定義というわけには行かないだろう。しかし全体をモジュール化して、 article 、 aside 、 header 、 footer 、 nav あたり をFunctional Elements Moduleなどとすれば、使いたい作者はフルの(X) HTML5で書けばいいし、これがHTMLの本質に反すると思うなら、納得できるモジュールだけのサブHTML5を定義して用いればいい。新機能は役立ちそうだけれど既存要素のセマンティクスを変えて欲しくなかったり、削除される要素や属性で必要なものがあるなら、XHTML1.1と新モジュールを組み合わせることもできるだろう。もしかしたら、XHTML2とだって相乗りができるかもしれない。
あー、しかし 、Ian Hicksonはメーリングリストでこんなこと言ってるよ。
The " Modularization of XHTML " basis is a specification - level concern and does n't affect authors or implementors , so I do n't really understand its relevance .
モジュール化したければXHTML2を使えという反応が返ってきそうだけれど、何かもう少し賢い方法を取れないものか。
When I started this blog , I did n’t know much about the personal finance information that was out there .
Because I did n’t know much , I mistakenly assumed the little I did know must be common knowledge , and acted as such .
But after several questions about “ snowflaking ” from visitors , readers , and commenters , I realized that just because the “ Debt Snowball ” popularized in recent times primarily by Dave Ramsey was known and understood by most people that came across my site , snowflaking as a related but slightly separate concept was not .
I learned about the concept of snowflaking from a Debt Support Messageboard at iVillage that I began to frequent when I decided to find a way , no matter what , to get rid of our credit card debt once and for all .
I did n’t know who Dave Ramsey or what a debt snowball was , and I certainly had no idea what snowflaking meant .
Through that board I learned about the idea of saving or earning small extra amounts of money and paying it directly to debt , and calling those extra-over - minimum payments snowflakes .
I really embraced the concept and the method ( and I do n’t know the origination of the term , if it was coined by that messageboard or was adapted from somewhere else ) and started challenging myself to find snowflakes whenever and wherever I could .
When I branched out to starting my own blog about debt reduction , I talked about snowflaking as if it was a commonly understood concept because , as I stated in the beginning of this post , I had no idea it was n’t .
Once I realized my constant reference to snowflaking was n’t necessarily understood by my everyday visitors , I wrote my snowflaking primer .
I continued to snowflake down my credit card debt , and a few weeks ago , as part of a 12 Days of Christmas – Personal Finance Style project , wrote my Five Golden Rules of Snowflaking .
And then something interesting happened .
I submitted that post to the Carnival of Personal Finance , and the host that week , JD of Get Rich Slowly , chose it as one of his editor ’s picks .
Mrs. Micah : Finance for a Freelance Life had submitted her post asking for people ’s choices for best personal finance practices of the year ( in which she had chosen my snowflaking primer as her choice ) to the same carnival , and her post was subsequently picked up by The Consumerist , which also mentioned my snowflaking primer .
And people started visiting .
And reading .
And learning about snowflaking , and talking about it themselves .
The snowflake revolution has begun .
Every day it seems I get another notification of a link to one of my snowflaking posts , where someone is talking about it on their own blog or website .
Both my Five Golden Rules and my Primer posts get dozens to hundreds of hits a day from visitors who saw the snowflaking concept referenced elsewhere and followed it here .
And I ca n’t be more delighted .
I did n’t create the concept of snowflaking .
I do n’t claim to be the end - all of information about it either .
All I am is a very enthusiastic follower of the concept and practicer of the ideals and principles behind it .
And with it , I ’ve been decimating my credit card debt at a fantastic rate .
Find ways to save money and pay that saved money directly to debt .
Find ways to earn more money and pay that earned money directly to debt .
Someday in the future , instead of snowflaking to debt , I ’ll be snowflaking to savings , and my future will greatly thank me for it .
The revolution has begun .
Why do n’t you join the revolution , too ?
There ’s room for everyone on board .

Bill Maher : Ca n't the Democrats grow even one ball ?

Comedian Bill Maher had a question for his panel Friday night in reference to Democrat Chuck Schumer 's decision to support the nomination of Michael Mukasey for Attorney General :
" Can they grow even one ball ? " he asked , frustrated , of the Congressional majority .
" I 'm not asking for two , just one . "
The audience applauded him wildly and no one on the panel came to the Democrats ' defense .
Maher was joined by Alison Stewart of NBC News , Markos Moulitas of Daily Kos and actor Martin Short .
All expressed concerned for what may amount the tacit approval of Congress for the interrogation techniques implemented by the Bush administration many decry as torture .
" We 'd like to wag our finger at the Burmese regime , " Maher said , " but it turns out they were torturing those monks by water - boarding them , so ... "
The following video is from HBO 's Real Time with Bill Maher , broadcast on November 02 , 2007
Lighthouses are lonely places .
Abandoned lighthouses are the loneliest of the lonely .
This derelict lighthouse off the coats of South Wales can be reached at low tide .
Its naked , bolted ribs are reminiscent of a design by Lebbeus Woods , the inspiration behind the setting of Alien III and the source of the plagiary in 12 Monkeys .
On Sunday , YouTube became unreachable from most , if not all , of the Internet .
No " sorry we 're down " or cutesy kitten - with - screwdriver page , nothing .
What happened was that packets sent to YouTube were flowing to Pakistan .
Which was curious , because the Pakistan government had just instituted a ban on the popular video sharing site .
What apparently happened is that Pakistan Telecom routed the address block that YouTube 's servers are into a " black hole " as a simple measure to filter access to the service .
However , this routing information escaped from Pakistan Telecom to its ISP PCCW in Hong Kong , which propagated the route to the rest of the world .
So any packets for YouTube would end up in Pakistan Telecom 's black hole instead .
On the North American Network Operators Group ( NANOG ) mailing list , where many engineers in charge of Internet routing hang out , the consensus is that this was an accident .
Only one or two people suggest that it may be a malicious act , possibly a trial of something bigger .
So why was this incident so devastating to YouTube 's reachability ?
Originally , IP addressing was set up for three different classes of users : classes A , B , and C. Class A users , such as the original ARPANET , got an address block of 16777216 addresses so they could connect millions of systems to the Internet .
Class B users , such as universities , got 65536 addresses .
Class C users , such as businesses with only a small number of Internet - connected systems , got 256 addresses .
Obviously , these classes often did n't fit well with the number of addresses needed , which led to a lot of waste .
So in the early 1990s , a new system called Classless Inter - Domain Routing ( CIDR ) was created so that IP addresses could be used much more efficiently .
CIDR allows address blocks to be given out in power of two blocks , such as 256 ( / 24 ) , 512 ( /23 ) , 1024 ( / 22 ) , and so on .
The number after the slash indicates how many of the 32 address bits are " network " bits , the remaining bits are used to number hosts .
So / 24 is 24 network bits and 8 bits to number hosts , which allows for 256 addresses .
An interesting side effect of CIDR is that a particular IP address can now fall within multiple address ranges .
For instance , a router could have both 10.0.0.0/ 8 and 10.10.0.0/16 in its routing table .
Then , if a packet for 10.10.10.10 arrives , how should it be forwarded ?
The answer is : longest match first .
The smallest address block , with the largest number after the slash , takes precedence .
In the case of YouTube and Pakistan Telecom , YouTube injected the address block 208.65.152.0/22 ( 208.65.152.0 - 208.65.155.255 ) in the Internet 's routing tables , while Pakistan Telecom advertised the 208.65.153.0/24 ( 208.65.153.0 - 208.65.153.255 ) block .
So even though YouTube 's routing information was still there , packets would flow towards Pakistan Telecom because of the longest match first rule .
This vulnerability has been known for a long time , and smaller - scale accidents of this nature happen at regular intervals .
But so far , efforts within the IETF to make the Border Gateway Protocol , which governs Internet routing , more robust against this type of accident ( or attack ) have n't produced any results yet .
There are routing databases around the world where network operators can register their IP address blocks for the purpose of generating filters automatically , but since everyone has to register their own address blocks , and many people do n't , the filters generated from these databases often do more harm than good .
This means that the only thing that prevents things like this from happening are the filters that everyone sets up for their own address blocks , and filters that ISPs apply to their BGP - capable customers manually .
A likely result of this incident is that more network operators will start to announce their IP address blocks as a collection of / 24 blocks .
/ 24 is the smallest address range that is widely accepted between ISPs , so announcing the / 24 yourself provides some protection against others doing the same .
However , the problem with that is that it increases the routing tables in routers , which exacerbates problems from global routing table growth that already exist .
[ Update :
The press release offered lots of confusion – the story ’s been updated now for clarity ]
Valve are rocking the boat in a really big way , especially for PC gaming piracy .
They have just announced the release of a complete collection of publisher power , called Steamworks , available to developers and publishers completely free .
Valve describe it as ,
“ A complete suite of publishing and development tools – ranging from copy protection to social networking services to server browsing – now available free of charge to developers and publishers worldwide . ”
What does this actually mean ?
Well , its extensive .
The complete press - release is beneath the cut , as well as our explanation of what it means .
And what it means could be huge .
What does it mean ?
It gives publishers and developers the ability to control their games in a brand new way , with Steam itself dropping in the final executable to get the game working , which could have a hefty impact on how we buy our games .
And most importantly , no one ’s paying Valve a penny , neither the publisher , nor the player .
The suite will allow developers to perform many of the tricks that have distinguished Valve , such as monitoring sales stats , hefty anti-piracy measures , automatic updating , voice chat , multiplayer matchmaking , social networking and even the ability to run beta testing .
The possibilities this opens up for independent developers , and smaller publishing companies , could be enormous .
It ’s a bit confusing what this will actually means , so here ’s what we understand : A publisher can sell their game in the shops or distribute it digitally via their own system , customers install it , and then have Steam drop in the executable .
It kills off day - one piracy in a single shot .
Bam .
Then updates will be delivered automatically for the game via Steam , and all the post - release stats and tools will be available , with Valve charging no one any money for this at all .
Does this give Valve more power ?
It certainly means more people will be installing Steam on their systems , and that is n’t going to hurt them .
But since they wo n’t be responsible for distribution , nor handling money for these companies , the control seems to be firmly in the hands of each game ’s publisher .
Complete Suite of Publishing Tools Available Free of Charge
January 29 , 2008 – Valve , creators of best - selling game franchises ( such as Half - Life and Counter - Strike ) and leading technologies ( such as Steam and Source ) , today announce Steamworks , a complete suite of publishing and development tools – ranging from copy protection to social networking services to server browsing – is now available free of charge to developers and publishers worldwide .
Steamworks , the same suite of tools used in best - selling PC titles Half - Life 2 and The Orange Box , is available for all PC games distributed via retail and leading online platforms such as Steam .
The services included in Steamworks may be used a la carte or in any combination .
Specifically , Steamworks offers :
· Real - time stats on sales , gameplay , and product activation : Know exactly how well your title is selling before the charts are released .
Find out how much of your game is being played .
Login into your Steamworks account pages and view up to the hour information regarding worldwide product activations and player data .
· State of the art encryption system : Stop paying to have your game pirated before it ’s released .
Steamworks takes anti-piracy to a new level with strong encryption that keeps your game locked until the moment it is released .
· Territory / version control :
The key - based authentication provided in Steamworks also provides territory / version controls to help curb gray market importing and deliver territory - specific content to any given country or region .
· Auto updating : Insures all customers are playing the latest and greatest version of your games .
· Voice chat : Available for use both in and out of game .
· Multiplayer matchmaking : Steamworks offers you all the multiplayer backend and matchmaking services that have been created to support Counter - Strike and Team Fortress 2 , the most played action games in the world .
· Social networking services :
With support for achievements , leaderboards , and avatars , Steamworks allows you to give your gamers as many rewards as you would like , plus support for tracking the world ’s best professional and amateur players of your game .
· Development tools : Steamworks allows you to administer private betas which can be updated multiple times each day .
Also includes data collection tools for QA , play testing , and usability studies .
“ Developers and publishers are spending more and more time and money cobbling together all the tools and backend systems needed to build and launch a successful title in today ’s market , ” said Gabe Newell , president of Valve .
“ Steamworks puts all those tools and systems together in one free package , liberating publishers and developers to concentrate on the game instead of the plumbing . ”
“ As more developers and publishers have embraced Steam as a leading digital distribution channel , we ’ve heard a growing number of inquiries regarding the availability of the platform ’s services and tools , ” said Jason Holtman , director business development at Valve .
“ Offering Steamworks is part of our ongoing efforts to support the needs of game developers and our publishing partners . ”
Steam is a leading platform for the delivery and management of PC games and digital content .
With over 13 million active accounts and more than 250 games , plus hundreds of movie files and game demos available , Steam has become a frequent destination for millions of gamers around the world .

If not , why ?
Seriously , take a moment to tell me in the comments .
If you have n't had a chance to play with Haml yet , here is an easy opportunity to do so online .
All of Hashrocket 's new projects are done in Haml , and we 've now decided to transition everything else in our portfolio over to Haml as soon as possible .
The indentation - based approach works wonders for generating clean , semantic markup and the way that you can see the structure of your markup in a way that easily maps to CSS rules is simply brilliant .
My initial impression of Haml was not as favorable .
If you similarly gave Haml a try when it was originally released and could n't get it to work in a stable fashion , you might want to try again .

The possibility of alien life has provoked excitement for centuries
It 's 60 years since the term flying saucer was first coined , and I have to admit I hold a rather cynical view when it comes to UFOs and alien life .
But no matter how much of an unbeliever you are , the idea of extraterrestrial life cannot fail to quicken the pulse and the notion has captivated the imagination of people all across the globe for decades .
And it 's not likely to go away - the lure of the unexplained has long proved irresistible and , with space tourism becoming a reality , our fascination with close encounters can only grow .
Thirty years ago , a corner of south west Wales was caught up in a " flap " - a wave of sightings in an area - that became known as The Broad Haven Triangle .
So when details about these cases were released at the National Archive in Kew recently , I could n't resist some Mulder and Scully action .
It was a bit like an upside - down saucer - it looked like a jelly to start with
Rosa Granville
Leafing through the documents at Kew , the story began to unfold .
It was April 1977 and Rosa Granville , who runs the Haven Fort Hotel in Little Haven , was in bed at around 2.30 am when she was awoken by strange noise and lights .
Looking out of her window , she described seeing an object which looked like an " upside - down saucer " in the field next to the hotel and two ' faceless humanoid ' creatures with pointed heads .
The incident , she said in a subsequent letter she wrote to her MP Nicholas Edwards , left her " agitated and disturbed and not the least bit desirous of another encounter " .
" I would be pleased to hear of an explanation , it would greatly help to relieve the sense of shock I feel since my encounter , " she added .
I shouted ' Hello , what are you doing there ? '.
They looked faceless .
I could n't see their features
Rosa Granville
Speaking to BBC Wales ' news website , Mrs Granville recalled the object : " It was a bit like an upside - down saucer - it looked like a jelly to start with . "
" There was so much heat - I was by the window - my face felt burned .
" There was light coming from it and flames of all colours .
Then [ the creatures ] came out of these flames , that 's what I do n't understand .
" I shouted ' Hello , what are you doing there ' - they looked faceless .
I could n't see their features . "
She said she went to find other people in the hotel to show them , but that when she returned to the window a few minutes later , the objects and the men had gone .
There were a flurry of UFO sightings near Little Haven in 1977
When she visited the site of the alleged landing in the morning , she added there were " two inches of burned ground there " .
On receiving Mrs Granville 's letter back in 1977 , Mr Edwards contacted the Ministry of Defence and Flight Lieutenant Cowan , an officer from RAF Brawdy , then visited the hotel .
In his report to MoD chiefs , Flt Lt Cowan wrote : " [ Mrs Granville ] told me that one night in April of this year she saw a round object ' like the moon falling down ' land in a field at the back of her property .
Two very tall , faceless ' humanoids ' got out of this object ( about the size of a mini bus ) and appeared to ' take measurements or gather things ' . "
' Landing fees '
Flt Lt Cowan said he examined the landing site but " could find no evidence of a landing " and could offer no further explanation .
He added finally that , " should a UFO arrive at RAF Brawdy we will charge normal landing fees and inform you immediately " .
Other incidents reported in the Broad Haven area at the time included a class of schoolchildren who claimed to have seen a spacecraft near their playground .
Then a family said they saw several UFOs in the space of a week , as well as several sightings of silver suited creatures .
In his report , Flt Lt Cowan did mention the possibility that " a local prankster " was at work , and when contacted recently , he said the description of aliens from many witnesses " fitted exactly the type of protective suit that would be used in the event of a fire at one of the local oil refineries at Milford Haven " .
This indeed seems to have been the case as in 1996 , the Western Mail carried a report in which a 44 - year - old businessman Glyn Edwards admitted he had wandered around the area in a silver suit in 1977 as a prank .
The fact the RAF did an investigation of a UFO encounter is unique , as far as I 'm aware
Dr David Clarke
" Alien sightings were all the rage , so I took a stroll around for a bit of fun , " he is reported as saying .
However , Mrs Granville remains insistent that she had not been the subject of a hoax .
" You will always get silly people pretending , but what I saw was definitely humanoid , " she said .
Looking back now , Mrs Granville said she wished there had been an explanation from nearby RAF Brawdy , but that they had always denied their plane or their men were involved .
Researcher and lecturer Dr David Clarke , who has written a book called Flying Saucerers : A Social History of UFOlogy , said Mrs Granville 's account was a big part of " a UFO flap " at the time .
" Despite the fact we know there was hoaxing in the area , the fact that Mrs Granville 's account has remained consistent over 30 years shows she did see something unusual , " he said .
" The fact the RAF did an investigation of a UFO encounter is unique , as far as I 'm aware . "
The truth is still out there ...
The military says troops are ' engaging ' the militants
Pervez Musharraf
Eight soldiers have been killed and 32 others wounded in raids on militant hideouts backed by artillery and helicopters , a military statement said .
Earlier troops had hit militant positions with artillery fire .
South and North Waziristan , adjoining the Afghan border , are strongholds of militants allied to the Taleban .
The military said that the militants had been killed in a series of raids on Wednesday and early on Thursday .
Thirty militants had been arrested from a number of hideouts near the Afghan border during the raids , the statement said .
Mastermind
In the latest fighting , militants are reported to have responded to the army artillery attacks by firing missiles at security positions .
There are reports of people moving out of the area and walking for miles to reach secure zones .
The government has set up a temporary camp for displaced people in the Tank district of North West Frontier Province , where tents and food have been made available .
Militant leader Baitullah Mehsud is based in South Waziristan and is accused of leading attacks by tribesmen on forts controlled by the army .
The authorities in Islamabad also accuse him of masterminding the murder of former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto last month .
On Wednesday , a Pakistani senator said that Mr Mehsud was not involved in Ms Bhutto 's killing .
Saleh Shah , an Islamist senator who represents Waziristan , says Mr Mehsud was not " in any way " involved .
He also rejected recent claims by the American Central Intelligence Agency that Mr Mehsud is involved with al - Qaeda .
" I do n't know where these stories come from - about foreign fighters in the area , " he said .
" I have never seen any Arab or Uzbeks in the area . "
European file - sharers were given a huge legal boost today , as the European Court of Justice declared that EU law does not allow Internet Service Providers to be forced to reveal the personal details of people accused of file sharing .
Telefonica , Spain ’s largest telecom operator successfully argued that the law only required it to reveal the identities of those accused of a criminal offense and that sharing of music was a civil issue .
The European Court of Justice agreed with Telefonica in its dispute with the Spanish music rights holders association Promusicae .
In order to start civil proceedings , Promusicae had asked for the names of Telefonica subscribers , who allegedly infringed copyrighted material by using KaZaA .
The court said that : “ Community law does not require the member states , in order to ensure the effective protection of copyright , to lay down an obligation to disclose personal data in the context of civil proceedings . ”
This ruling is a huge victory for EU filesharers , whose privacy is now backed by a ruling from the European Court .
For ISPs this should be a huge relief as well , and they can finally put their time and effort in working for their customers , instead of against them .
The tide is changing for European filesharers .
Last week we reported that the data protection commissioner in Switzerland criticized the infamous anti-piracy tracking outfit Logistep for helping to breach the privacy of filesharers .
A few days before that decision , Greens EFA , a coalition of two political parties that currently have 42 seats in the European parliament , launched a pro-filesharing campaign named “ I Would n’t Steal ” .
The administration has already said it would order the Justice Department not to pursue a contempt charge against either Mr. Bolten or Ms. Miers .
But Democratic officials have decided that they have no choice but to pursue the citation to protect Congressional oversight authority in view of the administration ’s refusal to allow the administration aides to appear .
The White House has cited executive privilege in directing the two not to testify before Congress .
Democratic officials said that they believed that they had enough support to win approval of the contempt citation but that the schedule still needed to be presented to the rank and file .
It was possible that the vote , which has been delayed for months , could be put off .
The case arose out of accusations that administration officials sought to remove some federal prosecutors so they could be replaced with ones more in line with administration ideology , an approach that Democrats said destroyed the independence of the Justice Department .
The vote would occur as the two parties in Congress and the Bush administration have made new efforts to cooperate legislatively , producing an economic measure that Mr. Bush is scheduled to sign on Wednesday .

Claim : Osama bin Laden was dying of kidney disease .
Status : Undetermined .
Origins : Was Osama bin Laden , the scourge of our age , a sickly man , possibly even one dying of his infirmities ?
In the world of gossip , scuttlebutt that trivializes a hated enemy by portraying him as less powerful and more piteous often proves highly popular because it helps reduce the perceived threat that person represents to a more manageable level .
Such rumbles are routinely kited during times of conflict , and often prove to have little more to them than mere wishful thinking on the part of those looking for reassurance .
Yet that may not have been the case here .
Rumors about bin Laden ’s suffering from kidney - related afflictions had been rampant for years .
In March 2000 , more than a dozen Pakistani religious students offered to donate kidneys to the leader of the al Qaeda network .
That same month , a witness to a meeting among bin Laden and his people reported that the terrorist appeared weak and gaunt , coughed frequently , and seemed to become easily exhausted .
He also took milk during the meeting instead of the traditional tea .
This man spoke to a doctor who accompanied bin Laden and was told the leader ’s ailment was related to his circulation and his blood “ not being cleaned in the right way . ”
Around that same time , an unnamed official in the intelligence community stated bin Laden had kidney failure and “ his liver is going . ”
He said the terrorist ’s followers were trying to find a dialysis machine for their ailing leader .
In an interview with Asiaweek , another ( or possibly the same ) unnamed member of the intelligence community said of bin Laden , “ This man is dying . ”
Afghanistan ’s ruling Taliban militia responded to the rumors by denying them .
“ His health is good .
There is no problem with his kidney or liver , ” said Ahmad Ullah , a Taliban spokesman in southern Kandahar , in March 2000 .
William Safire asserted in a November 2001 New York Times article that in mid-May , 2001 , two of Saddam Hussein ’s secret service agents arrived at the clinic of Dr. Mohammed Khayal , Baghdad ’s leading kidney specialist .
“ The doctor hurriedly packed a bag and was escorted to a government car .
Three days later , he was returned , and the building was soon abuzz with the word that Saddam ’s Dr. Khayal had been to Afghanistan where his patient was Osama bin Laden . ”
In September 2001 , it was reported that Moosa Wardak , an Afghan doctor , had traveled to India not long before on a diplomatic passport issued by the Taliban government to buy some medical equipment for bin Laden .
Unnamed intelligence sources say a dialysis machine was bought for bin Laden earlier in 2001 and shipped to Kandahar .
Stories about bin Laden ’s renal problems and treatments that have been sought for them surface in many news articles , each appearing to come from different sources , thus this rumor may have more substance to it than the usual slander of an enemy which , even if voiced through numerous media outlets , ultimately proves to flow from the same wellspring .
This multiplicity of sourcing cannot be confirmed , however , because those who provide such accounts do so only under promise that their identities not be revealed .
The secrecy of the al Qaeda network and the CIA manhunt for bin Laden made it impossible to ensure that the same person was not telling one reporter after another the same tale , but the diversity of the information provided and that it was been offered up a bit here and a bit there over an extended period of time lent credence to the premise that there was something wrong with the terrorist ’s kidneys .
A persistent rumor asserts bin Laden received treatment for his ailing kidneys at the American Hospital in Dubai in 2001 , arriving on July 4 and leaving on July 14 .
Among those with him , it is thought , was Dr. Ayman Zawahiri , who as well as being his personal physician is al - Qaeda ’s second - in - command .
In an extension of this particular rumor , a CIA agent purportedly met with the terrorist at that hospital during bin Laden ’s ten - day course of
treatment .
The CIA has flatly denied the report .
Its spokeswoman , Anya Guelsher , said that it was “ complete nonsense . ”
Bernard Koval , the director of the hospital , also denied the terrorist had been a patient there , saying “ Osama bin Laden has never been here .
He ’s never been a patient and he ’s never been treated here .
We have no idea of his medical condition .
This is too small a hospital for someone to be snuck through the backdoor . ”
Osama bin Laden himself , in a November 2001 interview with a Pakistani newspaper , denied reports he had been hospitalized in Dubai for kidney treatment and said “ My kidneys are all right . ”
Was he ill or was he well ?
Whom to believe ?
The truth of such whispers will be impossible to determine until the body of bin Laden can be examined .
( The Contractor ’s end came in May 2011 when he was killed in a military operation led by the United States in which a small team carried out the attack and took custody of his remains . )

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday it had launched a criminal investigation into the CIA ’s destruction of videotapes showing the harsh interrogation of terrorism suspects .

“ There is a basis for initiating a criminal investigation of this matter , and I have taken steps to begin that investigation , ” said Attorney General Michael Mukasey .
The Central Intelligence Agency last month disclosed that in 2005 it destroyed hundreds of hours of tapes from the interrogations of two al Qaeda suspects , prompting an outcry from Democrats , human rights activists and some legal experts .
The interrogations , which took place in 2002 , were believed to have included a form of simulated drowning known as waterboarding , condemned internationally as torture .
President George W. Bush has said the United States does not torture but has declined to be specific about interrogation methods .
The Justice Department and the CIA ’s inspector general last month launched an initial inquiry into the destruction of the tapes .
The CIA says it acted lawfully in destroying the tapes , but critics say the agency flouted court orders and investigators ’ requests that it hand over evidence in various terrorism cases .
A Justice Department official declined to specify what laws may have been violated .
“ Those tapes may have been evidence of a crime , and their destruction may have been a crime in itself , ” said Sen.
Edward Kennedy , a Massachusetts Democrat and member of the Judiciary Committee .
Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont , the Judiciary Committee ’s chairman , said the investigation ’s launch “ shows that many of us were right to be concerned with possible obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress . ”
Congressional intelligence committees , which are seeking testimony from senior CIA officials believed involved in the destruction , signaled they would continue their investigations despite the federal probe .
The Justice Department had initially balked at the congressional investigations , saying they could undermine its own efforts , and lawmakers accused the Bush administration of trying to cover up the controversy .
“ Our negotiations with the CIA and ( Justice Department ) over the scope of our investigation are ongoing .
I fully expect their continued cooperation , including relevant testimony and documents , ” said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman John Rockefeller , a West Virginia Democrat .
The CIA said it would “ cooperate fully with this ( federal ) investigation , as it has with others into this matter . ”
The agency ’s inspector general , John Helgerson , said he would step aside from the Justice Department ’s investigation despite taking part in the initial probe .
Helgerson said the inspector general ’s office had reviewed the tapes “ some years ago ” as part of a study of agency interrogations and that he had helped prepare a report on the issue , so it would be inappropriate to be involved in the probe .
Mukasey said he had directed the FBI to conduct the investigation under the supervision of a federal prosecutor from Connecticut , John Durham .

ROME ( Reuters ) - Recording secret videos of sex with your partner is not illegal , Italy ’s supreme court has ruled .
Rome ’s highest appeals acquitted a 49 - year - old man who , unbeknown to his girlfriend , had recorded and kept films of them having sex .
It overruled two previous verdicts which had given him a four - month jail sentence .
The woman had agreed to the man using a video camera to project live images of them having sex on to the bedroom wall , but did not know he was recording the action .
The court acquitted the man because he had not distributed the films to other people .
When the relationship ended the man gave the videos to his partner in a package accompanied by a note saying : “ These are my last thought for you . ”
Memo to Irving Kristol :
Get yourself to a secure , undisclosed location immediately if not sooner .
You are in grave danger .
No , you need n't worry about receiving threats from left - wing loonies like Al Gore or his disciple , the Unabomber .
You do n't even have to fear the paleoconservatives and libertarians .
You should , however , keep your eyes open for members of the National Review / Wall Street Journal crowd .
IMPORTANT : If you receive a package in the mail from David Frum , call the bomb squad immediately !
Why do I say Irving Kristol had better keep a close eye on his allies on the ' official ' right ?
Simply this :
He recently wrote a piece for The Weekly Standard in which he spelled out exactly what neoconservatism is .
What 's worse is that ol '
Irv 's description of neoconservatism proves that it is everything its critics have said it is ' and worse .
Now that ' the ' godfather ' of all those neocons , ' as Kristol describes himself , has spoken on the subject ( and written a book entitled Neoconservatism : The Autobiography of an Idea ) , the NR / WSJ crowd can no longer plausibly deny the existence of such a movement , as some have tried to do .
In addition , they can no longer plausibly claim that neoconservatism is merely another form of traditional conservatism .
Nor can they plausibly insist that neoconservatism has anything at all to do with the American founding and tradition of limited government and avoidance of entangling alliances .
Kristol has blown all these arguments out of the water .
Kristol first points out that neoconservatism had 'its origin among disillusioned liberal intellectuals in the 1970s , ' just in case anyone had any doubts about its ancestry .
At this time the grassroots of the Republican Party , and indeed much of Middle America , was still largely wedded to the ideas of small government at home and a reasonably prudent foreign policy abroad .
Barry Goldwater ' who Kristol says is ' politely overlooked ' in the neocon pantheon of ' 20th - century heroes , ' while FDR is included 'had , after all , been the Republican presidential nominee in 1964 ; and Ronald Reagan , who at least espoused relatively conservative ideas even if he did n't follow through on most of them once in office , was to be elected president in 1980 .
In other words , neocon ideas were not the ideas of the mainstream right at the time , and their prospects were n't even looking very bright .
So , says Kristol , ' one can say that the historical task and political purpose of neoconservatism would seem to be this : to convert the Republican party , and American conservatism in general , against their respective wills , into a new kind of conservative politics suitable to governing a modern democracy . '
It 's easy to see the liberal 'and , indeed , Straussian , as Kristol claims Leo Strauss as one of the forerunners of neoconservatism ' mind at work here .
We , the enlightened ones , will ' convert ' you , the unenlightened , from your backward , parochial ways to our progressive , global ways ; and we will do so against your will , by deception if possible , by force if necessary .
The only genuinely conservative idea Kristol attributes to the neocons is an affinity for ' cutting tax rates . '
Even there , however , Kristol hedges .
It 's not that ' the particularities of tax cuts . . . interested ' the neocons , and it certainly is n't the case that they view tax cuts as a moral imperative .
They are interested in tax cuts only insofar as those cuts ' stimulate steady economic growth , ' presumably so the natives do not become restless when their bread and circuses peter out and start clamoring for the emperor 's head .
Kristol notes that the neocon ' emphasis on economic growth ' has led to 'an attitude toward public finance that is far less risk averse than is the case among more traditional conservatives . '
' Neocons , ' he adds , ' would prefer not to have large budget deficits , but it is in the nature of democracy [ and here he may be onto something ] . . . that one sometimes must shoulder budgetary deficits as the cost ( temporary , one hopes ) of pursuing economic growth . '
In other words , to heck with the future !
Open the floodgates of the treasury while at the same time reducing the revenues coming in , and do n't worry about how your children and grandchildren are going to pay the bills .
What matters now is economic growth to keep the sheeple fat , dumb , and happy so that we neocons can retain and expand our power at their expense .
In case what he has written thus far has still failed to convince the reader that neoconservatism is merely a variant on liberalism , Kristol then opens up both barrels with his description of the neocon view of the state .
' Neocons do not like the concentration of services in the welfare state and are happy to study [ note that he does n't say implement ] alternative ways of delivering these services .
But they are impatient with the Hayekian notion that we are on ' the road to serfdom . '
Neocons do not feel that kind of alarm or anxiety about the growth of the state in the past century , seeing it as natural , indeed inevitable . '
Why , really , should they be alarmed ?
The state is their god , and they derive their power from expanding its reach .
As far as Kristol is concerned , the ' 19th - century idea ' of government as the enemy of human freedom ' was a historical eccentricity . '
Here again one can see the Marxist mind of ' former ' liberals at work :
The total state is inevitable , so why fight it ?
Accept it , enjoy it , and get as much as you can out of it .
Stop fretting about lost liberty .
As a result , ' [ n ] eocons feel at home in today 's America to a degree that more traditional conservatives do not . '
Now for the big subject of the day : ' foreign policy , the area of American politics where neoconservatism has recently been the focus of media attention , ' as Kristol puts it .
That , of course , is because neocon foreign policy is exemplified by precisely the foreign policy that the Bush administration has implemented , contrary to Bush 's paean to a ' humbler ' foreign policy while campaigning .
It seeks to dominate the world at any cost , sending troops to far - flung countries ( Afghanistan , Iraq , Liberia ) in pursuit of , well , hegemony , in the guise of bringing liberation and democracy to the oppressed of the world .
It is completely contrary to the vision of the Founding Fathers and to the American tradition , which is why it had to be imposed on us against our will as well .
Kristol claims that ' there is no set of neoconservative beliefs concerning foreign policy , only a set of attitudes derived from historical experience . '
He lists three ' theses ' guiding neocon foreign policy and adds , parenthetically , 'as a Marxist would say . '
( The apple certainly does n't fall far from the tree .
Does it , Irving ? )
Those three theses ' that patriotism is a good thing , that world government is a bad thing , and that statesmen should be able to distinguish friends from enemies ' seem relatively harmless .
To be fair , Kristol is right in saying that there are no core principles behind neocon foreign policy because these three ' theses ' seem to have little or nothing to do with the paragraphs that follow .
Essentially , neocon foreign policy is that might makes right .
Oh , Kristol does n't come right out and say this , but his words add up to the same thing .
For ' a great power , ' he writes , ' the ' national interest ' is not a geographical term . '
That is , U.S. foreign policy should not be confined to safeguarding the territorial United States .
Oh , no .
We must be concerned with the entire world .
' A larger nation has more extensive interests .
And large nations , whose identity is ideological , like the Soviet Union of yesteryear and the United States of today , inevitably have ideological interests in addition to more material concerns . '
Yes , according to Irving Kristol , neocon foreign policy applies equally to the Soviet Union and the United States , both of whom have ( or had , in the case of the Soviets ) ' ideological interests ' which trump mere territorial concerns .
Kristol further notes that since the U.S. ' will always feel obliged to defend . . . a democratic nation under attack from nondemocratic forces , ' the neocons thus ' feel it necessary to defend Israel today . '
Apparently only the holding of elections , not what those elected governments ' policies are , matters to neocons , and even then they 're more than willing to give some leeway to cooperative dictators .
Once again , I must give Kristol credit for being accurate in his assessment that no central principles ( other than the one left unmentioned , spelled p - o - w - e - r ) guide the neocons in their quest for ' national greatness ' ( as Kristol 's equally arrogant son , William , put it ) .
It 's clear , though , that this power - grubbing , world - dominating foreign policy is certainly not in the interest of the average American , which is why he has to be converted against his will by the neocons .
Kristol continues to celebrate the power of the U. S. , and he notes that ' [ w ] ith power come responsibilities , whether sought or not , whether welcome or not .
And it is a fact that if you have the kind of power we now have , either you will find opportunities to use it , or the world will discover them for you . '
The neocons , of course , are not content to let the world find uses for the power they 've worked so hard to achieve .
As a matter of fact , they 're more than happy to ' find opportunities to use it . '
Whether those ' opportunities ' are in the best interest of the country or the world is irrelevant ; all that matters is that the neocons are the ones finding the opportunities and wielding the power .
Finally , in case any doubt remains as to whether the Bush administration qualifies as neoconservative ' and there are still some out there who believe it remains fully within the American conservative tradition ' Kristol puts all doubt to rest .
Bush and his administration , he says , ' turn out to be quite at home in this new political environment , although it is clear they did not anticipate this role any more than their party as a whole did . '
Face it , says Kristol :
We 've won , and you traditional conservatives in the Republican Party never saw it coming and still do n't know what hit you .
Unfortunately , he 's right .

BBC News , Patras
The local council says his perch is illegally parked and is obstructing drivers because it partially blocks a metered parking space .
Coco the parrot 's owner , Lambros Michalopoulos , says the bird will die if it has to move back inside .
Neither side is backing down so now the dispute is going to the courts .
' Sociable creature '
With his multi-coloured Amazonian plumage and extrovert personality , Coco has , for 18 years , been something of a mascot in this busy port city , with narrow streets and precious few parking places .
Coco could be heading for court
His small perch occupies part of a metered zone and under the zero tolerance rules , the local police have ordered Mr Michalopoulos to pay a heavy fine .
The pet shop owner says he has ignored the authorities because if Coco goes back inside the store permanently the macaw will die because he is a sociable creature who enjoys being with people .
Patras 's Deputy Mayor Spiros Demartinos is embarrassed that Coco 's plight is attracting international attention .
He would prefer to talk about the city 's ambitious plans to use parking revenue for funding bicycle lanes and pedestrian zones .
" Is it bureaucratic to be concerned about the parrot 's safety ? " he asks .
" The parrot 's security is of paramount concern to the council . "
Both sides are refusing to back down and so the dispute is heading to the palace of justice .
Coco 's owner is hoping that the case will be laughed out of court .

After retiring as the Federal Reserve 's second longest ever serving chairman , Alan Greenspan is now cashing in big late in life at age 81 .
He chaired the Fed 's Board of Governors from the time he was appointed in August , 1987 to when he stepped down January 31 , 2006 amidst a hail of ill - deserved praise for his stewardship during good and perilous times .
USA Today noted " the onetime jazz band musician went out on a high note . "
The Wall Street Journal said " his economic legacy ( rests on results ) and seems secure . "
The Washington Post cited his " nearly mythical status . "
Stanford Washington Research Group chief strategist Greg Valliere called him a " giant , " and Bob Woodward called him " Maestro " in his cloying hagiography ( now priced $ 1.99 used on Alibris and $ 2.19 on Amazon ) that was published in 2000 as the Greenspan - built house of cards was collapsing .
The book was an adoring tribute to a man he called a symbol of American economic preeminence , who the Financial Times also praised as " An Activist Unafraid to Depart From the Rule " - by taking from the public and giving to the rich .
Others joined the chorus , too , lauding his steady , disciplined hand on the monetary steering wheel , his success keeping inflation and unemployment low , and his having represented the embodiment of prosperity in compiling a record of achievement his successor will be hard - pressed to match .
In 2004 , William Greider in The Nation magazine had a different view .
He 's the author of " Secrets of the Temple " on " how the Federal Reserve runs the country . "
He wrote Greenspan " ranks among the most duplicitous figures to serve in modern American government ( who used ) his exalted status as economic wizard ( to ) regularly corrupt the political dialogue by sowing outrageously false impressions among gullible members of Congress and adoring financial reporters . "
They were front and center in the New York Times for the man who " steer ( ed ) the economy through multiple calamities and ultimately .... one of the longest economic booms in history ....( He earned his bona fides ) weather ( ing ) the Black Monday stock crash of 1987 ( and in 18 and a half years in office ) achieved more celebrity than most rock stars " and may now approach them in earnings .
The new book of his memoirs " The Age of Turbulence " is just out for which his reported advance exceeded $ 8.5 million ( second only to Bill Clinton 's $ 10 for his memoirs ) plus additional royalties if sales exceed 1.9 million copies .
They may given the amount of high - impact publicity it and he are getting nonstop .
And that 's not all .
He 's in great demand on the lecture circuit at six figure fees , has his own consulting firm , Greenspan Associates LLC , and his lawyer , Robert Barnett says " virtually every major investment - banking firm " in the world wants to hire him for his rainmaking connections .
They have value , not his market advice , best avoided for the man who engineered the largest ever stock market bubble and bust in history through incompetence , timidity , dereliction of duty , and subservience to the capital interests he represented at the expense of the greater good and a sustained sound economy he did n't worry about nor did Wall Street .
For firms on the Street and big banks , he could do no wrong and was above reproach for letting them cash in big and then get plenty of advance warning when to exit .
Most ordinary investors were n't so fortunate .
They 're not insiders and were caught flat - footed by advice from market pundit fraudsters and the most influential one of all in the Fed Chairman .
Just weeks before the market peak in January , 2000 , he claimed " the American economy was experiencing a once - in - a - century acceleration of innovation , which propelled forward productivity , output , corporate profits and stock prices at a pace not seen in generations , if ever . "
It was hype and nonsense and on a par with famed economist and professor Irving Fisher 's remarks just before the 1929 stock market crash and Great Depression when he claimed economic fundamentals in the country were strong , stocks undervalued , and an unending period of prosperity lay ahead .
It took a world war a decade later , not market magic , for them to arrive , but before it did Fisher kept insisting in the early 1930s recovery was just around the corner .
It 's the same way Wall Street touts operate today on gullible investors who even after they 've been had are easy prey again for the next con .
And they 're really in trouble when it comes from the " Maestro , " who at the height of the stock market bubble said : " Lofty equity prices have reduced the cost of capital .
The result has been a veritable explosion of spending on high - tech equipment ...
And I see nothing to suggest that these opportunities will peter out anytime soon ....
Indeed many argue that the pace of innovation will continue to quicken .... to exploit the still largely untapped potential for e-commerce , especially the business - to - business arena . "
One week later , the Nasdaq peaked at 5048 and crashed to a low of 1114 on October 9 , 2002 .
It lost 78 % of its value , the S&P 500 stock index dropped 49 % , and retail investors lost out while Greenspan was busy engineering another bubble with a tsunami of easy money for Wall Street and big investors .
It 's now unwinding as he gets a big payday for his memoirs and a chance to rewrite history .
He aims to raise himself to sainthood and at the same time distance himself from the very costly policies he implemented on top of trillions he helped scam in the greatest modern era wealth transfer from the public to the rich .
More on that below .
Greenspan 's Background and Tenure as Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan grew up in New York , got his B.A. and M.A. in economics from New York University and later was awarded a Ph.D. in economics from Columbia without completing a dissertation the degree usually requires .
In a highly unusual move , Columbia made an exception in his case .
Early on , he became enamored with free market ideologue Ayn Rand , wrote for her newsletters and authored three essays for her book " Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal . "
It expressed her views on capitalism 's " moral aspects " and her attempt ( with Greenspan 's help ) to rescue it from its " alleged champions who are responsible for the fact that capitalism is being destroyed without a hearing ( or ) trial , without any public knowledge of its principles , its nature , its history , or its moral meaning . "
That was in 1966 when Rand , a staunch libertarian as is Greenspan , believed fundamentalist capitalism was being battered by a flood of altruism in the wake of New Deal and Great Society programs she ( and Greenspan ) abhorred .
She defended big business , made excuses for its wars , and denounced the student rebellion at the time and the evils of altruism .
Greenspan concurred , maintained a 20 year association with Rand ( who died in 1982 ) , and never looked back .
From 1948 until his 1987 Federal Reserve appointment , he served as Richard Nixon 's domestic policy coordinator in his 1968 nomination campaign and later as Gerald Ford 's Council of Economic Advisers Chairman .
He also headed the economic consulting firm , Townsend - Greenspan & Company , from 1955 - 1987 .
Its forecasting record was so poor it was about to be liquidated when he left to join the Fed .
A former competitor , Pierre Renfret , noted : " When Greenspan closed down his economic consulting business to ( become Fed Chairman ) he did so because he had no clients left and the business was going under ( and we found ) out he had none ( of his employees left ) . "
That made him Reagan 's perfect Fed Chairman choice , and Renfret added it was Greenspan 's failure in private business that got him into government service in the first place .
He would n't disappoint as Wall Street 's man from the start .
He bailed it out in 1987 after the disastrous October black Monday .
It was the same way he did in it later in 1998 following Long Term Capital Management 's collapse and again after the dot - com bubble burst .
It was by his favorite monetary medicine guaranteed to work when taken as directed - floods of easy money followed by still more until the patient is healed , unmindful that the cure may be worse than the disease .
No matter , it 's a new Chairman 's problem with Greenspan claiming no culpability for his 18 and a half year tenure of misdeeds , subservience to capital , and contempt for the public interest .
His new book claims the opposite .
It 's a breathtaking example of historical revisionism that 's become standard practice for the man Sydney Morning News ' Political and International Editor Peter Hartcher calls " Bubble Man " in his new book by that title .
In it , he quotes Bob Woodward saying Greenspan " believed he had done all he could " to contain over - exuberance when , in fact , he let it get out of control .
He now claims :
-- he did n't support George Bush 's regressive tax cuts for the rich ( that helped create huge budget deficits ) .
In fact , he did , and in 2001 wholeheartedly endorsed this centerpiece of the administration 's economic policy in his testimony before the Senate Budget Committee .
At the time , he cited the economic slowdown saying : " Should current economic weakness spread .... having a tax cut .... may .... do noticeable good . "
-- he 's " saddened ( in his book ) that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : the Iraq war is largely about oil . "
In his typical obfuscating way to confuse and have things both ways , he tried clarifying his position in a September interview claiming : " I was not saying that that 's the administration 's motive .
I 'm just saying that if somebody asked me , are we fortunate in taking out Saddam ?
I would say it was essential . "
He failed to say he supported the Bush administration agenda across the board , including the Afghanistan and Iraq wars , with reasons given at the time he 's now distancing himself from .
-- no responsibility for the 2000 stock market bubble .
He falsely claimed he never saw it coming while providing generous amounts of liquidity to fuel it .
After citing the market 's " irrational exuberance " in a December , 1996 speech , he failed to curb it and could have by raising interest rates , margin requirements , and jawboning investors to cool an overheated market to restore stability for long - term economic growth .
Instead , he did nothing .
He failed to take away the punch bowl , created a bubble , and allowed it to burst causing investors ( mostly retail ones ) to lose trillions .
-- no responsibility for the housing and bond bubbles he created by cutting interest rates aggressively to 1 % and flooding the markets with liquidity .
As things got out of hand , timely responsible action could have avoided the summer , 2007 credit crisis .
Again , he allowed a bad situation to get worse to keep the party going and allow lenders to profit hugely .
In the unprecedented run -up in house prices to an $ 8 trillion wealth bubble , he derided critics claiming anything was wrong .
He even encouraged homebuyers to take out adjustable rate mortgages , approved of very risky no down payment purchases , created the subprime mess as a consequence , and is n't around to address buyers faced with $ 1.2 trillion in mortgage resets later this year and next that will cause many thousands of painful foreclosures .
Affected homeowners wo n't likely be cheered by his speech - making bunkum that bubble level asset prices proved his monetary policies worked by getting investors to demand lower risk premiums .
They also wo n't be calmed by his arrogant claim that it's " simply not realistic " to expect the Fed to identify and deflate asset bubbles when it 's real role is to champion flexible and unregulated markets leaving everyone unprotected on our own .
-- no responsibility for allowing outstanding US debt to more than triple to around $ 40 trillion on his watch that one analyst calls his " most conspicuous achievement . "
Those having to pay it off wo n't thank him .
Greenspan 's Role in the Greatest Modern Era Wealth Transfer from the Public to the Rich
Greenspan was a one - man wrecking crew years before he became Fed Chairman , and his earlier role likely sealed the job for him as a man the power elite could trust .
He earned his stripes and then some for his role in charge of the National Commission on Social Security Reform ( called the Greenspan Commission ) .
He was appointed by Ronald Reagan to chair it in 1981 to study and recommend actions to deal with " the short - term financing crisis that Social Security faced ....( with claims the ) Old - Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund would run out of money .... as early as August , 1983 . "
There was just one problem .
It was a hoax , but who'd know as the dominant media stayed silent .
They let the Commission do its work that would end up transfering trillions of public dollars to the rich .
It represents one of the greatest ever heists in plain sight , still ongoing and greater than ever , with no one crying foul to stop it .
The Commission issued its report in January , 1983 , and Congress used it as the basis for the 1983 Social Security Amendments to " resolve short - term financing problem (s ) and ( make ) many other significant changes in Social Security law " with the public none the wiser it was a scam harming them .
The Commission recommended :
-- Social Security remain government funded and not become a voluntary program ( that would have killed it ) ;
-- $ 150 - 200 billion in either additional income or decreased outgo be provided the Old Age , Survivors , and Disability Insurance ( OASDI ) Trust Funds in calendar years 1983 - 89 ;
-- the actuarial imbalance for the 75 year Trust Funds valuation period of an average 1.80 % of taxable payroll be resolved ;
-- a " consensus package " to fix the problem by raising payroll taxes on incomes but exempting the rich beyond a maximum level taxed .
Also a gradual increase in the retirement age and various other possible short and longer range options for consideration .
The result today is low income earners pay more in payroll than income tax .
For bottom level earners , the burden is especially onerous .
They pay no income tax but are n't exempt from 6.2 % of their wages going for Social Security and Medicare .
-- coverage under OASDI be extended on a mandatory , basis as of January 1 , 1984 , to all newly hired civilian employees of the federal government and all employees of nonprofit organizations ;
-- state and local governments that elected coverage for their employees under the OASDI - HI program not be allowed to terminate it in the future ;
-- the method of computing benefits be revised to exclude benefits that can accrue to individuals from non-covered OASDI employment and only be for the period when they became eligible - to eliminate " windfall " benefits ;
-- 50 % of OASDI benefits should henceforth be taxable as ordinary income for individuals earning $ 20,000 or more and married couples $ 25,000 or more ;
-- in addition , other recommendations concerning cost of living adjustments , the law pertaining to surviving spouses who remarry after age 60 , divorced spouses , disabled widows and widowers , and for scheduled payroll tax increases to move up to earlier years up to 1990 after which no further change be made with the wage base rising and is now at a level of $ 97,500 in 2007 at a tax rate of 6.2 % matched by employers ;
-- self - employed persons beginning in 1984 pay the combined employer - employee rates now at 12.4 % with half considered a business expense ;
-- in addition , a number of other changes recommended that in total would penalize the public to benefit the most well - off that was the whole idea of the scheme in the first place .
The public was told the Commission recommendations of 1983 were supposed to make Social Security fiscally sound for the next 75 years .
They were n't told there was no problem to fix and the changes enacted were to transfer massive wealth from the public to the rich .
It was one part of an overall Reagan administration scheme that included huge individual and corporate tax cuts that took place from 1981 to 1986 .
The rich benefitted most with top rates dropping from 70 % in 1981 to 50 % over three years and then to 28 % in 1986 while the bottom rate actually rose from 11 to 15 % .
It was the first time US income tax rates were ever reduced at the top and raised at the bottom simultaneously .
But it was far worse than that .
In only a few years , Reagan got enacted the largest ever US income tax cut ( mostly for the rich ) while instituting the greatest ever increase entirely against working Americans earning $ 30,000 or less .
Alan Greenspan engineered it for him by supporting income tax cuts and doubling the payroll tax to defray the revenue shortfall .
He also recommended raiding the Social Security Trust Fund to offset the deficit , and who'd know the difference .
His scheme helped make the US tax code hugely regressive as well as for the first time transform a pay - as - you - go retirement and disability benefits program into one where wage earner contributions subsidize the rich as well as support current beneficiaries .
As a consequence , the wealth gap widened , continued under Clinton but became unprecedented under George W. Bush with Greenspan at it again .
He supported the administration 's wealth transfer scheme to the rich and outsized corporate subsidies with the public getting stuck with out - of - control deficits , deep social service cuts , and a new Treasury Department report just out promising more of the same .
It claims Social Security faces a $ 13.6 trillion shortfall " over the indefinite future , " " reforms " are needed , delaying them punishes younger workers , and the program " can be made permanently solvent only by reducing the present value of scheduled benefits and / or increasing the present value of scheduled tax increases . "
Translation : cut benefits deeply , raise payroll taxes , and privatize Social Security so more public wealth goes to Wall Street and big investors .
Already the top 1 % owns 40 % of global assets ; the top 10 % 85 % of them ; the top 1 % in the US controls one - third of the nation 's wealth ; the bottom 80 % just 15.3 % ; and the top 20 % 84.7 % .
In contrast , the poorest 20 % are in debt , owe more than they own , and it 's getting worse .
A generation of financial manipulation devastated working Americans , but it 's even worse than that .
Added are the effects of globalization , automation , outsourcing , the shift from manufacturing to services , deregulation , other harmful economic factors plus weak unions just gotten far weaker in the wake of the UAW September membership sellout to General Motors .
The tentative agreement reached ( for members to vote on ) amounted to an unconditional surrender by a corrupted leadership after a two day walkout that was likely orchestrated in advance to cause GM the least pain .
If the package is approved as is likely , it will encourage other companies to offer similar deals , take it or leave it .
Organized labor suffered another grievous blow , corporate giants gained , and are more empowered than ever to win out at the expense of workers ' futures .
The whole scheme was kick - started under Ronald Reagan .
Between his tax cuts for the rich and the Greenspan Commission 's orchestrated Social Security heist , working Americans lost out in a generational wealth transfer shift now exceeding $ 1 trillion annually from 90 million working class households to for - profit corporations and the richest 1 % of the population .
It created an unprecedented wealth disparity that continues to grow , shames the nation and is destroying the bedrock middle class without which democracy can't survive .
Greenspan helped orchestrate it with economist Ravi Batra calling his economics " Greenomics " in his 2005 book " Greenspan 's Fraud . "
It " turns out to be Greedomics " advocating anti-trust laws , regulations and social services be ended so " nothing .... interfere(s ) with business greed and the pursuit of profits . "
It wo n't affect the " Maestro . "
He 's getting by quite nicely on his six figure retirement income that 's just a drop in the bucket supplementing the millions he 's making as payback for the trillions he helped shift to the rich and super - rich .
They take care of their own , and Greenspan is one of them .

Go ! flight report finds no mechanical flaws
The National Transportation Safety Board released a preliminary report of its investigation into a go !
airlines flight that flew past the Hilo airport on Feb. 13 , apparently because the two pilots fell asleep .
A check of the plane after the flight showed no problems with its pressurization system or carbon monoxide in the plane , according to the report .
The NTSB also says there were 40 passengers and three crewmembers on the flight , which left Honolulu at 9:16 a.m .
Flight 1002 was at 21,000 feet when air traffic controllers made several attempts to contact the pilots .
Controllers contacted the plane at about 10 a.m. , but by that time the plane had flown about 15 miles past the airport .
It landed safely about 15 minutes later .
The preliminary report draws no conclusions about why the plane overshot the airport .
Mesa Air Group , which owns go ! , has suspended the two pilots .
FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said the NTSB and the FAA are conducting separate investigations into whether the captain and first officer fell asleep during the flight .
Flight logs obtained by the Star - Bulletin say both pilots finished their Feb. 12 shift at 2:47 p.m. and returned to duty at 5:40 a.m .
In Gifu Prefecture , Japan , there is an unusual solar building called the Solar Ark , built by Sanyo .
It ’s one of the most impressive solar buildings in the world .
Passengers on high - speed bullet trains can’t help but notice the edifice as they ride past on a nearby railway line .
The building was built to symbolize the goal of becoming a “ clean energy society ” and it houses a solar museum inside .
The Ark incorporates 5,046 solar panels , and produces about 630 kW of power , which means 530,000 kWh of clean energy is produced annually by the structure .
For those interested in the exact dimension : the Solar Ark is 315 meters ( 1,033 feet ) long and weighs 3000 tonnes .
It includes 412 lighting units between the solar panels , each with 51 red , green and blue LEDs .
The entire system is computer - controlled and can create a variety of images and characters .
There ’s an interesting article in PHOTON magazine , that says that Sanyo actually built the Ark out of solar panels that were returned to the company .
The Bali negotiations , meant to lay the groundwork for a successor to the Kyoto Protocols , are nearing their end , and the picture of what will emerge has become more clear .
Despite an impassioned plea by the Secretary - General of the UN and strong backing from the nations of the European Union , the US and China have succeeded in preventing any agreements on hard targets for future carbon reductions .
Progress has been made , however , in addressing some of the concerns of the developing world .
Although the Bali negotiations began last week , many high - level officials are arriving now , after the preliminary work has been completed .
Ban Kai-Moon , Secretary - General of the UN , spoke to the gathered delegates earlier today , calling climate change , " the moral challenge of our generation . "
He presented inaction as a threat to future inhabitants of the planet : " Succeeding generations depend on us , " he said .
" We can not rob our children of their future . "
To a large extent , however , chances for any definitive action had already passed by the time he spoke .
The US delegation entered these negotiations with the intention of blocking any hard limits on carbon emissions , and they carried the day over the objections of the European Union and most developing nations .
This position is in keeping with the Bush administration 's promotion of long - term aspirational goals , rather than strict limits .
When talking to reporters after his speech , Ban apparently accepted that setting limits at this stage , " may be too ambitions , " according to the Associated Press .
" Practically speaking , " he said , " this will have to be negotiated down the road . "
With no movement on that front , attention has shifted towards a second major goal of the Bali meeting , aid to the developing world .
The New York Times is reporting that more significant progress has been made on that front .
Kyoto had set up a mechanism for funding adaptation work in the developing world , but the effort was chronically underfunded and developing nations have found it difficult to get projects approved .
The new agreement streamlines the approval process and levies a tax on carbon trading markets to fund the program .
Although this is still unlikely to cover anywhere close to the predicted costs the developing world will face due to climate change , the Times suggests that this agreement is being viewed by those nations as a sign that their concerns are at least being treated seriously .
Given the stated positions of major participants going into these talks , these results are fairly predictable .
Much of the hard work involved in forging a binding agreement has been put off to the future .
Perhaps the most significant consequence of the Bali negotiations is that any agreement on binding emissions limits is unlikely to be completed prior to the end of the Bush administration .
Many of the presidential candidates appear far more willing to consider mandated limits on carbon emissions , raising the possibility that the negotiations that have been put off to the future will be less contentious when that future arrives .
UPDATE : The BBC is reporting that the European Union is threatening to retaliate for the US ' intransigence at Bali by boycotting future climate talks hosted by the White House .
These talks are intended to set the aspirational goals for emissions curbs favored by the US ; the absence of major emitters would make them largely pointless .
The report suggests that this threat may simply be an EU negotiating ploy , but many have interpreted the Washington talks as little more than an attempt to undermine Bali in the first place .
Ideas come from everywhere .
While reading this blog , you might come across interesting snippets that you ’d like to save .
While writing code , you might be hit by an idea for something you want to do with the program .
While on a phone call , you might need to write down what you need to prepare for a meeting the next day .
How do you take notes now ?
Do you jot your notes on a scrap of paper or into a leather notebook ?
Do you copy and paste what you ’re looking at into a plain text file or document ?
Do you scribble things into a personal digital assistant ?
I ’ve tried different note - taking strategies : colorful mindmaps , outlined text files , even voice recordings .
I felt frustrated every time I had to write down whose e-mail or which webpage prompted the note ( should n’t the computer do that automatically ? ) , but I was even more frustrated when I ’d come across a note and not remember why I wrote it .
Remember changed all that for me .
The key ideas behind Remember are that you should be able to write notes with minimal distraction , and that as the context should be automatically picked up so that you do n’t have to write it down .
If you ’re writing a note based on a mail message , Remember will pick up the details of the message and create a hyperlink so that you can view the original message when reviewing your notes .
If you ’re working on a file , Remember will link to it so that you can jump back to it .
If you ’re browsing a web page ( in Emacs , of course ) , Remember will remember the title and URL , so that you can go back to the page when you want to clarify something in your notes .
After you save the note , you ’ll be back in the same environment you were : no need to switch applications and no need to remember different keyboard shortcuts .
You might think that Remember ’s only worth it if you do _everything_ in Emacs .
For me , it worked the other way around .
I started by using Remember to take notes in Planner , a personal information manager available for Emacs .
As I got accustomed to the way Remember and Planner just automatically hyperlinked to whatever I was looking at , I thought :
Why does n’t my mail client do this ?
Why does n’t my web browser do this ?
Why does n’t my chat client do this ?
So I ended up reading through the manuals , figuring out how to do all these things in Emacsâ € ” and I loved it , eventually doing most of my work ( and play ! ) within an Emacs frame .
Although I use other applications now , like Lotus Notes for work mail and Mozilla Firefox for browsing , I still switch back to Emacs for my notes .
In this section , you ’ll learn how to set up Remember and take quick notes in Emacs .
We ’ll start by configuring Remember to save your notes to a file , and how to configure Remember to save to different places depending on the content .
You ’ll also learn how to quickly search your notes file for entries .
You can also integrate Remember into other note - taking systems in Emacs .
The sections that cover those systems will also show you how to configure Remember to save your notes there .
Setting Up Remember
Remember is a separate package , which you can download from https://gna.org/projects/remember-el .
As of this writing , the latest stable release is Remember 1.9 .
Download the latest version and unpack it into your ~/ elisp directory .
You should end up with a new directory , ~/ elisp / remember - 1.9 .
To configure Remember to save to plain text files , add this code to your ~/.emacs and evaluate it :
( add - to - list ' load - path " ~/elisp/remember - 1.9 " ) ;; ( 1 ) ( require ' remember - autoloads ) ( setq remember - data - file " ~/notes.txt " ) ;; ( 2 ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C-c r " ) ' remember ) ;; ( 3 ) ( defun wicked / remember - review - file () " Open `remember - data - file ' . " ( interactive ) ( find - file - other - window remember - data - file ) ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C- c R " ) ' wicked/remember -review - file ) ;; ( 4 )
;; Not ( global - set - key ( kbd " C-c r " ) ... as originally written ...
Thanks for catching that , Seth !
1 : Change this to the directory that contains remember.el
2 : Notes will be saved to this file .
You can change this if you want ; just keep in mind that this section refers to ~/ notes.
txt .
3 : C-c r ( remember ) is a handy shortcut key for remember .
You can also bind it to other shortcut keys such as F9 r .
4 : This shortcut makes it easy to check your remembered notes .
After you ’ve configured Remember , try it out by typing C-c r ( remember ) .
Your Emacs frame will be split in two , and one of the windows will be a * Remember * buffer .
Type your note .
The first line will be the headline , and the rest of the buffer will be the body of the note .
If you call C-c r ( remember ) from a file , the filename will automatically be included at the end of the buffer .
Type C-c C-c ( remember - buffer ) to save the note .
Try it now by typing C-c r ( remember ) to bring up the buffer , typing in a short note , and using C-c c ( remember - buffer ) to save it .
If you open ~/ notes . txt to review your note , you ’ll find something like this :
** Sat Jan 12 14:43:02 2008
( Your headline goes here )
Your note body goes here / home / sacha/ .emacs
You can even save yourself some copying and pasting .
Mark a region of text and use C-u C-c r ( remember ) .
The selected text will be included in the buffer , so all you have to do is comment on it .
Make a habit of typing C - c C-r or C-u C-c C-r ( remember ) when you need to remember something .
Type C-c C-c ( remember - buffer ) to get back to work , knowing that your notes have been safely saved in your ~/ notes .
txt file .
Reviewing Your Notes
Use C-c R ( wicked / remember - review - file ) to check your notes , or open ~/ notes .
txt yourself .
To search your notes , use C-c R ( wicked / remember - review - file ) to open the file , then use C-s ( isearch - forward ) to search for words interactively , or use M-x occur to find all lines containing a word .
You may notice that the default format that Remember uses is an outline format that is compatible with Org and Allout , both of which have powerful outline - editing tools .
I prefer Org ’s outline - editing commands , and you ’ll learn about them in the “ Outline Notes with Org ” section .
Here ’s a quick summary .
First , you need to switch the buffer to Org mode by typing M-x org - mode .
To automatically open your notes file in Org mode , add
-*- mode : org -*-
to the first line of your ~/ notes.txt .
Then , when you open your ~/ notes .
txt file , it will be in Org mode .
You can quickly collapse or expand all the outline entries by pressing S - TAB ( org- shifttab ) .
To collapse or expand a single entry , move the point to the headline ( the line beginning with * , ** , or any number of asterisks ) , then press TAB ( org - cycle ) .
To move an entry up or down , move the point to the headline and press S - UP ( org - shiftup ) or S - DOWN ( org - shiftdown ) .
To demote or promote a heading , press M - RIGHT ( org - metaright ) or M - LEFT ( org- metaleft ) .
You can treat ~/ notes .
txt as your inbox , and keep your organized notes in another file or groups of files .
Cut and paste the text between the files to clear your inbox , and use M-x grep to search multiple files .
Alternatively , you can keep all of your notes in one large text file , and use C-s ( isearch - forward ) and M-x occur to search for information .
Now you know the basics of remembering information , saving it into a file , and reviewing the file .
By default , Remember annotates your notes with a filename , if you were looking at a file when you called C-c r ( remember ) .
As you learn more about Emacs , you may want to configure Remember to add more intelligent annotations and other text to the Remember buffer .
The more work Remember does for you , the less work you have to do !
Enabling annotation functions
The easiest way to get Remember to automatically understand mail messages , Web pages , info files , BBDB contact records , and other sources of information in Emacs is to use either Org or Planner .
To learn how to integrate Remember with either Org or Planner , read the section on “ Outline Your Notes with Org ” and “ Writing Your Journal with Planner ” .
You can also define your own annotation functions .
When you call C-c r ( remember ) from a buffer , Remember goes through each of the functions in remember - annotation - functions , and it uses the first non-nil value returned .
For example , you may work with many temporary buffers that do n’t have filenames .
To create an annotation function that adds buffer names , add the following code to your ~/.emacs after the basic Remember configuration code :
( eval - after - load ' remember '( progn ( add- to- list ' remember-annotation - functions ' buffer - name t ) ) )
This adds buffer - name to the end of the annotation list , making it a last resort .
What if you want line numbers included with the filename or buffer name ?
You could replace the previous code with this :
( defun wicked / remember-line-numbers-and-file-names () " Return FILENAME line NUMBER . " ( save - restriction ( widen ) ( format " %s line % d " ( or ( buffer - file - name ) ( buffer - name ) ) ( line - number - at - pos ) ) ) ) ( eval - after - load ' remember '( progn ( add- to- list ' remember-annotation- functions ' wicked/remember-line-numbers-and- file-names ) ) )
With that code , C-c r ( remember ) will automatically pick up the line number from your file or buffer .
By default , Remember saves your notes to a plain - text file , so you ’ll have to open the files manually .
The command M-x ffap or find - find - file - at - point may be convenient .
If you want hyperlinks that you can visit easily , consider saving your notes in an Org or Planner file instead .
Now you ’ve got context .
What else can you do with the Remember buffer ?
Adding Other Text to the Remember Buffer
Remember has plenty of hooks that let you modify the behavior .
For example , you might want to insert a random tagline or fortune - cookie saying whenever you create a note .
This is a fun way to encourage yourself to write more , because then there ’s a little surprise every time you open a Remember buffer .
Here is a totally small - scale way to use random lines from a text file .
Let ’s say that you have a text file made up of movie quotes , taglines , knock - knock jokes , or short fortune - cookie sayings .
When I wrote this code , I used Japanese / English sentence pairs about cats , because I was studying Japanese .
You can use whatever tickles your fancy , as long as this text file ( ~/taglines.txt ) has one line per saying .
( defun wicked / random - tagline ( &optional file ) " Return a random tagline . " ( with - current - buffer ( find - file - noselect ( or file " ~/taglines.txt " ) ) ( goto - char ( random ( point - max ) ) ) ( let ( ( string ( buffer - substring ( line - beginning - position ) ( line- end- position ) ) ) ) string ) ) ) ( eval - after - load ' remember '( progn ( defadvice remember ( after wicked activate ) " Add random tagline . " ( save - excursion ( goto - char ( point - max ) ) ( insert "
" ( wicked /random - tagline ) "
" ) ) ) ) )
If you want multi-line sayings , look into the Emacs fortune cookie package , and replace wicked / random - tagline with a function that returns a random string .
This code modifies the behavior of C-c r ( remember ) by inserting a random tagline after the buffer has been prepared .
You can use the same idea to insert a timestamp noting the time you started , use a template , or modify the text in other ways .
Saving to Different Places
You can also change how Remember saves its notes .
For example , if you want all of the notes that contain the word “ : EMACS : ” or “ : WORK : ” to go into separate files , you can add this code to your ~/.emacs :
( defvar wicked / remember - keywords '(( " : EMACS : " . " ~/emacs.txt " ) ( " : WORK : " . " ~/work.txt " ) ) " * List of ( REGEXP . FILENAME ) .
If an entry matches REGEXP , it will be storied in FILENAME .
The first regular expression that matches is used . " )
( eval - after - load ' remember '( progn ( defadvice remember - region ( around wicked activate ) " Save notes matching `wicked / remember - keywords ' elsewhere . " ( let * ( ( b ( or beg ( min ( point ) ( or ( mark ) ( point - min ) ) ) ) ) ( e ( or end ( max ( point ) ( or ( mark ) ( point - max ) ) ) ) ) ( string ( buffer - substring - no - properties b e ) ) ( done nil ) ( keywords wicked / remember - keywords ) ) ( while keywords ( when ( string - match ( caar keywords ) string ) ( let ( ( remember - data - file ( cdar keywords ) ) ) ad - do - it ) ( setq keywords nil done t ) ) ( setq keywords ( cdr keywords ) ) ) ( unless done ad - do - it ) ) ) ) )
You can even configure Remember to use different handler functions .
This chapter covers several note - taking systems for Emacs , and you may want to use Remember to save to more than one note - taking system .
For example , you can set up C - c r p to start a Remember buffer that saves to Planner , and C - c r o to start a Remember buffer that saves to Org .
Here ’s the code for your ~/.emacs :
( defun wicked / remember - to-org () " Remember to Org. " ( let ( ( remember-annotation - functions ; ; ( 1 ) ( cons ' org - remember - annotation remember - annotation - functions ) ) ) ( remember ) ( set ( make- variable - buffer-local ' remember -handler - functions ) ' ( org- remember - handler ) ) ) ) ;; ( 2 ) ( defun wicked / remember - to- planner () " Remember to Planner . " ( let ( ( remember-annotation - functions ; ; ( 3 ) ( append planner - annotation - functions remember - annotation - functions ) ) ) ( remember ) ( set ( make-variable - buffer-local ' remember-handler-functions ) '( remember - planner - append ) ) ) ) ;; ( 4 ) ( global - unset - key ( kbd " C-c r " ) ) ;; ( 5 ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C-c r o " ) ' wicked/remember - to-org ) ( global - set - key ( kbd " C-c r p " ) ' wicked/remember-to- planner )
1 : We need to make sure that Org- compatible links are created .
2 : This makes C-c C-c save the note to the Org file .
3 : Planner uses a list of annotation functions , so we add all of them to the beginning of the list .
4 : This makes C-c C-c save the note to the Planner page .
5 : We need to unset keyboard shortcuts before we can set longer keyboard shortcuts that start with the same sequence .
To learn more about configuring Remember with the different note - taking systems , read the sections for those systems .

In the daytime the view from Cerro Pachon , a rocky , desolate peak high above Chile , offers a breathtaking vista of the Andes .
Mountains of rock topped with snow and glaciers seem to touch the heavens .
Come nightfall , the Andes disappear into gloom and then the real show begins .
As if someone had flicked a switch , the gleam of millions of planets and stars studs the inky blackness overhead .
The sky seems too immense to absorb , even for giant telescopes .
They focus on one tiny portion at a time , pinpricks in the cosmos , because traditionally astronomers like to dwell on detail .
Not any more .
Cerro Pachon is to host the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope , a near $ 400 m ( £ 203 m ) project that will survey the entire sky several times a week - something never done before .
Every 15 seconds it will take an image seven times the diameter of the moon , adding up , every three days , to a full panorama of the heavens .
Boasting 3,200 megapixels , it will be the world 's biggest digital camera .
" Most telescopes look at a tiny part of the sky , to look deep and in detail .
We want to look broadly , to cover everything , " Victor Krabbendam , the deputy project manager , said yesterday .
This week the telescope took a step closer to reality after donations from two geeky philanthropic billionaires who are entranced by the technology and its possibilities .
Bill Gates gave $ 10 m from his private fortune and a former Microsoft colleague , Charles Simonyi , gave $ 20 m through his Fund for Arts and Sciences .
Gates , one of the world 's richest men , said the telescope would turn astronomy into a software issue by writing code and database queries to mine the night sky and recover its secrets .
" LSST is truly an internet telescope which will put terabytes of data each night into the hands of anyone that wants to explore it .
[ It is ] a shared resource for all humanity - the ultimate network peripheral device to explore the universe , " he said .
The donations will keep on track the construction of three large mirrors and three refractive lenses which are the most important and expensive part of the machine .
The first stages of production for the two largest mirrors are under way at the Mirror Laboratory at the University of Arizona .
Launched in 2000 , the project is a partnership based in Tucson , Arizona , and split among 23 universities , laboratories and private entities .
Once the mirrors are ready they will be hauled up the 2,690 - metre peak and installed in a dome due for construction in 2011 .
" First light " , as astronomers call their scoping , should begin four years later .
The camera is expected to take more than 200,000 pictures .
Processing that information is expected to be the most technically difficult part of the project .
The camera 's 15 second exposure should be long enough to record images of even very faint objects such as asteroids and so - called near - Earth objects .
By monitoring them night after night , it should be possible to infer their orbit around the sun and hence how likely they are to slam into Earth .
That is how the project 's director sold the LSST to congressmen in November .
" The ability to detect virtually every potentially hazardous near - Earth object and determine its orbit with precision transforms that statistical threat into a deterministic prediction , " said Anthony Tyson , at the University of California , Davis .
But it will also be useful for basic science .
Its time - lapse images can be used to create 3D maps of the mass distribution in the universe .
That should not only help to trace billions of galaxies , but also tell cosmologists more about the mysterious and recently discovered " dark energy " that is driving the expansion of the universe .
Every night the telescope will pull in 30 terabytes of image data ( about 190 times more than a top of the range iPod ) which will be made available free on the internet .
" People can find out what 's going on everywhere in the sky , and no one has ever done that before - not even come close , " said Donald Sweeney , the project manager .
" There are lots of things that happen every night in the sky , and no one has been able to track them and detect them . "
Cerro Pachon , located in northern Chile near the city of Vicuña , is a foothill of the Andes but high enough to escape haze and light pollution .
It was chosen over a site in Mexico because it hosts two other large telescopes known as Gemini South and SOAR , delivering a ready - made astronomy infrastructure .
" It 's very beautiful up there , very rocky and quiet .
You can see glaciers in the distance , " Krabbendam said .
This week 's donations would keep the project on schedule by enabling the early fabrication of large optics and other long - lead components of the telescope system , Sweeney said .
When working together at Microsoft , Gates and Simonyi became fascinated with stretching software and the internet 's possibilities .
Simonyi , estimated to be worth $ 1bn , is also obsessed by space .
Last year be became the fifth space tourist and the second Hungarian in space .
" There is a similarity between the telescope and these two guys , " said Suzanne Jacoby , a project spokesperson .
" It 's very innovative and the technology is very cool .
It appeals to technologically minded people . "
Other eyes on sky
· The European Southern Observatory 's Very Large Telescope in Chile 's Atacama desert has produced the first direct images of planets outside our solar system .
· At $ 1bn the Atacama Large Millimetre Array in Chile will be the world 's most expensive observatory .
By 2012 it is expected to discover a new galaxy every three minutes .
· The southern hemisphere 's biggest optical eye is the Southern African Large Telescope in the Karoo desert .

Freedom's Untidy : Understanding Modern America
Russia , Georgia and US Foreign Policy
13/8/08
In the autumn of 1956 , the Eisenhower administration found themselves placed in a situation that had been brewing since the breakdown in US - Soviet relations at the end of World War Two .
After being encouraged by rabble - rousing broadcasts over the CIA - sponsored Radio Free Europe , Hungarian dissidents decided to stand up to the Soviet Union and seek ‘ liberation ’ from the Soviet bloc .
When the Kremlin took the inevitable decision to send in the Red Army and crush the rebellion , Washington was faced with the choice of whether or not to support the Hungarians .
In reality , it was not much of a choice at all : within the context of the Cold War and a delicate balance of power between the US and the USSR , there was no way that Eisenhower was going to risk an armed confrontation in Eastern Europe .
Cold War exigencies , then , coupled with the developing international crisis at Suez , precluded US intervention .
Just over fifty years later , the outbreak of fighting in South Ossetia last week – a province of Georgia with long - held ambitions to be part of Russia – has brought simmering tensions in Eastern Europe to the fore .
As Moscow , under the leadership of Vladimir Putin , has moved increasingly toward authoritarianism , the outbreak of democracy in close neighbours such as Georgia and the Ukraine , along with Western attempts to bring these nations into the NATO orbit have impacted a deep - rooted tension onto the region .
Put simply , Russia does not want to see its close neighbours forging ties with Western Europe and the US ; especially when such moves could be seen by some analysts as an attempt to destabilise the Kremlin .
With Russia announcing an end to military operations today , it seems as though the immediate crisis – at least in terms of humanitarian issues – may have passed .
There is , however , still a need to understand what this tells us about US foreign policy as we edge toward the presidential election in November .
The events of fifty years ago are not , of course , an exact parallel for the present situation ; there are certain echoes , though , that are worthy of consideration .
First , the Bush administration has , in the recent past , encouraged the Georgians to pursue a pro-western policy and mooted the idea of Georgian accession to NATO .
The emergence of a functioning Georgian democracy has been viewed positively in Washington and , in an effort to bolster the government in Tblisi , President Bush has visited the nation on official state tours .
Certainly , this was not as provocative as the destabilisation efforts of Radio Free Europe in the mid-1950s .
And yet , with Russia – in the view of Paddy Ashdown on Radio Four ’s ‘ Any Questions ’ still smarting from Western triumphalism at the end of the Cold War – this strident support of emerging democracies in Eastern Europe was bound to provoke hostility from the Kremlin .
Second , as with the Hungarian uprising of 1956 , Washington has proven powerless to act in the face of overt Russian aggression .
Obviously , the surrounding context is completely different to that half a century ago : the zero-sum connotations of the Cold War are not in evidence here .
But the endemic difficulties in countering aggression from a major foreign power are similar and raise disquieting questions about US foreign policy .
In assessing these events , many commentators have referred to the motif of the “ Limits of Power ” , suggesting that Washington ’s inability to intervene strongly to stem the fighting is demonstrative of a lack of means at the heart of US foreign policy .
William Kristol , writing in the New York Times on Monday , argued that such weakness was unbecoming and that Washington should take a stronger stand .
Consider the implications of our turning away from Georgia for other aspiring pro-Western governments in the neighborhood , like Ukraine’s .
Should n’t we therefore now insist that normal relations with Russia are impossible as long as the aggression continues , strongly reiterate our commitment to the territorial integrity of Georgia and Ukraine , and offer emergency military aid to Georgia ?
While these examinations have a point – the lack of a firm response from Washington does suggest an absence of ‘ power ’ – they also elide a broader issue : that the impotent response from the Bush administration is suggestive of a lack of clarity in current US foreign policy aims .
We are now all familiar with the sentiments of the 1992 Defense Planning Guidance document and Charles Krauthammer ’s eulogising over the unipolar moment the year before ; moreover , we are cognisant of the fact that , after 9/11 , some elements of the Bush administration advocated the pursuit of power and talked of the power to shape the world as America saw fit .
For some officials , imposing democracy in Iraq was supposed to usher in a wave of democratisation across the Middle East ; similarly , strong support for democratic revolutions in ex-Soviet states was supposed to encourage other nations in the region to adopt pro-western positions .
Even a precursory tour d’horizon such as this demonstrates that such aims were always rooted in raw ideological constructs and an ongoing belief in America ’s manifest destiny .
But as Iraq has descended into a stalemate , events in Georgia raise the question of whether the administration ’s aims have altered .
Clearly , the methods used to pursue their policies have become necessarily less bellicose during Bush ’s second term .
And yet , it is not clear that there has been any equivalent shift in grand strategy .
During the last week , it appears certain that the Bush administration wanted to protect the Georgian government and quell Russian aggression .
The problem was that they lacked the capabilities to achieve this : as with the situation in 1956 , the onset of military aggression by a major power made it too difficult to stand in front of Russian tanks .
On one level this was clearly prudent .
The situation could only have got worse if the US had threatened to escalate or impose sanctions .
However , it forces us to ask how far the Bush administration – or for that matter , an Obama or McCain administration – will go to support democracies in key strategic areas ?
If , for example , China decides to expand its influence in the Middle East and , in the process , undermines an emerging democracy , will the US act to combat this ?
Are we now in a position whereby the US will offer rhetorical support to any democracy threatened by a major power ?
If so , this not only suggests innate limits on American power , but also , a need to rethink US foreign policy goals and the way that Washington interacts with the world .
Portents of Failure : Covert Ops in Iran and Guatemala
3/7/08
In this week ’s New Yorker , famed journalist Seymour Hersh lifted the lid on the Bush administration ’s covert activities in Iran .
None of this came as too much of a surprise : rumours about covert operations inside Iran have been apparent for some time .
But the details of $ 400 million funding appropriations added a whole new dimension to the stories .
One of the most notable aspects of the story , though , was the lack of clarity underpinning US actions ; nobody , it appeared , seemed to be sure just what the US was trying to achieve beyond murmurings about destabilising the ruling elite in Tehran .
As David Ignatius wrote in Wednesday ’s Washington Post :
In the new cold war between America and Iran , the United States appears to be running some limited covert operations across the Iranian border .
But according to knowledgeable sources , this effort shares the defect of broader U.S. policy toward Iran -- it is tentative and ill - coordinated , and it undermines diplomacy without bringing serious pressure on the regime .
In considering what is going on , it is important to recall an earlier story that broke in the media last year about the US seeking to supply increased levels of military materiel to Iran ’s closest neighbours .
In July , 2007 , the New York Times reported ,
Bush Administration officials said the arms sales are meant in part to act as a bulwark against Iran ’s growing influence in the Middle East .
R. Nicholas Burns , undersecretary of state for political affairs , told reporters today that Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and financial support for terrorist groups “ has worried everybody in the region , ” and that the arms sales would help balance aggressive attempts by Iran to dominate the Middle East .
Efforts to destabilise the Iranian government – if not , for the moment , to overthrow it – are quite clearly , then , still ongoing .
Whether this is to placate Israel , or to lay the groundwork for a future offensive is not yet known .
What is clear , however , is the lack of understanding among leading US officials as to the potential outcome of these efforts .
On one level , this can be discerned from the inherent lack of understanding that US policymakers have about the current Iranian government .
The belief continues to prevail that , if Ahmadinejad can be overthrown , then a more cooperative regime may well take office .
This is patently not the case .
First , there is no telling who would come to power if Ahmadinejad was ousted ; second , the government in Tehran is made up of far more elements than the president and a few close advisors .
Nonetheless , beyond this most fundamental of problems there is a further difficulty : namely , that – in the past – covert operations have rarely gone smoothly or resulted in an outcome predicted by Washington .
An obvious comparison is Guatemala in the 1950s .
There , as in present - day Iran , the United States sought to encourage instability through arming Guatemala ’s neighbours , ostracising it from the international community and undertaking covert and propaganda operations against the incumbent regime of Jacobo Arbenz .
After Arbenz was removed from office by a military coup in June , 1954 , the Eisenhower administration portrayed it as a strong success for the Free World in the battle against Communism .
And yet , between late - 1953 and June 1954 , a successful outcome had not always been predictable .
In fact , there were times when the US was unsure as to how successful its destabilisation efforts were proving to be .
The coup itself was an untidy affair : Eisenhower prevaricated over whether or not to offer US air support to the rebels , while a potential challenge in the United Nations raised fears over the US being seen to have acted illegally .
It was far from a smooth operation .
The problem facing US officials was that , while all in Washington were agreed on the desirability of removing Arbenz , they did not want any proof of US involvement .
Therefore , actually achieving these preordained goals became hugely difficult ; it was not until the last minute , as Nick Cullather has demonstrated in his book Secret History , that the US could be sure of a successful outcome .
This rather messy operation was , for the rest of the decade , held up as a ‘ model intervention ’ : evidence of US collusion had been muted and the immediate objective – the neutering of Arbenz ’s rabble - rousing administration – had been achieved .
It was not until the chronic failure at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 that a significant reappraisal began to take place .
But the broader narrative is one of America achieving its aims in spite of the fact there were severe flaws in its policy .
Coherence was not as apparent as it should have been due , predominantly , to the need for intense secrecy .
And , this was in a nation with no armed forces of note , a weak economy , limited infrastructure and in close proximity to the US .
Achieving anything vaguely comparable in Iran would be far more complex .
This is not to suggest that the present administration is seeking regime change in Tehran through destabilisation techniques .
The outbreak of such instability in Iran would , one imagines , be far more problematic for US officials then the present situation .
However , given the levels of secrecy required for these operations there is a sense that , unbeknownst to Washington , more damage could be done to ( already hostile ) US - Iranian relations if covert ops escalate or get out of hand .
In Guatemala , the relative triumph of removing Arbenz soon gave way to decades of authoritarianism and murder : nobody , it transpired , was made safer by the 1954 incursion into Central America .
Writing in dark tones , a State Department official captured this sentiment in 1981 .
“ What we ’d give to have an Arbenz now , ” he wrote .
“ We are going to have to invent one , but all the candidates are dead . ”
History and George W. Bush
23/6/08
Over the last couple of years , President Bush has increasingly spoken about the way that historians might judge him in future years .
Perceptibly , he seems to have picked up on the fact that , given the nature of the profession , he will not receive a uniformly bad press .
Revisionists will , assuredly , come along in a few years time and , on the basis of newly opened documents ( assuming a new administration tackles the shameful slowing down of the declassification process ) , inform us that those doubting the 44th president were wrong : that , contrary to popular opinion , George W. Bush was a successful president ; especially in terms of his foreign policy .
Commentators and analysts , throughout Bush ’s two terms in office , have been divided over the administration ’s approach .
Many have slammed what they believe to be an egregious use of presidential power , criminal acts of illegal invasion and an approach to a “ War on Terror ” that advocate ’s torture , rendition , wire - tapping and the breaking of international law .
Others , though , have saluted the president ’s bravery in standing up to this new and complex threat – believing America to be engulfed in a “ new Cold War ” they champion Bush ’s determination to protect America and the West from Islamic extremism .
This is to be expected ; it is very much the nature of the world we live in .
Attempting to predict what historians might say in the future , though , is much more problematic .
Contemporary commentators – on either side of the political spectrum – have sought to use historical examples to support their assertions about post - 9/11 foreign policy .
Our colleagues Tim Lynch and Rob Singh , for example , cited the Korean War in a recent blog as an example of the links between that conflict and the ongoing battle in Iraq .
Similarly , many books have emerged examining the links between Vietnam and Iraq .
In an article in yesterday ’s Sunday Telegraph , though , the historian Andrew Roberts – fresh from his historian ’s banquet with President Bush and British Prime Minister , Gordon Brown – provided a bravura support of the current president and foretold a time when “ History will say that we misunderestimated President Bush . ”
As supporting evidence , Roberts cited President Harry S. Truman .
In the late - 1940s / early - 1950s , Truman was deeply unpopular with the electorate ; had miserable approval ratings ; and , had brought about a potential split in his own party .
Now , as Roberts goes on to argue , Truman is viewed as one of America ’s greatest presidents ( although this is by no means a view universally shared in academic circles ) .
This , Roberts suggests , bodes well for Bush : “ If the West wins the modern counterpart of that struggle , the War Against Terror , historians will look back in amazement at the present unpopularity of George W Bush , and marvel at it quite as much as we now marvel at the 67 per cent disapproval rates for Truman throughout 1952 . ”
And there are similarities between Bush and his Democratic predecessor : both have held power in moments of extreme change , and have overseen dramatic recalibrations of American foreign policy .
There are even similarities in their views and prevailing beliefs .
As Arnold Offner wrote about Truman in an article in 1999 , “ the man who became president in April 1945 was less an incipient internationalist than a parochial nationalist given to excessive fear that appeasement , lack of preparedness , and enemies at home and abroad would thwart America ’s mission to ‘ win the peace ’ on its terms . ”
It is not too much of a leap of faith to apply similar descriptions to Bush .
Where the analogy falls down , though , is in its lack of evidential depth .
Bush is most certainly not Truman ; the 1940s bear little comparison to the 21st Century ; and , the War on Terror is a far more complex and intangible concept than the Cold War .
Truman ’s implementation of the Marshall Plan , the formation of NATO , the avoidance of no-holds - barred war with China over Korea , and his steady hand during the Berlin Airlift all demonstrate his capacity for careful and prudent leadership .
Moreover , there is strong evidence that one his most fateful decisions – to support the French war effort in Indochina – was a result not of presidential alarm , but a gradual shift among mid-level advisors in the Department of State and international pressure from Paris and London .
Each of these examples pose the counter - factual question of : how would President Bush have reacted to such events ?
Far , far worse , however , is the attempt to quantify these events :
While of course every individual death is a tragedy to the bereaved families , these great achievements have been won at a cost in human life a fraction the size of any past world - historical struggle of this magnitude .
The number of American troops killed and wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan is equivalent to the losses they endured - for a nation only a little over half the size in the mid-Forties - capturing a single island from the Japanese in the Pacific War .
British losses of 103 killed over seven years in Afghanistan bears comparison to a quiet weekend on the Western Front in the Great War , or the numbers the Army loses in traffic accidents in peacetime .
History can lend a wider overall perspective to what are nonetheless , of course , immeasurably sad events .
This spurious use of comparative statistics , avoids the broader debate about Bush ’s policies .
Instead , it imposes a macabre knowingness onto the debate that does nothing to improve its tone or intellectuality .
Such reductionism does serve a purpose , though , for those writers seeking to avoid broader , more complex debates : overthrowing tyrannical regimes is a small price to pay for the loss of a comparatively low number of lives .
Such a view frames the debate in stark terms – good or bad ; win or lose .
It assumes that victory is at hand , because Saddam Hussein is no longer in power .
The impreciseness of this argument , however , is betrayed in Roberts ’ penultimate paragraph : “ Give Iraq five , ten or twenty years , and Bush 's decision to undertake the surge - courageously taken in the face of all bien pensant and " expert " opinion on both sides of the Atlantic - will rank alongside some of Harry Truman 's great decisions of 1945 - 53 . ”
Give the old Iraq five , ten or twenty years and any number of events might have occurred .
Saddam would probably have died ; more moderate elements might have come to power ; more moderate elements in Washington might have used coercive diplomacy to neutralise any Iraqi threat and bring about political reform .
Equally , none of these things might have happened and Iraq would have remained caught in a repressive and tyrannical regime .
Equally , though , none of these things might happen now and Iraq could quickly fall into a state of extreme disrepair .
In avoiding the issue and hypothesising about unpredictable outcomes , Roberts adds little to a debate that needs refocusing .
Between the Legal System and National Security
14/4/08
Last week ’s ruling by the High Court on the British Government ’s decision to stem a Serious Fraud Office investigation into links between BAE and the Saudi Arabian Government has garnered a great deal of attention in the press .
Rumours that the government will be forced to reopen the investigation have , predictably , been to the fore ; but on Thursday night ’s Newsnight , Gavin Esler chaired an intriguing debate between Liberal Democrat leader , Nick Clegg , and former Foreign Minister , Sir Malcolm Rifkind .
The tenor of their discussion was , in simple terms , whether the rule of law should be revoked if the Prime Minister and Attorney General believed national security interests were at risk .
Clegg sought to inhabit the moral high - ground : visibly outraged that the Saudi government would threaten to revoke its support in the War on Terror if the SFO investigation was not brought to a halt , Clegg cited the ruling as being vindication that the rule of law could not ( and should not ) be bypassed by leaders willing to invoke national security concerns in order to repress unfavourable investigations .
Rifkind , barely able to suppress his scorn for the naiveté of this position , commanded Clegg “ not to be so pious ” and set out his belief that , if national security concerns so dictate , the Prime Minister and his Attorney General have every right to overrule the law .
Rifkind won the debate hands down ; superior experience and an absolute certainty in his own position overwhelming Clegg ’s rather obvious inexperience .
However , when the specifics of this case – and other instances , like Iraq and Northern Ireland where national security considerations have been utilised to quell investigations – were stripped away , it all came down to a matter of trust .
Tony Blair , Rifkind conceded , had eroded much public trust in our leaders to make such high - stakes decisions responsibly due to his , at best approximate , at worst vague , relationship with the truth in the run-up to war in Iraq .
The broader question that this raised , however , was : to what extent do the public consider ‘ national security ’ a credible excuse for overruling the law of the land and , moreover , do we still trust our elected politicians to make such decisions responsibly ?
Those of us familiar with studying American history – especially in the Cold War era – are somewhat used to the grim cadence of national security being invoked to explain and legitimise a whole number of policies and decisions .
Anything , it seems , can be linked to national security if the stakes are judged sufficiently high .
Notoriously , President Nixon attempted to suppress recordings he had made during the Watergate cover - up by claiming that to release them would threaten America ’s national security ( given the impact that Watergate had on the US some might argue that he had a point ) .
During the War on Terror , the remit of national security has been broadened – touching upon all aspects of American life .
During a research trip to Washington DC in November , 2004 – just after President Bush ’s election victory over John Kerry – unremitting chaos was caused on the roads around Capitol Hill by the actions of a local police chief .
After announcing on national television that the security barriers preventing vehicles from driving past the Capitol were to be taken down , commuters were ( understandably ) surprised to find them still in place during their attempts to reach work the next day .
When questioned as to why this had happened , the police chief invoked national security : in order to catch out potential terrorists , he said , the barriers had not in fact been taken down – it was all a ruse .
Obviously , this tale of commuter frustrations is in no way the same as the BAE case .
( However , it is worth considering the level of outcry that would have occurred in London if similar liberties were taken with commuter routes ) .
What it does do , though , is to indicate the pervasive nature of national security issues in the modern world and give some indication as to their reach : from the capacity to overturn laws , to reshaping the world ’s capitals , invocations of national security threats can now appear almost anywhere .
There is an element of the ‘ boy who cried wolf ’ about all of this , though .
While not qualified to evaluate whether or not Blair and Lord Goldsmith acted responsibly over the BAE deal , this recurrent recourse to use national security as a legitimising tool has , it seems to me , further eradicated public trust in the ways it is used and in our faith that our political leaders ( from whatever party ) can be trusted to take these decisions responsibly .
Under those circumstances , Nick Clegg might be right ; the rule of law may have to come before ‘ national security . ’
The debate as to whether or not this is right , however , is one that will run and run .
Is Iraq another Philippines ?
21 /2/08
From almost the moment that the “ Shock and Awe ” bombing raids were launched on Baghdad in March , 2003 , comparisons between the war in Iraq and America ’s tragic involvement in Vietnam have been both prevalent and recurring .
In November 2003 , writing for the ‘ Independent Institute ’ , Ivan Eland wrote : “ As the insurgency in Iraq gets bolder , more sophisticated and more deadly , the hawks are falling all over themselves to pooh - pooh comparisons of Iraq to the debacle in Vietnam .
But the White House should be alarmed that such comparisons are even being made .
Despite some differences between the conflicts , in both wars avoiding defeat means winning “ hearts and minds ” — of the American people . ”
Similarly , in reviewing Bob Brigham ’s book Is Iraq Another Vietnam , Lawrence Freedman argued , “ Comparisons between the U.S. experiences in Vietnam and Iraq are unavoidable .
In both cases , intervention reflected a clearer sense of the potential of power than of power 's limits -- and hence grew increasingly unpopular as the rationale came to seem questionable and the costs less bearable ( subscription required ) . ”
Beyond the immediate visualisations that such invocations conjure up , though , it has become increasingly clear that Iraq , in many , many ways , is not another Vietnam .
There are , to be sure , strong similarities : the fighting of a potentially un-winnable war in a far - off land ; attempts to nation - build falling foul of local difficulties ; periods of apparent success followed by periods of immense difficulty ; and , of course , the absence of a viable ‘ exit strategy ’ .
But these are only similarities ; there is quite clearly not an exact parallel .
As Brigham himself has explained , “ History does not repeat itself , but it does rhyme . ”
An astute rendering of this debate has been provided , in a similar vein to Brigham , by John Dumbrell .
“ As [ Christopher ]
Hitchens and others argue , Vietnam - Iraq differences outweigh the similarities .
However , Hitchens protests too much .
The Vietnamese communists and nationalists had a certain authenticity , but eventually erected a Stalinist state in Vietnam .
Among the Iraqi insurgents , there are , no doubt , ‘ authentic ’ nationalists as well as brutal Saddamists and outside extremists and terrorists .
Neither conflict can reasonably be reduced to simple sloganeering .
The most important parallel , surely , is that the Vietnam War and the Iraq invasion were both unnecessary and ( particularly if we factor in the inadequate and flawed post - conflict planning in Iraq ) unwise uses of military power . ”
While there are some strong similarities between the two conflicts , then , there are at least as many differences .
All of which raises the question of how useful comparisons of this ilk are in furthering our understanding of US policy in Iraq and , moreover , asks whether other case - studies might be equally apt ?
In 1898 , after committing to war against Spain – ostensibly to ‘ defend ’ Cuban nationalism against Spanish imperialism – the United States found itself in possession of the Philippines .
Strategically , the islands were a useful acquisition for Washington : providing a good staging post for activities in an increasingly important China .
However , it thrust the US into the role of imperialists and , more fatefully , into the midst of an ongoing revolt , fuelled by Philippine nationalism .
This quickly developed into a full - blown insurgency , with American troops compelled to fight against forces using tactics with which they were both unfamiliar with and unsure of how to counter .
In beginning his book , The Blood of Government , Paul Kramer opens with a passage that has obvious parallels with Washington ’s presence in Iraq .
“ On January 9 , 1900 , Senator Albert Beveridge , Republican of Indiana , stood before the US Senate , defending a war on the other side of the world that refused to end by American command .
The previous November , General Elwell Otis had declared victory and an end to major combat operations in the Philippines , where American troops were struggling to impose US sovereignty on the forces of the Philippine Republic .
Over the next few months , however , much to the frustration of US generals and the McKinlay administration , resistance would both vanish and intensify as Filipinos adopted a guerrilla strategy to fight off the invaders . ”
The US was unable to quell the insurgency in the Philippines because they were unable to stymie the single factor underpinning the Filipino will to fight : unremitting and deep - rooted nationalism and a desire for independence .
Similar difficulties are apparent in Iraq – where even some military successes have been followed by a failure to engineer a shift in the prevailing situation .
The Iraq Study Group Report outlined this when it stated : “ Because none of the operations conducted by U.S. and Iraqi military forces are fundamentally changing the conditions encouraging the sectarian violence , U.S. forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end . ”
These similarities , of course , stem from a lack of comprehension among US policymakers – both recently and a hundred years ago – of the power of indigenous nationalism and the innate difficulties in attempting to fight against it .
This was also true in Vietnam – where Washington ’s anti-communist doctrine clashed awkwardly ( and , ultimately , disastrously ) with Vietnamese nationalism .
There is , however , another reason why the Philippines might make a more apt analogy for Washington ’s war in Iraq : namely , the length of time that it might take to get out .
Toward the end of World War Two , when American pre-eminence in the post - war era looked assured , Franklin D. Roosevelt prepared to relinquish the US stranglehold over the Philippines .
At the war ’s end , the Philippines would become an autonomous and independent nation ( albeit one whose economy was shackled to that of the US and , more importantly , that provided Washington with a number of crucial military bases that have only just been relinquished ) .
It had , however , taken the best part of half a century to achieve this moment .
In his efforts to convince Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle of the merits of decolonisation , FDR was not averse to pointing to the US role in the Philippines as a potential exemplar of what could be achieved .
But this came with a staunch caveat attached : the long term commitment to ‘ educate ’ the indigenous people in the arts of self - rule and democracy .
During a press conference in 1945 , Roosevelt stated : “ With the Indo - Chinese , there is a feeling they ought to be independent but are not ready for it .
I suggested at the time [ 19431 , to Chiang , that Indo - China be set up under a trusteeship -- have a Frenchman , one or two Indo - Chinese , and a Chinese and a Russian because they are on the coast , and maybe a Filipino and an American -- to educate them for self - government .
It took fifty years for us to do it in the Philippines . ”
The benefits of American tutelage over a long period remained as a prevalent theme during the final stages of the handing over process , with President Harry S. Truman announcing : “ It will be my constant endeavor to be of assistance to the Philippines .
I will be only too happy to see to it that the close friendship between our two peoples , developed through many years of fruitful association , is maintained and strengthened . ”
Such sentiments undoubtedly overlooked the depth and the vehemence of anti-American nationalism in the Philippines during the US occupation .
But with Senator ( and presumptive Republican nominee ) John McCain recently declaring that a US presence in Iraq of a hundred years would “ be fine with me ” , it is clear that the links between the Philippines and Iraq are not just limited to the tragic melodrama of a great world power fighting an indigenous insurgency ; there is also the possibility that the US mission may stretch on for decades , like it did in the Philippines , in an effort to prepare the Iraqi people for self - rule .
Honestly Now , Trust Us !
The Gates - Rice Double Act on Iraq and Afghanistan
14 /2/08
There almost was n’t a ‘ Freedom ’s Untidy ’ this week , but – after my eye was caught by a headline in the Washington Post – I did n’t feel able to let this pass and so put the following piece together with undue haste .
In an article entitled “ What We Need Next in Iraq ” ( which the Post had by - lined “ On Iraq , Trust Us ” ) , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates outlined the reasons why Congress and the American people should support the Bush administration ’s efforts in Iraq .
“ We encourage Congress and the public to support the efforts of our senior diplomats and military officers as they forge ahead with these talks , which we believe are essential to a successful outcome in Iraq and , by extension , the vital interests and security of the United States . ”
In recent weeks , Secretary Gates has been increasingly prominent , chastising NATO for their lack of steel in Afghanistan and advocating a slowdown in troop withdrawal levels in Iraq ( a change in direction to which the media has not given anywhere near enough attention ) .
But both he and Secretary Rice are perhaps at their most brazen in this article where , with apparently straight faces , they write : “ In short , nothing to be negotiated in the coming months will tie the hands of the next commander - in - chief , whomever he or she may be .
Quite the contrary , it will give the president the legal authority to protect our national interest -- and the latitude to chart the next administration 's course . ”
To suggest that the new president – whoever it might be – will not have any substantive commitments in Iraq when they come to office is bordering on the surreal .
Iraq , it is true , has not been as prominent an issue so far in this election campaign as it was in the 2006 mid-terms ; the Democrats have chosen to keep their powder dry and focus on the battle against each other , rather than demonising John McCain .
That could quickly change , however , once both parties have confirmed candidates and the race for the White House becomes a partisan , rather than inter-party , battle .
With McCain calling for a US commitment of “ 100 years in Iraq ” , it seems certain that the war will become a prominent issue before the year is out , even if it is not a central concern to the majority of American voters .
Of course , it would be naïve to expect two of the administration ’s leading spokespeople not to adopt such a position on one of the most contentious issues in recent history .
However , with much of the media choosing to focus its attention elsewhere , just why the administration has been adopting this stance in recent weeks has gone relatively unexamined .
To be blunt , it seems worryingly short - sighted not to link Gates ’ comments on Afghanistan and Iraq with the Rice - Gates op - ed piece in today ’s Post .
Since President Bush agreed to the insertion of more American troops into Iraq – the much vaunted ‘ surge ’ – proclamations of success have been coming thick and fast .
Gates ’ sounding of a cautionary note earlier this week , a view shared by the commander on the ground in Iraq , Gen. David Petraeus , is understandable .
With insurgent attacks down in recent months , it would be foolhardy to withdraw too soon .
As Gates argued on Monday , “ I think the notion of a brief period of consolidation and evaluation probably does make sense . ”
But when viewed alongside recent comments over NATO ’s involvement in Afghanistan , it becomes increasingly likely that the administration is not as sure about the success of The Surge as it has been suggesting .
If this were the case , it would be a mood that fit in with expert opinions expressed over the last year on the US position in Iraq .
General George Casey , Petraeus ’s predecessor , has expressed his concerns in print to the Wall Street Journal , as well as stating publicly that the army cannot maintain its footing in Iraq without long - term damage being done .
The outbreak of renewed waves of insurgent attacks in recent weeks , coupled with the absence of any viable new political settlement , means that the Bush administration cannot currently sanction the troop withdrawals that Casey believes to be necessary to ensure American military flexibility .
Under these circumstances , Gates ’ critique of America ’s NATO allies takes on a new meaning .
In warning “ that the future of Nato was at risk if it became a " two - tiered alliance " of countries which fought , and those that did not , ” Gates was openly calling for other NATO countries to commit more troops to the fight in Afghanistan .
A month earlier , he had criticised the counterinsurgency skills of Washington ’s allies , a blast that came on the back of a decision to send 3,200 more US troops to aid the fight in Southern Afghanistan .
However , as Lord Ashdown noted in an opinion piece in today ’s Financial Times , merely increasing resources and commitments in Afghanistan is not going to be enough to turn the tide – despite Secretary Gates ’ call - to - arms .
For , as he noted , “ what we lack above all is a strategy that all ( including , crucially , the Afghan government and the international military ) can buy into . ”
An increased commitment by Washington ’s NATO allies , though , might enable the US more flexibility in rotating its own troop levels , an issue that becomes crucial to this administration if The Surge has not been the broad success that they have proclaimed it to be .
In both scenarios , military strategy appears to have been confused with political necessity : if the Bush administration can leave office with Iraq and Afghanistan relatively stable , it achieves the best result it can possibly hope for .
If , however , the Pentagon is forced to withdraw more troops from Iraq and scramble to shore up its position in Afghanistan , then the prospect of the whole situation falling apart becomes increasingly likely .
So , when Gates and Rice ask Congress and the American people to “ trust them ” , there may very well be an element of pleading beneath their apparent confidence .
Is Dave the new Bobby ?
8 /2/08
While listening to PM on Radio 4 this Wednesday , I was struck by the comparisons being made between the ongoing electoral process in the US and our very own political situation in Britain .
Unusually , these were not the words of some hyperbolic commentator seeking to identify trans -Atlantic political trends ; instead , they came from a Conservative Party Member of Parliament – one Simon Burns , the right honourable member for West Chelmsford .
To be fair to him , I should note that Burns was n’t claiming that there were exact parallels .
Where he did believe there were similarities , though , was in the prevailing mood of the election .
Most notably – have you guessed where this is going yet ?
– he noted the rise to prominence of a youthful , dynamic and charismatic politician , whose zest for politics and crusading spirit of reform captures the mood of an electorate disenchanted with old - style politics .
He was , of course , trying to link the rise of Barack Obama and David Cameron ( I ’m assuming that he was n’t referring to the new leader of the Liberal Democrats , Nick Clegg ) .
Not only did he identify this ‘ trend ’ , he asserted that America had not seen anything like this since the rise of Ronald Reagan in the 1970s and , more strangely , the ill - fated and ultimately tragic campaign of Robert F. Kennedy in the late - 1960s .
Cameron , Burns noted , bears strong similarities to RFK , not least in his capacity to energise an electorate and his desire to initiate ‘ change ’ .
My immediate reaction was : he did say Robert Kennedy , did n’t he ?
Helpfully , he soon repeated the comparison .
Come the next General Election in Britain , the electorate will --- like that in the US in 1968 , 1980 and 2008 --- side with the youthful crusading reformer rather than the tired old former Chancellor .
Burns ’ analysis was troubling on several levels .
Firstly , he appeared to be overplaying the impact that Obama ( and , to a lesser extent , Clinton , McCain and Huckabee ) has had on America .
True , turnout has been high during the primaries , but there does n’t appear to be a sense that a momentous change is in the air .
With the election over the same old battlegrounds of economy and “ security ” , but without any prospect of significant new initiatives in these areas , it will be impossible to define the 2008 election as being an epochal moment until well after its conclusion .
Secondly , and more worryingly for Burns , if Cameron is the heir apparent to Robert Kennedy , then his chances of success in Britain seem slim .
Kennedy was not a gifted campaigner : he was an uncomfortable public speaker , lacked the natural ease of his brother , and owed a great deal of the traction that he had built up in the early stages of the 1968 campaign to his brother ’s tragic death and the lingering sense that JFK ’s legacy remained unfulfilled .
Furthermore , his run for office came after a spell in Congress that was far from distinguished .
Had he gone on to win the election in 1968 it is impossible to speculate what kind of president he would have become .
But , it does seem clear that he would not have been the paragon of idealism that Burns is holding up .
Cameron clearly has a greater aptitude for the meet - and - greet , razzmatazz aspects of modern politics than RFK ever had .
If there is a comparison to be made , however , it is in their rather indistinct and incoherent approaches to policy .
Indeed , if one wants an analogy , then Ronald Reagan is the more appropriate member of Burn ’s analysis .
Even here , though , Reagan ’s approach to government was far more apparent during his run for office than Cameron ’s currently is .
Of course , Burns had an objective in his comments : talking up the possibility that change is in the air to cloak personal ambition .
Quite clearly , he hopes that the same factors helping Obama ’s rise to prominence will prove to be a trans-national aid for Cameron ’s bid for power .
More obsequiously , linking his boss to such major political figures could help get Burns noticed during any shadow cabinet reshuffle .
As the show ’s presenter , Eddie Mair , concluded the piece , “ That was Simon Burns , who is not yet a member of David Cameron ’s front bench . ”
Yet , in attempting to achieve this , Burns might be minded to consider his analogies more carefully .
Reagan , perhaps , might fit Cameron ’s ambition .
But Bobby Kennedy ?
He was never the politician Burns seems to think he was .
Diplomacy - Iraqi Style
31/1/08
With the recent furore over the presidential primaries in the US , over Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ’ lambasting of the European members of NATO , and over the high - profile events in Gaza , the once ubiquitous story of Iraq has slipped from the top of the news agenda .
Perceptions that ‘ the surge ’ is succeeding and a subsequent drop in insurgent attacks have made events in Baghdad less prominent than they were twelve months ago .
However , a lack of media attention does not mean that significant events are not occurring .
Relatively unnoticed this week was the announcement that Iranian president , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , was going to visit Baghdad for diplomatic talks with the provisional government in Iraq .
Although the Guardian reported Ahmadinejad ’s trip as “ a challenge to American influence in Iraq ” , the story has not gained any significant traction in the week ’s media .
It raised the familiar reactions and opinions that any possible shift in US - Iranian relations brings to the fore : Washington and Tehran do n’t like each other ; the US is deeply mistrustful or Iranian actions in the Middle East ; Bush and Cheney are musing on the possibility of a military strike on Iran before they leave office .
But even at a time when tensions in US - Iranian relations are high , the response has been muted .
There is , however , a far more important aspect to this visit that needs to be recognised .
What does the future hold for diplomacy in Iraq ?
If , for example , the ‘ surge ’ continues to meet its objectives ( in spite of whether or not you think the proclamations of success by the Bush administration are overly fanciful ) , and the US allows Baghdad an increasing amount of autonomy , what stance will the Iraqi regime take with regard to its diplomatic relations ?
Fundamentally , there are two issues at play here : First , what are Washington ’s long - term plans for the region ?
And second , how does the ‘ new ’ Iraq plan to situate itself in the wider Middle East ?
For the US , a long - term military presence in Iraq looks certain : even a relatively stable regional situation will demand an American presence to protect the fragility of the Iraqi nation .
Baghdad , however , will have to forge a diplomatic stance of its own .
Does it remain allied with the US --- allowing Washington to assume a level of primacy over their diplomatic relations --- or will it pursue an independent course ?
At first , an alliance with the US might seem the sensible option .
Military aid and the omnipresent threat of US retaliation would give Iraq a broad security blanket and seem to preclude any threat that might be posed by her immediate neighbours .
But the ever - present complications in the Middle East that in part stem from Washington ’s alliance with Israel ( and , to a lesser extent , Saudi Arabia ) mean that Baghdad would be well - advised to consider how it is integrated into the wider diplomacy of the region .
The invitation to Ahmadinejad suggests that the leaders in Iraq are cognisant of this , but this raises the gloomy spectre for Washington of an Iraqi - Iranian alliance ; a development that , whoever wins the 2008 election , would be inimical to US interests .
Sadly , for American officials there is little they can do to prevent an independent Iraqi foreign policy .
Efforts to coerce Baghdad into a closer relationship with the US would undoubtedly look clumsy and lead to allegations of ‘ empire ’ ; while , even successfully keeping Iraq tied to Washington could potentially destabilise the region further and , moreover , add renewed fuel to the fire of the insurgency and deepen sectarian splits in the fabric of the nations .
That there is no easy answer is quite clear ; that this is yet another unforeseen consequence of an ill - planned invasion and occupation is equally apparent .

Florida or Bust for Rudy ?
24/1/08
With Fred Thompson choosing yesterday to announce that he was bringing an end to his ill - fated bid for the White House , there is an increasing sense that the Democrat and Republican Primaries are beginning to get serious .
Thompson ’s campaign ended with a whimper .
In a short , rather terse statement , he announced : “ Today I have withdrawn my candidacy for President of the United States … I hope that my country and my party have benefited from our having made this effort . ”
Although Thompson ’s withdrawal was expected , it does mark a hardening in the race for the White House .
On the Democratic side , the two leading candidates – Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama – are getting increasingly personal in their attacks on each other , with Monday ’s latest debate descending into a point - scoring slanging match , rather than an informed debate on major policy issues .
This level of acrimony has also spilt out of the debating hall and onto the campaign trail .
As the Boston Globe has reported , “ A day after clashing in their testiest debate yet , Senators Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton stepped up their acrimonious dispute over character and truthfulness yesterday , signalling that their feuding might continue unabated until Democratic voters pick their presidential nominee … the two leading Democrats picked up largely where they left off in Monday night ’s debate in Myrtle Beach , accusing each other of obscuring the truth and of lowering the level of campaign discourse . ”
As the primary season begins to shift into a more brutal phase , there a number of candidates who need to start winning and winning quick if they are to stay in the race .
For Democratic Senator , John Edwards , the game is almost up : he has failed to put a dent in the Clinton - Obama roadshow and , barring a miraculous turnaround , he appears to be following Fred Thompson out of the contest any day soon .
Similarly , Mike Huckabee needs to somehow regenerate his campaign , which , after surprising everyone in Iowa , has now fallen behind John McCain and Mitt Romney .
However , as an article in Sunday ’s Observer noted , the stakes are , perhaps , highest for ‘ America ’s Mayor ’ , Rudy Giuliani .
Since announcing his candidacy , Giuliani and his advisors have developed a high - risk electoral strategy : one that virtually ignored the early battlegrounds of Iowa , New Hampshire , Michigan and South Carolina and which , instead , focused on winning the “ big ” states with the most electoral college votes – starting with Florida , and pushing on toward the golden possibilities of ‘ super - duper Tuesday . ’
Commentators both in the US and the UK have all agreed that , in theory , this approach could work .
If Giuliani succeeded in taking all the major states that he and his team have pinpointed , then he could , potentially , tie up the Republican nomination before the party holds its convention .
However , it is a huge if ; especially given the fact that , since Iowa and New Hampshire , nobody is talking about Rudy ’s chances .
The momentum gained by both Mitt Romney and , more particularly , John McCain have pushed Giuliani into the sidelines .
It is a shift in momentum that increasingly looks like it will destroy Giuliani ’s dreams of succeeding George W. Bush .
Giuliani ’s woes , however , have not occurred just because of his campaign ’s high - risk electoral strategy .
Equally important has been the perception that he is one - dimensional : Giuliani ’s fame and reputation rest on the national profile that he developed in the wake of 9/11 .
As such , his campaign platform has prioritised his ‘ commitment ’ to the War on Terror and his willingness to fight the good fight in order to protect America .
And yet , as the Observer article mentioned , very few Americans are prioritising national security or , indeed , Iraq as a major issue .
To return to a familiar mantra of fifteen years ago , “ It ’s the economy stupid ! ”
Increasing concerns over a potential recession in the US – concerns that , it seems , are being keenly felt in the Federal Reserve – have overtaken the importance of getting the troops out of Iraq and defeating the threat posed by international terrorism .
Inevitably , this has had the effect of sidelining Giuliani ’s “ strong on defense ” message .
Moreover , he has not been helped by the Bush administration ’s continual references to the success of the ‘ surge ’ in Iraq , and the almost daily announcements that the US is turning the tide of insurgency .
Irrespective of how accurate such announcements are , they have reduced the willingness of the American people to embrace a future leader pledging to ‘ defend ’ the homeland .
So , can Giuliani still win ?
It looks increasingly difficult – especially given the high stakes now riding on a win in Florida .
Perversely , a downturn in the US position in Iraq might actually enable him to regain some lost ground ; but it would take an almost cataclysmic event to propel Giuliani back to the front of the field .
His only hope now rests on winning ( and winning well ) in Florida , in an effort to galvanise his campaign and , above all else , get himself back on the front pages of the leading newspapers .
Benevolent America ?
A Look Back from the Middle East
to Southeast Asia and Latin America
17/1/08 President Bush ’s recent attempt to interpose his administration in the Middle East peace process bore signs of a comprehensive lack of engagement with the complexities of both the Israel - Palestine conflict and the region as a whole .
In a keynote speech in Abu Dhabi , Bush lectured the countries of the region on the need for them to embrace noble principles such as ‘ freedom and democracy . ’
Adopting a patrician tone , Bush stated : “ You can not build trust when you hold an election where opposition candidates find themselves harassed or in prison .
You can not expect people to believe in the promise of a better future when they are jailed for peacefully petitioning their government .
And you cannot stand up a modern and confident nation when you do not allow people to voice their legitimate criticisms . ”
Perhaps even more condescending , though , was his statement that , “ The United States appreciates that democratic progress requires tough choices … yet we also know that for all the difficulties , a society based on liberty is worth the sacrifice …
My friends , a future of liberty stands before you .
It is your right .
It is your dream .
And it is your destiny . ”
As ‘ Watching America ’ noted in an earlier podcast , Bush ’s vision of peace for the Middle East – outlined throughout his recent tour – has proven to be little more than a “ sham ” .
This is not because the sentiments or the ideas were undesirable but because the simplistic way in which they were presented is just not viable in a region as complex as the Middle East .
This was illustrated in a speech on the Israel - Palestine conflict when , after describing Jerusalem as a “ tough issue ” , Bush stated : “ The peace agreement should happen , and can happen , by the end of this year .
I know each leader shares that important goal , and I am committed to doing all I can to achieve it . ”
The tone used by Bush in his recent tour , however , is certainly not unique in the history of US policy toward peripheral areas of the world : it is informed by long - standing cultural assumptions within the American mindset about the peoples of the Third World and an enduring belief in the US capacity to improve conditions in those areas .
During World War Two , Franklin Roosevelt often spoke of the desirability of implementing a process of ‘ decolonization ’ once the war had finished ; deconstructing the old system of Empires , and bringing freedom , liberty and democracy to areas previously under European control .
While FDR was generally opposed to all examples of European colonialism , he reserved a particular ire for the French Empire – believing it to have achieved very little in terms of improving the lives of those people living within it .
The most obvious example of this , Roosevelt argued , was in Southeast Asia – a region that had long been under French control , but which remained rooted in an almost feudal state .
FDR exerted a great deal of diplomatic effort during the war in attempting to encourage the ‘ great powers ’ to support trusteeship of Southeast Asia once the war was over , thus ending French control .
These efforts were motivated by the inherent belief that the US system could , undoubtedly , improve the situation in the region ; a belief engendered by ingrained assumptions in the US of western superiority .
As Mark Bradley has noted in his essay “ Slouching Toward Bethlehem ” , US efforts “ were the central elements of the American construction of Vietnam that had emerged in the interwar period : unfavourable images of a ‘ primitive ’ and ‘ backward ’ Vietnamese society , vociferous critiques of French colonial policy in Vietnam , and an unwavering belief in the applicability of American institutions and values across cultures . ”
Of course , as Mark Atwood Lawrence has argued decisively in his book Assuming the Burden , this process soon gave way to more traditional strategic and economic concerns ; a shift that , following Roosevelt ’s death in April 1945 , led to the US supporting the French quest to reassert their authority in the region .
Within five years it would lead to tacit US financial and military support for the worsening French position .
In spite of this , though , US policy toward Indo - China throughout the 1950 - 1973 period would continue to be informed by similar cultural assumptions .
The enduring belief that peace could be brought to the region if only “ they ” would just embrace the US model continued to hold true among leading US officials .
The story is very similar in Latin America .
As scholars such as Michael Hunt have outlined , there is a long tradition there of US condescension – with many commentators and cartoonists in the late - nineteenth century depicting ‘ Uncle Sam ’ as the father figure attempting to control the unruly ‘ boys ’ of Latin America .
These views continued to predominate in the 1950s .
One of the most infamous examples is the oft - quoted remark by Eisenhower ’s Secretary of State , John Foster Dulles , that in order to improve US - Latin relations , you need to “ pat them on the head and make them think you are fond of them . ”
This view was by no means unique .
In his 1963 memoir , The Wine is Bitter , Milton Eisenhower – the president ’s brother – sketched out the view that many Americans had of their southern neighbours .
“ Our misconceptions of others are often as ridiculous as theirs are of us , ” he wrote .
“ Our stereotypes of the Latin Americans are definite and erroneous : he is lazy , darkly handsome , and capricious .
He insists upon a siesta no matter what , and he prefers a palace revolution to an election ... to us , Latin Americans are happy natives with ruffled sleeves and broad - brimmed hats , dancing and strumming guitars . ”
The depth of such sentiments was starkly demonstrated to the author of these words when , on the eve of departing on a fact - finding tour of the region , an acquaintance asked him , “ ‘ what is the capital of Latin America , anyhow ’ ? ”
Again , as with the situation in Southeast Asia , such sentiments continued to predominate .
Consequently , US policy continued to adopt a patrician , benevolent air , structured around the ideas of free market capitalism and democracy .
President Bush ’s tour of the region in the spring of 2007 – a tour that quickly descended into a farcical Bush v Chavez publicity blitz – once more saw the same clichéd proposals trotted out .
The unspoken message ?
If you would just adopt these measures , then life would be so much better .
Ingrained traditions and long - standing cultural beliefs make it hugely difficult for any other avenue to be pursued .
When Bush lectures the Middle East nations on the errors of their democracies , he does so in order that they might see the error of their ways and embrace the US model .
Naturally , there is a rather large element of self - interest involved , too ; but , in a world that continues to demonstrate on a daily basis just how complex it is , these long - standing ideological constructs within the American mindset continue to stymie any hopes of a more evolved US policy .
Until leading US officials can bring themselves to adopt a view of foreign policy that does not see it simply as a case of ‘ democracy ’ , or ‘ freedom ’ , then any attempts to bring peace to the Middle East ‘ within a year ’ will , sadly , be doomed to ignominious failure .
Bouncing Back with Hillary Clinton
Bolivia , Brazil and Chile have signed an agreement to create a corridor linking the Pacific and Atlantic oceans , according to reports reaching here on Monday .
Under the agreement signed by the presidents of the three countries on Sunday at Bolivia 's government seat , the Quemado Palace , the road link will become operational in 2009 .
The Bolivia stretch of the road totals 1,600 km , 75 percent of which is ready for use .
The three unfinished parts that link Santa Cruz to Puerto Suarez , Oruro to Pisiga , and Santa Matias to Concepcion require 415 million U.S. dollars , 78 million dollars and 260 million dollars in investment respectively .
In Chile , two projects are under plan -- a 192 - km road starting in Arica and another 216 - km stretch linking Iquique to its eastern border with Bolivia .
Brazil will invest nearly 133 million dollars refurbishing astretch of highway that is already in use .
A total of 2,225 km of existing road will be re-profiled as part of this corridor .
" I feel that this road is a vital artery " that allows integration and unification of towns in Chile , Bolivia and Brazil , Bolivian President Evo Morales said at the signing ceremony .
Chilean President Michelle Bachelet described the new link as a dynamic stream that " allows free flow of people and growing equality " among the countries .

I ’m sure you have experienced a wake up call at some point in your life .
Events such as a divorce , a new baby , a firing , a terrorist attack , or a near - death experience tend to hit us like a ton of bricks and are not easily forgotten .
Personally , what I find interesting is that implicit in the idea of a wake up call is that we have , in some sense , been asleep .
What is it that we have been asleep to ?
When I think of wake up calls , the word that comes to mind is “ priorities ” .
Wake up calls tend to make us stop , pull back from the runway of life , and consider exactly what it is that is important to us .
Very often we realize that we have had our priorities upside down .
Perhaps we have been spending too much time at the office , too little time with our kids , or have been neglecting our health .
So to answer my earlier question , it seems to me that many of us travel through life asleep to what really is important .
If you are in a slumber , the following are some ideas to help you wake up and remember the important things in your life :
Connect to Your Own Mortality
Some may find it depressing to think about death , but it can actually be a great technique to improve your life .
Try , for example , to imagine laying on your deathbed .
What could potentially give you cause for regret ?
Would it be all the money you did n’t make ?
Or would it be the friendships you did n’t nurture , the time you did n’t spend with your family , and the places you did n’t see ?
Now , consider if the way you currently live your life will give you cause for any regrets when you do actually come to lay upon your deathbed .
Steve Jobs is a famous advocate of connecting to your own mortality .
In his Commencement Speech at Stanford University , he said : “ Remembering that I ’ll be dead soon is the most important thing I ’ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life , because almost everything — all external expectations , all pride , all fear of embarrassment or failure — these things just fall away in the face of death , leaving only what is truly important . ”
Write a Personal Mission Statement
I admit to being one of those people who normally skips the exercises in self - help books .
I did , however , decide to follow Stephen R. Covey ’s advice in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People and write a personal mission statement .
In short , a personal mission statement is an individual statement of who you are , what you are about and what you value .
The process of writing such a statement helps to clarify your inner-most thoughts and feelings , and once finished is something you can turn to for guidance .
If you are interested in writing your own personal mission statement , I recommend Dr. Covey ’s Mission Statement Builder .
Also , if you would like to see an example you are welcome to read my personal mission statement .
Have a Meaningful Conversation with an Older Person
As you grow older , you naturally acquire experience and knowledge of what is important in life .
For example , is there anything you could tell the “ you ” from 10 years ago that would make life easier ?
I ’m sure there is .
Unfortunately , though , unless you have a time machine this is impossible .
A great way then to acquire the wisdom that comes with age is to seek out an older person , such as a grandparent , and have a meaningful conversation with them .
Ask them about their life , what they have learned , and what they would do differently .
You may just find they experienced many of the thoughts and feelings you are currently are when they were younger .
Meditate
Usually the problem is not that we do n’t know what is important in life , but that it is forgotten as we get caught up in the everyday tasks that comprise life .
One of the best methods I have found to overcome this problem is meditation .
Meditation is a great way to relax both your mind and body .
Such a state is ideal for gaining a better understanding of who you are and what you value .
Volunteer
It is easy in life to become consumed with your own sense of self importance .
A very effective way to step back and see life in a greater context is to volunteer .
For example , helping those with less than yourself will help you realize just how fortunate you really are .
So often we act in such a way that we do n’t already have the important things in life , when in actual fact they are right under our nose .

An improved firewall was one of the 300 - plus features Apple touted before the release of Leopard , but a mix of design choices and functionality changes reduces its effectiveness compared to the firewall in Tiger , something I had heard only rumblings about when I wrote “ How Leopard Will Improve Your Security , ” 2007 - 10 - 22 .
While it ’s not concerning enough that you should n’t upgrade , it is something Apple will need to address fairly quickly with an update .
What ’s a Firewall ?
For you non-security - geeks out there , a firewall is a tool that blocks traffic to a system or network based on rules ( for a more - detailed description , see Chris Pepper ’s “ What ’s a Firewall , and Why Should You Care ? , ” 1999 -02 - 22 ) .
Firewalls have existed since the late 1980s and were developed in response to the first Internet worms , particularly the Morris Worm , as a way of protecting systems and networks by blocking any unwanted traffic .
Before firewalls , if you placed a computer on a network ( including the Internet ) , anyone else on that network could remotely probe your system for open connections and send you traffic directly .
Since all computers tend to have some vulnerabilities , and some of those vulnerabilities are remotely exploitable over a network , this gives attackers an easy way to play on your network and potentially exploit your systems .
Some of these attacks are self propagating – where malicious code takes over a system and then uses that system to take over other systems .
This is what distinguishes a worm from a virus – a virus needs user interaction , while a worm “ worms ” its way through the network from system to system .
Some of you might remember the Code Red worm from 2001 that took down major portions of the commercial Internet by hopping from computer to computer .
In the information security field we use many different kinds of firewalls .
The most basic is a network firewall , typically a stateful packet inspection firewall , installed in a router .
That ’s a fancy way of saying we use network firewalls that are a little smarter and can track inbound and outbound connections .
The way Internet protocols work is that when you make a connection to a remote computer , you do it over a port .
These ports are standardized , such as FTP on port 21 , HTTP ( the Web ) on port 80 , and SSH on port 22 .
The remote system needs to communicate back to you , so when you set up the initial connection your computer gives the remote computer an arbitrarily high port number for the return traffic .
Otherwise , you would be limited to talking to only one Web site or FTP server at a time .
A stateful packet inspection firewall keeps track of all these connections so it can allow traffic back to your system only if you have an open session , on those seemingly random ports that would normally be blocked .
Another kind of firewall , the one on our Macs , is a host - based firewall .
Since our computers are n’t always behind big network firewalls , it makes sense to build a firewall into our computers to protect us from attack as we wander between different networks , something that ’s increasingly common thanks to laptops .
If you connect a laptop to any public network , such as at a wireless hotspot or a hotel , some person or automated program will almost certainly be scanning you .
The Tiger Firewall — In Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger , Apple used a good open - source firewall called ipfw .
ipfw is software that sits deep inside Mac OS X and filters network traffic before it makes it to the rest of the operating system , providing the same protection on the road as we have at home .
When you opened the Firewall view of the Sharing preference pane in Tiger , that was just a graphical front end to ipfw .
Tiger did n’t let you adjust the really granular settings without writing your own configuration files , but the available controls were reasonably effective .
When you enabled the firewall you could select which network services you wanted to let run .
For example , if you had enabled file sharing , the Firewall view would show that file sharing was enabled and that you had to disable it in the Services view .
The firewall functioned in a “ deny all ” mode that blocked everything except ports you specifically enabled , and it offered some advanced options to block all UDP traffic and ignore requests to filtered ports ( what ’s called “ stealth mode ” ) .
This approach was n’t perfect , but was good enough for the average user .
It lacked any outbound filtering – a nice feature that lets you lock down your system to ensure that unapproved services on your Mac ca n’t connect to the outside world , and a good technique to help limit attackers or talkative applications .
It also lacked application control , a useful feature common in most host firewalls that lets only approved applications talk to the outside world , no matter what port they use .
Firewalls in Leopard — Leopard still includes ipfw , but it ’s no longer the default firewall .
Instead , Apple has replaced it with a black box – a firewall program that is unknown to security researchers – that behaves a little oddly .
From what we can tell , Apple developed the new firewall themselves to add application control .
The firewall now lives in the Security pane of System Preferences and now has three options for the firewall : Allow All Incoming Connections , Block All Incoming Connections , and Set Access for Specific Services and Applications .
Apple made the decision to move the firewall in an entirely new direction , which is n’t necessarily bad , but makes it more difficult to understand what ’s being filtered , and seems to leave some potential holes open .
The first problem with the Leopard firewall is that it ’s difficult to tell what the Set Access option does .
It starts the new application - level firewall and lists in the Sharing pane any services you ’ve opened , but it does n’t indicate if they are allowed or blocked .
There ’s also no option for you to add your own open services or ports anymore .
Instead , you can add or remove individual applications , but not network services .
Stealth mode is still available in the Advanced settings , but the UDP blocking , useful to stop port scanning and some other attacks , is gone .
Worse yet , when you install Leopard , the firewall is turned off , even if you ’re upgrading and the firewall was previously enabled .
Say what you want about Windows , but the firewall is enabled by default .
Finally , the firewall can actually break your applications , which I ’ll explain more about shortly .
Further investigation revealed some really strange ( for a firewall ) behavior .
Some applications ask for permission to access the network the first time you use them , like Safari , Firefox , and Cyberduck , while others are ignored , like Colloquy and Twitterrific .
If you have a service enabled in the Sharing pane , but select Block All , it still appears open to the outside world when you scan the ports , but you ca n’t connect to it .
Some services seem to be open all the time , no matter what you do .
If you ever connect to another computer for file sharing , TCP port 88 ( for Kerberos authentication ) is opened and stays that way until you reboot , no matter what you set on the firewall , even if you enable stealth mode .
Bonjour ( mDNS ) is hidden in stealth mode but available even if you select Block All .
Finally , the firewall is a black box – the only way I could learn what was opened or closed was to scan it from the outside using networking tools ( such as Nmap , the same tool Trinity used in “ The Matrix Reloaded ” ) .
Unlike in previous versions of Mac OS X , you ca n’t check settings by looking in a configuration file .
There ’s one behavior that caught me completely by surprise and calls for an immediate fix .
If you have the firewall set to control applications , those applications that do n’t already have their code signed are signed by Leopard when they access the network .
( Code signing is the process of affixing a digital signature to an application , such that the operating system can tell if the application has been modified by malware , because the application ’s checksum would no longer match the checksum in the signature . )
If the application changes itself while running , as Skype does ( and as some other applications do too ) , it wo n’t match the signature the next time you go to run it and your application wo n’t launch .
There are no warnings or errors , and the average user might assume something is seriously wrong with their system .
I experienced this myself when I was recording a podcast with Glenn Fleishman : Skype failed to launch ; I reinstalled , and it launched .
The next time I tried to launch it , Skype failed again , and a reinstall fixed it .
I looked in my console and saw a weird error .
A quick Google search provided the answer .
All of these behaviors are considered “ bad ” on the whole firewall good / bad scale .
Leopard breaks a number of conventions .
First , if you select Block All , no network services should be enabled , even if you ’ve turned them on somewhere else .
Apple either needs to relabel that setting to “ Block All Except … ” , or change the behavior to block all traffic , especially Bonjour .
Application control behavior also needs to be more consistent – having some active applications appear in the settings , but not others , is confusing and could lead to wrong assumptions .
I may think I ’m only allowing a few applications , when , in reality , all sorts of applications are accepting network connections without my permission .
More seriously , Kerberos should n’t linger on an open port just because you connected to another computer .
Having a firewall arbitrarily break approved applications is also unacceptable .
Finally , firewall rules need to be user - accessible to allow customized configurations or just to allow the more - advanced users to understand expected behavior .
I ’ve listed some of the more technical details I ’ve discovered on the firewall on my blog at Securosis.com
These are all problems
Apple is perfectly capable of fixing and I ’ll be surprised if they do n’t address them sooner rather than later .
Until then , I still recommend you activate the firewall in Block All Incoming Connections mode so you do n’t break applications .
If you need to enable file sharing or other remote access , you ’ll need to either select the Set Access method , or turn your firewall off .
One last option is to use ipfw and manually configure firewall rules , or use a GUI tool like the free WaterRoof , and skip the Leopard firewall completely .
In WaterRoof , just click Rules Sets to pick your rules , and then go to Tools > Startup Script and install a startup script to run those rules when you reboot .
The good news is that I do n’t know of any active remote exploits for the Mac , and if you have to take the risk you should be OK for now even without your firewall running , especially if you avoid AFP for file sharing and use SMB instead ( selectable with the options button in the Sharing preference pane ) .
This is n’t ideal , but it does give Apple a little time to fix up the firewall so it protects users without breaking applications .
Unchecked Police And Military Power Is A Security Threat
As the U.S. Supreme Court decides three legal challenges to the Bush administration ’s legal maneuverings against terrorism , it is important to keep in mind how critical these cases are to our nation ’s security .
Security is multifaceted ; there are many threats from many different directions .
It includes the security of people against terrorism , and also the security of people against tyrannical government .
The three challenges are all similar , but vary slightly .
In one case , the families of 12 Kuwaiti and two Australian men imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay argue that their detention is an illegal one under U.S. law .
In the other two cases , lawyers argue whether U.S. citizens — one captured in the United States and the other in Afghanistan — can be detained indefinitely without charge , trial or access to an attorney .
In all these cases , the administration argues that these detentions are lawful , based on the current “ war on terrorism . ”
The complainants argue that these people have rights under the U.S. Constitution , rights that can not be stripped away .
Legal details aside , I see very broad security issues at work here .
The Constitution and the Bill of Rights were designed to ensure the security of people : American citizens and visitors .
Their limitations of governmental power are a security measure .
Their enshrinement of human rights is a security measure .
These measures were developed in response to colonial tyranny by Britain , and have been extended in response to abuses of power in our own country .
Laws mandating speedy trial by jury , laws prohibiting detention without charge , laws regulating police behavior — these are all laws that make us more secure .
Without them , government and police power remains unchecked .
The case of Jose Padilla is a good illustration .
Arrested in Chicago in May 2002 , he has never been charged with a crime .
John Ashcroft held a press conference accusing him of trying to build a “ dirty bomb , ” but no court has ever seen any evidence to support this accusation .
If he ’s guilty , he deserves punishment ; there ’s no doubt about that .
But the way to determine guilt or innocence is by a trial on a specific indictment ( charge or accusation of a crime ) .
Without an indictment , there can be no trial , and the prisoner is held in limbo .
Surely none of us wants to live under a government with the right to arrest anyone at any time for any reason , and to hold them without trial indefinitely .
The Bush administration has countered that it cannot try these people in public because that would compromise its methods and intelligence .
Our government has made this claim before , and invariably it turned out to be a red herring .
In 1985 , retired Naval officer John Walker was caught spying for the Soviet Union ; the evidence given by the National Security Agency was enough to convict him without giving away military secrets .
More recently , John Walker Lindh — the “ American Taliban ” captured in Afghanistan — was processed by the justice system , and received a 20 - year prison sentence .
Even during World War II , German spies captured in the United States were given attorneys and tried in public court .
We need to carry on these principles of fair and open justice , both because it is the right thing to do and because it makes us all more secure .
The United States is admired throughout the world because of our freedoms and our liberties .
The very rights that are being discussed within the halls of the Supreme Court are the rights that keep us all safe and secure .
The more our fight against terrorism is conducted within the confines of law , the more it gives consideration to the principles of fair and open trial , due process and “ innocent until proven guilty , ” the safer we all are .
Unchecked police and military power is a security threat — just as important a threat as unchecked terrorism .
There is no reason to sacrifice the former to obtain the latter , and there are very good reasons not to .

American Airlines will be the first U.S. commercial passenger carrier to flight test a defensive system against anti-aircraft shoulder - fired missiles  known in military parlance as MANPADS , for “ man-portable air defense system . ”
Although they are participating in the test program , American Airlines is “ not in favor of installing counter - MANPADS on commercial aircraft . ”
In fact , the airline industry as a whole has not been enthusiastic about adopting military technology for use on civilian passenger aircraft , largely because of cost considerations .
According to a 2006 Air Line Pilots Association white paper [ .pdf ] :
“ The airline industry is currently experiencing very difficult times described as ‘ the perfect storm ’ of high fuel prices , terrorist threats , a wartime environment , and the rise of low - cost carriers that are challenging the so - called ‘ legacy ’ carriers .
As a result , the established hub - and - spoke airlines are fighting for their survival despite passenger loads that equal or surpass pre-September 11 levels .
The Air Transport Association maintains that at this time the air transport industry cannot afford the cost of installing and maintaining C - MANPADS [ counter - MANPADS ] technology on their member airlines ’ fleets . ”
MANPADS are relatively simple surface - to - air missiles that are used by single person .
Once launched , the missile homes in on its target  typically via an infrared guidance system that locks in on the heat signature from an aircraft ’s engines  with a flight time of just five or six seconds until impact .
An estimated 500,000 to 700,000 MANPADS have been produced worldwide and are thought to be in the military inventories of at least 56 countries .
More worrisome is that , according to a U.S. government estimate , there are 6,000 MANPADS outside the control of any government .
More than two dozen terrorist groups probably possess them , including al - Qaeda .
And there have been more than 20 reported uses of MANPADS by non-state actors .
So the terrorist threat is very real , not hypothetical .
Although the loss of life from a single MANPADS attack would be considerably less than that caused by the 9/11 attacks ( perhaps several hundred killed rather than thousands ) , the terror spread by such an attack could be just as profound .
Even an unsuccessful terrorist attack against a U.S. commercial aircraft would likely have a chilling effect on airline travel , with ripple effects felt throughout the economy .
A RAND Corporation study [ .pdf ] concluded that “ demand for air travel could fall by 15 - ­25 percent for months after a successful MANPADS attack on a commercial airliner in the United States .
A week - long systemwide shutdown of air travel could generate welfare losses of $ 3 - 4 billion , and when losses from reduced air traffic in the following months are added in , the result could exceed $ 15 billion . ”
RAND estimated that if the airlines were shut down for one month , the total loss could be more than $ 70 billion .
( By way of comparison , a Milken Institute study [ . pdf ] estimated that the U.S. economic output lost in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attacks was $ 47 billion . )
The Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) was even more pessimistic : “ Given the easy availability and number of MANPADS around the world , a future terrorist attack against commercial airliners may succeed sooner or later , potentially bringing the world economy to a standstill . ”
So the consequences of a terrorist MANPADS attack would not be trivial .
The problem is that increased security to prevent a MANPADS attack is not practical , because the area to be secured is quite large .
For example , the RAND Corporation determined a terrorist armed with an SA - 7 ( a Russian - made system that can be purchased in arms bazaars around the world for as little as $ 5,000 ) would be a threat to Los Angeles International Airport anywhere within an 870 - square - mile area surrounding the airport .
Given the population density of Los Angeles , protecting against a single terrorist would require a dedicated security effort for an 870 - square - mile area with nearly 7 million people and over 2 million housing units .
So technical countermeasures are the only way to defend against ( and possibly deter ) a potential MANPADS attack .
Assuming such countermeasures are effective ( but also knowing that they are not perfect ) , the deciding factors are cost and affordability .
According to the RAND Corporation , it would cost $ 11 billion ( roughly one - quarter of the total budget for the Department of Homeland Security ) to outfit the entire U.S. commercial airline fleet with laser jamming countermeasures similar the kind being tested by American Airlines .
To be sure , the DHS budget may not be large enough to support an $ 11 billion project , but the focus should not be just on DHS .
While $ 11 billion would break the DHS budget , it is only 2 percent of the Department of Defense budget ( over $ 480 billion exclusive of supplemental spending for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan ) .
Moreover , in its 2007 Pig Book , Citizens Against Government Waste identified 2,658 pork barrel projects at a cost of $ 13.2 billion in the Defense and Homeland Security Appropriations
Acts for fiscal 2007  more than enough to pay for MANPADS countermeasures .
Or to provide another perspective on the cost of MANPADS countermeasures : two months of the Iraq War .
While it is not possible to defend against all possible terrorist attacks , and acknowledging that countermeasures will not create a perfect defense against MANPADS ( there is no such thing as a perfect defense ) and that they will not prevent terrorists from using other means to attack aircraft or other targets , effective countermeasures will raise the cost of attack and lower the likelihood of success  thus potentially deterring terrorists from using MANPADS .
So if one of the primary responsibilities of the federal government is to provide for the common defense , the U.S. government ought to be able to find needless spending equal to less than one - half of 1 percent of its bloated $ 2.6 trillion budget to help fulfill this important obligation .
SIDEBAR
Charlie Wilson ’s War  starring Tom Hanks , Julia Roberts , and Philip Seymour Hoffman  hit movie theaters over the Christmas holiday .
I have n’t seen the movie yet ( I did see the documentary The True Story of Charlie Wilson on the History Channel ) , but the book by George Crile is a good read ( even though it ’s nonfiction , it ’s better than a Tom Clancy novel ) .
The book and documentary ( and I ’m sure the movie too ) portrays boozing and womanizing former Texas congressman Charlie Wilson as a hero for aiding the mujahedeen to defeat the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s  perpetuating the myth that the Soviet defeat in Afghanistan was a pivotal point in winning the Cold War .
The harsh reality , however , is that Charlie Wilson ’s war helped give rise to al - Qaeda .
And if al - Qaeda or other radical Muslims do indeed have MANPADS in their arsenal , we can thank Charlie Wilson because that is what his war was all about  supplying the mujahedeen with Stinger missiles to shoot down Soviet helicopters .
So Charlie Wilson ’s
War is yet another classic case of how an interventionist foreign policy ( in this case , what amounted to an independent foreign policy carried out by a lone member of Congress ) results in blowback .
Rather than celebrating such actions , we should be learning from them .

Moon Slide Slim
Credit & Copyright : Stefan Seip ( TWAN )
Explanation :
No special filters - or even a telescope - are required to enjoy a leisurely lunar eclipse .
In fact , watched from all over the night side of planet Earth , these regular celestial performances have entertained many casual skygazers .
Still , this eye - catching picture of a lunar eclipse may look unfamiliar .
To make it , astroimager Stefan Seip set his camera on a tripod and locked the shutter open during the total lunar eclipse of March 3 , 2007 .
The resulting image records the trail of the Moon ( and narrower trails of stars ) sliding through the night .
Reddish hues common during the total phase of a lunar eclipse , are evident along the darker , slimmer portion of the Moon trail .
At least part of tonight 's lunar eclipse will be visible in clear skies over the Americas , Europe , Africa and western Asia .
The eclipse lasts over three hours from start to finish , with about 50 minutes of totality .
Tonight 's eclipse is the last total lunar eclipse until December of 2010 .

Reviews :
Basically a parody / satire of our dysfunctional political system in which partisan players duke it out in combat .
Love the costumes and the artistic details that make politics into a battleground yet laden with humor and nonsense to keep it interesting .
Especially love the female characters , which you can outfit with amazing weaponry and jewelry that look like they came straight from the artist - gorgeous statement rings and choker collar necklaces that contain hidden offensive weapons .
The chokers actually choke the opposition and the statement rings become lances and laser weapons .
Very fun , very funny , very enjoyable !

The main objective is to kill your opponent .
You can be Obama , Romney , Hillary , Rudy , etc .
Rudy is vicious and true to form .
Weaponry includes amazing blades ala Wolverine , and lots of other deadly items that you can use to destroy your opponent .
Music is appropriately radical , there 's lots of blood , and when you decapitate someone , you get a big cheer from the peanut gallery .
It 's the coliseum of political warfare with players you 'll recognize and tactics normally used in martial arts and shoot 'em ups .
You 'll play this game instead of arguing over policy - much better use of your time .

At a dinner party about a month ago we started reminiscing about Kung Fu Election and wishing there was an update to encompass the present Trump presidency and his appointees .
It seemed like such a disconnect discussing Kung Fu Election while sitting on the stunning italian modern dining furniture in my friends beautiful contemporary condo they had recently bought .
Kung Fu Election was popular during our early college grunge years .
A lot had happened in the past decade .
All of us were appalled by the results of the 2016 election .
Playing an updated " Trump " version of Kung Fu Election , if there were one , would be carthartic for all of us .
Alas , no new version of Kung Fu Election is forthcoming .

Mr Chua asked media to give him and his family " some space "
He said he had apologised to the prime minister and other ruling party leaders but would not resign , and his own wife and children had accepted his apology .
Mr Chua said he had taken no part in the making of the DVD recordings , one of them said to be almost an hour long .
The video is CCTV footage taken in a hotel , according to one newspaper .
It is the latest in a series of difficulties to confront the administration of Prime Minister Abdullah Badawi , who is expected to call an election in the coming weeks .
According to Malaysia 's Star newspaper , copies of the DVDs were initially left at various locations in the town of Muar , in Johor State , on Saturday " for people to pick up " .
' It was me '
Mr Chua made his admission hours after the Star reported that the two DVDs were being widely distributed in Johor , his home state .
" I am the man in the tape , " Mr Chua , 60 , told reporters .
" The girl is a personal friend . "
" I would like to emphasise I did not make the tape myself , " he added .
" Who [ did ] this is not important .
What is most important is that my family , wife and children have accepted my apology . "
According to the Star , the DVDs are believed to be CCTV recordings made in a hotel suite .
The hotel and the date are reportedly unknown .
As health minister , Mr Chua has advocated giving out free condoms to reduce the spread of HIV , in the face of religious opposition .
When the British needed a senior political officer in Basra during World War I , they appointed a forty - six - year - old woman who , apart from a few months as a Red Cross volunteer in France , had never been employed .
She was a wealthy Oxford - educated amateur with no academic training in international affairs and no experience of government , policy , or management .
Yet from 1916 to 1926 , Gertrude Bell won the affection of Arab statesmen and the admiration of her superiors , founded a national museum , developed a deep knowledge of personalities and politics in the Middle East , and helped to design the constitution , select the leadership , and draw the borders of a new state .
This country , created in 1920 from the three Ottoman provinces of Baghdad , Basra , and Mosul , which were conquered and occupied by the British during World War I , was given the status of a British mandate and called Iraq .
When I served as a British official in southern Iraq in 2003 , I often heard Iraqis compare my female colleagues to “ Gertrude Bell . ”
It was generally casual flattery and yet the example of Bell and her colleagues was unsettling .
More than ten biographies have portrayed her as the ideal Arabist , political analyst , and administrator .
Does she deserve this attention ?
Was she typical of her colleagues ?
What are the terms by which we can assess a policymaker eighty years after her death ?
The British Mandate of Iraq had problems from its beginnings .
A revolt in 1920 cost the British several hundred lives and an estimated £ 40 million and convinced them of the impossibility of direct colonial control .
The monarchy , which they established under the Hashemite King Faisal — a foreigner and a Sunni with close links to the British — was unpopular with many Kurds , Shia , and nationalists .
And even after Iraq joined the League of Nations in 1932 , having developed some of the institutions of a modern state , it continued to be threatened by ethnic and sectarian divisions and religious and nationalist opposition .
In 1958 the monarchy was brutally overthrown , in favor of military rule and then Baathist dictatorship .
Bell ’s letters , now all available on - line in an archive prepared by the Newcastle University library , suggest that Bell ’s strength lay not in her political success — she did not succeed in forming a sustainable , stable , unified Iraqi state — but in the clarity and imagination with which she explored failure .
She wrote almost as soon as she arrived in Basra in 1916 :
… We rushed into the business with our usual disregard for a comprehensive political scheme .
We treated Mesop[ otamia ] as if it were an isolated unit , instead of which it is part of Arabia … .
When people talk of our muddling through it throws me into a passion .
Muddle through !
why yes , so we do — wading through blood and tears that need never have been shed .
She places some blame on the pre-existing chaos , as did the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003 .
In her “ Review of the Civil Administration in Mesopotamia ” in 1920 , she notes that

JERUSALEM ( CNN ) --
The war of words between United States and Tehran continued Wednesday , with President Bush repeating his assertion that Iran is " a threat to world peace . "
President Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert at the airport in Tel Aviv on Wednesday .
The two countries have been trading accusations since a weekend confrontation involving Iranian boats and U.S. Navy warships in the Strait of Hormuz .
The United States claims Iranian vessels deliberately sped toward its warships despite warnings to stay away .
Bush 's criticism of Iran came Wednesday during a news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert in Jerusalem .
Bush is in the region to encourage the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians .
Bush called the incident " a very dangerous gesture " by Iran and warned the Islamic republic against any escalation .
" We have made it very clear , and they know our position , and that is :
There will be serious consequences if they attack our ships , pure and simple . "
" My advice to them is : Do n't do it . "
Earlier in the day , National Security Adviser Stephen Hadley said the Sunday incident in the Strait of Hormuz almost triggered an exchange of fire -- and if it happens again there may be a battle .
The Pentagon released dramatic video of Sunday 's encounter , which occurred in the narrow channel critical to the shipment of oil from the Persian Gulf .
Iran 's navy said the video was faked , according to state - run media .
" It 's the kind of incident that can provoke exchange of fire , " Hadley said .
" And we think the Iranians need to be on notice that they are fishing in troubled waters here . "
Hadley , speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One as Bush headed to Israel , said , " It almost involved an exchange of fire between our forces and Iranian forces , " but he stopped short of saying whether the U.S.
Navy would have fired the first shots .
" This is not -- this is a provocative act , not a smart thing to do , and they 're going to have to take responsibility for the consequences if they do it again , " Hadley said .
Vice Adm. Kevin Cosgriff , commander of the Bahrain - based U.S. 5th Fleet , said the U.S. ships received a " threatening " radio transmission indicating the boats were closing in on the U.S. ships and that the American vessels would " explode . "
Watch as the confrontation unfolds »
No shots were fired , and no one was hurt in the incident , which lasted about 20 minutes , the Defense Department said .
It began as the USS Port Royal , USS Hopper and USS Ingraham were traveling in formation after having finished a routine transit through the strait , the Navy said .
Five boats , suspected to be from the Islamic Republic of Iran Revolutionary Guard Navy , " maneuvered aggressively in close proximity of the Hopper , " the Navy said in a posting on its Web site .
On Tuesday , the Pentagon released a four - minute , 20 - second videotape shot from the bridge of the USS Hopper showing five fast boats racing back and forth near the convoy .
An unidentified Navy crew member says over the radio : " This is coalition warship .
I am engaged in transit passage in accordance with international law .
I intend no harm .
Over . "
The boats continued to race through the water even as the U.S. warship repeatedly sounded its horns .
" I am coming to you , " a deep , thickly accented voice says in English over the radio .
To that , an unidentified sailor aboard the Hopper , speaking into a radio , asks the boats to identify themselves and steer clear .
" Inbound small craft :
You are approaching a coalition warship operating in international waters .
Your identity is not known ; your intentions are unclear , " he says .
" You may be subject to defensive measures .
Request that you establish communications now or alter your course immediately to remain clear . "
Immediately afterward , an accented voice says , " You will explode in a few minutes . "
It was not clear , however , that the voice was coming from any of the boats , said Cmdr. Lydia Robertson , the 5th Fleet spokeswoman in Bahrain .
It could have come from another ship in the area or from shore , she said .
" We do n't have a direct connection , but it 's not necessarily a disconnect , " she said .
Nor was it clear that the boats indeed belonged to the Revolutionary Guard Navy , she acknowledged .
" We believe they are , " she said , adding that " at least one had an Iranian flag . "
But Chris Madden , the Navy 's visual news director , said no Iranian flags were visible in the video .
Robertson said estimates of the boats ' nearest proximity to the warships range from 200 to 500 yards .
She called the fast boats ' actions " unsafe , unnecessary and unprofessional . "
Though the video does not show it , at least one of the boats dropped about five or six objects that looked like boxes into the water , where they floated , Robertson said .
The U.S. naval commanders did not pick them up " because they did not know what they were , " she said .
Iran 's state - run Press TV quoted a spokesman for Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Navy as saying Wednesday that the video " had been compiled using file pictures and the audio had been fabricated . "
An Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman downplayed the incident , calling it " normal , " state - run news agency IRNA reported .
" The case ... was similar to the past ones and it was a regular and natural issue , " Mohammad - Ali Hosseini said , according to the news agency .

Researchers at Idaho National Laboratory , along with partners at Microcontinuum Inc. ( Cambridge , MA ) and Patrick Pinhero of the University of Missouri , are developing a novel way to collect energy from the sun with a technology that could potentially cost pennies a yard , be imprinted on flexible materials and still draw energy after the sun has set .
The new approach , which garnered two 2007 Nano50 awards , uses a special manufacturing process to stamp tiny square spirals of conducting metal onto a sheet of plastic .
Each interlocking spiral " nanoantenna " is as wide as 1/25 the diameter of a human hair .
Because of their size , the nanoantennas absorb energy in the infrared part of the spectrum , just outside the range of what is visible to the eye .
The sun radiates a lot of infrared energy , some of which is soaked up by the earth and later released as radiation for hours after sunset .
Nanoantennas can take in energy from both sunlight and the earth 's heat , with higher efficiency than conventional solar cells .
" I think these antennas really have the potential to replace traditional solar panels , " says physicist Steven Novack , who spoke about the technology in November at the National Nano Engineering Conference in Boston .
Taking antennas to the atomic level
The miniscule circuits absorb energy just like the antenna on your television or in your cell phone .
All antennas work by resonance , the same self - reinforcing physical phenomenon that allows a high note to shatter glass .
Radio and television antennas must be large because of the wavelength of energy they need to pick up .
In theory , making antennas that can absorb electromagnetic radiation closer to what we can see is simple : just engineer a smaller antenna .
But finding an efficient way to stamp out arrays of atom - scale spirals took a number of years .
" It 's not that this concept is new , " Novack says , " but the boom in nanotechnology is what has really made this possible . "
The INL team envisions the antennas might one day be produced like foil or plastic wrap on roll - to - roll machinery .
So far , they have demonstrated the imprinting process with six - inch circular stamps , each holding more than 10 million antennas .
It was n't immediately obvious the structures might be used for solar power .
At first , the researchers considered pairing the antennas with conventional solar cells to make them more efficient .
" Then we thought to start from scratch , " Novack says .
" We realized we could make the antennas into their own energy harvesters . "
An economical alternative
Commercial solar panels usually transform less that 20 percent of the usable energy that strikes them into electricity .
Each cell is made of silicon and doped with exotic elements to boost its efficiency .
" The supply of processed silicon is lagging , and they only get more expensive , " Novack says .
He hopes solar nanoantennas will be a more efficient and sustainable alternative .
The team estimates individual nanoantennas can absorb close to 80 percent of the available energy .
The circuits themselves can be made of a number of different conducting metals , and the nanoantennas can be printed on thin , flexible materials like polyethylene , a plastic that 's commonly used in bags and plastic wrap .
In fact , the team first printed antennas on plastic bags used to deliver the Wall Street Journal , because they had just the right thickness .
By focusing on readily available materials and rapid manufacturing from inception , Novack says , the aim is to make nanoantenna arrays as cheap as inexpensive carpet .
Fine - tuning fine structures
The real trick to making the solar nanoantenna panels is to be able to predict their properties and perfect their design before printing them in the factory .
While it is relatively easy to work out the physics of one resonating antenna , complex interactions start to happen when multiple antennas are combined .
When hit with the right frequency of infrared light , the antennas also produce high - energy electromagnetic fields that can have unexpected effects on the materials .
So the researchers are developing a computer model of resonance in the tiny structures , looking for ways to fine - tune the efficiency of an entire array by changing factors like materials and antenna shape .
" The ability to model these antennas is what 's going to make us successful , because we can't see these things , " Novack says .
" They 're hard to manipulate , and small tweaks are going to make big differences . "
A charged future
One day , Novack says , these nanoantenna collectors might charge portable battery packs , coat the roofs of homes and , perhaps , even be integrated into polyester fabric .
Double - sided panels could absorb a broad spectrum of energy from the sun during the day , while the other side might be designed to take in the narrow frequency of energy produced from the earth 's radiated heat .
While the nanoantennas are easily manufactured , a crucial part of the process has yet to be fully developed : creating a way to store or transmit the electricity .
Although infrared rays create an alternating current in the nanoantenna , the frequency of the current switches back and forth ten thousand billion times a second .
That 's much too fast for electrical appliances , which operate on currents that oscillate only 60 times a second .
So the team is exploring ways to slow that cycling down , possibly by embedding energy conversion devices like tiny capacitors directly into the antenna structure as part of the nanoantenna imprinting process .
Pick up lines are n't all they 're cracked up to be .

The agreement stipulates that drivers with an " honest religious [ Muslim ] belief which precludes them from transporting certified guide dogs " must now respond to service requests from the blind and their canine companions .
But the settlement gives drivers the right to request dispatch operators to send " the next available cab . "
Drivers must also " provide the customer their name and wait with the customer until the next cab arrives . "
I certainly hope it 's not raining .
Mr. Gilmour noted that the ruling is " not binding with any other cab company , " and fears the consequences .
But the National Post gushed , with no trace of irony , that the deal " balances rights and religion . "
Whose rights ?
Whose religion ?
Those of our dog- fearing cabbies , alas .
What is this cabdriver cynophobia ?
What accounts for this abnormal and persistent fear ?
This is no idle question , for Gilmour and many others will suffer as a result of the court 's ruling that Muslims are within their rights to refuse them .
Cabdrivers have argued that dogs are " unclean , " but there is little agreement on the subject .
In our own time , clerics like the Iranian Hojatolislam Hassani have denounced the " moral depravity " of dog ownership , and demanded " the judiciary arrest of all dogs with long , medium or short legs - together with their long - legged owners . "
And last September , Saudi religious police banned dogs from the holy city of Mecca and neighboring Jeddah .
But these are exceptional cases .
Early chroniclers of the Prophet 's life and mission report that dogs , while " unclean , " are not entirely off limits .
Dogs may be kept for hunting , shepherding , and protection , for example .
And legal scholars disagree among themselves as to whether the dog is ( 1 ) entirely pure , ( 2 ) entirely impure , or ( 3 ) pure as to fur and impure of saliva .
Ritual purity is the rub .
According to the " impure " tradition , contact with dog saliva will invalidate ritual purity and nullify ablutions ( " breaks " wudu ' ) required for prayer or handling the Muslim holy book .
This applies to the saliva of every canine , mongrel and " certified guide dog " alike .
But what is the worst that can happen if car and driver become contaminated with dog saliva ?
The answer is that the soiled spot of the clothes or car must be cleansed in ritual fashion ( seven times in all , and once with dirt ) , and the person must apply partial ablutions ( wudu ' ) to the face and extremities .
Still , I ask :
So what ?
What 's the harm in allowing Man's Best Friend into one 's cab ?
Consider more serious wudu ' - breakers : barehanded contact with one 's genitals or a member of the opposite sex ; profound sleep ; sexual discharge ; defecation ; urination ; and flatulence .
Dog or no dog , any one of these will nullify one 's ablution .
Bottom line :
While it is entirely possible to avoid the animal ( ask Mr. Gilmour ) , it is next to impossible to maintain a state of ritual purity .
The " broken " wudu ' of the driver is nearly a foregone conclusion - as would be the case for anyone .
Soiled spots in one 's cab must still be ritually cleansed , but if one must submit to ablutions anyway , what great sacrifice can it be ?
Scrupulously observant drivers may take pride in their discipline ; but respect for religion cannot and will never " balance " the right of the individual and his service animal to hail a taxicab .
The " sin " is abandoning Bruce and his canine companion on the sidewalk .
" I 'm humiliated and frustrated and it's an awkward position having to go into defending your rights because you 're blind , " Gilmour said .
The court , in trying to be respectful of traditions they do not comprehend - and traditions for which there is no great agreement - has required persons like Bruce Gilmour to swallow the indignity of waiting beside a taxi chaperone while dispatch scrambles to find a less discriminating driver .
The Vancouver solution is shameful and indulgent .
Mr. Gilmour must not be compelled to respect the tenets of another 's faith .
No one is bound to chauffeur the public for a living , and scrupulously observant drivers should not require a settlement or ruling to perform the function for which they were hired .
Just when it seemed Americans could n't get any gloomier about the country 's direction , they have .
That finding , from the latest Wall Street Journal / NBC
News poll , could leave Republicans the gloomiest of all , as prospects for their party darken further in a presidential - election year .
Amid a weakened economy and market turmoil , President Bush 's stock has slid again as he prepares to deliver his final State of the Union address next week , underscoring the burden he could pose for his party 's presidential nominee in the race ...
Bush 's presidency , with his rubberstamp Republican and Democratic congresses , was the earthquake .
Now we face the economic disaster tsunami produced by the earthquake .
The ordinary solutions -- income tax cuts , prime interest rate cuts -- they wo n't help and could make things worse .
Visionary , courageous leadership is essential .
There 's a story about the economy ; Economic Stimulus Is Already Too Late in today 's NY Times . .
Fact is , just about any day you pick up the Wall Street journal , you see reports that the economy is getting worse -- house sales down , home prices lower , more mortgages defaulted , more banking and lending institutions losing tens of billions , the dollar droppping in value , more countries shifting away from the dollar to the Euro , jobs down .
Gold and oil at record highs ( cash goes to gold when the dollar is weak and threatened . )
Crop and food prices rising due to costs of oil and shifting of resources to alternative energy production ....
Sounds pretty bad , eh ?
Well it 's going to get worse .
The fact is , we should n't expect miracles from the congress , in terms of bailing us out of this mess .
Discussion over whether we are in a recession will soon fade as the denial is squashed like a bug , by reality .
We ARE in a recession and it will get much worse .
Bush and his rubber stamp congress got us into this mess , with globalist agreements that removed protective tariffs , increased the instability in the middle east , which led to massive oil price increases , put us into huge debt , which decreased the credit rating of the US , motivated international money to go elsewhere .
Bush and Alan Greenspan got us into the housing / mortgage disaster we are still falling down deeper into by de-regulating lending , by allowing low interest rates for anyone , by allowing games to be played with transferring of debt assets ....
Like the many warnings of terrorists threats , that Bush and Condi Rice claimed they never heard or saw , there were many , many warnings that the US was going to go into a huge housing slump .
In 2003 , the British were already in the middle of one .
I knew it was coming ( should have shorted Toll Brothers and similar housing construction companies ) and friends knew about it .
Surely Bush 's advisors should have known .
Greenspan should have known .
They could have taken a look at the financing , at the tax breaks .
They could have prevented some of the problems .
Instead , the banking industry made things much worse .
What the hell , they 'd given more to Bush and the Republicans , in lobbying money , campaign gifts and 527 support than any industry , except , possibly , pharmaceuticals .
They could pretty much do whatever the hell they wanted to do .
So , in the US , things are much worse than the mess that Britain had and is still going through ( Yes , the housing crash in the UK is still going on , five years later .
We 're in the first or second year of ours , here in the US , and that suggests that we face three or four years , more , at least .
One article , about a month ago , in the Wall Street Journal , reported , like the article in today 's NY Times , that , because the US operates , more and more , in an international environment , with many , many factors , it is less and less capable of influencing the economy by manipulating one variable -- like the interest rate .
The stock market may show a flicker of upward movement when Bernanke drops the prime rate a quarter or half point , but that does n't change the Bush / Cheney induced instability in the middle east that has raised the price of Oil .
Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi may introduce some band - aid legislation to help a percentage of the home owners with predatory mortgages that are eating them alive , but does that help the people with conventional mortgages whose homes have dropped in value so much , they can't afford to sell them to make the moves they planned , because there is no longer enough equity left in the house ?
The truth is , " stimulus packages " are bandages , like giving 500 MG of vitamin C to someone in an auto accident with two broken legs , crushed and shattered ribs and a punctured lung .
The USA is in for bad times and that may mean the rest of the world will take the ride down the economic roller coaster with us .
The usual band - aids will not work .
The usual short term , month to month approach will not work .
We need big , visionary thinking that is out of the box .
Trickle down , cut taxes economic idiocy never worked and now , any presidential candidate who suggests that this is the solution is ... an idiot .
That 's not saying that smart tax breaks might be part of the solution , but they should be aimed at stopping the housing price crash and mortgage tsunami disaster we are just beginning to experience .
Maybe banks need to be taxed , with new taxes , but then given breaks , if they convert mortgages from adjustable balloon types -- the ones that are bankrupting so many home owners -- to conventional , 30 year , affordable mortgages .
And then , let 's take a look at these slime ball CEOs who lose billions for their companies and then exit with golden parachutes .
They should be paying penalties , and maybe even doing jail time , not getting rewarded .
Maybe we should pass laws taxing them at 99 % .
That 's what they deserve -- and throw in their choice -- orange or red -- for the country club VIP prison garb they get to wear .
Is it crazy to call a CEO who costs a company , its investors billions , its laid off employees , lost jobs , it 's creditors hundreds of millions in unpaid bills ?
How dare these fools take hundreds of millions in exit pay ?
They deserve nothing .
They deserve VERY close scrutiny and the oppposite of the protection they are now getting .
And let 's talk about Alan Greenspan .
He watched all this coming down .
If he did n't see it coming , he 's an incompetent fool .
If he did see it coming and did nothing to prevent it , what does that make him then ?
Either way , he should go down in history as a disaster capitalist .

The PR firm outed in 2005 for planting U.S. propaganda in Iraqi newspapers is still in Iraq , working for the U.S. military .
The Lincoln Group , " which has conducted surveys for the military since shortly after the invasion , received a year - long contract in January to conduct focus groups , " reports Karen DeYoung .
The focus groups interviewed " separate groups of men and women ... in Ramadi , Najaf , Irbil , Abu Ghraib and in Sunni and Shiite neighborhoods in Baghdad . "
When asked to describe " the current situation in Iraq to a foreign visitor , " most Iraqis " would describe the negative elements of life in Iraq beginning with the ' U.S. occupation ' in March 2003 , " according to a December 2007 report .
So few participants mentioned Saddam Hussein that the report states , " the current strife in Iraq seems to have totally eclipsed any agonies or grievances many Iraqis would have incurred from the past regime . "
The Iraqis interviewed had " far more commonalities than differences , " including that they " see the departure of ' occupying forces ' as the key to national reconciliation . "

There is a very important man in human history whose name too few people know : Â Alfred Korzybski.Â
He ’s the father of general semantics , and before you say toÂ yourself , “ Oh , it ’s only semantics , ” understand that improper use of semantics can absolutely , positively , kill you .
Â I ’ll explain why , shortly .
Korzybski is not only the father of general semantics , but a god high in the pantheon of suchÂ fields as cybernetics , neuro - linguistics , consistency theory , and the like .
Â
He deserves to be .Â
He was the first to examine human behavior in terms of whatÂ people can know , and how they act on that knowledge ( Descartes may have provided a foundation , but Korzybski built the palace ) .
Â
He said that there are really only two means of knowing : Â ( 1 ) through the structure and capabilities of the nervous system , and ( 2 ) through the structure of language and how we use it . Â
Korzybski divided allÂ human experience into levels .
Â
The first level is Â the event itself .
Â
The second is our verbal , Â symbolicÂ description of this event , internal or external , and our description is subdivided into three levels of abstraction : Â ( 1 ) the descriptive , ( 2 ) the inferential , and ( 3 ) the judgmental .
Â
Improper use of theÂ judgmental can kill you .
Â
For instance :
Descriptive : Â
That automobile has itsÂ right turn - signal on .
Inferential : Â
That automobile is going to turn right .
Judgmental : Â
It ’s safe to pull out in front of that automobile .
We probably all know at least one person who is stuck at one of these levels of abstraction .
Â
Talk to a person stuck at the descriptive level , and you may get a story that goes on forever with “ and then he said , and then she said , ” without ever arriving at a point .
Â
Talk to a judgmental person , and you may get , “ I hate women drivers , ” or “ He would n’t have been accused if he were n’t guilty . ”
Korzybski pointed out that the very structure of language tends to push us towards the judgmental .
Â
Most languages have very few intermediate words between polar opposites .
Â
For instance , find the single , intermediate word between such English pairs as “ honest / dishonest , ” “ relevant / irrelevant , ” “ learned / ignorant , ” etc. Â
To be sure , there are some intermediate words in English ( for instance , a range or words between “ beautiful ” and “ repulsive ” ) , and taken in context , the word “ average ” can be very useful .
Â
But in most cases , we are forced to use modifying words like “ very , ” “ somewhat , ” “ most , ” “ many , ” etc. if we want to move our language from the judgmental level to the descriptive .
Â
Another weakness of language is the verb “ to be . ” Â
It implies that people are a certain thing , which isÂ leap to judgment .
Â “ Joe is lazy ” is a greater order of abstraction than , “ Joe did n’t get the work done . ”
There is debate about whether the symbology of language drives cognitively drivenÂ behavior , or whether language is the ultimate result of hard - wired behavioral tendencies .
Â
I tend to believe the latter , while recognizing that Â there is a reinforcing loop .
Â
For instance , if we are biologically predisposed to order our world into broad categories to simplify our thinking and reactions Â ( and I believe we are ) , then we would structure our language into exactly theÂ judgmental , bipolar words and ways of expressing states of being that we currently possess .
Â
Having said that , the language itself makes it difficult to break out of the judgmental level of abstraction .
Â
One must consciously make an effort to use , say , the word “ many ” in the phrase , “ Many elderly people are poor drivers . ”
Â
It appears to be our natural inclination to simplify , saying simply “ Elderly people are poor drivers . ”
Even our writing classes tend to force people from the descriptive or inferential into the judgmental .
Â
I once had a journalism professor tell me that the way I worded something told him that I was guessing .
Â
I replied that guessing was exactly what I was doing , that a guess was all that the data warranted , and that not using modifying words in this case would imply that I was more certain than anyone should be .
Â
Still , there is this push among writing teachers to use transitive verbs ( except among political writers where “ mistakes were made ” has become ubiquitous ) as if there is something virtuous in certainty when certainty is impossible .
The upshot of all this is that jumping to levels of abstraction , like judgment , before we have enough information is a human thinking trap that has caused us much grief over human history .
Â
For instance , we categorize others by race , as if race has any real meaning , and then apply a structure of judgment to that race that carries over to individuals in that racial group .
Â
We categorize others by when they were born , calling them a “ generation , ” and deciding that all individuals of that generation must share the same characteristics .
Understand that it ’s not necessary to say something like , “ All millennials feel entitled . ”
Â
It ’s enough to say , “ Millenials feel entitled . ” Â
In the English language , the “ all ” is implied unless a modifier is used , in the same way one can say “ Water is wet , ” without having to say “ AllÂ water is wet . ” Â
It ’s a human thinking trap , and the way to avoid it is to pay closer attention to the way you write and think .
Â
If you start to use modifying words , I think you will find that you begin to modify your thoughts , as well .
Â
And uncertainty , painful as it can be , is a very useful thing , indeed .
Â
It helps us avoid bad decisions .
Â It may help you decide not to pull out in front of the wrong car , someday .
( Note : Â JS O’Brien will have veryÂ limited access to the Internet in the next week .

Please do not take any failure to respond personally . )
MIAMI , Sept. 16 ( AP )  Patrol officers here will have the option of carrying assault rifles as they try to combat the rise in the use of similar weapons by criminals , the city ’s police chief said Sunday .
The chief , John F. Timoney , approved the policy last week , before a Miami - Dade police officer was killed on Thursday in a shootout with a man wielding an assault rifle .
“ This is something we do not do with any relish , ” Chief Timoney said .
“ We do this reluctantly . ”
The policy had been under review for about a year after officers began seeing an increase in the weapons in the hands of criminals , the chief said .
Officers interested in the guns will have to undergo two days of training and be certified in their use .
The Police Department does not yet have money to buy the assault rifles , and if officers want to use them immediately they will have to pay for them , Chief Timoney said .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Verizon Communications says it has provided federal , state and local law enforcement agencies tens of thousands of communication and business records relating to customers based on emergency requests without a court order or administrative subpoena .
Rep. Edward Markey : " There is an atmosphere of ambiguity which clouds this entire area . "
In an October 12 letter to members of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , a senior Verizon official says that from 2005 through this September there were 63,700 such requests , and of those , 720 came from federal authorities .
The company refused to discuss the content of those requests outside the several examples provided in the letter .
The letter came in response to a request from the panel seeking information from telecommunication firms about the extent of their cooperation with government entities , especially concerning the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program that started weeks after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks .
" There is an atmosphere of ambiguity which clouds this entire area , " Rep. Edward Markey , D - Massachusetts , said in an interview with CNN .
" Congress needs to know .
The American people need to know what the Bush administration is doing in the name of the American people to its own citizens .
And right now we do n't know the answers . "
AT&T and Qwest Communications International also submitted information to the committee , but Verizon 's response was the most detailed .
It said that from 2005 through September it received almost 240,000 requests from government agencies .
The information authorities sought often came along with a warrant from the classified intelligence court authorizing a wiretap or through an administrative subpoena , for example , seeking an Internet address .
The emergency requests , however , were some of the more surprising data provided .
Some of the emergency situations Verizon said it assisted in included locating the Internet address of a child predator who had abducted a 13 - year - old girl ( who was then found due to that information ) and helping Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents track down a man using a webcam to broadcast the sexual abuse of a 6 - year - old boy .
In its letter to Congress , Verizon said that the emergency requests were legal and that private companies do not have " all the information necessary to completely assess the propriety of the government 's actions . "
" Placing the onus on the provider to determine whether the government is acting within the scope of its authority would inevitably slow lawful efforts to protect the public .
When an emergency situation arises , prompt assistance is often needed , " wrote Randal Milch , Verizon 's senior vice president and general counsel .
The extent of cooperation between the nation 's telecommunication firms and the government , especially in the counterterrorism arena , has been of intense interest to civil liberties advocates as well as members of Congress .
In May 2006 , USA Today reported the National Security Agency had been collecting the records of tens of millions of customers from various companies .
A former Qwest executive has said he decided not to participate in that program because of its questionable legality .
Verizon , AT&T and Qwest are all facing lawsuits about their possible participation in various government efforts and therefore have said they cannot comment .
The Justice Department has invoked the " state secrets " privilege to prevent the firms from confirming or denying possible involvement in specific intelligence operations .
Wayne Watts , AT&T 's senior executive vice president and general counsel , wrote , " Our company essentially finds itself caught in the middle of an oversight dispute between the Congress and the executive relating to government surveillance activities .
...
Disputes of this kind need to be resolved through accommodation between the two political branches of government . "
Verizon , which has about 30 million phone and 70 million wireless subscribers , also disclosed it had received subpoenas for more detailed information about whom a person under investigation had called .
Not only had authorities sought information about the person called but wanted to know whom , in turn , that person then communicated with -- a " calling circle " or " community of interest . "
The company said it did not provide that information because it does n't keep such records .
Government officials have said there was a standard that had to be met before making that type of request .
However , in light of an ongoing Justice Department audit concerning abuses by the FBI of administrative subpoenas and misreporting of their use , the bureau has said it has temporarily stopped asking for " community of interest " data .
" It is important to emphasize that it is no longer being used pending the development of an appropriate oversight and approval policy , was used infrequently , and was never used for e-mail communications , " FBI spokesman Mike Kortan told CNN last month .

Supreme Court Backs Monsanto In Seed Patent Case
Justices uphold lower appeals court ruling in dispute over reuse of patented biotech seeds
The Supreme Court , without comment , ruled in favor of Monsanto on Jan. 7 and upheld a lower court ruling that penalized a Mississippi farmer for reusing genetically modified soybean seeds .
Monsanto was awarded $ 375,000 in damages after successfully suing Homan McFarling in 1999 for violating its patents by replanting Roundup Ready soybean seeds .
McFarling saved 1,500 bushels of seeds from his 1998 soybean crop and planted those seeds in 1999 .
He did the same thing the following year , saving soybeans from his 1999 crop and planting them in 2000 .
Monsanto sued , arguing that a technology agreement the farmer signed restricted him to using the seeds for only one growing season .
McFarling 's lawyers argued that patent law does not allow Monsanto " to control the future use of seeds that were a natural product of the seeds that he had bought and planted . "
But the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington , D.C. , sided with Monsanto , ruling that the " the licensed and patented product ( the first - generation seeds ) and the goods made by the licensed product ( the second - generation seeds ) are nearly identical copies . "
The Supreme Court 's affirmation of the lower court rulings helps ensure " continued investment into the kind of research and development necessary to keep growers on the cutting edge of productivity , " Monsanto said in a statement .
" We believe strong intellectual property protection will encourage the investment needed to maintain continued crop improvement , " the company stated .
Newark , CA : Peace activist , Cindy Sheehan says that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi collaborated with the Bush administration in condoning torture because Pelosi knew about water boarding torture since 2002 .
“ Even before becoming Speaker of the House of Representative , she said that impeachment of Bush is out of question . ”
She should be impeached for knowing about torture which dehumanize us all , she added .
Washington
Post reported last week that in September 2002 , four members of Congress met in secret for a first look at a unique CIA program designed to wring vital information from reticent terrorism suspects in U.S. custody .
For more than an hour , the bipartisan group , which included current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democrat Rep.
Jane Harman , was given a virtual tour of the CIA 's overseas detention sites and the harsh techniques interrogators had devised to try to make their prisoners talk .
Speaking at the fourth peace convention of the American Muslim Voice in Newark , CA , last Sunday , Sheehan reiterated that she will be running for Congress against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi for the congressional seat representing San Francisco .
On August 9 , Cindy Sheehan announced that in 2008 she will run as an independent candidate against Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) .
" I dedicate my candidacy to the people of Iraq and Afghanistan , " Sheehan said .
Sheehan later appeared on CNN to explain that she was running because " they 're not making the administration change course in Iraq .
They give him more money ... to wage the war .
They 're not holding him accountable . "
In April 2004 , Sheehan 's son was killed in Iraq .
Sheehan said that we are occupying Iraq , we were not invited by them .
" This occupation of Arab - Muslim land shows how racist we really are , " she said .
" If we can justify it by saying it 's OK to kill a million Iraqis , but at least my family is safe .
...
No , that is not OK ! "
Events , coalition building and groups like the American Muslim Voice are very important to Sheehan , she said , because they allow her " to tear down the boundaries whether they are real or fake that prevent us from having true and authentic relationships with each other . "
Other speakers at the convention included Brandon Mayfield , an Oregon lawyer , who received an apology and restitution from the federal government after being held in jail for weeks spoke about racial and religious profiling after Sept. 11 .
Brandon Mayfield , spoke about his quest for justice , not only for himself , but for all of us through his lawsuit against the government , demanding that the PATRIOT Act be declared unconstitutional .

NEW YORK ( AP )  Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia ( MSO ) is bringing in a new celebrity : popular TV chef Emeril Lagasse .
The media and merchandising company founded by domesticity maven Martha Stewart announced on Tuesday that it bought the rights to the Emeril Lagasse franchise of cookbooks , television shows and kitchen products for $ 45 million in cash and $ 5 million in stock at closing .
The final price could reach $ 70 million if certain benchmarkets are achieved .
The company did not acquire Emeril 's Homebase , which includes Lagasse 's 11 restaurants and corporate office .
Martha Stewart Living said the deal will " contribute immediately to our performance , " adding $ 8 million in earnings before interest , taxes , depreciation and amortization .
The acquired assets generated $ 14 million in revenue in 2007 .
Martha Stewart Living expects the deal to close in the second quarter .
Lagasse joined the Food Network in 1993 and has hosted over 1,600 shows .
His programs The Essence of Emeril and Emeril Live reach more than 85 million homes daily .
At the same time , Martha Stewart Living posted disappointing quarterly results .
The publisher of such magazines as Martha Stewart Living forecast full - year revenue that was below expectations .
RBC Capital analyst David Bank described the outlook and results as a " mixed bag , " but said the Emeril deal adds another well - known brand name to the company , so it would not depend solely on Martha Stewart 's name .
" Both revenue and earnings per share were marginally below our prior expectations but they were n't materially so , " he said , adding that the Emeril deal made strategic and financial sense .
" The more you can bring into the mix away from Martha the better you are , " he said .
" Diversifying the brands in the portfolio is a positive thing . "
Net profit for the fourth quarter was $ 33.3 million , or 63 cents a share , compared with $ 16.2 million , or 31 cents a share , a year earlier .
Revenue rose 22 % to $ 118.5 million .
Analysts were looking for earnings of 65 cents and revenue of $ 121.7 million , according to Reuters Estimates .
It forecast a first - quarter 2008 operating loss in a range of $ 4 million to $ 5 million on revenue of $ 66 million to $ 67 million .
Analysts on average were expecting a loss of $ 4.54 million on revenue of $ 70.9 million for the first quarter , according to Reuters Estimates .
The company said it expects full - year operating income of $ 9.5 million to $ 14.5 million on revenue of $ 300 million .
This compares with analyst estimates for a profit of $ 16.54 million on revenue of $ 333.86 million , according to Reuters Estimates .

Locks of Love sends the best of the hair it receives to a wig manufacturer , Taylormade Hair Replacement in Millbrae , Calif. , which weeds through the selection still further , rejecting up to half .
“ We hate throwing it away but ultimately we have to clear the place out , ” said Greg Taylor , the president and owner of Taylormade .
“ There is a disparity between the hundreds and hundreds of braids and ponytails and the number of hairpieces we ’ve produced . ”
Mr. Taylor sells the wigs wholesale to Locks of Love for less than $ 1,000 .
Since the charity began in December 1997 , it has provided about 2,000 wigs to recipients for free or a reduced price .
The group makes clear in its literature and on its
Web site that most of the wig recipients are not children with cancer .
Rather , they are children who suffer from alopecia areata , an autoimmune disorder that destroys follicles and results in hair loss .
About 2 percent of the population , including half a million children , are estimated to have alopecia .

But many alopecia sufferers seem unaware that they are the group ’s main priority ; only about 10 apply for a wig each week , Ms. Coffman said .
Many donors , too , seem ignorant or only partly aware of the group ’s focus .
Maggie Varney , a hairdresser and owner of a salon in St. Clair Shores , Mich. , said she was shocked to learn that hair she collected from her clients and sent to Locks of Love was not used for wigs for children with cancer .
In reaction , she formed her own nonprofit , Wigs 4 Kids , in 2003 , which receives a few dozen donations of hair a month that are made into wigs that go predominantly to children with cancer .
Two other groups also serve people with cancer .
Pantene Beautiful Lengths , started in June last year , has the resources of Pantene , the $ 3 billion global hair product division of Procter & Gamble , including teams of publicists who stage cutting fests .
Already the program has received 18,000 ponytails — 8,000 more than originally projected — and distributed 2,000 wigs to women with cancer , said Seth Klugherz , the North American Pantene brand manager .
The Federal Reserve has cut rates three times since September
The comments came in the minutes from their 11 December meeting , when they cut rates for the third time to 4.25 % .
They said that risks to growth had risen since their last meeting , mainly due to deteriorating credit markets .
But they also recognised that if financial market conditions improved quickly then rate rises may be needed .
" Some members noted the risk of an unfavourable feedback loop in which credit market conditions restrained economic growth further , leading to additional tightening of credit , " the minutes said .
" Such an adverse development could require a substantial further easing of policy , " they added .
" The ( stock ) market is cutting losses as people are interpreting the Fed minutes as indicating that there will be additional rate cuts , or other measures to lower rates , sooner rather than later , " said Michael James from Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles .
The Dow Jones fell sharply after the release of figures showing manufacturing contracting , and added to its losses after oil prices hit $ 100 a barrel .
But they rebounded after the minutes were published .

After I took you to the philosophy section to show you her absense in person , you began to explain your personal theories to me .
You explained to me that Ayn Rand is the first person to radically change philosophy in history .
You explained to me , in a soft , intimate voice , that capitalism should in fact be called " liberalism , " due to the fact that it comes from the French word for " free , " and that capitalism makes us free .
I would like to apologize at this point for the fact that my employer prevents me from engaging in political or philosophical discussions with customers , because instead of nodding quietly , at this point , what I really should have done was point out that liber actually comes from Latin , from which both the French and English words are derived .
I also apologize for not explaining that capitalism actually falls under the subject of economics .
You continued on to explain that although you do not have a degree in philosophy , you teach this theory to businessmen .
So I would also like to apologize for not explaining that I do actually have a degree in philosophy and would be able to clear a few things up for you ; also for not mentioning that while I 'm sure businessmen who regularly screw the little guy over for money in the name of capitalism are happy to learn it 's actully in the name of freedom , and that I 'm sure you also enjoy the benefit of the freedom your large salary entitles you to , it does not actually constitute a revolution in the philosophical world .
It was only when you went on to explain to me that it is only now , through Ayn Rand , that philosophy has started to be " taken seriously as a science " and is no longer " useless , " that I really began to regret this missed opportunity to engage in discussion .
So , for all these reasons , man with the Ayn Rand obsession , I aplogize profusely .

Straight Talk : DNA Testing and the Legal System
Monday , February 11 , 2008
By Radley Balko
ADVERTISEMENT
Last month , a judge in Terre Haute , Indiana released David Scott from prison .
Scott was freed after serving more than 20 years for a murder he did n't commit .
He was 15 when the crime was committed .
Also last month in Greeley , Colorado , Tim Masters was released after DNA cleared him of a murder for which he had been convicted , and served nearly 10 years .
He was also 15 when the crime was committed .
Police pursued him for 12 years before earning his conviction .
He 's now 36 , and has spent most of his life under a cloud of suspicion for a crime he did n't commit .
Scott and Masters are just two of more than 200 people freed by advances in DNA testing after being convicted of crimes they did n't commit .
It 's true that 200 do n't seem like a large number , particularly when you consider how many cases make their way through U.S. courts each day .
But not every criminal case involves biological evidence .
Typically , only murder and rape cases do , and even within those cases , conditions need to be just right .
It needs to be a case where the biological evidence available was critical in securing a conviction .
The evidence needs to have been preserved , and still in a condition that 's testable .
Factor in all of this , and the pool of cases available for DNA testing shrinks considerably , and that 200 plus figure starts to become a significant proportion of the total cases under consideration .
Consider Dallas County , Texas .
It has the highest exoneration rate in the country , and is second only to New York and Chicago in total exonerations .
This is largely because of two interesting anomalies .
First , because of budget constraints the county began outsourcing its crime lab work to a private contractor in the 1980s .
Unlike many jurisdictions , then , where district attorneys destroy case files after a defendant has exhausted his appeals , the private facility where Dallas was sending its lab work to has biological evidence for cases going back 20 years .
At the same time , Dallas ' has an ( unfortunately ) one - of - a- kind district attorney named Craig Watkins , who not only does n't fight wrongful conviction claims , he is actively working with the Texas Innocence Project to find and clear people doing time for crimes they did n't commit .
Perhaps it 's mere coincidence that the same city where , fortuitously , evidence has been preserved going back two decades , and a crusading young district attorney recognizes that there 's more to his job than throwing people in prison , would also be the city with the highest exoneration rate in the country .
Perhaps Dallas just has a uniquely flawed criminal justice system , and has now stumbled into an uniquely serendipitous set of circumstances to help uncover it .
Unfortunately , the more likely and troubling explanation is that the rest of the country is just as flawed as Dallas — what is unique about Dallas is n't the number of innocent people in prison there , only that we 're finding out about them .
In an illuminating article published last month by the Columbia Law Review , Brandon L. Garret looked at the trials and appeals of 200 people convicted of violent crimes for which they were later exonerated .
Garret 's question gets to the crux of the wave of exonerations since the onset of DNA testing :
How is it that our criminal justice system , with all of its checks and balances , could allow so many innocent people to be convicted of rape or murder ?
How did it allow innocent people to be sentenced to death ?
Garret found that a variety of factors contributed to the initial wrongful convictions .
False eyewitness testimony was the overwhelming factor ( 79 percent of the cases ) , followed by faulty forensic science ( 55 percent ) , and false testimony from informants working for the police ( 18 percent ) .
In 16 percent of the cases , the defendant actually falsely confessed to the crime .
False confessions are common among young and mentally ill suspects , particularly when subjected to harsh interrogation from police .
More troubling was what Garret found in the appeals process .
Many people wrongly assume appeals courts serve as a kind of backup for trial courts , guarding against innocent people slipping through the system .
In truth , appeals courts rarely consider the actual guilt or innocence of a criminal defendant .
Most of the time , they address procedural matters relating to how the trial was administered , whether the judge issued appropriate rulings regarding evidence and witnesses , and whether the state properly protected the defendant 's constitutional rights .
Garret found that of the 200 people convicted for crimes for which they were later exonerated , just eighteen were granted reversals by the appellate courts .
Of the rest , 67 had their appeals denied with no written ruling at all .
In 63 cases , the appellate court 's opinion referred to the defendant 's guilt .
In 12 other cases , it referred to the " overwhelming " evidence of guilt .
In the remaining cases , the appeals courts either found the defendant 's appeal without merit , or found some merit in his claims , but found that the trial court 's errors were " harmless , " or unlikely to have affected the jury 's verdict .
Keep in mind , these are all cases in which the defendant was later determined to be actually innocent of the crime for which he was convicted .
More alarmingly , Garret found in his research of these 200 cases that " even after DNA testing became available , courts and law enforcement also posed obstacles to conducting DNA testing , and then denied relief even after DNA proved innocence . "
Many were convicted despite DNA testing pointing to their innocence , and 41 had to rely on the mercy of a governor 's pardon power because , despite their proven innocence , they had already exhausted their appeals , and could make no further claims in court .
" Thus for some , " Garret concludes .
" Even once DNA evidence exonerated them , our judicial system was unwilling or unable to provide a remedy . "
Garret 's study is chilling .
Even if these 200 cases represent a small percentage of the subset of cases for which DNA testing can conclusively point to a defendants guilt or innocence — say one or two percent — it 's safe to assume that the flaws in the criminal justice system that allowed them to happen exist in all criminal cases , not just rape or murder cases .
The same overeager prosecutors , corrupt or incompetent forensics experts and cops , mistaken eyewitnesses , and indifferent courts that prosecute and oversee these cases also move thousands of cases through the system for which there 's no safety net of DNA testing .
If it 's this difficult for an innocent person to clear his name in cases where there 's science available to deliver a definitive answer , imagine the people now wrongly sitting in a jail cell for drug offenses , theft , or for violent crimes for which there was no available biological evidence — people for whom science offers little hope for relief .
Imagine a world where most of the functions of our personal computers – running applications , communicating , and storing data – do not take place on those computers but rather at massive computer server farms located in remote locations and linked through high - speed networks .
This is not the stuff of science fiction but rather describes " cloud computing , " one of the hottest Internet and computing trends and the subject of my weekly technology law column ( Toronto Star version , Vancouver Sun , homepage version ) .
Despite limited public attention , cloud computing has already woven its way into the fabric of the Internet .
Web - based applications allow users to word process , create presentations , and manipulate data spreadsheets online , Internet - based data backup services offer the chance to store mirror images of our computer hard drives , and every day hundreds of millions of people use Internet services such as web - based email , photo sharing sites , or Facebook applications where the significant computing power resides elsewhere ( in the " cloud " of the Internet ) .
Critics argue that the benefits of cloud computing – greater computing efficiencies and the accessibility of data and applications from anywhere – are offset by the privacy implications of lost control over our personal data .
Moreover , a growing number of environmental groups note with alarm the enormous energy requirements to power ( and keep cool ) hundreds of thousands of computer servers .
While cloud computing is an international trend , Canada may interestingly enjoy a global competitive advantage that would address some of the critics ' concerns .
Indeed , led by Bill St. Arnaud , the Senior Director of Advanced Networks for CANARIE , which focuses on advanced networks in Canada , there are mounting efforts to position the Canadian north as the ideal home for cloud computing .
The starting point is to establish high - speed , optical networks that run north – south between the Canadian arctic and the major Canadian urban centres .
Connecting these two regions by optical network would use minimal energy and have the power to instantly transfer huge amounts of data .
Locating the server farms in the Canadian north offers several environmental advantages .
These include easy access to clean energy sources such as wind and geo - thermal energy and , given the colder climate , decreased energy requirements to cool the computer server farms .
In fact , St. Arnaud argues that the heat generated by the computers can be captured and used to heat nearby buildings leading to zero carbon data centres .
In addition to the environmental considerations , locating computer server farms in Canada would offer Canadians better privacy protection since their data would never leave the country and would be subject to national privacy laws .
St. Arnaud is quick to point out that Canada is not alone in competing for cloud computing installations , however .
As companies increasingly factor environmental and legal considerations into their decision making processes , other countries are trying to position themselves as the ideal hosts .
For example , Iceland recently announced the creation of a high - speed link with the United States , as it seeks to parlay its geographic position and availability of geo - thermal energy to advantage .
Canada already has much of the technical and privacy infrastructure in place to become a global player .
It is a recognized fibre - optic network leader in close proximity to the United States and its privacy legislation meets international standards , thereby removing a potential impediment to data transfers into the country .
A significant barrier , however , may be the failure to address several legal issues that increases the risk of storing data in Canada .
These include the absence of legal protections for Internet intermediaries ( such as Internet service providers ) for content they host but over which they have no knowledge or control .
Moreover , the absence of a " fair use " provision under Canadian law increases the potential liability for innovative business models that rely on cloud computing infrastructure .
Many of the world 's leading technology companies , including IBM , Google , and Microsoft , are moving rapidly toward the cloud computing model .
If Canada responds , it could emerge as a leader and in the process address mounting concerns over the cloud computing 's effect on personal privacy and the environment .

More than 30 Vermont towns passed resolutions on Tuesday seeking to impeach President Bush , while at least 16 towns in the tiny New England state called on Washington to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq .
Known for picturesque autumn foliage , colonial inns , maple sugar and old - fashion dairy farms , Vermont is in the vanguard of a grass - roots protest movement to impeach Bush over his handling of the unpopular Iraq war .
Even as the grassroots impeachment movement gathers steam , the mainstream media and the Democrats are doing to their best to mock , derail , ignore and sabotage the efforts of concerned Americans across this great country .
Did anybody choke over the preceding paragraph ?
Did you think that Democrats would be eager to avenge the impeachment of Clinton ?
Well , you 're wrong .
The Democrats are avoiding the issue like it was radioactive .
And the media , well , we all know the liberal media is ... liberal .
Right ?
Wrong .
The media is not left or right , it 's corporate .
The media does whatever sells , folks .
Their only true ideology is profit .
As the Propaganda Model states , the media does not sell news -- they sell , the consumers of news , to the businesses that pay for ads and PR .
Who perpetuates the myth of the liberal media anyway ?
Oh , that 's right ...
The media does !
Especially the Bill O'Reillys and Sean Hannitys and Rush Limbaughs and Ann Coulters of the world ( there seem to be a lot of these folks .
How did they manage to find employment in the big , mean liberal media machine ? ) .
Despite their lies , the media is certainly not liberal , but the lie has become self - perpetuating so that people think " if the media does it , it must be liberal ! " thereby allowing conservatives and corporatists to define liberals with their own labels and bias .
It 's a really neat trick .
Goebbels would be proud .
The left - wing is so weak and pathetic that it mostly just nods its head and cowers in the corner lest Bill O'Reilly raise his voice again ( of course , these are just the liberals the mediato see ) .
In reality , the media skews conservative on many things , including the war , the economy and the prospect of impeachment .
Let 's take a look at this Reuters article on Vermont 's grassroots impeachment effort and see how the media distorts things to serve a certain point of view .
Notice how Vermont is portrayed as pastoral .
The subtle message is : " These backwards - ass hicks think they can impeach the president .
Is n't that cute ?
" Now that we 've established that Vermont 's voters are bunch of tree - hugging , bean - curd - eating hippies we proceed to " The Big Lie " , which Reuters needs to work on a bit since it really sticks out like a sore thumb in this piece .
See if you can spot it :
After casting votes on budgets and other routine items , citizens of 32 towns in Vermont backed a measure calling on the U.S. Congress to file articles of impeachment against Bush for misleading the nation on Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction and for engaging in illegal wiretapping , among other charges .
Five Vermont towns passed similar resolutions last year .
The idea of impeaching Bush resides firmly outside the political mainstream .
The new Democratic - controlled Congress has steered clear of the subject , and Wisconsin Sen . Russell Feingold 's call last year to censure Bush -- a step short of an impeachment -- found scant support on Capitol Hill , even among fellow Democrats .
Did you find it ?
It 's the mostly - unsupported argument in the middle .
" The idea of impeaching Bush resides firmly outside the political mainstream . "
THIS IS A LIE .
A big one , too .
If the reporter / propaganda - spewer ( Jason Szep ) had done any research ( and I believe he must have ) , he would 've noticed that Americans overwhelmingly support impeachment .
From the Zogby poll :
By a margin of 53 % to 42 % , Americans want Congress to impeach President Bush if he lied about the war in Iraq , according to a new Zogby poll commissioned by AfterDowningStreet.org , a grassroots coalition that supports a Congressional investigation of President Bush 's decision to invade Iraq in 2003 .
Not surprisingly , Democrats supported the consideration of impeachment by a broad margin ( 76 percent ) while Republicans opposed ( 66 percent ) .
However , 29 percent of Republicans told Zogby pollsters that they supported Congress examining impeachment over Iraq .
This is " firmly outside the political mainstream " ?!!
Well , in the reporter 's defense it must be said that the Democrats and the Mainstream Media ( MSM ) have done everything in their power to keep it out of the political mainstream .
This is done via articles such as the one we 're talking about , wherein people supporting accountability are mocked as pastoral peasants , slandered as left - wing nutjobs or talked down to like illiterate boobs .
So much for the free and impartial press .
The Democrats are certainly party to this travesty .
They have betrayed the very Americans who voted for them
It should be noted that AfterDowningStreet.org had to commission this poll because the Media certainly would n't do it themselves .
If we had waited on them for such a poll , we 'd still be waiting .
Despites the media 's lies of omission and distortion impeachment is gathering steam across the nation , not just in Vermont as the article tried to imply .
New Mexico Washington state and cities across the nation are moving towards , or have already passed , resolutions supporting impeachment .
The Media does n't want you to know this .
As for the Democrats , their spinelessness is appalling , especially considering what happened less than 10 years ago .
Funny , I do n't remember people taking to the streets to demand Clinton 's impeachment .
In fact , polls showed most people opposed impeachment for Clinton .
I would 've liked to see Clinton impeached for other reasons , but the charges he was impeached for were pretty trivial , and it was clearly a political witch - hunt .
This time around the polls favor impeachment , but the Media is nowhere to be found whipping up impeachment fervor , and the Democrats , far from leading the charge , are carrying up the rear .
They 're being dragged into this fight by the common folk , and many of them show no signs of supporting impeachment .
It 's as if Bush were there best buddy all of a sudden .
Suspicious , would n't you say ?
I 've said it before , and I 'll say it again : The Mainstream Media is a corporate - controlled institution that the oligarchy is using to promote and maintain fascism .
Bush , as a fascist , is their hero .
The MSM and Bush led us into this bloody war in Iraq , hand - in - hand ; they 're practically attached at the hip .
They would sooner spit on their own mothers than encourage the impeachment of their pretty - boy fascist führer .
The Democrats are controlled by the same oligarchy and their part is to basically " rollover and play dead " for the fascist Republicans .
We must feed the war machine with our babies .
The economy depends on it , since so much of it is rooted in the military - industrial complex
So what can you do about it ?
Well , start by supporting the organizations out there that are spearheading the impeachment effort .
Quite frankly , there are so many that I have a hard time keeping track of them all .
Here 's a quick list of some of the bigger ones : Apathy is not a strategy .
What are you doing to change the world ?

Sea levels rising at an " alarming " rate because of climate change and depleting groundwater threaten coastal economies , officials warned Tuesday .
Two key cities , Shanghai and Tianjin , are among those facing the biggest threat , State Oceanic Administration ( SOA ) spokesman Li Haiqing said , citing the agency 's 2007 sea - level monitoring report .
In the last 30 years , the financial hub of Shanghai has seen the sea level rise 115 mm , or the length of half a chopstick , the report says .
Tianjin , a major port about two hours ' drive from Beijing , has seen the level rise as much as 196 mm , about the length of a new pencil .
In the past 30 years , the country 's overall sea level has risen 90 mm with the average offshore surface temperature going up by 0.9C .
In comparison , when the global sea level rose 1.7 mm every year between 1975 and 2007 , the Chinese sea level rose 2.5 mm every year , the SOA reports .
In the next decade , the SOA forecasts , China 's coastal sea level is likely to rise by 32 mm , or 3.2 mm every year .
This is the first time the SOA has reported the cumulative figures of sea level rises in the last 30 years .
The report is now being released annually , instead of every three years .
A three - degree risk rating system is being set up by the SOA to inform coastal cities of potential threats they face , Chen Manchun , a researcher with the SOA , told China Daily .
Sea level rises worldwide cannot be reversed , so Chinese city officials and planners must take measures to adapt to the change , he said .
Global warming is the main reason for the rising sea levels , SOA officials said , but surface subsidence is also to blame for the threat of floods in Shanghai and Tianjin - due to their " indiscriminate exploitation of groundwater resources " -
Chen said .
Shanghai is also facing additional trouble in ensuring fresh water supply to its 20 million residents due to seawater intrusion , he pointed out .
The sea level report also shows an imbalance , the SOA reported without explaining the reason .
From the Yangtze River Delta to the north , cities tend to face more serious problems than those in the south .
Liaoning , Shandong and Zhejiang provinces saw sea levels rise about 100 mm , while in Fujian and Guangdong provinces , including the area about the Pearl River Delta and Hong Kong , the rise was 50 - 60 mm .
Also Tuesday , the SOA released its China 2007 Sea Environmental Quality Report and China 2007 Sea Disaster Report .
The environmental quality report shows serious deterioration in offshore water quality caused by pollution from onshore sources .
This commentary aired on National Public Radio ’s All Things Considered on January 16 , 2008 in response to much talk about the the need to create a stimulus package to avert a recession .
Audio is here .
Love that word — stimulus .
It sounds so scientific .
With the right stimulus , you can even make the leg of a dead frog twitch .
A heart attack victim gets the stimulus from those chest paddles and bam .
Back to life .
My online dictionary defines stimulus as something that “ rouses or incites to activity . ”
Sounds like the perfect prescription for an ailing economy .
But if politicians know how to stimulate the economy , why wait for a recession ?
If you can make the economy grow , why wait for bad times ?
One answer is that a healthy patient does n’t need medicine .
But the other possibility is that it ’s all hot air .
Maybe we do n’t know how to make a $ 14 trillion economy move very quickly .
And if we did , it would take a lot more than an injection of even 125 billion dollars .
There ’s that scientific language again — an injection .
The politicians are always going to inject some amount of money into the hands of consumers and into the economy , like a doctor giving a lifesaving blood transfusion .
But where does the economic injection come from ?
It has to come from inside the system .
It ’s not an outside stimulus like the chest paddles or the transfusion .
It means taking money from someone or somewhere inside the system and giving it to someone else .
The standard stimulus package does n’t change incentives .
It ’s a check from the government .
The hope is that the receiver will spend it .
But when you just send out checks from the government , whoever gets stimulated is likely to be offset by someone who gets unstimulated .
The money has to come from somewhere .
If you raise taxes to fund the plan , the people who are taxed are poorer and they ’ll spend less .
If you borrow money to fund the plan , the people who buy the government bonds have less money to spend and that offsets the stimulus .
It ’s like taking a bucket of water from the deep end of a pool and dumping it into the shallow end .
Funny thing — the water in the shallow end does n’t get any deeper .
And even the people who get the money often save more of it than they spend .
That ’s why stimulus schemes based on giving people money have a poor track record of energizing the economy .
Usually , the only thing that gets stimulated is a politician ’s approval rating .
I ’m not saying that economy policy is irrelevant .
Economic policy matters because it affects the long - run growth of the economy .
I ’m all for policies that make us more productive or innovative by changing incentives .
But those policies take time .
There ’s little any economic doctor can do to move our $ 14 trillion organism of an economy in the next few months .
Politicians who work in the Oval Office — or those who seek to work there — would be wise to remember that patience is a virtue .
Focus on the policies that lead to growth over time .
Expecting results overnight is bound to lead to disappointment .
Friday night 's Real Time with Bill Maher was a riveting display of the dishonest attacks on Barack Obama by the wingnut paparazzi .
Rep. Jack Kingston is in his usual wanker form and brings out the most ludicrous talking points to lead the way .
Download Download ( h/t Heather )
Kingston promotes the false wingnut position that Obama wo n't say the pledge of allegiance and refuses to wear his American flag lapel pin .
Funny , I did n't see Kingston wearing a pin either .
He must hate America too .
Heather makes a few observations :
Frum justifies McCain 's back peddling on torture as a practical solution on dealing with terrorists .
Taibbi calls him out and asks what does that tell you about that wing of your party if we can't even take a stand against the Spanish Inquisition .
Kingston is lying about what Michelle Obama said .
She did come out and clarify her statements later and he 's ignoring that .
Kingston saying Obama is applying for the " number one cheer leading slot for United States of America " .
So the President 's job is to cheer lead ?
Kingston says Obama still wants to bomb Pakistan .
He ignores that Bush said the same thing about going after Bin Laden if an exact location was known .
Taibbi on McCain and how he wants to do more bombing and how his idiot civilian commanders would n't let him bomb more targets during Vietnam .
He 's continued to say we 've never done enough air strikes in any conflict we 've been in and lists them .
Kingston says it means he wants to win the war and bring the guys home .
Frum says Obama goes off on these " windy cascades " where people look to politics to transform their lives rather than to actually run the country .
The candidate he 's more sympathetic to is Clinton and that people will go back later after I guess Obama has destroyed the country .
Obama thinks there 's a special magic that comes from a Presidential meeting and has a great over estimation about the power of his own personality and he 's been drinking his own bath water .
Last week I researched how to subvert the Asus 701 ( Eee ) !
Last year I documented adding internal USB Bluetooth to another sub-notebook …
Now I ’ve combined the two – I ’ve added internal USB Bluetooth to my Eee without interfering with the built - in wireless , using the empty mini PCIe card slot , or disabling any of the available USB ports :)
First , I stripped the casing and USB connector off a small USB Bluetooth module ( Bluetooth 2.0 + EDR ) :
After soldering 30 ga. flexible insulated wire to the USB Bluetooth module , I wrapped it in Kapton tape :
Then I connected the USB Bluetooth module to a 5V trace ( off in standby ) and a nearby ground trace – I used the USB signals available on the mini PCIe card slot occupied by the Atheros mini PCIe wireless card :
Finally , I decided to install the USB Bluetooth module in the area between the track pad and the status lights under the palm rest .
I picked this location because there ’s no shielding over the front edge of the palm rest to interfere with the PCB antenna on the USB Bluetooth module :
The end result in Xandros Linux :
The end result in Windows XP :
Here I have a Bluetooth mouse connected as well as my Sony Ericsson K850 i which is being used both as an HSDPA modem over Bluetooth and as the camera taking these pictures :
641 Kbps dpwn and 264 Kbps up – pretty good for an HSDPA modem over Bluetooth , especially indoors , right next to a wireless router :
Just remember , kids …
Do n’t try this at home !
Introduction
Michael Behe 's term " irreducible complexity " is , to be frank , plainly silly — and here 's why .
" Irreducible complexity " is a simple concept .
According to Behe , a system is irreducibly complex if its function is lost when a part is removed1 .
Behe believes that irreducibly complex systems cannot evolve by direct , gradual evolutionary mechanisms .
However , standard genetic processes easily produce these structures .
Nearly a century ago , these exact systems were predicted , described , and explained by the Nobel prize - winning geneticist H. J. Muller using evolutionary theory2 .
Thus , as explained below , so - called " irreducibly complex " structures are in fact evolvable and reducible .
Behe gave irreducible complexity the wrong name .
Behe 's flawed argument
Behe claims that irreducibly complex systems cannot be produced directly by gradual evolution3 .
But why not ?
Behe 's reckoning goes like this :
( P1 ) Direct , gradual evolution proceeds only by stepwise addition of parts .
( P2 ) By definition , an irreducibly complex system lacking a part is nonfunctional .
(C) Therefore , all possible direct gradual evolutionary precursors to an irreducibly complex system must be nonfunctional .
Of course , Behe 's argument is invalid since the first premise is false : gradual evolution can do much more than just add parts .
For instance , evolution can also change or remove parts ( pretty simple , eh ? ) .
In contrast , Behe 's irreducible complexity is restricted to only reversing the addition of parts .
This is why irreducible complexity cannot tell us anything useful about how a structure did or did not evolve .
The Mullerian two - step
With Behe 's error now in hand , we immediately have the following embarrassingly facile solution to Behe 's " irreducible " conundrum .
Only two basic steps are needed to gradually evolve an irreducibly complex system from a functioning precursor :
Add a part .
Make it necessary .
It 's that simple .
After these two steps , removing the part will kill the function , yet the system was produced directly and gradually from a simpler , functional precursor .
And this is exactly what Behe alleges is impossible .
As a scientific explanation , the Mullerian two - step is extremely general and powerful , since it is independent of the biological specifics of the system in question .
In fact , both steps can happen simultaneously , in a single event , even a single mutation .
The function of the system can remain constant during the process or it can change .
The steps can be functionally beneficial ( adaptive ) or not ( neutral ) .
We do n't even need to invoke natural selection in the process — genetic drift or neutral evolution will do4 .
The number of ways to add a part to a biological structure is virtually unlimited , as is the number of different ways to change a system so that a part becomes functionally essential .
Plain , ordinary genetic processes can easily do both .
A historically and technically appropriate name for IC : " Interlocking Complexity "
For the preceding reasons , compelled by both scholarly ethics and scientific accuracy , I suggest that we avoid reference to " irreducibly complex " structures using Behe 's misnomer .
Rather , I propose the term " Mullerian interlocking complexity " ( MIC ) , terminology similar to that used in H. J. Muller 's much earlier evolutionary analyses of the same molecular phenomenon ( Muller 1918 ; Muller 1939 ) .
Example 1 : The stone bridge
A clear example of the Mullerian two - step is given by a stone bridge .
Consider a crude " precursor bridge " made of three stones .
This bridge spans the area needed to be crossed and is thus functional .
For step one of the Mullerian two - step , a part is added : a flat stone on top , covering all precursor stones .
Whether this improves the functionality of the bridge is irrelevant — it may or may not , the bridge still functions .
For step two of the Mullerian two - step , the middle stone is removed .
Voilá , we have an irreducibly complex bridge , since the last step made the top - stone necessary for the function .
The precursor bridge : three stones .
Step # 1 , add a part : the top -stone .
Step # 2 , make it necessary : remove the middle stone .
As promised , we now have an irreducibly complex stone bridge .
None of the three stones can be removed without destroying the bridge 's function .

Sprays may irritate the airways , say the researchers
A study found using household cleaning sprays and air fresheners as little as once a week raised the risk of asthma .
Heavy use of such products has already been linked with occupational asthma , but the latest work suggests occasional use in the home also poses a threat .
The Spanish study of more than 3,500 is published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine .
We do already know that air fresheners and bleach trigger symptoms in people who already have asthma
Victoria King of Asthma UK
The risk of developing asthma increased with frequency of cleaning and the number of different sprays used .
Spray air fresheners , furniture cleaners and glass cleaners carried the highest risk .
Exposure to cleaning products could account for as much as 15 % , or one in seven adult asthma cases , the researchers suggest .
On average , the risk was 30 - 50 % higher in people regularly used the sprays than in others .
And the incidence of physician - diagnosed asthma was higher among those using sprays at least four days per week
Irritants
The study authors , Dr Jan -Paul Zock and colleagues from the Municipal Institute of Medical Research in Barcelona , said work was needed to determine the biological mechanism behind the increased risk .
It may be that sprays contain irritants specific to asthma , they suggest .
Dr Kenneth Rosenman , professor of occupational and environmental medicine at Michigan State University , said : " Clinicians should be aware of the potential for cleaning products used in the home to cause respiratory symptoms and possibly asthma . "
Victoria King of Asthma UK said : " We know that up to 25 % of people exposed to chemicals , including cleaning sprays , at work will go on to develop occupational asthma .
" This report also highlights significant findings regarding the link between asthma and the use of spray cleaning products in the home .
Although further research is needed , we do already know that air fresheners and bleach trigger symptoms in people who already have asthma .
" For anybody concerned about developing asthma as a result of using cleaning products we recommend they speak to their doctor or call our advice line on 08457 01 02 03 . "
The UK Cleaning Products Industry Association said : " The safety of consumers is the highest priority of our industries and the safety of our products is regularly checked and subject to rigorous controls , as well as stringent European legislation . "
A spokesman stressed that cleaning product use has not been demonstrated to cause asthma .

For anyone with a case of mild Facebook addiction , finding the time to squeeze a little work in between messing around online has become one of the great challenges of the 21st - century office .
So if you are taking a quiet moment at work to read this online , steal a glance over your shoulder now : an investigation by the Guardian has found that employers are taking an increasingly draconian line on workplace time - wasters .
More than 1,700 public employees have been sacked or disciplined for internet or email misuse in the past three years , our research has found .
The figures - obtained from 65 institutions - show how strongly employers are clamping down on staff who spend hours on social networking sites such as Facebook , MySpace and Bebo .
Unions say that disputes over the sites are growing at a phenomenal rate and have demanded clearer guidelines for their use .
Studies have shown that up to £ 130 m a day in productivity is lost because of the sites , with Facebook 's British members spending an average of 143 minutes a month logged in .
Other common offences include excessive use of other websites or email , viewing " inappropriate " material such as pornography and the forwarding of offensive emails .
An increasing number of employers now attempt to ban sites they consider inappropriate .
Government departments have been among the most unforgiving .
The Ministry of Justice ( MoJ ) , formally the Department for Constitutional Affairs , dismissed 30 employees while the Department for Work and Pensions reprimanded 313 .
An MoJ spokesman said that the offenders had been in clear breach of the department 's IT procedures and , in some cases , its equality and diversity rules .
Personal internet use is only allowed if sanctioned by a line manager .
The Metropolitan police disciplined 187 staff while Hertfordshire police gave formal warnings to 25 after an offensive video clip was circulated .
The TUC has criticised employers who clamp down too heavily on staff without properly fleshing out guidelines for what constitutes reasonable conduct .
A spokesman said : " Social networking at work is a recent problem and it's growing at a phenomenal rate .
But employers are often not setting a standard as to what level of internet use is acceptable . "
The figures , obtained under the Freedom of Information Act , show that in the past three years at least 1,722 public employees were disciplined for internet or email misuse .
A total of 132 were sacked , 41 resigned , 868 got formal warnings and 686 received other forms of warning or punishment , such as a reduction in rank or a fine .
The data came from 65 government departments , police forces and local councils .
A spokesman for the Local Government Association said : " Councils will take a no - nonsense approach to anyone who uses the internet in work time to download inappropriate or offensive material .
Councils have a duty to ensure that employees are working for the council taxpayer as that is who pays their wages . "
Cary Cooper , a professor of organisational psychology and health at Lancaster University , said that managers should be realistic .
" Britain has some of the longest working hours in the developed world .
Employers have created this culture .
It is natural for people to have to use work computers for organising their personal life . "
Social networking has boomed over the past 12 months .
Facebook alone now has more than 5 million regular users in the UK .
A spokesman said : " While we respect the decision of employers to put website policies into place , we also encourage them to consider the important role Facebook plays in people 's daily lives . "

Since the launch of the “ global war on terror , ” a large majority of Americans have been encouraged to cower under the pseudo - protective umbrella of a permanent Nation Security State .
Last year I wrote several posts about the current prison - industrial complex and the increasing number of privatized prisons being used to house thousands of detained immigrants .
The rise of the prison - industrial complex is one the most disturbing things going on in this country .
According to a recent report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics – released on June 30 , 2006 and revised in July 2007 – there are over 2 million people behind bars in the United States .
At the time of the report , there were about 180,000 in federal custody , 1.2 million in state custody , and 760,000 in local jails .
The BJS statistics also reported there were over 90,000 immigrants ( both documented and undocumented ) who were held over 12 months by three jurisdictions : the Federal system housed 33,701 ; California housed 15,849 ; and Texas housed 9,227 .
In a recent “ year in review ” report , the Department of Homeland Security announced that the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement ( ICE ) had rounded up more than 30,000 immigrants – doubling the number from last year .
According to Detention Watch Network , a D.C. based advocacy group , more than 186,600 immigrants were deported in 2006 .
However , more disturbingly , in 2007 , ICE had detained more than 300,000 immigrants .
These frightening statistics only confirm this country ’s commitment to lock up an insurmountable amount of people ; and the reality of it all , this is an integral part of the globalization of capital .
Prison Construction Continues to Mushroom
Private prisons are changing the face of American incarceration .
For the tycoons who have invested in the prison industry , it has been like winning the lottery .
Analysts say profit margins are higher at detention centers than prisons , according to a 2006 New York Times article .
The explosive growth in the detention business has drawn many cities and counties to partner these corporations in exchange for lucrative federal contracts .
Last month , Louisiana - based Emerald Correctional Management LLC made a pitch to the Caldwell Commissioners Court to build a $ 30 million , 1,000 - bed private detention center in Central Texas .
The proposed facility would be built between Lytton Springs and Dale , about 30 miles southeast of Austin .
ICE would house men and women separately .
In November , Homeland Security agreed to pay Los Angles County $ 51 million to house 1,400 immigrants at the Mira Loma Detention Center , making it the largest facility of its kind in California .
According to the contract obtained by the Daily Journal , County officials will charge the Homeland Security $ 100.09 a day to house a detainee .
One week before Christmas , the city of Aurora , Colorado held a town meeting to debate the proposed plan to expand the existing 400 - bed facility , Aurora ICE Processing Center , into a 1,500 - bed center , making it the second largest detention center .
The largest is located in Raymondville , TX with 2,000 - beds .
The Aurora ICE Processing Center is run and operated by the Geo Group ( formerly known as the Wackenhut Corrections Corporation ) .
According to Geo , the facility can currently hold up to “ 400 males , females , children ( unsentenced ) . ”
The detainees being held in the Aurora Processing Center are the immigrants that have been picked up from Colorado , Wyoming , Idaho , Montana , and Utah .
In order to defuse the tension that was beginning to build up in Aurora , Carl Rusnok , a spokesman for ICE , made sure to state that ICE had no influence in GEO ’s decision to expand their facility and that there is “ no guarantee ” that ICE would require an additional “ 1,100 beds at the Aurora facility . ”
Recently , the Miami Herald reported on the military ’s plan to build a tent encampment to detain up to 45,000 migrants seeking asylum in the event of a Caribbean migrant crisis .
Last May , at a cost of $ 16.5 million , “ the Navy hired a Jacksonville contractor to build concrete buildings with 525 toilets and 248 showers on an empty corner ” at GuantÃ¡namo Bay , Cuba .
This is part of a larger plan by Homeland Security , dubbed “ Operation Vigilant Sentry . ”
Vigilant Sentry is a massive operation that also includes federal , state and local law enforcement agencies “ to thwart a mass influx of boat people fleeing political upheaval or natural disaster in the Caribbean . ”
According to Reuters , part of the encampment was finished a few years ago .
The site can currently “ hold up to 400 migrants in tents and cots stored in shipping containers on the base .
A barbed - wire fence separates it from a neighboring galley and bar . ”
Reuters is also reporting that is will cost the federal government $ 110 million to finish the site .
However , one must be concerned if the Bush administration is planning to replicate Australia ’s use of ‘ offshore ’ processing camps – infamously known as the ‘ Pacific Solution ’ – to process all asylum claims .
Adopted in 2001 by the Howard Government , the ‘ Pacific Solution ’ was the name given to Australia ’s immigration policy to detain all asylum seekers who arrive independently , without permission to offshore detention centers in the Pacific Ocean such as Christmas Island , the tiny island nation of Nauru and Papua New Guinea ’s Manus Island until it can process their asylum requests .
The Pacific Solution has been criticized by human rights groups and by the UN .
Asylum - seekers in offshore processing centers had no recourse to the appeals system available in Australia .
Part of the policy included mandatory detention for adults and children seeking asylum for the duration of their processing by the Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs ( DIMIA ) .
Particular concerns have been expressed by many over the detention of children in Australia ’s Immigration Detention Centers .
Although the US military did not mention if the new site will also house the children of asylum seekers , one does have to wonder what will happen to the children once the asylum seekers are captured by the Coast Guard .
If so , it would be wise for this government to also take note of the latest developments regarding Australia ’s Pacific Solution .
During the latter months of 2007 , the newly elected Prime Minister , Kevin Rudd , began dismantling the discredited policy .
Rudd confirmed that the detention centers on Manus Island and on Nauru would be closed .
Influencing Incarceration
The private prison industry exerts whatever pressure it can to encourage state legislators to privatize state prisons .
The rise of modern prison privatization was based on the notion that government was doing a poor job of incarceration .
The phenomenon of private prisons and their corollary industries , private inmate transportation , private inmate food services and private inmate medical services , came into the public eye in the mid-1980s , when the fledgling Corrections Corporation of America ( CCA ) opened its first detention center in Houston , TX .
Wackenhut Corrections Corporation ( now Geo Group ) , the prison - management division of global security giant Wackenhut Security , entered the market soon after .
These developments drew little attention , but this changed in 1985 and 1986 when governments began to contract with private firms to operate secure facilities that functioned as county jails and state prisons .
For too long now , the American public has looked on in despair or resignation as private corporations shape public policies to advance the interests of their industry , often at the expense of the common good .
Nearly , 50 years ago , President Dwight D. Eisenhower warned us of the dangers of “ a permanent arms industry of vast proportions ” in addressing the looming “ military - industrial complex . ”
While the former general was well aware of the military threat posed by the Soviet Union , he also was well aware that war profiteers in the US had their own agendas , too .
In the councils of government , we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence , whether sought or unsought , by the military - industrial complex .
The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist .
What makes this industry so complex is that it ’s comprised of think tanks , former corporate executives , consultants and shareholders of top US defense companies “ who profit by manufacturing arms and selling them to the government . ”
Subsidized by the Complex , pro-war think tanks have become a major force in promoting our current ( Afghanistan and Iraq ) and upcoming ( Iran ) wars .
Billions of dollars are sent , without hearings and often unquestioned because they ’re ostensibly for “ defense , ” to Congressional districts across the country .
This process , of course , fuels incumbent campaigns for re-election .
The fact is that politicians , regardless of party affiliation , march to the drums of US multinational corporations who fund their political careers .
As we try to understand the prison - industrial complex , we have to look at all of these pieces together .
Like the military - industrial complex , the prison - industrial complex is also driven by a set of bureaucratic , political , and economic interests that encourage increased spending on imprisonment , regardless of the actual need .
One of the principal mechanisms used to advance their cause comes from a little - known organization called the American Legislative Council ( ALEC ) , a conservative public policy think tank with members that include private corporations , trade organizations , and 2,400 state and federal legislators .
ALEC ’s primary function is to draft model legislation for legislator - members to take back to their home jurisdictions and do their best to turn into law ; it ’s essentially a forum for corporations and government to “ co-author ” laws .
In 2000 , over 3,100 bills based on ALEC ’s model legislation were introduced into legislatures by its members , with 450 such bills signed into law .
According to ALEC itself , the most productive of its various divisions is the Criminal Justice and Homeland Security Task Force , which has repeatedly turned its model legislation into real laws .
Due in large part to these new industry authored laws , the number of incarcerated Americans has risen dramatically – from 740,000 prisoners in 1985 to more than 2.2 million in 2006 .
As much as ALEC downplays the corporate benefits accruing from its legislative initiatives , it should come as no surprise that both CCA and Geo Group have been private - sector members of ALEC , and that both have been among its major benefactors of ALEC ’s Criminal Justice Task Force .
It is also important to note that CCA executives have co-chaired Criminal Justice Task Force for many years .
It is hard to say what role , if any , CCA and / or Geo Group has played in the drafting and promoting of ALEC - sponsored legislation aimed at expanding our prison population .
However , one thing is for certain , each company pays thousands of dollars in annual membership dues for a seat at the drafting table with influential legislators .
While some try to downplay the idea that government has been taken over by powerful special interests , the simple fact is that for - profit prison operators need to maintain a steady flow of prisoners in order to prosper .
Politics is the only reason the Bush Administration feels bound to continue with a policy that is demonstrably inhumane and unjust .
It has exploited our broken immigration system and manufactured a political crisis by demonizing immigrants .
Today , the calculated and ubiquitous use of pejorative rhetorical descriptors define every element of the government ’s framing of the immigration issue – “ terrorists , ” “ Muslims , ” “ illegals , ” etc. – a process that only serves to establish a socially accepted discourse around racism and the repression of all people of color , whether they live in the US or not .
The prison - industrial complex is profiting from an evil in the US that neither Democrats nor Republicans will seek to remedy .
The corporate will has replaced the will and conscience of the people .
Both the Democrats and the Republicans have abdicated their responsibility to their constituencies .
How many people must be restrained , denied human dignity and treated as inhuman for society to finally wake up ?
How many people must be detained under the name of so - called safety and morality for society to finally realize our society is inching toward totalitarianism ?
Immigration reform should not lie in an uncompromising policy of deterrence based on detention as a form of collective punishment , but instead on treating those who arrive unlawfully with compassion and justice .
Nor does it lie in a draconian system , which is costly and difficult to enforce , but more importantly perpetuates the inhumane elements of a flawed system that has undermined the integrity this country .
It is not in this country ’s best interests to deprive people of their dignity and the right to earn a living .
This can only reduce them to a state of fragility that will leave them ill - equipped to make sensible decisions about their future .
Further , it seriously undermines their integration into society as strong , independent and resourceful citizens with existing and beneficial links to the community .
By definition , human rights are universal ; however , by detaining these unfortunate immigrants , this country not only has isolated them from society but also has deemed them unworthy of the most basic human rights .
As a result , this country now faces a legal and moral crisis of such monstrous dimensions that it threatens our centuries - old understanding of human rights , of what is fair , humane and just .
There is much to be done to help reunite these people with their families and to heal their fractured minds and broken spirits .
Now is the time to demand that this country show the same care and compassion to all immigrants whether they arrive on these shores armed with the relevant visa or not .
Seeking a better life is a human right , not a crime .

The square of the Catalan sequence
Yesterday I went to a talk by Val Tannen about his work on " provenance semirings " .
The idea is that when you calculate derived data in a database , such as a view or a selection , you can simultaneously calculate exactly which input tuples contributed to each output tuple 's presence in the output .
Each input tuple is annotated with an identifier that says who was responsible for putting it there , and the output annotations are polynomials in these identifiers .
( The complete paper is here . )
A simple example may make this a bit clearer .
Suppose we have the following table R : R a a a b a c b c c e d e We 'll write R( p , q ) when the tuple ( p , q ) appears in this table .
Now consider the join of R with itself .
That is , consider the relation S where S( x , z ) is true whenever both R( x , y ) and R(y , z ) are true : S a a a b a c a e b e Now suppose you discover that the R ( a , b ) information is untrustworthy .
What tuples of S are untrustworthy ?
If you annotate the tuples of R with identifiers like this : R a a u a b v a c w b c x c e y d e z then the algorithm in the paper calculates polynomials for the tuples of S like this : S a a u2 a b uv a c uw + xv a e wy b e xy If you decide that R ( a , b ) is no good , you assign the value 0 to v , which reduces the S table to : S a a u2 a b 0 a c uw a e wy b e xy So we see that tuple S ( a , b ) is no good any more , but S ( a , c ) is still okay , because it can be derived from u and w , which we still trust .
This assignment of polynomials generalizes a lot of earlier work on tuple annotation .
For example , suppose each tuple in R is annotated with a probability of being correct .
You can propagate the probabilities to S just by substituting the appropriate numbers for the variables in the polynomials .
Or suppose each tuple in R might appear multiple times and is annotated with the number of times it appears .
Then ditto .
If your queries are recursive , then the polynomials might be infinite .
For example , suppose you are calculating the transitive closure T of relation R .
This is like the previous example , except that instead of having S( x , z ) = R( x , y ) and R(y , z ) , we have T( x , z ) = R( x , z ) or ( T( x , y ) and R(y , z ) ) .
This is a recursive equation , so we need to do a fixpoint solution for it , using certain well - known techniques .
The result in this example is : T a a u+ a b u*v a c u *( vx+w ) a e u *( vx+w ) y b c x b e xy d e z
In such a case there might be an infinite number of paths through R to derive the provenance of a certain tuple of T .
In this example , R contains a loop , namely R( a , a ) , so there are an infinite number of derivations of some of the tuples in T , because you can go around the loop as many times as you like .
u+ here is an abbreviation for the infinite polynomial u + u2 + u3 + ... ; u* here is an abbreviation for 1 + u+. 1 a 2 ( a + b) 3 ( ( a + b ) + c ) ( a + ( b + c ) ) 4 ( ( ( a + b ) + c ) + d ) ( ( a + ( b + c ) ) + d ) ( ( a + b ) + ( c + d ) ) ( a + ( ( b + c ) + d ) ) ( a + ( b + ( c + d ) ) ) 5 ( ( ( ( a + b ) + c ) + d ) + e ) ( ( ( a + ( b + c ) ) + d ) + e ) ( ( ( a + b ) + ( c + d ) ) + e ) ( ( ( a + b ) + c ) + ( d + e ) ) ( ( a + ( ( b + c ) + d ) ) + e ) ( ( a + ( b + ( c + d ) ) ) + e ) ( ( a + ( b + c ) ) + ( d + e ) ) ( ( a + b ) + ( ( c + d ) + e ) ) ( ( a + b ) + ( c + ( d + e ) ) ) ( a + ( ( ( b + c ) + d ) + e ) ) ( a + ( ( b + ( c + d ) ) + e ) ) ( a + ( ( b + c ) + ( d + e ) ) ) ( a + ( b + ( ( c + d ) + e ) ) ) ( a + ( b + ( c + ( d + e ) ) ) )
In one example in the paper , the method produces a recursive relation of the form V = s + V2 , which can be solved by the same well - known techniques to come up with an ( infinite ) polynomial for V , namely V = 1 + s + 2s2 + 5s3 + 14s4 + ... .
Mathematicians will recognize the sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 5 , 14 , ... as the Catalan numbers , which come up almost as often as the better - known Fibonacci numbers .
For example , the Catalan numbers count the number of binary trees with n nodes ; they also count the number of ways of parenthesizing an expression with n terms , as shown in the table at right .
Anyway , in his talk , Val referred to the sequence as " bizarre " , and I had to jump in to point out that it was not at all bizarre , it was the Catalan numbers , which are just what you would expect from a relation like V = s + V2 , blah blah , and he cut me off , because of course he knows all about the Catalan numbers .
He only called them bizarre as a rhetorical flourish , meant to echo the presumed puzzlement of the undergraduates in the room .
( I never know how much of what kind of math to expect from computer science professors .
Sometimes they know things I do n't expect at all , and sometimes they do n't know things that I expect everyone to know .
( Once I was discussing the algorithm used by ENIAC for computing square roots with a professor , and the professor told me that at the beginning of the program there was a loop , which accumulated a total , each time accumulating the contents of a register that was incremented by 2 each time through the loop , and he did not know what was going on there .
I instantly guessed that what was happening was that the register contained the numbers 1 , 3 , 5 , 7 , ... , incremented by 2 each time , and so the accumulator contained the totals 1 , 4 , 9 , 16 , 25 , ... , and so the loop was calculating an initial estimate of the size of the square root .
If you count the number of increment - by - 2's , then when the accumulator exceeds the radicand , the count contains the integer part of the root .
( This was indeed what was going on , and the professor seemed to think it was a surprising insight .
I am not relating this boastfully , because I truly do n't think it was a particularly inspired guess .
( Now that I think about it , maybe the answer here is that computer science professors know more about math than I expect , and less about computation . )
Anyway , I digress , and the whole article up to now was not really what I wanted to discuss anyway .
What I wanted to discuss was that when I started blathering about Catalan numbers , Val said that if I knew so much about Catalan numbers , I should calculate the coefficient of the x59 term in V2 , which also appeared as one of the annotations in his example .
So that 's the puzzle , what is the coefficient of the x59 term in V2 , where V = 1 + s + 2s2 + 5s3 + 14s4 + ... ?
After I had thought about this for a couple of minutes , I realized that it was going to be much simpler than it first appeared , for two reasons .
The first thing that occurred to me was that the definition of multiplication of polynomials is that the coefficient of the xn term in the product of A and B is Σa i b n - i .
When A=B , this reduces to Σa i a n - i .
Now , it just so happens that the Catalan numbers obey the relation c n+1 = Σ c i c n- i , which is exactly the same form .
Since the coefficients of V are the c i , the coefficients of V2 are going to have the form Σc i c n- i , which is just the Catalan numbers again , but shifted up by one place .
The next thing I thought was that the Catalan numbers have a pretty simple generating function f( x ) .
This just means that you pretend that the sequence V is a Taylor series , and figure out what function it is the Taylor series of , and use that as a shorthand for the whole series , ignoring all questions of convergence and other such analytic fusspottery .
If V is the Taylor series for f( x ) , then V2 is the Taylor series for f( x ) 2 .
And if f has a compact representation , say as sin(x ) or something , it might be much easier to square than the original V was .
Since I knew in this case that the generating function is simple , this seemed likely to win .
In fact the generating function of V is not sin(x ) but ( 1 - √ ( 1 - 4x ) ) / 2x .
When you square this , you get almost the same thing back , which matches my prediction from the previous paragraph .
This would have given me the right answer , but before I actually finished that calculation , I had an " oho " moment .
The generating function is known to satisfy the relation f( x ) = 1 + xf ( x ) 2 .
This relation is where the ( 1 - √ ( 1 - 4 x ) ) / 2 x thing comes from in the first place ; it is the function that satisfies that relation .
( You can see this relation prefigured in the equation that Val had , with V = s + V2 .
There the notation is a bit different , though . )
We can just rearrange the terms here , putting the f( x ) 2 by itself , and get f( x ) 2 = ( f ( x ) - 1 ) / x .
Now we are pretty much done , because f( x ) = V = 1 + x + 2x2 + 5x3 + 14x4 + ... , so f( x ) - 1 = x + 2x2 + 5x3 + 14x4 + ... , and ( f( x ) - 1 ) / x = 1 + 2 x + 5x2 + 14x3 + ... .
Lo and behold , the terms are the Catalan numbers again .
So the answer is that the coefficient of the x59 term is just c ( 60 ) , calculation of which is left as an exercise for the reader .
I do n't know what the point of all that was , but I thought it was fun how the hairy - looking problem seemed likely to be simple when I looked at it a little more carefully , and then how it did turn out to be quite simple .
This blog has had a recurring dialogue between subtle technique and the sawed - off shotgun method , and I often favor the sawed - off shotgun method .
Often programmers ' big problem is that they are very clever and learned , and so they want to be clever and learned all the time , even when being a knucklehead would work better .
But I think this example provides some balance , because it shows a big win for the clever , learned method , which does produce a lot more understanding .

MOSCOW ( Reuters ) - Vladimir Putin ’s four - hour performance at the Kremlin on Thursday mixed flirtatious banter with metaphors about snot and showed a gift for sarcastic brush - offs worthy of a stand - up comedian .
Putin twice referred to a runny nose during the annual presidential news conference -- to dismiss rumors about his personal wealth and to discuss the pressures of public office .
Newspaper reports about his alleged fortune were just rubbish , said Putin , “ excavated from someone ’s nose and then spread on those bits of paper ” .
Explaining how he worked his guts out “ like a galley slave ” for eight years in the Kremlin , Putin said leaders must take firm decisions and not wobble in the face of adversity .
“ Heads of state have no right to whinge , or drool for any reason ...
If they are going to slobber and blow snot and say things are bad , bad , then that ’s how it will be , ” Putin said .
The Russian was also sympathetic towards U.S. President George W. Bush .
“ Sometimes you have to make decisions that nobody else can make ...
Do you think Bush has it easy ? ” he said .
Many Russian journalists held up signs to attract Putin ’s attention in the Round Hall of the Kremlin packed with hundreds of domestic and international reporters .
When one young woman said she had a golden heart to present to him on Valentine ’s Day , Putin invited her to step down from her seat and pass it on to his officials .
Putin seemed to be thinking about European bodies , and not of the institutional kind , when another asked about a news article alleging Russia ’s gas giant Gazprom was eating into Europe ’s body .
“ Why are the Americans so worried about a European body ?
Maybe because they want to tear themselves away from it , nice body that it is , ” he said , laughing and making generous hand gestures to illustrate his point .
To illustrate her question about demographics , another woman said she personally would like to have a child .
“ Why are you asking me ? ” Putin shot back to applause from his audience , many of them regional Russian reporters who clapped enthusiastically at Putin ’s quips .
But there was no whiff of attraction when it came to a question about U.S. presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton and her comment that former KGB officers can’t have souls .
“ A state official must at least have brains , ” he snapped , one of several occasions when his easy - going facade slipped .
Asked about the guarantees about the rouble , Putin turned on the reporter .
“ What do you want ?
Do you want me to eat soil from a flower pot ?
Make an oath on blood ? ”
Spitting out the Russian acronym for the OSCE ’s election watchdog , that sounded very close to ‘ bitch ’ in English , he said Russia would not take lessons on democracy from Western observers .
“ Well , let them rather teach their own wives to cook soup . ”

A Short History of the GNU Privacy Guard ========================================
It 's been a decade now that the very first version of the GNU Privacy Guard [ 0 ] has been released .
This very first version was not yet known under the name of GnuPG but dubbed " g10 " as a reference on the German constitution article on freedom of telecommunication ( Grundgesetz Artikel 10 ) and as a pun on the G - 10 law which allows the secret services to bypass these constitutional guaranteed freedoms .
Version 0.0.0 released on December 20th 1997 [ 1 ] , was a barely working replacement of PGP avoiding all patented algorithm by using Elgamal and Blowfish instead of RSA and IDEA .
It was prominently marked as a test version but nevertheless included most of the features of the current GnuPG .
The data format however was not compatible with OpenPGP but oriented towards the PGP 2 format with a few extensions ( e.g. to allow streaming of data ) .
The OpenPGP working group was founded back in fall 1997 and I learned a bit to late about it to build " g10 " according to the then existing draft .
For copyright reasons it was practically not possible to reverse engineer the format used by PGP - 5 , so the establishment of the OpenPGP WG was the right thing at the right time .
Before talking about GnuPG we need to go some more years back in history :
To help political activists Phil Zimmermann published a software called Pretty Good Privacy ( PGP ) in 1991 .
PGP was designed as an easy to use encryption tool with no backdoors and disclosed source code .
PGP was indeed intended to be cryptographically strong and not just pretty good ; however it had a couple of inital bugs , most of all a home designed cipher algorithm .
With the availability of the source code a community of hackers ( Branko Lankester , Colin Plumb , Derek Atkins , Hal Finney , Peter Gutmann and others ) helped him to fix these flaws and a get a solid version 2 out .
Soon after that the trouble started .
As in many counties the use or export of cryptographic devices and software was also strongly restricted in the USA .
Only weak cryptography was generally allowed .
PGP was much stronger and due to the Usenet and the availability of FTP servers and BBSs , PGP accidently leaked out of the country and soon Phil was sued for unlicensed munitions export .
Those export control laws were not quite up to the age of software with the funny effect that exporting the software in printed form seemed not to be restricted .
MIT
Press thus published a book with the PGP source code which was then scanned outside the USA to form the base of PGP - 2i ( " i " for international ) .
Since then that version was used widely .
The criminal investigations against Phil ended in 1996 and he founded PGP Inc to write PGP - 5 .
The first public release was done in spring 1997 .
The same year at the 39th IETF meeting at Munich in August Phil Zimmermann and Jon Callas asked the IETF to setup a working group to publish a standard for the protocol used by PGP - 5 under the name OpenPGP .
The main drive behind this was to allow widespread use of strong encryption even if at some point the new company would decide to stop selling and supporting PGP .
As it turned out PGP Inc was acquired by Network Associates just a few months later and in 2002 this company actually ceased support and development of PGP ( though the PGP product was later continued by the new PGP Corporation ) .
Also often claimed to be Free Software , PGP has never fulfilled the requirements for it : PGP - 5 is straight proprietary software ; the availability of the source code alonedoes not make it free .
PGP - 2 has certain restrictions on commercial use [ 2 ] and thus puts restrictions on the software which makes it also non-free .
Another problem with PGP - 2 is that it requires the use of the patented RSA and IDEA algorithms .
The patent on RSA was only valid in the USA but the patent on IDEA was and is still valid [ 3 ] in most countries .
Although the GNU project listed a requirement for a PGP replacement for some years on its task list , it was not possible to start implementing it as long as patents on all public key algorithms were valid .
That changed when in April 1997 the basic patent on public key algorithms expired ( the Diffie - Hellman US patent 4200770 ) and finally in August when the broader Hellman - Merkle patent ( 4218582 ) expired .
A month later , at the Individual - Network Betriebstagung at Aachen [ 4 ] , Richard Stallman continued his talk with a BoF session where he asked the European hackers to start implementing public key software .
The arms trafficker laws of the USA prohibited the GNU project to write such software in their country or even by US citizens working abroad .
Thus he told the European hackers that they are in the unique position to help the GNU with crypto software .
Being tired of writing SMGL conversion software and without a current fun project , I soon found my self hacking on PGP - 2 parsing code based on the description in RFC - 1991 and the pgformat .
txt file .
As this turned out to be easy I continued and finally came up with code to decrypt and create PGP - 2 data .
After I told the GNU towers that I will take up the PGP replacement implementation I spent the rest of the year replacing IDEA by Blowfish , RSA by Elgamal , implementing streaming encryption , adding some key management and getting the code into a reasonable shape .
There used to be a plan for a free version of Secure Shell called PSST ( later known as LSH ) with a somewhat populated mailing lists maintained by Martin Hamilton .
Martin was the so kind to setup a mailing list for g10 too and announced it on that list .
This way we got the first subscribers .
Eventually I made the first tarball , put it up to ftp.guug.de , the FTP server of the German Unix User Group , and wrote an announcement [ 5 ] .
Right the next day Peter Gutmann offered to allow the use of his random number code for systems without a / dev/random .
This eventually helped a lot to make GnuPG portable to many platforms .
The next two months were filled with code updates and a lengthly discussion on the name ; we finally settled for Anand Kumria 's suggestion of GnuPG and made the first release under this name ( gnupg - 0.2.8 ) on Feb 24 [ 6 ] .
Just a few days later an experimental version with support for Windows was released .
( That release also fixed an alignment problem on Alpha boxes which was detected due to kernel log files filling up the hard disk and an admin asking whether they really need to be backed up . ;-)
In July 1998 the first more or less OpenPGP draft compliant version was released .
Matthew Skala had contributed Twofish code done cleanly From scratch ( Twofish was at that time a promising AES candidate and suggested by Schneier as a Blowfish replacement ; however we had some copyright concerns with the reference code ) .
Michael Roth contributed a Triple - DES implementation later the year and thus completed the required set of OpenPGP algorithms .
Over the next year the usual problems were solved , features discussed , complaints noticed and support for gpg in various other software was introduced by their respective authors .
Finally , on September 7 , 1999 the current code was released as version 1.0.0 with the major update of including Mike Ashley 's GNU Privacy Handbook [ 7 ] .
A year later the RSA patent was to expire on September 20 ; the patent holder placed the patent into the public domain 3 weeks earlier and thus we could release 1.0.3 with RSA support already on September 18 .
One of the major obstacles on widespread use public cryptography had gone ( far too late of course ) .
Also in 1999 the German government decided that strong encryption will not be regulated in any way and that its use is recommended for everyone .
To publicly support this statement the Ministry of Economics funded the porting of GnuPG and related software to Microsoft Windows [ 8 ] .
The US government was not keen to see that and tried to urge the German government to revise the decision to allow unregulated distribution of crypto software [ 9 ] .
That did not work out and to the end the USA had no other way than to weaken their own export rules .
Although we still develop GnuPG using servers located in Europe the new US export controls eventually allowed US hackers to contribute to GnuPG development .
In 2001 David Shaw joined the project and since then he is one of the most active GnuPG hackers and the co-maintainer .
It 's now a long time since GnuPG could be managed as a fun project and thus I now spend most of my professional life maintaining and extending GnuPG .
In 2001 I founded g10 Code , a Free Software company for the development and support of GnuPG and related software .
The most known project is probably GnuPG - 2 which started under the name NewPG as part of the broader Aegypten project .
The main goal of Aegypten was to provide support for S/ MIME under GNU / Linux and integrate that cleanly with other mail clients , most notably KMail .
Although having been actively used since 2004 , we released 2.0.0 only one years ago .
It was not that much fun writing X.509 / CMS ( commonly named S / MIME ) software compared to the elegant and very interoperable OpenPGP protocol .
Having mastered that we meanwhile achieved to provide a software which is really useful and works nicely with almost any other S/ MIME implementation .
It also turned out that we could port GnuPG - 2 to Windows - despite my original claim that a modern POSIX platform will be needed for GnuPG - 2 .
This development also showed that it is viable to develop Free Software as a business .
With the new tools and from a user 's perspective S/ MIME and OpenPGP will soon not make much of a difference anymore .
However I had to smile when I today read a report on the last RSA Europe conference where a quick poll during a talk showed that OpenPGP is the mostly used encryption protocol .
Recall that GnuPG is just one tool ; there are numerous other tools out to solve related privacy problems .
Kudos to all who worked on writing and deploying privacy tools over all these years !
Happy Hacking , Werner [ 0 ]

Auschnahme regelt ein Bundeschgesetz .
A LOTTERY scratchcard has been withdrawn from sale by Camelot - because players could n't understand it .
The Cool Cash game - launched on Monday - was taken out of shops yesterday after some players failed to grasp whether or not they had won .
To qualify for a prize , users had to scratch away a window to reveal a temperature lower than the figure displayed on each card .
As the game had a winter theme , the temperature was usually below freezing .

But the concept of comparing negative numbers proved too difficult for some Camelot received dozens of complaints on the first day from players who could not understand how , for example , - 5 is higher than - 6 .
Tina Farrell , from Levenshulme , called Camelot after failing to win with several cards .
The 23 - year - old , who said she had left school without a maths GCSE , said : " On one of my cards it said I had to find temperatures lower than - 8 .
The numbers I uncovered were - 6 and - 7 so I thought I had won , and so did the woman in the shop .
But when she scanned the card the machine said I had n't .
" I phoned Camelot and they fobbed me off with some story that - 6 is higher - not lower - than - 8 but I 'm not having it .
" I think Camelot are giving people the wrong impression - the card does n't say to look for a colder or warmer temperature , it says to look for a higher or lower number .
Six is a lower number than 8 .
Imagine how many people have been misled . "
A Camelot spokeswoman said the game was withdrawn after reports that some players had not understood the concept .
She said : " The instructions for playing the Cool Cash scratchcard are clear - and are printed on each individual card and in the game procedures available at each retailer .
However , because of the potential for player confusion we have decided to withdraw the game . "
More than 15 m adults in Britain have poor numeracy - the equivalent of a G or below at GCSE maths
Almost three times as many UK adults ( 15.1 m ) have poor numeracy - the equivalent of a G or below at GCSE maths - than with poor literacy skills , according to the government 's Skills for Life survey .
Peter Hall , of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics , said : " The concept of minus numbers is something we would cover with 11 or 12 year olds , and we would expect them to have come across it before .
" The concept of smaller numbers is something that some people do seem to struggle with .
Seven is clearly smaller than eight , so they focus on that and do n't really see the minus sign .
There is also a subtle difference in language between smaller - or lower - and colder .
The number zero feels lower .
" There have always been some people who find numbers and basic mathematics difficult .
Maybe in the past it was less noticeable because people could find jobs they could excel in without having qualifications in maths . "

An innocuous Sheridan College student who hunkered down with peers during a lockdown and full - scale search for a potential gunman had no idea he had triggered the campus - wide panic .
Last week ’s Oakville campus lockdown , which saw heavily armed tactical officers and police dogs scouring the school for a man seen carrying what they believed was a long - barrelled gun , only ended after police determined it was more likely a tripod .
After a description of the man scraped from surveillance video was publicized , a student told school officials he might be the person police were looking for .
“ Realizing there was no intent on his part to excite or mislead people , he came forward , ” said Sgt. Brian Carr .
Halton region police now confirm the “ long tubular object ” seen by a professor and eight other students was a black metal tripod stand used to hold a microphone .
It was property of Sheridan College and had been signed out from the Media arts program .
At no time did the student act “ in a foolish manner in order to lead others to believe he was carrying a firearm , ” police said .
He also did n’t speak inappropriately in any way to suggest he had a weapon .
Students were confined to their school and a nearby residence for three hours Feb. 8 while police conducted a thorough search .
One person , who seemed to match the man ’s description , was arrested and subsequently released during that time .
TSA screeners are learning to recognize set of secret , forbidden facial expressions .
If your face slips into one of these during a TSA inspection , you will be taken off and given a thorough , secondary screening :
TSA officials will not reveal specific behaviors identified by the program — called SPOT ( Screening Passengers by Observation Technique ) — that are considered indicators of possible terrorist intent .
But a central task is to recognize microfacial expressions — a flash of feelings that in a fraction of a second reflects emotions such as fear , anger , surprise or contempt , said Carl Maccario , who helped start the program for TSA .
" In the SPOT program , we have a conversation with ( passengers ) and we ask them about their trip , " said Maccario from his office in Boston .
" When someone lies or tries to be deceptive , … there are behavior cues that show it . … A brief flash of fear . "
Making Light 's Avram Grumer draws a vivid parallel to Orwell 's facecrime :
He did not know how long she had been looking at him , but perhaps for as much as five minutes , and it was possible that his features had not been perfectly under control .
It was terribly dangerous to let your thoughts wander when you were in any public place or within range of a telescreen .
The smallest thing could give you away .
A nervous tic , an unconscious look of anxiety , a habit of muttering to yourself – anything that carried with it the suggestion of abnormality , of having something to hide .
In any case , to wear an improper expression on your face ( to look incredulous when a victory was announced , for example ) was itself a punishable offence .
There was even a word for it in Newspeak : facecrime , it was called .
( Nineteen Eighty - Four , Part 1 , Chapter 5 )
It 's a complicated issue : on the one hand , this beats racial profiling ( as the article notes ) .
On the other hand , the penalty for wearing the wrong face is nigh - unlimited .
We 've all heard stories of screeners detaining people , forbidding them to fly , and so on , in a kind of bottomless expression of authority without oversight .
I 'd feel a lot better about this if the TSA would publish the forbidden faces ( look , if it 's peer - reviewed science , that means terrorists can just look it up in the damned journals , and if it 's not science , why should we believe it works ? ) so that we can all verify for ourselves whether this actually works or whether it 's just a bunch of hooey ; I 'd also feel better if the TSA acted as though the Constitution mattered to them , securing us from unreasonable search and seizure , being answerable to us as their tax - paying employers , and maintaining the presumption of innocence throughout our travelling experience .

The popular BitTorrent site Mininova celebrates its 3rd anniversary today .
At the time it launched , no one would have predicted that it would become the success story it turned out to be , but we can now safely say that Mininova is here to stay .
There was quite a bit of news surrounding Mininova in the last year , they regained the .com domain , served billions of torrents , and launched a content distribution platform for independent publishers .
Most impressive perhaps is that they are now among the 50 most visited websites on the Internet , which makes them the most frequently visited BitTorrent site .
The first public version of Mininova went public on January 15 , 2005 and was hosted at the DSL line of Niek , one of the founders of the site .
The name “ Mininova ” was inspired by SuprNova.org , the popular BitTorrent site that decided to shut its doors in December 2004 , a few days before Mininova was launched .
Not surprisingly , within a few days Niek ’s connection could n’t handle the bandwidth .
Gottfrid of The PirateBay was so kind to offer them a hosting account until they found a more permanent solution .
After a while Mininova temporarily moved to Gary of IsoHunt , but soon after that they got their own servers .
Since that time , Mininova continued to extend and upgrade their server park , which consists of 27 servers at the moment .
What are Mininova ’s plans for the future , you might wonder .
We talked to Niek from Mininova and he told TorrentFreak : “ We want to focus on getting more publishers for our recently launched Content Distribution service .
Currently we have over 200 publishers and we ’re sure this this number will grow tremendously the coming months ”
There is no doubt that Mininova will continue to grow throughout 2008 , we wish them all the best with their future endeavors .
RIAA Sends Institute 19 Settlement Letters Alleging Infringement
Nineteen members of the MIT community have been asked by the recording industry to preemptively settle lawsuits for allegedly downloading music illegally on peer - to - peer networks , according to a Jan. 10 Recording Industry Association of America press release .
One MIT student who has received a letter from the RIAA said last week that he planned not to settle and that he would fight the RIAA ’s attempts to learn his identity .
To date , no MIT students are known to have gone to court — all have paid the pre-litigation settlement or have settled after the RIAA has sent a subpoena to MIT .
The RIAA identified alleged infringers by looking at their IP addresses .
Since the RIAA cannot obtain the names of people connected with the IP addresses without a court order , it instead sent its demand letters directly to MIT and requested that the Institute forward the letters to the community members .
MIT complied with the RIAA ’s request and has forwarded the letters to the computer users corresponding to those addresses .
These requests come as part of the latest wave of 407 RIAA letters sent to college students from universities across the country this month .
The RIAA has sent thousands of such letters in batches since February 2007 .
This is the third time that the RIAA has sent letters to groups of MIT affiliates : 23 letters were sent in May 2007 , and 30 were sent in September 2007 .
By asking for settlements in these letters , the RIAA avoids ordering costly subpoenas that force universities to release the identities of alleged infringers and following up on those subpoenas with copyright infringement lawsuits .
The letters also , according to the RIAA , “ provide students the opportunity to resolve copyright infringement claims against them at a discounted rate before a formal lawsuit is filed . ”
According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation , these early settlement amounts generally range from $ 3,000 to $ 5,000 .
RIAA spokesperson Liz Kennedy told The Tech in October that , from the May 2007 group of letters , 15 of 22 people contacted paid the pre-litigation settlement , while seven others had their records subpoenaed .
Those seven students later settled out of court before a trial .
The 23rd IP address to which a letter was sent could not be connected to an individual , Kennedy said .
Kennedy did not respond to numerous requests for comment this week and last week about the outcome of the October letters , and she declined to comment on the group of letters sent most recently .
One student may contest letter
An MIT student who said he received a demand letter contacted The Tech last week and said he plans to decline an early settlement and to fight the RIAA ’s subpoena .
He requested anonymity because he wants to keep his identity from the RIAA .
The student , who said he was “ the victim of a fishing expedition by the RIAA , ” said he did not want to settle because settlement would not prevent further legal action by the individual record labels the RIAA represents .
“ I ’m disappointed that MIT is n’t going to step up , ” the student said .
Other schools like Boston University and the University of Oregon have resisted RIAA subpoenas of student records more actively than MIT has , he said .
Two BU computer science professors , Azer Bestavros and Jesse R. Stengel , gave sworn statements in July 2007 asking the Massachusetts federal district court to quash subpoenas that sought to identify BU community members .
The University of Oregon in November 2007 asked the Oregon federal district court to quash a similar subpoena .
The MIT student who received a letter said he would like to challenge the subpoenas by collaborating with other MIT students who have received letters , but he has been unable to find the names of the other recipients because those records are considered confidential by MIT .
In an Oct. 4 statement , Dean for Student Life Larry G. Benedict and Jerrold M. Grochow ’ 68 , vice president for Information Services & Technology , said , “ Unauthorized downloading and sharing of copyrighted files is illegal , contrary to MIT policy , and a serious matter with potentially damaging consequences .
MIT strongly discourages such unauthorized downloading and sharing of computer files . ”
The statement notes that in addition to pre-litigation notices from the RIAA , students may also receive takedown notices from the Motion Picture Association of America under the Digital Millenium Copyright
Act for illegally - downloaded content .
The MIT Internet Services & Technology Web site discusses unauthorized file sharing .
The site ’s contents , at http://web.mit.edu/copyright/, include MIT ’s most recent statements about the RIAA notices and about music downloading in general .
デスクトップ・コンピューターに搭載されているCPUのコアは2個から4個、やがては8個へと増加の一途だ。それに応じてソフトウェアが計算量の大きな処理を並列処理する能力の重要性も増している。圧縮関連のツールでは、 pbzip2 がマルチコアに対応しており、前者は圧縮処理に、後者は圧縮とその復元処理にマルチコアを活用することができる。
どちらの場合も、圧縮ファイルの復元は、それぞれの標準ツールで可能だ。つまり、pbzip2の圧縮ファイルにはbzip2を、mgzipの圧縮ファイルにはgunzipを使う。Fedora 8の場合、pbzip2のパッケージが標準リポジトリーにあり「 yum install pbzip2 」でインストール可能。一方、mgzipは、ほとんどのディストリビューションでパッケージがなく、ソースからインストールする必要がある。
しかも、コンパイルでエラーが発生する。zlibヘッダーには gz_header が定義されているが、mgzip.cでも同じ変数が正当なgzipアーカイブの16進値を保持するために使われているからだ。
$ make gcc - g - O2 - c -o mgzip . o mgzip . c mgzip.c:40 : error : ' gz_header ' redeclared as different kind of symbol / usr / include / zlib.h: 124 : error : previous declaration of ' gz_header ' was here mgzip .c : In function ' compress_infile_to_outfile ' : mgzip .c:530 : warning : cast to pointer from integer of different size
解決は簡単。gz_header変数にプレフィックスを付け、それに合わせてこの変数への参照を修正すればよい。参照はmgzip.cの中に数カ所にある。プレフィックスは、 gz_header 以外で適正なCの識別子であれば何でもよい。たとえば、 mgzip_gz_header などとする。
圧縮および復元機 能
コマンドライン・スイッチは、どちらの場合も、使い慣れた非並列版のものとほぼ同じだ。ただし、並列版にはないオプションがある。たとえば、gzipのスイッチ -- recursive はmgzipにはない。
pbunzip2の並列処理能力を見ると弱点が1つある。マルチコアを活用して圧縮ファイルを復元できるのはpbzip2で圧縮したファイルの場合だけなのだ。pbzip2はファイルを部分ごとに圧縮し、pbunzip2はその各部分を並列に復元する、このときマルチコアが利用されるからだ。したがって、カーネル・ソースのミラーサイトからダウンロードしたlinux-2.6.23.tar.bz2を復元する場合も1つのコアしか使われないことになる。pbzip2がファイルを分割すると、それによって圧縮ファイルのサイズが増加するが、増加量はごくわずかとされている（pbzip2の説明書によると0.2％）。そこで、本体のbzip2プログラムがファイルを分割するようにしてはいかがだろう。シングルコアの利用者の負担はほとんど変わらず、マルチコアの利用者は大いに助かるはずだ。
下に両ツールの簡単な使用例を示す。bzip2とgzipの利用者には、いずれもお馴染みのものだろう。この数字でpbzip2による圧縮ファイルのサイズを確認すると、確かに非並列版とほとんど同じ、わずか0.46％大きくなるだけだ。

現行のpbzip2にも大きな欠点がある。mgzipは圧縮対象のデータをstdinから読めるためパッケージしたばかりのtarファイルをパイプを介して流し込むことができるが、pbzip2はstdinあるいはパイプを介して入力することができないのだ。したがって、pbzip2でtarファイルを圧縮するには、実体あるファイルとしてtarファイルを作る必要がある。以下に、マルチコアCPU上でpbzip2を使って圧縮したtarballを展開するコマンドと、tarファイルをpbzip2で圧縮するコマンドを示す。
$ pbunzip2 -c /tmp/test/linux-2.6.23.tar.pbzip2 | tar xvf - $ tar cvf linux - 2.6.23.tar linux - 2.6.23 $ pbzip2 - 9 linux - 2.6.23.tar $ tar cvO linux - 2.6.23 | mgzip > linux -2.6.23.tar.gz
Obama claims delegate win but party officials say no
Sun political columnist Jon Ralston is reporting that the Barack Obama campaign is claiming the delegate win in Nevada , but Democratic Party officials disagree .
Obama ’s camp is saying because of his wins outside of Clark County , that he would receive 13 delegates to Hillary Clinton ’s 12 delegates .
However , Ralston reports that party officials are saying no delegates will be apportioned until later , probably when the nomination is decided .
Ralston writes : " Party boss Jill Derby told journalist Steve Friess :
' I do n't know why they 're saying that , ' a confused Derby said .
' We do n't select our national delegates the way they 're saying .
We wo n't select national delegates for a few more months . ' "
Newcomb ’s Problem , for those of you with social lives , is this .
A superintelligent “ Predictor ” puts two opaque boxes on a table .
The first contains either $ 1,000,000 or nothing , while the second contains $ 1,000 .
You have a choice : you can either open the first box or both boxes .
Either way , you get to keep whatever you find .
But ( duhhh … ) there ’s a catch : the Predictor has already predicted what you ’ll do .
If he predicted you ’ll open both boxes , then he left the first box empty ; if he predicted you ’ll open the first box only , then he put $ 1,000,000 in the first box .
Furthermore , the Predictor has played this game hundreds of times before , with you and other people , and has never once been wrong .
So what do you do ?
As Robert Nozick wrote , in a famous 1969 paper :
“ To almost everyone , it is perfectly clear and obvious what should be done .
The difficulty is that these people seem to divide almost evenly on the problem , with large numbers thinking that the opposing half is just being silly . ”
Actually , people confronted with Newcomb ’s Problem tend to split into three camps : the one - boxers , the two - boxers , and the Wittgensteins .
The one - boxers figure they might as well trust the Predictor : after all , he ’s never been wrong .
According to the prediction , if you open the first box you ’ll get $ 1,000,000 , while if you open both you ’ll only get $ 1,000 .
So it ’s a no- brainer : you should open only the first box .
“ But that ’s stupid ! ” say the two - boxers .
“ By the time you ’re making the choice , the $ 1,000,000 is either in the first box or it is n’t .
Your choice can’t possibly change the past .
And whatever you ’d get by opening the first box , you ’ll get $ 1,000 more by opening both .
So obviously you should open both boxes . ”
( Incidentally , do n’t imagine you can wiggle out of this by basing your decision on a coin flip !
For suppose the Predictor predicts you ’ll open only the first box with probability p.
Then he ’ll put the $ 1,000,000 in that box with the same probability p.
So your expected payoff is 1,000,000p2 + 1,001,000 p ( 1 - p ) + 1,000 ( 1 - p ) 2 = 1,000,000 p + 1,000 ( 1 - p ) , and you ’re stuck with the same paradox as before . )
The Wittgensteins take a third , boring way out .
“ The whole setup is contradictory ! ” they say .
“ It ’s like asking what happens if an irresistable force hits an immovable object .
If the ‘ Predictor ’ actually existed , then you would n’t have free will , so you would n’t be making a choice to begin with .
Your very choice implies that the Predictor ca n’t exist . ”
I myself once belonged to the Wittgenstein camp .
Recently , however , I came up with a new solution to Newcomb ’s Problem — one that I do n’t think has ever been discussed in the literature .
( Please correct me if I ’m wrong . )
As I see it , my solution lets me be an intellectually - fulfilled one - boxer : someone who can pocket the $ 1,000,000 , yet still believe the future does n’t affect the past .
I was going to write up my solution for a philosophy journal , but what fun is that ?
Instead , I hereby offer it for the enlightenment and edification of Shtetl - Optimized readers .
We ’ll start with a definition :
“ You ” are anything that suffices to predict your future behavior .
I know this definition seems circular , but it has an important consequence : that if some external entity could predict your future behavior as well as you could , then we ’d have to regard that entity as “ instantiating ” another copy of you .
In other words , just as a perfect simulation of multiplication is multiplication , I ’m asserting that a perfect simulation of you is you .
Now imagine you ’re standing in front of the boxes , agonizing over what to do .
As the minutes pass , your mind wanders :
I wonder what the Predictor thinks I ’ll decide ?
“ Predictor ” !
What a pompous asshole .
Thinks he knows me better than I do .
He ’s like that idiot counselor at Camp Kirkville — what was his name again ?
Andrew .
I can still hear his patronizing voice : “ You may not believe me now , but someday you ’ll realize you were wrong to hide those candy bars under the bed .
And I do n’t care if you hate the cafeteria food !
What about the other kids , who do n’t have candy bars ?
Did n’t you ever think of them ? ”
Well , you know what , Predictor ?
Let ’s see how well you can track my thoughts .
Opening only one box would be rather odd , would n’t you say ?
Camp Kirkville , Andrew , candy bar – that ’s 27 letters in total .
An odd number .
So then that settles it : one box .
What ’s my point ?
That reliably predicting whether you ’ll take one or both boxes is “ you - complete , ” in the sense that anyone who can do it should be able to predict anything else about you as well .
So by definition , the Predictor must be running a simulation of you so detailed that it ’s literally a copy of you .
But in that case , how can you possibly know whether you ’re the “ real ” you , or a simulated version running inside the Predictor ’s mind ?
“ But that ’s silly ! ” you interject .
“ Here , I ’ll prove I ’m the ‘ real ’ me by pinching myself ! ”
But of course , your simulated doppelganger says and does exactly the same thing .
Let ’s face it : the two of you are like IP and PSPACE , water and H 2 O , Mark Twain and Samuel Clemens .
If you accept that , then the optimal strategy is clear : open the first box only .
Sure , you could make an extra $ 1,000 by opening both boxes if you did n’t lead a double life inside the Predictor ’s head , but you do .
That , and not “ backwards - in - time causation , ” is what explains how your decision can affect whether or not there ’s $ 1,000,000 in the first box .
An important point about my solution is that it completely sidesteps the “ mystery ” of free will and determinism , in much the same way that an NP - completeness proof sidesteps the mystery of P versus NP .
What I mean is that , while it is mysterious how your “ free will ” could influence the output of the Predictor ’s simulation , it does n’t seem more mysterious than how your free will could influence the output of your own brain !
It ’s six of one , half a dozen of the other .
Or at least , that ’s what the neural firings in my own brain have inexorably led me to believe .
Money is like an iron ring we 've put through our noses .
We 've forgotten that we designed it , and it 's now leading us around .
I think it 's time to figure out where we want to go -- in my opinion toward sustainability and community -- and then design a money system that gets us there .
The origin of the word " community " comes from the Latin munus , which means the gift , and cum , which means together , among each other .
So community literally means to give among each other .
Therefore I define my community as a group of people who welcome and honor my gifts , and from whom I can reasonably expect to receive gifts in return .

The Caucus — Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio may get excluded from Democratic presidential debates , as he has been recently , but no one can deny him the floor in the House .
And today Mr. Kucinich took to the floor to fire off his latest salvo at the Bush administration : his plans to introduce Articles of Impeachment against President Bush on Jan. 28 — the day of Mr. Bush ’s State of the Union speech .
Accusing the administration of lying about the need for the war in Iraq , Mr. Kucinich said he did not need to hear the president ’s assessment .
“ We know the State of the Union , ”  he declared .
“ It ’s a lie . ” 
He also fired a volley at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California who has maintained that impeaching Mr. Bush is not on the table for Congressional Democrats .
“ If impeachment is off the table , ”  Mr. Kucinich said , “ truth is off the table .
If truth is off the table then this body is living a lie . ” 
Mr. Kucinich introduced Articles of Impeachment against Vice President Dick Cheney last April and in November , with the surprise help of Republicans seeking to embarrass the Democrats , he nearly succeeded in securing an hour of debate on the House floor .
House Democratic leaders blocked that , however , by referring the impeachment effort back to the Judiciary Committee .
Anti-Bush groups have been urging Mr. Kucinich to undertake an effort to impeach the president .

Senator John McCain of Arizona , whose bid for the Republican presidential nomination was all but dead this summer , has made a dramatic recovery in the Granite State 2 1/ 2 weeks before the 2008 vote , pulling within 3 percentage points of front - runner Mitt Romney , a new Boston Globe poll indicates .
McCain , the darling of New Hampshire voters in the 2000 primary , has the support of 25 percent of likely Republican voters , compared with 28 percent for Romney .
Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani has slid into third place , with 14 percent .
A Globe poll of New Hampshire voters last month had Romney at 32 percent , Giuliani at 20 percent , and McCain at 17 percent .
Among Democratic voters , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois has opened up a narrow lead over Senator Hillary Clinton of New York , 30 percent to 28 percent .
That , too , represents a major shift from last month 's Globe poll , which had Clinton with a 14 - point advantage .
Former senator John Edwards of North Carolina remained a steady third at 14 percent .
The Globe poll also found wide disparities in voter opinion on domestic issues , with Republicans and Democrats expressing starkly different views on the government 's role in healthcare and on whether illegal immigration is a problem .
The survey provided fresh evidence of how tight the primary contests have become in New Hampshire and around the country , adding to a growing sense among political analysts , voters , and the campaigns that neither party has a clear front - runner just days before the crush of primaries begins .
The survey of 422 likely Democratic voters and 410 likely Republican voters in New Hampshire , conducted from Dec. 16 to Dec. 20 , has a margin of error for each party subsample of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points .
The races in New Hampshire are still wide open - roughly 40 percent of likely voters in both parties indicated they are still undecided .
But McCain 's momentum is striking given that he was essentially written off by the political class and by rivals after weak fund - raising and excessive early spending forced him to completely retool his campaign in July .
Since then , his focus on New Hampshire , stumbles by his opponents , and a series of newspaper endorsements have helped him regain traction .
" Republicans talked about the John McCain deathwatch back in the summer , " said Andrew E. Smith , director of the University of New Hampshire Survey Center , which conducted the Globe poll .
" He 's back to the John McCain of 2000 . "
McCain appears to have gained ground without a surge of support from independent voters , who propelled him to a double - digit win over George W. Bush in the 2000 primary and nearly catapulted him to the GOP nomination .
McCain earned more support in the Globe poll from registered Republicans than from " undeclared " voters .
A research team led by Dr. Paul Wiseman of the Departments of Physics and Chemistry at McGill University has developed a radically new technique that uses lasers and non-linear optical effects to detect malaria infection in human blood , according to a study published in the Biophysical Journal .
The researchers say the new technique holds the promise of simpler , faster and far less labour - intensive detection of the malaria parasite in blood samples .
Malaria is a vector - borne infectious disease spread by parasites of the genus Plasmodium .
Most common in tropical and subtropical regions , it is a global scourge with 350 to 500 million new cases -- and one to three million fatalities -- reported annually .
Most of the fatalities are concentrated in sub-Saharan Africa , where the resources and trained personnel currently required to accurately diagnose the disease are spread the thinnest .
Current detection techniques require trained technicians to stain slides , look for the parasite 's DNA signature under the microscope , and then manually count all the visible infected cells , a labourious process dependent on the skill and availability of trained analysts .
By contrast , the proposed new technique relies on a known optical effect called third harmonic generation ( THG ) , which causes hemozoin -- a crystalline substance secreted by the parasite -- to glow blue when irradiated by an infrared laser .
" People who are familiar with music know about acoustic harmonics , " said Dr. Wiseman .
" You have a fundamental sound frequency and then multiples of that frequency .
Non-linear optical effects are similar : if you shine an intense laser beam of a specific frequency on certain types of materials , you generate multiples of the frequency .
Hemozoin has a huge , non-linear optical response for the third harmonic , which causes the blue glow . "
Dr. Wiseman and his colleagues now hope to adapt well - established existing technologies like fibre - optic communications lasers and fluorescent cell sorters to quickly move the technique out of the laboratory and into the field .
" We 're imagining a self - contained unit that could be used in clinics in endemic countries , " said Dr. Wiseman .
" The operator could inject the cell sample directly into the device , and then it would come up with a count of the total number of existing infected cells without manual intervention . "
Maybe cyberpunk is n't quite dead , but it definitely peaked a while back .
There are way fewer books and movies with cyberpunk themes coming out now than there were in the golden age of the 80s and mid-90s .
And we 've got the statistics to prove it .
We counted up the cyberpunk books and movies for every year since 1980 , and charted their rise and fall .

Methods :
We compiled a complete list of cyberpunk novels and movies , by date , from a variety of sources including Wikipedia , the Cyberpunk Review , Amazon.com 's cyberpunk lists and various other sites .
Then we tallied the number of novels ( red line ) and movies ( blue line ) per year .
We were hoping for a nice smooth curve , but it did n't happen .
We 're sorry the chart turned out so zig - zag , we were as surprised as anybody .
Results : Cyberpunk has gone in waves , judging from our data .
Novels in the genre have had a few high points .
The biggest peaks for novels were the late 80s ( eight novels in 1988 ) , and then the mid-90s ( an average of 6 novels per year from 1993 - 1996 ) .
Cyberpunk films had a peak in the late 80s - early 90s , followed by a brief lull .
There were ten cyberpunk movies each in 1993 and 1995 , and then another lull .
The genre had a resurgence at the movies from 2002 - 2004 , and then quieted down again .

How do we define cyberpunk ?
We tried not to .
We pulled our list from as many reliable - looking sources as possible , and only left out things that seemed like obvious outliers .
( On the Cyberpunk Review site , some of the movies on the cyberpunk list were listed as having a " low " level of cyberpunk themes , and seemed to be obviously reaching .
So we left those movies out . )
So what does this tell us ?
Maybe cyberpunk is less of a fad than it used to be .
Or maybe because we 're now living in a cyberpunk era with virtual worlds , nonstop cybersex and evil corporations , we no longer view those things as elements of science fiction .
What do you think ?

Bush and Laura were on the TODAY Show and interviewed by a fawning Ann Curry yesterday in Africa that I did n't get a chance to post .
When she asked George just how bad Americans feel over the economy , Bush gave us this insanity :
Download Download ( rough transcript )
Bush : ... and I 'm convinced fifty years from now people will look back and say , Thank God there were those that were willing to sacrifice .
Curry :
But you 're saying you 're going to have to carry that burden .
Some Americans believe that they feel they ’re carrying the burden because of this economy .
Bush : Yeah , well …
Curry :
They say we ’re suffering because of this .
Bush : I do n’t agree with that .
Curry :
You do n’t agree with that ?
It has nothing do with the economy , the war , the spending on the war ?
Bush : I do n’t think so .
I think actually the spending in the war might help with jobs .
Curry : Oh , yeah ?
Bush : Yeah , because we ’re buying equipment , and people are working .
I think this economy is down because we built too many houses ( Curry : hmmmmm ) and the economy is adjusting .
On the other hand we 're just about to kick out 157 billion dollars to our taxpayers ...... what would have been had we abandoned Iraq when times were tough and let those soldiers die in vain ..
How ignorant can this man act on teevee about important issues .
Curry had praised Bush a few seconds earlier for his " doing God 's work , " because of his work in Africa .
And he feels so awful about the war in Iraq .
Here 's a follow up question Curry could have asked .
" Were you doing God 's work when you invaded Iraq under false pretenses ?
Our troops were ordered to go to Iraq .
They were n't asked if they wanted to go .
What 's worse is to have ordered them there in the first place and then after years of chaos , still let them die in vain .
How about including all the innocent Iraqis that have fallen .
He never does seem to mention them , does he ?
Now , about his reasoning for our economic woes .
War spending does create a certain number of jobs , but ... sorry .... I -- can't -- respond -- to that drivel .
You know I never curse on the site , but was I ever close .
What about the predatory mortgage lending practices ?
What about the record number of foreclosures ?
We built too many damn houses is your response ?
Insomnia takes on a whole new meaning with the discovery that newborn dolphins and killer whales can forego sleep for their entire first month .
Hard to believe ?
Just ask their mothers .
The research finds both species of mammals can stay active 24/7 for weeks after birth .
Mom gets minimal z's , too , as you might imagine .
Both mother and calf gradually get more shut - eye in subsequent months , researchers report in the June 30 issue of the journal Nature .
Do n't try this at home
Such sleep deprivation would kill a rat or a fly , previous studies have found .
Indeed , all other mammals whose sleep behavior has been studied snooze more at birth than in adulthood .
Humans doze a third of their lives away and can barely endure even with one night of bad sleep , suffering more auto accidents and less sex , among other downsides .
The world record - holder for sleeplessness , Randy Gardner , stayed awake for 11 days straight in 1964 .
He hallucinated after four days , but held a coherent press conference at the end of the ordeal .
Scientists do n't really know why getting 40 winks is so important for the average human .
The answer likely involves the brain 's need to recharge , as anyone who has pulled an all - nighter can attest after trying to concentrate the next day .
Studies have shown that memory is consolidated and solidified during sleep .
Like cetaceans , human babies rob parents of sleep , of course .
A comprehensive study in Australia concluded that the typical baby causes between 400 and 750 hours of lost sleep for Mom and Dad in the first year .
You snooze , you lose
For dolphins and killer whales , evolution apparently has determined that sleep must take a back seat to survival .
" Somehow these seafaring mammals have found a way to cope with sleep deprivation , facilitating rather than hindering a crucial phase of development for their offspring , " said UCLA researcher Jerome Siegel .
There are advantages to being sleepless in the sea .
Young cetaceans can better escape predators if alert , and their body temperatures stay higher as they wait for insulating blubber to accumulate .
The lack of sleep also encourages rapid brain growth , the scientists say .
" Their bodies have found a way to cope , offering evidence that sleep is n't necessary for development and raising the question of whether humans and other mammals have untapped physiological potential for coping without sleep , " Siegel said .
The study involved two adult female killer whales and their calves at Shamu Stadium at SeaWorld San Diego and four dolphins and their calves at a marine mammal center in Russia .

The Pentagon is expected to close an intelligence office that has drawn fire from lawmakers and civil liberties groups who charge that it was part of an effort by the Defense Department to expand into domestic spying , The New York Times reported Wednesday .
The move , government officials told the Times , is part of a broad effort under Defense Secretary Robert Gates to review an intelligence architecture built by his predecessor , Donald Rumsfeld .
The intelligence unit , called the Counterintelligence Field Activity office , was created by Rumsfeld after the Sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks as part of an effort to counter the operations of foreign intelligence services and terror groups inside the United States and abroad , the Times noted .
Yet the office , whose size and budget is classified , came under fierce criticism in 2005 after it was disclosed that it was managing a database that included information about anti-war protests planned at churches , schools and Quaker meeting halls , the paper reported .
According to the Times , the Pentagon ’s senior intelligence official , James Clapper , has recommended to Gates that the counterintelligence field office be dismantled and that some of its operations be placed under the authority of the Defense Intelligence Agency .
Pentagon officials said Gates had yet to approve the recommendation , the Times wrote .

A teen hacker known for his deftness with iPhones has figured out how to unlock models running the latest firmware versions by cracking a protection that has frustrated hackers for weeks .
The breakthrough by George Hotz , aka Geohot , means people who have bought a recent iPhone will once again be able to use it on the phone network of their choice .
Apple makes as much as $ 400 for every handset that 's activated on an approved network , so its developers have worked hard to prevent the so - called unlocking of iPhones .
Last year , 17 - year - old Geohot was among the first group of hackers to break Apple 's iron - fisted grasp on the iPhone , a coup that won him a Nissan 350Z and 3 8GB iPhones .
Apple promptly responded by issuing updated firmware that stymied such efforts .
Not only did the updates disable modified phones , effectively turning them into $ 400 bricks , they also prevented unlocking software from working in many cases .
The arms race has persisted ever since .
The latest salvo was fired late last week , following a 24 - hour hacking spree by Geohot that was broken up by only three hours of sleep .
It turns out the latest firmware contained modifications to the device 's memory registers to prevent unlocking .
Geohot worked around those changes by finding another , much higher register that was vulnerable .
" I guess Apple thought big numbers were harder to guess , " he wrote .
He then found a way to install his custom - built code by exploiting a flaw that allowed him to erase a range of memory addresses where security software is stored .
" The technique was not one that I was familiar with at all , " said Kevin Finisterre , a researcher who has spent a fair amount of time dissecting Apple devices .
" From the read it sounds as though the gentleman has made some significant progress .
More importantly he is sharing . "
This latest unlocking is no small accomplishment because iPhones are programmed to accept only approved SIM cards .
Geohot 's technique appears to work around this limitation by writing to certain sections of the firmware .
The hack is highly technical and by no means for the faint of heart .
Those iPhone owners in need of more hand - holding should check out step - by - step instructions here from iClarified .
ModMyiPhone also offers a tutorial here .
Several weeks ago , analysts at Bernstein Research estimated that 1 million iPhones , or a full 27 per cent of the handsets sold to date , are running on unauthorized networks .
At that rate , Apple could lose $ 1bn in revenue over the next two years .
Rest assured that developer drones in Cupertino are already laboring to circumvent this latest workaround . ®
We 've long been concerned about the human rights risks of printer tracking dots for anyone who publishes printed works with modern technology .
Tracking dots are the secret marks that many popular color laser printers and photocopiers scatter across every document they touch .
The marks , almost invisible to the eye , uniquely identify the printer that produced the document , and , as EFF uncovered , can even automatically encode the time and date it was created .
Anonymous self - publication and distribution have been , and remain , a vital political communication channel in many countries .
A telltale pattern readable by government officials is a tool that oppressive states everywhere would love to have -- not to mention the general threat to individual privacy countries more respectful of human rights .
It turns out that the European Commission , the executive wing of the EU ( whose members include many former Eastern Bloc states ) , shares these concerns .
When asked by Satu Hassi , Green Member of European Parliament for Finland , about the legality within Europe of America 's tracking dots , Commissioner Frattini said that while the Commission could not uncover a specific law against the dots themselves ,
" to the extent that individuals may be identified through material printed or copied using certain equipment , such processing may give rise to the violation of fundamental human rights , namely the right to privacy and private life .
It also might violate the right to protection of personal data . "
There 's some irony in hearing such concerns come from Commissioner Frattini , who is currently championing his own privacy invasions with a proposed EU Passenger Name Record data - mining network .
Nonetheless , at least there is recognition in Europe of the dangers of these yellow dots .
It also raises some follow - up questions .
Given that including tracking systems in printers appears to be a U.S. government policy , how hard does the EU plan to pressure their ally for change in its secret agreements with printer manufacturers ?
Is the United States sharing its knowledge of how to decode these dots with individual EU nations ' governments ?
And if so , what other governments , authoritarian or not , know the secret of tracking their citizens ' publications ?
The Jan. 9 meetings , the first visit with Mr. Musharraf by senior administration officials since the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , also included the new army chief , Gen. Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , and the director of Pakistan ’s leading military intelligence agency , Lt. Gen. Nadeem Taj .
American officials said the visit was prompted by an increasing sense of urgency at the highest levels of the United States government that Al Qaeda and the Taliban are intensifying efforts to destabilize the Pakistani government .
The C.I.A. has fired missiles from Predator aircraft in the tribal areas several times , with varying degrees of success .
Intelligence officials said they believed that in January 2006 an airstrike narrowly missed killing Ayman al - Zawahri , the second - ranking Qaeda leader , who had attended a dinner in Damadola , a Pakistani village .
Pakistani authorities , in interviews , say they have more than 100,000 troops operating in the region , including a sizable force conducting what they said was a major offensive in South Waziristan .
But in the White House , the Pentagon and the C.I.A. , frustrations remain high , and there is concern that Mr. Musharraf ’s political problems will distract him from what the administration regards as its last chance to take aggressive action .
Despite the insistence of administration officials that the United States and Pakistan have a common goal in fighting Al Qaeda , Mr. Musharraf has made clear in public proclamations that it is far from his first priority .
At the Davos World Economic Forum in Switzerland last week , Mr. Musharraf said several times that the 100,000 Pakistani troops that he said were now along the border were hunting for Taliban extremists and “ miscreants , ” but he also said there was no particular effort being put into the search for Qaeda fighters .
In Washington , however , the Bush administration has said that fighting terrorists , chiefly Al Qaeda , is the primary purpose of the $ 10 billion in American aid that has been sent to Pakistan , mostly for reimbursements for the cost of patrolling the tribal areas .
President Bush has often praised Mr. Musharraf for fighting terrorism , pointing out that Al Qaeda has tried to kill the Pakistani leader .
But White House officials were silent when Mr. Musharraf said this week that his efforts were focused on the Taliban , and that the main problem the United States faced was in Afghanistan , not Pakistan .
Pen -top utensils !
Seriously , are these not the greatest inventions ever ?
I never want to use regular flatware again , as I can't jot down notes on my dinner with a normal fork .
I mean , these things are a gimme for restaurant reviewers , but from now on whenever I 'm eating I 'll always know in the back of my mind that it could be better ; I could be able to write with my knife .

DS Smith , has launched its new sustainability vision and strategy , Now and Next , which maps out ambitious commitments and goals for the next decade .
The House Committee on Foreign Affairs is calling Yahoo !
chief executive Jerry Yang to a hearing on 6 November to explain why the company lied to Congress in early 2006 about its knowledge of the investigation into Chinese journalist Shi Tao .
Shi Tao ended up with a 10 year prison sentence , but Yahoo ! told Congress it knew nothing about the nature of the investigation .
Committee chairman Tom Lantos said : " Last year , in sworn testimony before my subcommittee , a Yahoo !
official testified that the company knew nothing ' about the nature of the investigation ' into Shi Tao , a pro-democracy activist who is now serving 10 years on trumped up charges .
" We have now learned there is much more to the story than Yahoo !
let on , and a Chinese government document that Yahoo !
had in their possession at the time of the hearing left little doubt of the government 's intentions . "
In August of this year , Yahoo !
accused Lantos of rushing to judgement and said its testimony was truthful .
The company is also facing a private lawsuit brought by Shi Tao 's mother .
Yahoo ! has maintained that it was only following local laws in handing over Shi Tao 's emails and IP addresses .
The company has been criticised , along with Microsoft , Google and other service providers , of failing to stand up to Chinese demands by groups including Amnesty International and Reporters Without Borders .
The press release from the House Committee is here . ®

With a European ban on animal testing for cosmetics looming , companies are giving a hard look at high - tech alternatives like the small , rectangular glass chip professor Jonathan Dordick holds up to the light in his lab at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute .
The chip looks like a standard microscope slide , but it holds hundreds of tiny white dots loaded with human cell cultures and enzymes .
It 's designed to mimic human reactions to potentially toxic chemical compounds , meaning critters like rats and mice may no longer need to be on the front line of tests for new blockbuster drugs or wrinkle creams .
Dordick and fellow chemical engineering professor Douglas Clark of the University of California , Berkeley lead a team of researchers planning to market the chip through their company , Solidus Biosciences , by next year .
Hopes are high that the chip and other " in vitro " tests — literally , tests in glass — will provide cheaper , efficient alternatives to animal testing .
No one expects the chips to totally replace animals just yet , but their ability to flag toxins could spare animals discomfort or death .
" At the end of the day , you have fewer animals being tested , " said Dordick .
Medical advances ranging from polio vaccines to artificial heart valves owe a debt to anonymous legions of lab rats , mice , rabbits , dogs monkeys and pigs .
Animals — mostly mice — are still routinely used to test the toxicity of chemical compounds .
Taylor Bennett , senior science advisor to the National Association for Biomedical Researchers , said animal testing maintains an essential role in making sure new pharmaceutical products are safe and effective for humans .
Studies with animals are generally needed before the federal Food and Drug Administration will approve clinical trials for a drug .
" The technology is not yet there to go from idea to patient application without using animals , " Bennett said .
But animal testing can be slow and some researchers question how well a creature 's physical response to a chemical can predict human reactions .
Meanwhile , the public has become increasingly queasy about animal testing , especially the idea of inflicting pain to clear the way for the likes of new lipsticks or eye shadows .
The movement against animal testing has been especially strong across the Atlantic , where the European Union is set to enact its ban on animal testing for cosmetics in March 2009 .
Cosmetics companies have greatly reduced the amount of animal testing , though they still may use it to test the safety of a new ingredient , said John Bailey , executive vice president of the Personal Care Products Council , an industry group .
Still , cosmetic companies that plan to offer new products to the lucrative European market must soon find a suitable replacement for animals .
Alternatives range from synthetic skin substitutes or computer simulations .
But in vitro products show the most promise because they can are efficient , fast and easy to manipulate , said Dr. Alan Goldberg , director of the Center for Alternatives to Animal Testing at Johns Hopkins University .
" There 's no question that it's the strategy of the future , " Goldberg said .
Bailey agrees that in vitro chips hold the most promise among animal testing alternatives , but he added that the chips still need to be validated before companies can have more confidence in them .
He noted that chips have limitations when it comes to risk assessment , such as determining if particular doses of a substance pose a cancer risk .
" In the long term , I think this is probably the direction that most testing will go in , " said Bailey of the cosmetic industry group .
" That said , there is a considerable amount of research that needs to be done before we get from here to there . "
The product developed by Dordick and Clark consists of two glass slides .
The first , called the MetaChip , has uniform rows of little blots containing human liver enzymes .
The other slide , the DataChip , contains an identical array of blots which , depending on the test , could be growing human liver , bladder , kidney , heart , skin or lung cell cultures .
Sandwiched together , the two chips mimic the human body 's reaction to compounds .
If the cells inside die or stop growing , it 's a sign that a toxin was introduced .
About $ 3 million in federal money , including grants from the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation , has gone to Troy , N.Y. - based Solidus .
Dordick said a pharmaceutical and a cosmetic company are testing the chip now and they hope Solidus will have a product on the market by late 2009 .
While the chip wo n't replace animal testing , Dordick said it can be used early in the testing process to weed out toxins that will not have to be tested on animals in later stages .
Goldberg notes that the movements toward in vitro and away from animal testing is incremental — even optimistic assessments measure progress in decades .
But he still believes there may well be a day when the lab rat becomes a thing of the past .
" At some time in the far future my suspicion is yes , " he said , " because were doing it stepwise by stepwise . "

As if a troubling family history was n’t causing enough problems for the as - yet - undeclared candidacy of Rudy Giuliani , now comes the relevalation that his law firm , Bracewell & Giuliani , LLP , can count Hugo Chavez among it ’s clients :
HOUSTON — Rudy Giuliani ’s law firm has received $ 100,000 to $ 200,000 since 2005 to lobby Texas legislators on behalf of Citgo Petroleum Corp. , a Houston - based oil company ultimately controlled by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
Records with the Texas Ethics Commission show that Shannon H. Ratliff II , an attorney with Bracewell & Giuliani of Houston has been registered to lobby the state legislature for Citgo since April 2005 .
But David McCollum , a spokesman for Citgo , said the company has had a lobbying contract with the law firm since before Giuliani joined and it was named Bracewell & Patterson .
“ I think the only reason this is coming out is because this is a political year , and Mr. Giuliani ’s name is on the law firm , ” McCollum said .
“ But Mr. Giuliani has no personal involvement in this at all . . .
If this were n’t a political year , this would get no attention at all . ”
Giuliani is the front - runner for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination .
Although Citgo Petroleum is a U.S. - based company , it was bought in 1990 by Petroleos de Venezuela , the national oil company of Venezuela .
The Bush administration has criticized Chavez as being uncooperative in the global war on terrorism .

JOSEPH LIEBERMAN ( D ) , CONNECTICUT :
The war is not lost in Iraq .
In fact , now American Iraqi security forces are winning .
The enemy is on the run in Iraq .
But , here in -- in Congress , in Washington , we seem to be , or some -- some members seem to be on the run , chased , I fear , by public opinion polls .
COOPER : Is the enemy on the run in Iraq , Michael ?
WARE : No , certainly not .
And I think we need to be aware that it 's enemies .
I mean , America does n't face just one opponent in this country , but a whole multitude , many of whom are becoming stronger , the longer the U.S. occupation here , or presence here , in Iraq continues .
So , unfortunately , I 'm afraid that Senator Lieberman has taken an excursion into fantasy .
Burma 's regime is targeting the last remaining communications links that brought images of the bloody crackdown on the recent pro-democracy protests to the outside world .
Exiled dissident groups in neighbouring Thailand say up to 10 satellite telephones and countless computers earlier smuggled into Burma have been seized , the last lines of contact after the government shut down the internet and blocked mobile and fixed - line telephones .
Officials from Burma 's foreign affairs ministry and home department security officers also visited a UN office in the Traders Hotel in downtown Rangoon late last week and demanded to see the organisation 's permits for its satellite phones .
The officials also inspected the Japan International Co-operation Agency at the Sakura Tower and offices at the Sedona Hotel , which has a vantage point overlooking the Shwedagon Pagoda , one of the flashpoints for the demonstrations .
" I think they came to the Traders Hotel and Sakura Tower in an effort to identify the systems that allowed information about the demonstrations to get out , " said a UN official .
The junta 's determination to snuff out the last trickles of information signals its paranoia over the damage images of the military 's suppression of the demonstrations had inflicted .
The pictures , coupled with accounts from bloggers , fuelled the international community 's anger over the beatings and arrests of monks , and the killing of at least 13 that heightened demands for tougher sanctions .
Among the most shocking were images of a monk floating face down in a pool and others of the Japanese video journalist , Kenji Nagai , being shot at close range , giving the lie to the regime 's claim that he died accidentally from a stray bullet .
Yesterday Burmese exiles , family members and fellow journalists in Tokyo paid their last respects at the funeral of the 50 - year - old , who died from massive blood loss after a bullet pierced his liver .
The ceremony came as the 15 - member UN Security Council met in New York to debate a resolution condemning Burma 's " violent repression of peaceful demonstrations " while calling for a halt to the regime 's heavy - handed measures .
Burma 's military leaders last night named deputy labour minister Aung Kyi as the " manager for relations " to build bridges with opposition groups .
His chief concern will be the junta 's dealings with the detained democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi , in line with a suggestion by UN envoy Ibrahim Gambari to Burma 's leader , General Than Shwe .
Despite the apparently conciliatory gestures , the arrests of those suspected of taking part in the 100,000 pro-democracy marches were reportedly still continuing in Rangoon .
Among those taken were the owners of computers suspected of being used to transmit images and testimony to the outside world .
Yesterday the British and US embassies in Rangoon , reachable by phone until late last week , were impossible to get through to from outside the country .
British ambassador Mark Canning and US charge d'affaires Shari Villarosa were outspoken critics of the regime 's actions .
In his appearance at an oversight hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 30 , 2008 , Attorney General Michael Mukasey allowed himself to be used as a stooge while Senator John Cornyn demonstrated how to suborn perjury .
Mukasey kept a straight face while Senator Cornyn attempted to blame deficiencies in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) for a 10 - hour delay ( it was actually 12 hours ) by U.S. intelligence personnel seeking to monitor enemy combatants in Iraq after some U.S. soldiers were kidnapped in May 2007 .
In response to Senator Cornyn 's dissembling , Mukasey pretended that the discredited tale told by Senator Cornyn was a good example of the reason that FISA needs to be revised .
The lies that were interwoven into the story about this unfortunate incident were disseminated by Director of National Intelligence Mike McConnell , who dropped this stink bomb on the House Judiciary Committee on September 20 , 2007 .
Within a few days , responsible journalists uncovered the true story that was the basis for the fictional account given by McConnell .
Government officials and documents revealed that the delay in surveilling the enemy combatants was caused by gross incompetence and ineptitude among officials in the Department of Justice ( now administered by Mukasey ) , and this delay was not caused by any deficiency in FISA , but as Winston Churchill said : " A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on . "
Congress passed FISA in 1978 to curb abuses which had occurred under prior Democratic and Republican Presidents , but primarily because the Nixon Administration went medieval on the rule of law .
The 110th Congress is the latest battleground in the war against our Constitution , and the concerted drive to disembowel FISA is on track .
Via an op -ed in the New York Times by Mike McConnell ( published Dec. 10 , 2007 ) and a follow - up op - ed in the Los Angeles Times by tag - team member Michael Mukasey ( published Dec. 12 , 2007 ) , the President trotted out two loyal soldiers to sound the clarion call .
It is obvious that McConnell and Mukasey have a right to advance their opinions about FISA to a large and influential audience , and it is understandable that their opinions would be considered newsworthy by the New York Times and the Los Angeles Times .
However , it is repugnant that officials in the Bush Administration and their enablers in Congress are so bereft of compelling arguments that they repeatedly must promulgate information about FISA that is demonstrably false .
Let us chronicle some of the most imprortant information omitted by McConnell and Mukasey , and let us examine some of the most misleading arguments presented by them .
Congress did not mention FISA in the Authorization for the Use of Military Force ( the AUMF ) in our so - called war on terror , and it is clear from the debate in Congress prior to passage of the AUMF on September 18 , 2001 that Congress did not intend to alter FISA within the context of the AUMF .
However , President Bush used the AUMF as a pretext for implementing the Terrorist Surveillance Program involving some indiscriminate use of electronic surveillance without a judicial warrant , which was contrary to FISA and contrary to the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution .
When Michael Mukasey referred to the AUMF as justification for the Terrorist Surveillance Program during his Attorney General Nomination Hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee , it was apparent from the skepticism in his remark that Mukasey did not find this argument convincing .
Mike McConnell only began lobbying Congress for significant changes to FISA after the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) determined early last year that the Terrorist Surveillance Program did not comply with FISA , which is the law with respect to electronic surveillance of foreign intelligence sources .
The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution states :
" The right of the people to be secure in their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against unreasonable searches and seizures , shall not be violated , and no Warrants shall issue , but upon probable cause , supported by Oath or affirmation , and particularly describing the place to be searched , and the persons or things to be seized . "
Mukasey alleges in his op - ed that " ( t ) he increased volume of applications for judicial orders under FISA impaired our ability to collect critical intelligence , with little if any corresponding benefit to the privacy of people in the U.S. "
In November 2007 , Mark Klein , a retired AT&T technician , visited Washington D.C. to talk to congressional staff members and journalists about his personal knowledge of wiretapping by the National Security Agency ( which directed the Terrorist Surveillance Program ) , including massive unfiltered electronic surveillance of Internet traffic and telephone calls to and from U.S. citizens .
This disclosure has been an integral part of a pending lawsuit against AT&T , yet this information had received little media attention prior to Mr. Klein 's trip to Washington .
Monitoring an electronic communication is a search .
As specified by the Fourth Amendment , the Government must have some reasonable basis for directing a search at a particular target .
Although a reasonable search does not necessarily require a warrant , probable cause is a prerequisite for any reasonable search .
Contrary to what both McConnell and Mukasey posit , a search is not reasonable merely because the underlying motivation ( e.g. , the possibility that a search may uncover dangerous illegal activity ) for the search is reasonable .
It is possible to understand why McConnell might not understand this legal distinction , but such equivocation is inexcusable from the Attorney General of the United States .
Perhaps because he was intent on proving that " government intelligence " is an oxymoron , McConnell babbled in his barely coherent op - ed about the inconvenience imposed by the law :
" Before the Protect America Act was enacted , to monitor the communications of foreign intelligence targets outside the United States , in some cases we had to operate under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , known as FISA , a law that had not kept pace with changes in technology .
In a significant number of these cases , FISA required us to obtain a court order .
This requirement slowed - and sometimes prevented - our ability to collect timely foreign intelligence . "
In his op - ed , Mukasey parrots the claim that ,
" Until recently , our surveillance efforts were hampered by the unintended consequences of an outdated law , the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , which was enacted in 1978 to establish a system of judicial approval for certain intelligence surveillance activities in the United States . "
Both Mukasey and McConnell know that FISA has been updated many times since 1978 to accommodate several Presidents ( including on several different occasions during the tenure of President Bush the Younger ) .
Both also know that FISA was not bypassed because FISA was outdated ; FISA was bypassed because the Bush Administration decided to use unconstitutional methods to acquire intelligence via the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
What is most irksome to Mukasey and McConnell is our outdated Constitution , which retains " quaint " prohibitions that have not kept pace with the ability of our technology to create an efficient national security state .
Just before Congress went on vacation in August 2007 , the President , Mr. McConnell and their minions in Congress used a fake threat of an imminent terrorist attack to frighten the Senate and the House of Representatives into passing ( with very little scrutiny and brief whimpering ) a six - month revision of FISA called the PROTECT AMERICA ACT OF 2007 ( PAA of 2007 ) .
McConnell declares in his op - ed that the PAA of 2007 made " the country safer while protecting the civil liberties of Americans " , but the reality is that the PAA of 2007 effectively nullified significant protections of U.S. citizens and other legal U.S. residents with respect to unreasonable searches and searches without warrants .
The PAA of 2007 temporarily codified much of the illegal Terrorist Surveillance Program .
The PAA of 2007 did not provide for any meaningful Congressional oversight , and although the PAA of 2007 provided for FISC review , this was limited to FISC review of the surveillance procedures , and it did not provide any substantive oversight of the actual surveillance .
Furthermore , the language in the PAA of 2007 was extremely deferential to the judgment of the Executive , as stated in Section 105C : " The court 's review shall be limited to whether the Government 's determination is clearly erroneous . "
Recently , writing in response to columnist Joe Klein ( whose self - professed ignorance about FISA did not prevent him from offering his own criticism of the timid Democrats ) , House Judiciary Committee Chairman John Conyers explained the negotiations between Congressional Democrats and Mr. McConnell prior to passage of the PAA of 2007 :
We addressed every one of the concerns Mr. McConnell raised .
He said he needed to clarify that a court order was not required for foreign - to - foreign communications -- our bill did just that .
McConnell said he needed an assurance that telecommunications companies would be compelled to assist in gathering of national security information  our bill did that .
The DNI said he needed provisions to extend FISA to foreign intelligence in addition to terrorism  the bill did that .
He asked us to eliminate the requirement that the FISA Court adjudicate how recurring communications to the United States from foreign targets would be handled  the bill did that .
McConnell insisted that basket warrants be structured to allow additional targets to be added after the warrant was initially approved  again , the bill did that .
When this legislation was described to DNI McConnell , he acknowledged that " it significantly enhances America 's security . "
Yet , suddenly , on the eve of the vote , Director McConnell withdrew his support after consultation with the White House .
If the media wanted to identify over - the - top partisanship , they could begin by citing the declaration of David Addington , Vice President Cheney 's Chief of Staff , that " We 're one bomb away from getting rid of that obnoxious FISA Court , " and DNI McConnell 's assertion that by merely having an open debate on surveillance , " some Americans are going to die . "
In a interview with a a reporter from the El Paso Times newspaper on August 14 , 2007 ( after passage of the PAA of 2007 ) , Mr. McConnell made exaggerated and unsupported allegations about the length of time and the amount of effort required to comply with FISA .
Specifically , Mr. McConnell alleged in this newspaper interview that it takes 200 hours to assemble a FISA warrant request on a single telephone number .
What Mr. McConnell failed to acknowledge is that his allegation referred to the length of time it takes to assemble a warrant request by writing in charcoal on the back of a wooden shovel , using only the light of a fireplace , and then transporting such warrant request by tramp steamer from Afghanistan to Guam for transcription .
After this newspaper interview , an aide to McConnell explained to him the miracle of word processing and global communication systems .
Mr. McConnell has whined that , prior to passage of the PAA of 2007 , FISA hindered the ability to collect information from foreign intelligence targets because " foreign - to - foreign " communications might be routed through a location in the United States , and the acquisition of such communications therefore was considered to be " in the United States " under the FISA statute .
This defect in FISA was also cited by Mr. Mukasey in his op - ed .
McConnell states that " the intelligence community should spend its time protecting our nation , not providing privacy protections to foreign terrorists and other diffuse international threats . " , but both McConnell and Mukasey know that the contested issue is not foreign terrorists .
In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September 2007 , Mr. McConnell stated that he would oppose any language that would amend FISA only to exclude " foreign - to - foreign " communications from the scope of FISA because the intelligence - gathering agencies cannot demonstrate with certainty that those people with whom their targets will communicate would be exclusively outside the United States and because such language would not enable intelligence - gathering agencies to monitor communications of foreign intelligence targets outside the United States who may communicate with a " sleeper " or co-conspirator who is inside the United States .
These are specious arguments because FISA , as it existed prior to the PAA of 2007 , did not require intelligence - gathering agencies to predetermine whom their foreign intelligence targets would contact , and also did not require intelligence - gathering agencies to guarantee that communications from foreign intelligence targets would be exclusively between persons located outside the United States .
It has long been taken for granted that U.S. citizens do not lose our Constitutional rights with respect to our own government when we travel outside the country , but Section 105A of the PAA of 2007 states :
" Nothing in the definition of electronic surveillance under 101 ( f ) shall be construed to encompass surveillance directed at a person reasonably believed to be located outside of the United States . "
One could argue that this change in FISA does not alter the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution , and technically that is true , but from a practical standpoint , the Fourth Amendment Constitutional rights of U.S. citizens with respect to our own government are no longer protected while we are outside the country .
Although Mr. Mukasey and Mr. McConnell repeatedly emphasize the problems associated with foreign intelligence targets located outside the United States , electronic surveillance of foreign intelligence targets located outside the United States usually did not require a warrant prior to passage of the PAA of 2007 because electronic surveillance of foreign intelligence targets located outside the United States was not included in the definition of electronic surveillance under FISA [ Title 50 U.S. Code , Chapter 36 , Subchapter 1 , Section 1801 ( f ) ] .
In September 2007 , Mr. McConnell testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that the PAA of 2007 does not need to be rewritten to protect the rights of United States citizens who may be outside the United States because it is alleged that such rights are protected by Section 2.5 of Executive Order 12333 .
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and his successor , Mr. Mukasey , have both testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee that they do not think that the President is subject to laws which restrict the extremely vague inherent powers of the President under their convoluted interpretation of the Constitution .
We are supposed to trust the Executive to adhere to an Executive Order when it has already been established that the Executive will not abide by a law ( FISA ) passed by Congress .
On January 24 , 2008 , Senator Jay Rockefeller and Senator Kit Bond offered an amendment to pending FISA legislation to protect the constitutional rights of U.S. citizens during periods of absence from the United States , but this addition to the Senate Intelligence Committee revision of FISA appears to be an attempt to decorate a turd .
In his op - ed , McConnelll states that " the intelligence community needs a law that does not require a court order for surveillance directed at a foreign intelligence target reasonably believed to be outside the United States , regardless of where the communications are found " , but the real problem as it is viewed by the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence concerns limitations imposed by FISA with respect to electronic surveillance without warrants of U.S. citizens and other legal U.S. residents , and the surveillance powers sought by the President and his subordinates via the PAA of 2007 far exceed the authority necessary to circumvent the alleged impediments imposed by FISA relative to foreign intelligence targets .
Despite their obfuscations , the Attorney General and the Director of National Intelligence want to be able to conduct electronic surveillance without warrants and without probable cause in a wide variety of circumstances involving U.S. citizens and other legal U.S. residents , which would have required warrants under FISA prior to passage of the PAA of 2007 .
Although legitimate national security concerns certainly exist , it is far too easy for the Federal Government to obstruct litigation through the process of withholding information from plaintiffs by alleging that release of such information would endanger the national security .
It should be obvious , but obviously it is not obvious , that the Federal Government often alleges that revelation of certain information will endanger the national security in situations where revelation of such information would cause only embarrassment .
Officially , the Supreme Court did not recognize the " state secrets " privilege until the landmark 1953 decision in UNITED STATES v. REYNOLDS , and it should not surprise anyone that ( despite the tortured logic in a Federal Appeals Court decision in 2005 concerning this case ) the Federal Government had invoked the " state secrets " privilege fraudulently because there was no justifiable national security issue involved in this case .
Also , it should not surprise anyone that the Bush Administration has asserted the " state secrets " privilege improperly and with regularity to obstruct justice .
A good example is the use of the " state secrets " privilege to suppress evidence in the case of Sibel Edmonds , who was fired by the F.B.I. for reporting security breaches and other official misconduct in the Bureau 's translator services division .
Similar suppression of justice by a foreign government would be called by it 's rightful name .
For most practical purposes , the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution has been relegated to the dustbin of history by the Supreme Court , but the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution states : " The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution , nor prohibited by it to the States , are reserved to the States respectively , or to the people . "
A naive person might reason that a common - law rule of evidence ( which is neither mentioned in , nor implied by , the language in our Constitution ) could not be used as a basis for obstructing those rights which are delineated in our Constitution .
However , the " state secrets " privilege is an extra-constitutional construct that can be used and has been used to nullify the Bill of Rights .
Contrary to procedures outlined by the Supreme Court related to evaluation of the " state secrets " privilege , many judges ( including the judge who presided over the case of Sibel Edmonds ) do not thoroughly examine the evidence in question to determine whether the assertion of the " state secrets " privilege by the Government is valid , and many judges ( including the judge who presided over the case of Sibel Edmonds ) do not rigorously analyze whether a lawsuit might succeed in the absence of the evidence which is subject to suppression .
Despite the fact that court decisions have made it almost impossible for plaintiffs to contest the legality of the assistance obtained by the Federal Government from the telecommunications providers , Mr. Mukasey does not have faith in using the " state secrets " privilege as a method of avoiding the embarrassment which would result if illegal activities of the Bush Administration are disclosed to the public via court proceedings .
In his op -ed , Mr. Mukasey addressed the retroactive immunity for telecommunications providers included in the version of FISA legislation approved by the Senate Intelligence Committee :
" ( I ) t would provide protections from lawsuits for telecommunications companies that have been sued simply because they are believed to have assisted our intelligence agencies after the 9/11 attacks .
The bill does not , as some have suggested , provide blanket immunity for those companies .
Instead , a lawsuit would be dismissed only in cases in which the attorney general certified to the court either that a company did not provide assistance to the government or that a company had received a written request indicating that the activity was authorized by the president and determined to be lawful .
It is unfair to force such companies to face the possibility of massive judgments and litigation costs , and allowing these lawsuits to proceed also risks disclosure of our country 's intelligence capabilities to our enemies . "
If ( as is expected ) Congress were to grant retroactive immunity to telecommunications providers , and if the Federal Government were to withhold information ( which currently is being done ) from the courts on the basis that such information would endanger the national security , the provision limiting the scope of the immunity would operate as a sham .
Mr. McConnell emphasizes in his op - ed that " it is critical for the intelligence community to have liability protection for private parties that are sued only because they are believed to have assisted us after Sept. 11 , 2001 . "
The arguments by Mukasey and McConnell with respect to immunity for telecommunication providers are very misleading because both know that the Bush Administration consistently circumvented FISA through the implementation of the Terrorist Surveillance Program .
Both also know that current court cases involving the allegedly defunct Terrorist Surveillance Program have foundered due to the inability of plaintiffs to obtain information necessary to establish their right to sue the Federal Government and / or the owners of the information technology through which the Federal Government obtains intelligence .
Resolution of this prominent defect in FISA is not addressed by pending FISA legislation , but it is a defect that will be exacerbated by any expansion of the Federal Government 's surveillance powers .
On January 22 , 2008 , Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator Arlen Specter introduced separate legislation that would give more direction to courts to allow litigation to proceed and simultaneously protect " state secrets " , but in the meantime , due to excessively restrictive interpretations of the " state secrets " privilege by various courts , lawsuits against telecommunication providers are the only realistic avenue for plaintiffs to discover if their electronic communications have been monitored illegally by our protectors .
Because the Federal Government can shield itself effectively from judicial review , the Federal Government has no meaningful restraint on the abuse of surveillance powers .
Mr. McConnell laments that " those in the private sector who stand by us in times of national security emergencies deserve thanks , not lawsuits " , but the myth of telecommunication providers as victims in this soap opera is a falsehood wrapped in sentimental twaddle , and this is evident to anyone who thinks for a moment about the vast array of legal resources employed by corporations when they are litigating against Federal and State agencies or when they are lobbying Congress to reduce taxes and eliminate regulations .
In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 30 , 2008 , Mr. Mukasey used the " state secrets " privilege as the basis for his argument that litigation involving the telecommunication providers should not be allowed to proceed regardless of whether the telecommunication providers may have violated FISA , and Mr. Mukasey simultaneously dismissed any possibility that that the telecommunication providers may have violated the law .
It would seem that courts are unnecessary for as long as we have Mr. Mukasey available to make summary judgments about all allegations of illegal activity .
The Senate and House have been struggling against themselves during the past few months to craft a more permanent revision of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) that corrects some of the damage they inflicted on FISA via the Protect America Act of 2007 ( which would have expired effective February 1 , 2008 if Congress had not approved a 15 - day extension ) .
The FISA revision which was approved by the Senate is an attempt by weak - willed Senate Democrats to demonstrate that the Republicans do not have a monopoly on contempt for the Constitution .
In 2006 , in response to widespread use of electronic surveillance without warrants ( involving U.S. citizens and other legal U.S. residents in addition to foreign targets ) under the illegal Terrorist Surveillance Program , Congress passed legislation stipulating that FISA was the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance could be conducted for foreign intelligence purposes .
Now , the Senate legislation to amend FISA does not state that FISA is the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted even though 57 Senators voted in favor of this amendment .
The Senate revision of FISA does little to improve on the illegal Terrorist Surveillance Program and also grants retroactive immunity for telecommunications providers that knowingly violated the law by assisting the Federal Government with the illegal Terrorist Surveillance Program , but the FISA revision approved by the House of Representatives does not grant retroactive legal immunity for these telecommunication providers .
The version of FISA revision passed by the House of Representatives establishes more oversight by Congress and by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court ( FISC ) , and states explicitly that FISA is the exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted .
However , the Senate , which has been incorporated into the legal departments of the telecommunications industry , has now voted to legalize the Terrorist Surveillance Program , and the " Blue Dog " Democrats in the House of Representatives are also anxious to capitulate to the Republicans .
The President has threatened to veto the FISA rewrite if FISA does not provide retroactive legal immunity for telecommunication providers , and if the final version of FISA does not resemble more closely the evisceration of FISA he temporarily achieved in August 2007 .
The fallback position for the President 's legal advisors is their assertion that the allegedly defunct Terrorist Surveillance Program was legal because the President 's inherent power ( i.e. , power which is alleged to be implied but which is not mentioned in the Constitution ) as commander - in - chief ( which is stated but not defined in Article II of the Constitution ) authorized him to bypass the powers of Congress which are detailed in Section 1 and Section 8 of Article I of the Constitution .
In the Report prepared by the Senate Intelligence Committee in October 2007 to accompany the Senate version of a more permanent revision of FISA , four Republican Senators ( including the ranking Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee ) added a statement reiterating their belief that the Terrorist Surveillance Program was legal because the unwritten inherent powers of the President under Article II of the Constitution superseded the legislative power of Congress as expressed through FISA .
Damning information about this issue was revealed in an August 2007 New York Times article , with reference to the PAA of 2007 , by Eric Lichtblau and James Risen , who wrote :
At a tense meeting last week with lawyers from a range of private groups active in the wiretapping issue , senior Justice Department officials refused to commit the administration to adhering to the limits laid out in the new legislation and left open the possibility that the president could once again use what they have said in other instances is his constitutional authority to act outside the regulations set by Congress .
At the meeting , Bruce Fein , a Justice Department lawyer in the Reagan administration , along with other critics of the legislation , pressed Justice Department officials repeatedly for an assurance that the administration considered itself bound by the restrictions imposed by Congress .
The Justice Department , led by Ken Wainstein , the assistant attorney general for national security , refused to do so , according to three participants in the meeting .
That stance angered Mr. Fein and others .
It sent the message , Mr. Fein said in an interview , that the new legislation , though it is already broadly worded , " is just advisory .
The president can still do whatever he wants to do .
They have not changed their position that the president 's Article II powers trump any ability by Congress to regulate the collection of foreign intelligence . "
Brian Walsh , a senior legal fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation who attended the same private meeting with Justice Department officials , acknowledged that the meeting - intended by the administration to solicit recommendations on the wiretapping legislation - became quite heated at times .
But he said he thought the administration 's stance on the president 's commander - in - chief powers was " a wise course . "
" They were careful not to concede any authority that they believe they have under Article II , " Mr. Walsh said .
" If they think they have the constitutional authority , it would n't make sense to commit to not using it . "
As Henny Youngman would have said : " This is a strict construction of the Constitution !?!?!? "
The rebuttal to an excess of Banana Republic Dictator Theater can be found in the Supreme Court decision written by Justice Robert Jackson in the 1952 case of YOUNGSTOWN SHEET AND TUBE CO .
v. SAWYER :
" When the President takes measures incompatible with the expressed or implied will of Congress , his power is at its lowest ebb , for then he can rely only upon his own constitutional powers minus any constitutional powers of Congress over the matter .
Courts can sustain exclusive presidential control in such a case only by disabling the Congress from acting upon the subject .
Presidential claim to a power at once so conclusive and preclusive must be scrutinized with caution , for what is at stake is the equilibrium established by our constitutional system . "
From a practical standpoint , the Constitution is whatever the Supreme Court says it is , but an assertion by the President that he is entitled to engage in massive electronic surveillance without warrants and without probable cause , involving citizens and other legal residents of the United States , is contrary to the plain meaning of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution even if FISA is rewritten to authorize such surveillance and even if the Supreme Court were to uphold such a revision of FISA .
We used to be the land of the free and the home of the brave , but now we are the land of " nine - eleven changed everything " .
There are few transgressions of the President which are not excused by fear - mongering with respect to our so - called " war on terror " , and this is a major impediment to a rational discussion of the limits on the President 's authority and our professed adherence to the rule of law .
The President 's profligate use of signing statements to distort the meaning of various pieces of legislation is ample evidence that the President cannot be entrusted with poorly - defined powers which are prone to abuse .
On May 17 , 2002 , the FISA Court released an opinion which stated that FBI and Justice Department officials had supplied erroneous information to the court in more than 75 applications for search warrants and wiretaps , including one signed by then - FBI Director Louis J. Freeh .
In March 2007 , the Inspector General for the Department of Justice released a report confirming extensive misuse of National Security Letters in a sample of four FBI field offices , and an internal audit by the FBI confirmed that the problem was far more extensive than it previously had been thought to be .
The discovery several months ago that the CIA Director is investigating the CIA Inspector General is a good example of why a weasel cannot be left alone to guard the chicken coop .
Protecting the lives of our fellow citizens is not a goal which should be dismissed casually , but the threat of a terrorist attack is relatively insignificant when compared to some other threats in which we actually participate willingly or threats that we take for granted :
Cigarette smoking causes over 400,000 deaths each year , and alcohol - related deaths exceed 75,000 each year , but the two most destructive drugs in the United States are legal , and Prohibition was a dismal failure due to non-compliance by the public .
We know that reducing the speed limit on our highways would save many thousands of lives every year , but the driving public would oppose such a policy because it would cause too much inconvenience .
Obesity - related illnesses have become a major cause of premature deaths in the United States , but people are not afraid of food .
Approximately 30,000 people are killed each year in the United States by citizens and other legal residents using guns , but most people accept that disarming the populace is unconstitutional and unrealistic ( at least while Charlton Heston is still living ) .
Al - Qaida in Iraq is less dangerous to us than the amorphous army of drunk drivers in the United States .
It is likely that terrorists will occasionally succeed in killing some people in the United States , and we should do everything practical that is allowed within our Constitution to prevent such deaths , but we should not bargain away our inalienable rights due to fears which are disproportionate to the actual threat .
The right of " habeas corpus " which protects people against unlawful and arbitrary detention has been one of the most fundamental principles of any free society since King John was forced by his nobles to sign the Magna Carta .
Section 9 of Article I of the United States Constitution states :
" The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended , unless when in cases of rebellion or invasion the public safety may require it . "
Despite the fact that various aspects related to the right of " habeas corpus " are delineated in the Fourth , Fifth and ( most specifically ) Sixth Amendments to the Constitution , former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales stated in testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee on January 17 , 2007 that the Constitution does not guarantee the right of " habeas corpus " to every United States citizen or resident .
Although President Lincoln suspended the right of " habeas corpus " selectively during the Civil War ( as did Jefferson Davis in the Confederacy ) , this course of action was quite limited in scope with respect to the existing danger , and the suspension of these rights was very limited in duration .
However , our so - called " war on terror " is an endless war , and therefore we would be wise not to jettison essential elements of our Constitution because the thought of Islamic terrorists induces us to wet our pants .
Unfortunately , there are many politicians who are betting that they will not pay any political price by trading away parts of our Constitution in return for votes from a cowering public .
( 1 ) Bend over ; ( 2 ) Put your head between your legs ; ( 3 ) Kiss your right to privacy goodbye .
This was the new order of things as outlined in a speech by Donald Kerr , Principal Deputy Director of the Office of National Intelligence , on October 23 , 2007 at the fourth annual Geospatial Intelligence Symposium in San Antonio , Texas .
With reference to Internet sites like Myspace and Facebook , Mr. Kerr said that Americans essentially are giving up privacy anyway by posting personal information on such social networking sites .
Mr. Kerr , age 68 , stated that the two most recent generations have very different ideas about what is essential privacy and about what they would wish to protect concerning their lives and affairs .
Therefore , Mr. Kerr concluded , anyone who has typed his / her name on " Google " understands that protecting privacy from our own government is not a fight which can be won , and ( he really said this ) " it 's not for us to inflict one size fits all " .
I 'd been a bit concerned that this race / gender business was tearing progressives apart , but I think all decent people can come together now in loathing of Tim Russert and his refusal to ask questions about actual issues in the campaign .

On Jan. 19 , party caucuses meet in each precinct to choose delegates to county conventions .
The delegates selected are not bound to any candidate .
At the county conventions on Feb. 23 , delegates to the state convention are chosen .
They are not bound to any candidate .
The state convention is April 18 - 20 , during which delegates choose 25 of the 33 delegates to the national convention .
Sixteen of the 25 delegates are allocated proportionally to presidential candidates based on the support for the candidates in each of the state ’s three Congressional districts .
Nine delegates are allocated to candidates based on the support among all of the delegates attending the convention .
The remaining eight unpledged delegates are chosen from party leaders .
A pair of gay flamingos have become foster parents after taking an abandoned chick under their wings .
Carlos and Fernando had been so desperate to start a family that they had resorted to stealing eggs at the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust ( WWT ) in Slimbridge , Gloucestershire .
But their egg - sitting and hatching skills impressed staff so much that when one of the flamingo nests was abandoned last week , they were considered the number one choice to adopt the chick .
The unhatched egg was taken to an incubator where it was warmed up and monitored .
Hours later a healthy chick emerged , but staff were concerned that the duo would not bond with the newborn because the process normally begins when the chicks are ' calling ' them from inside the egg .
So the chick was carefully placed in an old eggshell , which was taped up and returned to the couple 's empty nest .
The pair were soon seen ' talking ' to the chick inside the egg and a little while later it hatched for a second time - to be greeted by its new parents .
WWT spokeswoman Jane Waghorn said : " Fernando and Carlos are a same sex couple who have been known to steal other flamingos ' eggs by chasing them off their nest because they wanted to rear them themselves .
" They were rather good at sitting on eggs and hatching them so last week , when a nest was abandoned , it seemed like a good idea to make them surrogate parents . "
The pair , who have been together for about six years , can feed their chick without any female help , by producing milk in their throat .
The chick , who is being brought up in a ' creche ' with 15 other newborns , has been welcomed into the flock , under the watchful eyes of its new parents .
Gay flamingos are not particularly rare and enjoy an elevated status with their choice of partner .
" If there are n't enough females or they do n't hit it off with them , they will pair off with other males , " Ms Waghorn said .
The pair are greater flamingos , the most widely dispersed of the six flamingo species , being found in Europe , Asia , Africa and North and South America .
The average lifespan is about 30 years .
About 550 Australian combat troops have been based in southern Iraq
Troops had turned over responsibility for security in two provinces to Iraqi forces and were no longer needed , Air Chief Marshal Angus Houston said .
" We have achieved our objectives in southern Iraq , " he told a Senate committee .
" It 's time to leave . "
New Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has promised to withdraw combat troops from Iraq by mid-2008 .
' Very confident '
Australian military personnel have been deployed in Iraq since the US - led invasion in 2003 .
About 550 combat troops remain in the country , plus another 1,000 personnel engaged in operations related to Iraq .
The combat troops have been based in the two southern provinces of Al - Muthanna and Dhi Qar .
But responsibility for security had been returned to Iraqi forces two years ago and they were no longer in need of Australian back - up , Air Chief Marshal Houston said .
" The conditions on the ground have been established whereby we can leave them to it and ... we are very confident in their ability to handle the circumstances in those two provinces , " he said .
The military chief described the outcome as " very pleasing " .
He said the move to pull troops out would likely have come even without the recent change of government .
Australian troops at air bases outside Iraq and on a warship guarding Iraq 's offshore oil terminals will remain in place , as well as a 110 - strong security team in Baghdad .
US Defense Secretary Robert Gates in due in Canberra at the weekend to discuss the Australian withdrawal and other military issues .
Hamming 's problem
To demonstrate his “ discipline of programming ” , Dijkstra discusses “ an exercise attributed to R. W. Hamming ” :
To generate in increasing order the sequence 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 12 , … of all numbers divisible by no primes other than 2 , 3 , or 5 .
Here ’s Dijkstra ’s solution in Haskell :
hamming = 1 : foldl1 merge [ map ( n* ) hamming | n <- [ 2,3,5 ] ] merge ( x:xs ) ( y:ys ) = case compare x y of LT -> x : merge xs ( y:ys ) GT -> y : merge ( x:xs ) ys EQ -> x : merge xs ys
Even in Haskell , I recommend Dijkstra ’s two exercises .
This problem was later used to illustrate “ perpetual processes ” ( i.e. , the lazy evaluation of infinite terms ) in logic programming :
あけましておめでとうございます。 今年もよろしくお願いします。
La Fonera ( La Fonera + ) のブート・ローダ RedBoot は、 TFTP サーバに置いたカーネルを load して起動することができる。 したがって、 TFTP サーバから load したカーネルで root ファイル・システムを NFS マウントすれば、 フラッシュ・メモリを使わずにブートすること ( ディスクレス・ブート、というか flashless boot ) ができる 。
La Fonera のようなルータをディスクレスにして 何が嬉しいのかと思う人もいるかもしれないが、 ルータのように常時ネットワークにつなぐものだからこそ、 ネットワークにつないでいないと使えないという ディスクレス最大の欠点が欠点にならないわけで、 むしろルータこそ積極的にディスクレスにすべきではなかろうか。
ディスクレス化することによるメリットは数多い。
なんといっても最大のメリットは、 フラッシュ・メモリを書き換えること無く、
手軽にファームウェアを入れ替えられる
( Open Wrt や DD - WRT など ) こと。 フラッシュ・メモリを書き換える時間が節約できるし、 書き換え回数を気にする必要もなくなるわけで、 心置き無くファームウェアのデバッグを行なえる。 また、 NFS を使えばフラッシュ・メモリの容量をはるかに超えるディスク領域を使えるので、 セルフ・コンパイル環境の構築なども容易に行なうことができる。
試しに、 La Fonera のフラッシュ・メモリを書き換えること無く DD - WRT をブートさせてみる 。
まず、 DD - WRT の root ファイル・システムを NFS サーバ上に展開する。 ここでは例として / nfs / dd - wrt に展開した 。
/usr/sbin/udhcpc の実行を抑制するため ( 理由は後述 ) に、 /nfs/dd-wrt/usr/sbin/udhcpc を削除しておく。
senri:/ tmp # wget " http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/downloads/release candidates/DD-WRT v24 RC6.2/Atheros WiSoc/Fonera/root.fs "
--09:22:37 -- http://www.dd-wrt.com/dd-wrtv2/downloads/release%20candidates/DD-WRT%20v24%20RC6.2/Atheros%20WiSoc/Fonera/root.fs => `root.fs ' ... 09:22:46 ( 335.56 KB/s ) - `root.fs ' saved [ 2834432/2834432 ] senri:/tmp # unsquashfs.dd - wrt - dest /nfs / dd - wrt root.fs
Reading a different endian SQUASHFS filesystem on root .fs created 347 files created 61 directories created 159 symlinks created 0 devices created 0 fifos senri:/ tmp # rm /nfs/dd-wrt/usr/sbin/udhcpc
次に DD - WRT のカーネルを改変して、 root ファイル・システムを NFS マウントできるようにする。 DD - WRT のソースを取得 :
senri:/usr/local/src % svn co svn://svn.dd-wrt.com/DD-WRT A DD -WRT / tools A DD -WRT / tools/addpattern_gs A DD-WRT/tools/uemf.h ...
La Fonera 用のカーネルは、 DD - WRT / src/linux / ar531x/linux -2.6.23 にある。
SVN revision 8745 の場合は Linux 2.6.23.12 ベース。
ビルド用ディレクト リ /usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt を作って、 DD - WRT のデフォルトのカーネル設定ファイル .config_generic をコピーし、 make menuconfig を実行 :
senri:/usr/local/src % mkdir /usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt senri:/usr/local/src % cd DD-WRT/src/linux /ar531x/linux-2.6.23 senri:/usr/local/src/DD-WRT/src/linux/ar531x/linux-2.6.23 % make O=/usr/ local / src/linux -2.6.23.12-dd- wrt menuconfig ... senri:/usr/local/src/DD-WRT/src/linux/ar531x/linux-2.6.23 % cp .config_generic
/usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt/
senri:/usr/local/src/DD-WRT/src/linux/ar531x/linux-2.6.23 % cd /usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt senri:/usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt % make menuconfig
root ファイル・システムを NFS マウントするために必要な変更は以下の通り :
まず、 カーネルによる IP アドレス自動取得機能を有効にする :
-> Networking ->
Networking support ( NET [ =y ] ) ->
Networking options -> TCP / IP networking ( INET [ =y ] ) ->
IP : kernel level autoconfiguration ( IP_PNP [ =y ] ) ->
IP : DHCP support ( IP_PNP_DHCP [ =y ] )
DD - WRT のデフォルト設定では、 ネットワーク・ドライバ AR2313 がモジュールになっているので、 カーネル組み込み ( built - in ) に変更する :
-> Device Drivers ->
Network device support ( NETDEVICES [ =y ] ) ->
Ethernet ( 10 or 100 Mbit ) ( NET_ETHERNET [ =y ] ) ->
AR2313 Ethernet support ( AR2313 [ =y ] )
そして NFS サポートを有効にする :
-> File systems -> Network File Systems -> NFS file system support ( NFS_FS [ =y ] ) ->
Provide NFSv3 client support ( NFS_V3 [ =y ] ) ->
Root file system on NFS ( ROOT_NFS [ =y ] )
root ファイル・システムはカーネルがマウントするので mount コマンドは使用しないが、 La Fonera 用の DD - WRT の mount コマンド ( busybox に含まれる ) は、 NFS をサポートしていないので注意が必要である。 NFS サーバ上の root ディレクトリ / nfs / dd - wrt には、 NFS マウントをサポートした mount コマンドをインストールしておいたほうが便利 。
RedBoot の exec コマンドでカーネル・コマンドラインを指定しても、 なぜか無視される ( バグ? ) ので、 カーネルのデフォルト・コマンドラインを変更しておく :
-> Kernel hacking ->
Default kernel command string ( CMDLINE )
カーネル・コマンドラインとして以下を設定:
console=ttyS0,115200 ip=on root=/ dev/nfs nfsroot=/nfs/dd-wrt,nolock
以上まとめると、 カーネル設定ファイル .config の変更箇所は以下の通り :
CONFIG_IP_PNP=y CONFIG_IP_PNP_DHCP=y
CONFIG_AR2313=y CONFIG_NFS_FS=y
CONFIG_NFS_V3=y CONFIG_ROOT_NFS=y
CONFIG_LOCKD=y CONFIG_LOCKD_V4=y
CONFIG_NFS_COMMON=y
CONFIG_SUNRPC=y CONFIG_CMDLINE="console=ttyS0,115200 ip=on root=/dev/nfs nfsroot=/nfs/dd-wrt,nolock "
make して TFTP サーバに置く :
senri:/usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt % make make - C /usr / local / src/DD-WRT/src/linux/ar531x/linux-2.6.23
O=/usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt GEN /usr / local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt/ Makefile ... LD vmlinux SYSMAP System.map ...
senri:/usr/local/src/linux-2.6.23.12-dd-wrt % mips -linux - uclibc - objcopy - O binary vmlinux / var/tftp/vmlinux.bin
La Fonera で読み込んでブートさせる ... といいたいところだが、 DD - WRT のカーネルは、 flash RAM に「 nvram 」 という名前の区画がないと Kernel panic を起こす :
RedBoot > load -r -b 0x80041000 vmlinux.bin
Using default protocol ( TFTP ) Raw file loaded 0x80041000 - 0x8031cbb3 , assumed entry at 0x80041000 RedBoot > exec

Kernel panic - not syncing : Attempted to kill init !
flash - less boot の主旨には反するが ( ^^ ; ) 、 nvram 区画を作って再度ブートを試みる 。
もちろん、 flash を一切参照しないファームウェアを作ることも可能ではあるが、 わずか 64 k byte の flash 領域を確保するだけで、 既存のファームウェアをほとんどそのまま流用できるのであれば、 費用対効果の高い flash の使い方と言えるのではないだろうか 。
nvram 区画の内容 は 「 空っぽ 」でも構わないのであるが、 ついでなので他の DD - WRT マシンで設定した nvram ( nvram.bin ) をコピーすれば、 設定の手間が省ける 。
DD - WRT のデフォルト設定では、 ath0 ( 無線LAN ) と eth0 ( WAN ) がブリッジとして動作する設定になっていて、 ブート途中で一時的に eth0 を停止する ( ifconfig eth0 down あるいは ifconfig eth0 0.0.0.0 ) 。 当然、eth0 を止めた瞬間に NFS サーバと通信できなくなり、 「 nfs : server not responding , still trying 」という ログを出し続けてハングしてしまう。 したがって、 eth0 を止めない設定にしておく必要がある。 例えば、 NFS サーバ上の root ディレクトリから /usr / sbin / udhcpc を削除した上で 、 「 WAN Connection Type 」 を DHCP に設定する 。
ついで ^2 に、 La Fonera + には、 「 image2」という名前の普段は使われていない区画がある ( 「 image 」区画が壊れた場合の非常用 ) ので削除しておく ( fis delete image2 ) 。
RedBoot > fis delete image2
Delete image ' image2 ' - continue ( y/ n ) ? y ... Erase from 0xa8660000-0xa87a0000 : .................... ...

flash がこの状態でも、 La Fonera + のオリジナル・ファームウェアは正常に起動する。 また、 ここでは La Fonera + を使用しているが、 La Fonera でも同様に nvram 区画を作ればよい 。
より正確に言うと、 区画の個数が同じ ( / dev/mtd9 が board_config ) でないと、 オリジナル・ファームウェアでは fonsmcd が異常終了してしまって、 FON ルータが接続されていないと FON にみなされてしまう。 image2 を削除して nvram を追加すれば区画の個数は変わらないので、 fonsmcd を正常に動かすことができる 。
ついでに言うと、 区画の個数が変化してしまっても 、
/usr / sbin/ fonsmcd ファイル中の「/dev/mtd9ro」という部分を変更すれば、
この問題は回避できる。 MTD
パーティションの番号をハードコーディングしてしまっているのは、 この部分だけだと思われる 。
再度ブート :

A sea lion rests on a beach in Ecuador 's Galapagos islands May 1 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Guillermo Granja
QUITO ( Reuters ) - Ecuadorian authorities are investigating the massacre of 53 sea lions in the pristine Galapagos islands in an incident fueling concerns over the government ’s capacity to protect the famous archipelago .
Park rangers found the decomposing sea lions with their skulls crushed on a remote islet earlier this month and now reports of tourists meddling with animals are prompting calls for stricter controls at the U.N. World Heritage site .
Ecuador is already debating whether to limit growing tourism on Galapagos and has expelled hundreds of illegal workers there to protect the natural reserve after the United Nations warned last year that the site was in danger .
“ It is obvious the control system has to be greatly improved , ” said Luis Suarez , the head of Ecuador ’s branch of Conservation International .
“ We need satellite control to know where people are , and better police intelligence to know more about the traffic of species and their organs . ”
Authorities are unclear why the sea lions were butchered .
Traffickers often kill the animals to take organs in demand for traditional medicines .
But these sea lions were untouched except for head wounds , officials said .
Ecuador ’s media also recently criticized local Galapagos authorities after showing images of one tourist holding a baby sea lion and another sitting on top of a massive tortoise in a violation of strict controls at the site .
The volcanic islands , located 650 miles off Ecuador ’s coast , inspired British naturalist Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
Centenarian tortoises and blue - footed boobies live alongside 18,000 islanders who earn a living from fishing and the tourism industry .
“ The growing demand and the tourism market is imposing the rules of the game , ” Eliecer Cruz , the governor of Galapagos , told Reuters .
“ We are working very hard to look for a new type of tourism in Galapagos . ”

Oil hit a new high today , $ 89 a barrel .
Some analysts predict it will soon hit $ 100 .
All this has caused much anxiety in the markets and handwringing in the press , which has generally attributed the increase to 1 ) unrest in the Middle East 2 ) increased demand , particularly from China and India and 3 ) speculators .
Okay , so all of these things are a factor to some extent .
But what analysts and pundits generally fail to point out is another reason for high oil prices in the U.S. market is the devaluation of the dollar .
If it were n’t for that , oil would cost about $ 60 a barrel , as it does effectively does in Europe and Canada .
On George W. Bush ’s inauguration day in January 2001 , you could have purchased a barrel of oil for about $ 30 .
If you lived in Europe , a barrel would have set you back about 32 Euro .
Because the value of the U.S. Dollar has fallen so substantially since then ( it took 93 cents to buy a Euro in January 2001 , it now takes $ 1.42 ) , the increase in the cost of oil for a U.S. consumer has far outstripped the increase for a Euro ( or Canadian , or Swiss , or just about any other ) consumer .
Today , it takes US $ 89 to buy a barrel of oil , but only 62 Euro .
Going from 32 Euro to 62 is a healthy rise , but is less than a 10 % annual increase since Bush has been in office .
By contrast , the move from $ 30 to $ 89 is nearly a tripling , or more than 17 % per year .
See this chart , where the price of oil in U.S. dollars is represented in white while the price in Euros is in red :
Thus , of the $ 59 increase in the cost of a barrel of oil to a U.S. consumer , more than $ 30 is due to the depreciation of the U.S. Dollar and the fiscal and trade policies that have contributed to it .
Not Middle East tensions , not China ’s increased appetite , etc .
Same thing is true with skyrocketing price of gold ; gold is going through the roof , sure , but what ’s really happening is that the dollar is going through the floor .
Many things have led to the devaluation of the U.S. Dollar .
But a big portion of it can be attributed to a growing deficit .
Now some , like MoJo contributor James K. Galbraith , would argue that deficits per se are n’t bad .
But the problem with this deficit is that it is largely attributable to 1 ) runaway spending on a disastrous war with no end in sight — in fact the chart shows how the divergence between currencies really starts to pick up following the invasion — and 2 ) massive tax cuts to the wealthy .
And that ai n’t good .

Although the image of the United States appears to have improved in Saudi Arabia over the past year , the Saudi public ’s view of Washington remains largely negative , according to major new poll released here this week by Terror Free Tomorrow ( TFT ) , a Washington , D.C. - based bipartisan group .
Indeed , less than 40 percent of some 1,000 Saudi respondents interviewed by telephone during the first week of December , said they have either a " very " or " somewhat favorable " opinion of the US , while nearly 52 percent said their view was either very or somewhat unfavorable , according to the survey results .
By contrast , Iran  which Saudi leaders reportedly consider a dangerous rival for influence in the oil - rich Gulf region  is seen more positively by the Saudi public in general , the poll found .
A plurality of 47 percent said they regarded Tehran either very or somewhat favorably , compared to 44 percent who expressed unfavorable views .
Strong majorities of Saudi respondents , on the other hand , said they held favorable views of Turkey ( 71 percent )  whose secular traditions would appear to be at odds with Saudi Arabia ’s staunchly Islamist orientation  and China ( 61 percent ) .
Somewhat weaker majorities said they had positive views of France and Britain .
The TFT survey , the latest in a series by the organization of key countries in the Islamic world  including Iran and Pakistan  suggests that Saudi public opinion , especially toward the outside world , is considerably more complex than depicted by the western mass media which has portrayed it as a stronghold of " Wahabi " fanaticism .
Fewer than one in ten Saudis said they had a favorable opinion of al - Qaeda .
Eighty - eight percent said they approved of their government ’s crackdown against the group and 15 percent said they had a positive impression of the group ’s chief and fellow - Saudi , Osama bin Laden .
But strong majorities of those who expressed a favorable opinion of bin Laden and al - Qaeda also said they favored closer ties between the US and Saudi Arabia and insisted that their views of the US would change for the better if Washington changed a number of its policies in the region .
More than two thirds ( 69 percent ) of respondents said they favored better relations with the US
Asked what policy changes would improve their opinion of the US , 85 percent cited the withdrawal of US military forces from Iraq .
Seventy - four percent cited increasing student and work visas for Saudis in the US and 71 percent suggested striking a free trade deal between the two countries .
Fifty - two percent of respondents said their view of Washington would improve if it brokered a comprehensive peace between Israel and the Palestinians , while only 36 percent cited Washington ’s efforts at promoting democracy in the Middle East .
Nearly two thirds ( 63 percent ) said their view would improve if Washington provided more military assistance to Saudi Arabia , although only 49 percent said they favored the pending sale of billions of dollars in advanced US weaponry to the kingdom , while 32 percent said they opposed it .
While 52 percent of Saudi respondents said they retained a negative opinion of the US , that marked a considerable improvement over the results of a smaller TFT poll taken in May 2006 when 89 percent of Saudi respondents said they held an unfavorable view .
Still , TFT ’s director , Ken Ballen , said the 40 percent favorable view suggested that the Saudi public was one of the most pro-US countries in the region .
He noted that only around 20 percent of respondents in surveys taken over the past year in Pakistan and Egypt said they had favorable views , while only nine percent of Turks shared that opinion in a May 2007 poll sponsored by the Pew Global Attitudes Project .
" From our surveys and others , " he wrote in a summary analysis of the Saudi poll , " there are only two major Muslim majority countries with a higher favorable opinion of the United States : Bangladesh and Iran . "
As heartening as that conclusion appeared to be , the US and Americans ranked were still seen least favorably among seven nations and their citizens on whom respondents were asked to give their opinions .
Only four in ten Saudis said they felt positively about Americans .
Favorable opinions of the British were voiced by 48 percent of respondents .
Fifty - two percent said they had favorable views of Iranians , while the French , at 57 percent , were viewed somewhat more favorably Nearly three out of four respondents said they had a positive view of Turks .
" It ’s not like they ’re locked into an anti-western framework , " noted Steve Kull , director of the University of Maryland ’s Program on International Policy Attitudes ( PIPA ) , citing the statistics for Britain and France .
Kull , whose organization has done extensive polling in the Middle East , also noted that the relatively favorable views towards Iran suggested that the Saudi public does not share the same fears about Tehran as the royal family .
Nearly one third of Saudi respondents said they had a favorable opinion of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  nearly three times the percentage of those who had positive views of Bush .
Still , 57 percent of respondents said they opposed the development by Iran of nuclear weapons .
Thirty - eight percent said they would favor the US and other countries taking military action to prevent the Iranians from obtaining such a weapon , compared to 27 percent who said the US should accept a nuclear - armed Iran .
Saudis were particularly sympathetic toward Iraqis for whom more than four in five respondents expressed favorable views .
Iraq also appeared to be the dominant source of unhappiness with the US .
Despite their strong antipathy toward al - Qaeda , 36 percent of respondents said they supported Saudi citizens going to Iraq to fight US forces there .
Only 17 percent said they supported Saudis fighting Shi’ite militias in Iraq .
Saudi respondents expressed an almost uniform antipathy toward Jews .
Only six percent said they held favorable views of Jews .
Nearly nine of ten said their views were unfavorable ( 81 percent " very unfavorable " ) .
A slight majority of 51 percent said they would oppose any peace treaty recognizing Israel , while 30 percent said they would favor such a treaty on the condition that Palestinians establish a state of their own .
Attitudes towards Christians were more divided .
Forty - four percent expressed favorable views , while 54 percent said they had unfavorable opinions ( 40 percent " very unfavorable " ) .

( Updates with minister treated for injuries )
COLOMBO , Dec 27 ( Reuters ) - A Sri Lankan minister held hostage by state television employees needed stitches to head injuries on Thursday after they pelted him with stones and sprayed him with paint and urine , officials and witnesses said .
Non-cabinet labour minister Mervyn Silva entered the Colombo premises of state - owned Rupavahini earlier on Thursday complaining that his speech at a ceremony the previous day to reopen a bridge destroyed by the 2004 tsunami was not aired .
His aide then dragged the news director out of the newsroom , tearing open his shirt .
The broadcaster 's irate staff then hemmed the minister and his entourage into a small room , and would not let them leave , demanding an apology .
Silva was released after he apologised for the incident , but as he was escorted by police to his vehicle , some of the surrounding crowd pelted him with stones and poured dirty water over him .
Some members of the crowd told a Reuters reporter at the scene the water was mixed with urine .
" He has some head injuries and we have put stitches .
For further observation and treatment we have admitted him to the hospital , " said Hector Weerasinghe , director - general of Colombo National Hospital .
Local television showed hundreds of people at the premises shouting and jeering at the minister , who has previously been involved in brawls with the media .
Before he was roughed up , Silva had apologised .
" If my action is considered as a wrong act , I would like to apologise to the employees , " he said .
Media Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapa called the incident " unfortunate " .

NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) - With just two days to go before New Hampshire 's primary , two polls of voters in the state have Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in a virtual dead heat , while John McCain appears to be edging ahead of Mitt Romney .
Iowa caucus winner Obama and Clinton are backed by 33 % of Democratic primary voters in the poll conducted by CNN and WMUR by the University of New Hampshire .
A separate survey conducted for the Concord Monitor by Research 2000 had 34 % of likely Democratic primary voters opting for Sen. Obama , D - IL , and 33 % favoring Sen. Clinton , D - N.Y .
Former North Carolina Senator John Edwards netted 20 % in the CNN / WMUR poll , while the Concord Monitor poll had Edwards garnering 23 % of likely Democratic voters .
On the GOP side , Sen. McCain was backed by 35 % of likely Republican voters , while Romney , the former governor of Massachusetts , was backed by 29 % in the Concord Monitor survey , with Iowa caucus winner Mike Huckabee selected by 13 % , and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani at 8 % .
The CNN / WMUR survey offered similar results , with 33 % backing Sen. McCain of Arizona , and 27 % supporting Romney .
Huckabee was backed by 11 % , with the former Arkansas governor trailing former mayor Giuliani , who garnered 14 % .
Sunday 's televised news shows featured some , but not all , of the front - runners , with Edwards telling ABC that he's in the race for the long haul .
" I am in this through the convention and to the White House , " Edwards told ABC's ' This Week with George Stephanopoulos . '
Appearing on the same show after Edwards , Huckabee predicted he would do " better - than - expected in New Hampshire , " and win upcoming contests in South Carolina and Florida .
On NBC's ' Meet the Press , ' McCain reiterated past statements that he would not run as an independent should his latest bid for his party 's nomination falter .
They were told depleted uranium was not hazardous .
Now , 23 years after a US arms plant closed , workers and residents have cancer - and experts say their suffering shows the use of such weapons may be a war crime
Professor Randall Parrish 's research , which found depleted uranium ( DU ) in the urine of people exposed at the former Colonie , New York weapons factory , was funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council , not the UK Ministry of Defence , as we said in the article below .
His facility has participated in other DU tests for the MoD , but these are not directly linked to the New York study .
A fact box accompanying the piece called depleted uranium ' the densest naturally occurring metal ' but as a by - product of the production of enriched uranium it does not occur in nature .
Neither is it the densest when compared with , for example , tungsten , gold or platinum .
This has been corrected .
It is 50 years since Tony Ciarfello and his friends used the yard of a depleted uranium weapons factory as their playground in Colonie , a suburb of Albany in upstate New York state .
' There was n't no fence at the back of the plant , ' remembers Ciarfello .
' Inside was a big open ground and nobody would chase us away .
We used to play baseball and hang by the stream running through it .
We even used to fish in it - though we noticed the fish had big pink lumps on them . '
Today there are lumps on Ciarfello 's chest - strange , round tumours that protrude about an inch .
' No one seems to know what they are , ' he says .
' I 've also had a brain aneurysm caused by a suspected tumour .
I 'm constantly fatigued and for years I 've had terrible pains , deep inside my leg bones .
I fall over without warning and I 've got a heart condition . '
Ciarfello 's illnesses have rendered him unable to work for years .
Aged 57 and a father of five , he looks much older .
The US federal government and the firm that ran the factory , National Lead ( NL ) Industries , have been assuring former workers and residents around the 18 - acre site for decades that , although it is true that the plant used to produce unacceptable levels of radioactive pollution , it was not a serious health hazard .
Now , in a development with potentially devastating implications not only for Colonie but also for the future use of some of the West 's most powerful weapon systems , that claim is being challenged .
In a paper to be published in the next issue of the scientific journal Science of the Total Environment , a team led by Professor Randall Parrish of Leicester University reports the results of a three - year study of Colonie , funded by the UK Natural Environment Research Council .
Parrish 's team has found that DU contamination , which remains radioactive for millions of years , is in effect impossible to eradicate , not only from the environment but also from the bodies of humans .
Twenty - three years after production ceased they tested the urine of five former workers .
All are still contaminated with DU .
So were 20 per cent of people tested who had spent at least 10 years living near the factory when it was still working , including Ciarfello .
The small sample size precludes the drawing of statistical conclusions , the journal paper says .
But to find DU at all after so long a period is ' significant , since no previous study has documented evidence of DU exposure more than 20 years prior ... [ this ] indicates that the body burden of uranium must still be significant , whether retained in lungs , lymphatic system , kidneys or bone ' .
The team is now testing more individuals .
In 1984 , having bought the factory from NL for $ 10 in a deal that meant the firm was exempted from having to pay for its clean - up , the federal government began a massive decommissioning project , supervised by the Army Corps of Engineers .
The clean - up did not finish until summer 2007 , having cost some $ 190 m .
Contractors demolished the buildings and removed more than 150,000 tons of soil and other contaminated detritus , digging down to depths of up to 40ft and trucking it 2,000 miles by rail to underground radioactive waste sites in the Rockies .
All that is now left of the NL plant is a huge , undulating field , ringed by razor wire .
Despite this colossal effort , Parrish and his colleagues found high concentrations of DU particles in soil , stream sediments and household dust in the vicinity of the site , deposited long ago when the factory burnt the shavings and chips produced by the weapons manufacturing process : the study estimates that , over the years , about 10 tons of uranium oxide dust wafted from the chimney into the surrounding environment .
The Army Corps clean - up team tested the soil from some of the gardens of houses backing on to the plant , and in cases where it was found to be emitting more than 35 pico curies of radiation per gram they removed it .
The researchers discovered dust in and around buildings emitting up to 10 times as much .
DU , inhaled in the form of tiny motes of oxide that lodge inside the lungs , emits alpha radiation , nuclei of helium .
Unlike the gamma radiation produced by enriched , weapons - grade uranium , alpha particles will not penetrate the skin .
But inside the body DU travels around the bloodstream , accumulating not only in the lungs but also in other soft tissues such as the brain and bone marrow .
There , each mote becomes an alpha particle hotspot , bombarding its locality and damaging cell DNA .
Research has shown that DU has the potential to cause a wide range of cancers , kidney and thyroid problems , birth defects and disorders of the immune system .
When DU ' penetrators ' - armour - piercing shells that form the standard armament of some of Britain 's and America 's most commonly deployed military aircraft and vehicles - strike their targets , 10 per cent or more of the heavy DU metal burns at high temperatures , producing oxide particles very similar to those at Colonie .
TV footage shot in Baghdad in 2003 shows children playing in the remains of tanks coated with thick , black DU oxide , while there have long been claims that the DU shells that destroyed Saddam Hussein 's tanks in the 1991 Gulf war were responsible for high rates of cancer in places such as Basra .
Parrish 's team includes David Carpenter , an environmental health expert from Albany University .
' DU burns , it releases particulates that can be breathed in , and it does n't go away , ' he says .
' The issue does not concern military personnel as much as civilian populations in theatres where they are used .
Now we know that we can still find measurable levels of DU among the people of Colonie , we need a much bigger study to establish whether they have suffered disproportionate ill - effects such as cancers as a consequence .
If they have , it would raise a serious ethical challenge to the use of these weapons .
Arguably it could constitute a war crime .'
The NL plant on Central Avenue , Colonie 's main artery , opened in 1958 and became one of the Pentagon 's main suppliers .
DU - the material left in huge quantities by the process of refining enriched uranium for bombs and nuclear reactors - is extremely dense .
A pointed rod fired at high velocity will penetrate not only armour but several feet of concrete .
In 1979 a whistleblower from inside the plant told the local health department that it was releasing large amounts of DU from its 50ft chimney , which was not properly filtered .
The state government carried out atmospheric tests and in 1981 ordered that main production cease .
The factory shut three years later .
One of those who has now tested positive is Mike Aidala , 71 , who worked at the plant for 22 years and became its health and safety director .
' When it started , the place was spotless , ' he says .
' But over the years it got dirtier and dirtier .
We burnt the chips produced by the lathes in a steel furnace . '
He added : ' A lot of my co-workers died young .
Whether the plant was the reason , I guess we 'll never know . '
As concern in Colonie rose , a residents ' group began to call for a publicly funded health study .
For Anne Rabe , a founder member of a campaign that has now lasted for 25 years , the Parrish study represents overdue vindication .
' I do find it very ironic that the US government at state and federal level refused for so long to do anything , and now the UK comes along and has funded these tests , ' Rabe says .
Repeatedly , US agencies have claimed that the Colonie plant was reasonably safe , despite the massive clean - up .
Most recently , in 2003 , the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry issued a report saying that , although the pollution produced when the plant was operating might have slightly increased the risks of kidney disease and lung cancer , there was now ' no apparent public health hazard ' .
Rabe 's campaign has conducted a health study of its own , assembling a dossier from personal contacts and by knocking on neighbours ' doors .
It found that among almost 400 people surveyed there were numerous cases of rare cancers , thyroid and kidney complaints and birth defects .
The main difficulty the campaigners faced in the past is that DU eventually dissolves and is passed in the urine .
The US government claimed that the plant had been shut so long that it would be impossible to determine who had been contaminated - so rendering a full health survey pointless .
However , Parrish has developed new , more sensitive methods .
At the same time , his impartiality is impeccable .
Before his work in Colonie , Parrish tested more than 400 Gulf war veterans , failing to detect DU in any of them - so dealing a serious blow to those who claimed that DU is one of the causes of Gulf war syndrome .
' I did not expect to find it in Colonie , ' he says .
Some of those who have tested positive display classic , common symptoms found in DU victims elsewhere .
For example , Ciarfello says he was still in his twenties when his teeth ' just started to crumble : they ground down to nothing until they were just these little stumps and I pushed them out with my tongue ' .
Other members of his family are sick .
His son developed a severe kidney condition , while his brother , Frank , can barely walk and also suffers chronic fatigue .
A nephew was born with a disfiguring facial skin tumour that has required repeated surgery .
Tom Donnelly , 56 , spent 34 years as a foreman at a garage door workshop next to the NL factory , where tests have found high concentrations of DU in dust samples from places such as shelves and light fittings .
He has three auto - immune disorders : Crohn 's disease , a chronic inflammation of the bowel , total alopecia , and cerebral vasculitis , an immune system - related narrowing of blood vessels in the brain .
' The new tests suggest I inhaled about 4,000 particles of DU , ' Donnelly says .
' I used to come to work in the morning and see the chimney blowing its smoke in a thick black plume .
Most of us had no idea that the plant was using uranium at all .
After all , the sign outside said National Lead .
The Army Corps removed all that soil , but they never looked at the dust at all .
The effect on my life has been devastating , but how many others are already dead ? '
One is his late boss and friend Tom Murphy - who , like Donnelly , developed Crohn 's and died of it at 61 .
Ann Carusone lived in a house behind the plant from the time of her birth in 1966 until 1993 .
' When I tested positive , my reaction was sheer disbelief , ' she says .
She has endured years of a chronic lung disease , sarcoidosis , an inflammation of the lymph nodes usually found in much older people , as well as a blood disorder that produced petecchiae - dots of blood beneath her skin , similar to those seen in some of those exposed to radiation at Hiroshima .
In her twenties she had a pre-cancerous ovarian cyst that when removed was the size of a grapefruit .
' I knew many people from round here who died young , in their twenties and thirties , ' she says .
' We used to play out in the creek that flowed out of the plant site .
The water was sluggish , a weird yellow - green colour .
We 'd splash about in it .
Now we know it was laden with depleted uranium . '
' It 's very striking how many people in this small group have immune disorders like Tom Donnelly 's , ' says Carpenter .
' I can say with great confidence that people who inhaled DU are at greater risk of lung cancer , as well as leukaemia , other cancers and genetic damage of the type that causes birth defects .
Previous responses by official bodies could be said to amount to a cover-up .
People have been told that there 's no problem , and that 's very clearly not true . '
Yesterday NL failed to return calls requesting comment .
Deadly residue
Depleted uranium ( DU ) is the residue left in massive quantities when bomb - grade uranium is refined to make reactor fuel and nuclear weapons .
DU is used to make armour - penetrating shells , standard armament for some of the West 's most widely deployed military aircraft and vehicles , such as Bradley armoured cars , Abrams tanks , and Jaguar A10 fighter planes .
Less intensely radioactive than bomb - grade uranium , DU emits alpha particles , known to cause cancers .
DU weapons that strike their targets produce clouds of tiny uranium oxide particles , which lodge in the lungs and other soft tissues such as the brain and bone marrow .
DU shells were widely used in the 1991 Gulf war ; in Bosnia and Kosovo ; and are being used now in Iraq and Afghanistan .
In October e-mail , Bhutto said she would hold Musharraf ' responsible ' for her death David Edwards and Nick Juliano

In an e-mail sent to a confidant in the US two months ago , assassinated Pakistani opposition leader Benazir Bhutto said she would hold the country 's current leader Pervez Musharraf " responsible " because his government did not do enough to provide for her security .
" I wld [ sic ] hold Musharaf [ sic ] responsible , " Bhutto wrote to her US spokesman , Mark Siegel , in the October e-mail , which was reported Thursday afternoon by CNN's Wolf Blitzer .
" I have been made to feel insecure by his minions , and there is no way what is happening in terms of stopping me from taking private cars or using tinted windows or giving jammers or four police mobiles to cover all sides cld [ sic ] happen without him . "
Blitzer told viewers he received the e-mail soon after it was sent two months ago , but he agreed not to report on it unless Bhutto was assassinated .
" It 's a story I was asked to report to the world in -- if Bhutto were killed , " he said .
The former Pakistani prime minister was shot twice Thursday just before her assassin detonated a suicide bomb that killed at least 20 more of her supporters .
Appearing on The Situation Room on CNN , Siegel said Bhutto was concerned about her security as soon as she returned from years - long exile in October .
" Benazir was very concerned by the lack of security that she had on her arrival in Karachi on October 18th , " Siegel said .
" The circumstances around the attempt on the night of the 18th , the morning of the 19th , was very , very suspicious .
...
There was no investigation of that horrendous killing which killed 179 people .
She had asked that Scotland Yard and the FBI be brought in for forensic help for the investigation .
The government of General Musharraf absolutely refused . "
Since October , Siegel said , Bhutto received " some police protection , " but was denied other security precautions such as jammers to prevent improvised explosive devices or four police escorts to protect her from all sides when she appeared in public .
Mahmud al - Durrani , Pakistan 's ambassador to the US , also appeared on Blitzer 's program .
He said it was " naive " to blame Musharraf 's government for the attack .
" Musharraf tried his best , but the circumstances under which she moved , that was a problem , " al - Durrani said .
" When she was moving almost in a sea of humanity , so this -- this -- no system in the world can protect you against that . "

In May , Mozilla Labs vice president Chris Beard developed Personas , an experimental Firefox add - on for lightweight theming .
The add - on makes it possible to apply custom artwork to the Firefox chrome , including the toolbars , tabs , and status bar .
The addon is compatible with Firefox on all three major platforms .
The Personas addon started out as Beard 's personal project , but has now found a new home at Mozilla Labs and has undergone a major rewrite that is compatible with the latest Firefox 3 beta .
Beard says that Personas will become the starting point for experiments in dynamic personalization that Mozilla Labs will pursue in an effort to provide users with a richer browsing experience .
In the latest version of Personas , themes are automatically loaded directly from a JSON feed and are accessible through a menu that is embedded in the left - hand side of the status bar .
All of the content is loaded from remote locations and the styling changes are applied dynamically without the need for restarting the browser .
Mozilla Labs is actively developing a new API that will enable artists to submit content for inclusion in the feed .
According to Beard , artists will be able to use any technologies that are supported in a web page , including HTML , CSS , images , JavaScript , SVG , and the Canvas element .
This opens the door for rich skinning with very low barriers to entry .
I probably wo n't use Personas much myself since I greatly prefer the unadulterated GTK look in Firefox 3 , but the addon is very intriguing from a technical standpoint .
The way that Personas takes Firefox 's Internet capabilities and leverages theme to bring dynamic content to the Firefox chrome layer is very creative and it reflects a lot of possibilities that I had never previously considered .

It was nothing more than a warm handshake between two people meeting for the first time - but it was a gesture that saved Mark Gurrieri 's life .
The hand that clasped his belonged to a GP , Dr Chris Britt , who noticed a ' fleshy and spongy ' feeling which instantly triggered his professional concern .
A glance at Mr Gurrieri 's large facial features all but confirmed his suspicions and set alarm bells ringing .
Scroll down for more ...
Dr Britt had recognised the symptoms of acromegaly , a life - threatening disease caused by a benign brain tumour that affects just three people in every million .
The chance meeting led to Mr Gurrieri visiting his own GP , who referred him to a specialist , and the growth was removed last month .
The life - saving handshake happened on December 6 , when lifelong friend Rob Thompson brought Dr Britt to an Italian restaurant Mr Gurrieri runs in Canary Wharf .
" I came out to meet them at the door .
My friend , Rob , brought Chris along for the first time , " he said .
" We shook hands and I sat them down at the table .
He did n't say anything to me at the time but he turned to Rob as soon as he sat down and said ' I 'm sure he has acromegaly , I can tell you .
I 'll stake my career on it . '
" Rob did n't tell me straight away .
He came in two days later and was really nervous about telling me .
" I got straight on the internet .
I read down the lines and saw the word ' tumour ' .
That word is frightening , especially when it has to do with the head .
" I went to my GP with everything I could print off from the internet and waved it under his nose .
" He looked it up and said he was n't sure but would send me off for a blood test and MRI scan .
They came back positive for acromegaly . "
The condition , in which a tumour grows on the pituitary gland , causes an increase in growth hormones that can cause giantism in children .
In adults , it causes soft tissues to be deposited in the hands and growth of the skull bones .
Other symptoms include blindness , diabetes , high blood pressure and weakening of the heart and kidney .
If left untreated it can lead to premature death .
Mr Gurrieri , 36 , from Loughton , Essex , who is divorced with one son , is believed to have had the condition for up to five years before it was diagnosed .
He said he had been feeling under the weather for some time and would fall asleep at a moment 's notice .
" I always had big hands but I noticed in recent years they had become quite chunky .
I put it down to DIY at home and working in the kitchen , " he added .
" I had noticed my face becoming more fleshy too .
I went to a school reunion last year and I recognised everyone but I thought it was strange that no one recognised me .
" I also had muscle definition like I had been on steroids .
I went to play golf with a friend who I had n't seen for a couple of years and he asked if I had been going to the gym . "
During an operation in Wellington Hospital in St John 's Wood , north London , on January 14 , a pituitary surgeon managed to remove 92 per cent of the tumour .
Mr Gurrieri now takes medication and has to be monitored to keep the condition under control .
Dr Britt said : " As soon as I saw him I thought he looked like somebody who had acromegaly .
When I shook his hand it felt fleshy , which is caused by the soft tissue being deposited .
" When I was a medical student I was at Barts Hospital in London where I saw a few people with the condition because it is a specialist centre for treating it .
But it is extremely rare . "
Mr Gurrieri added : " My mum thinks Chris is my guardian angel .
I think I owe my life to him - and a few meals at the restaurant . "
Mr Clegg said politicians were entitled to a private life
The rapid - fire question and answer format on 5 Live meant the 40 - year - old did not have the chance to elaborate .
He later said he had " enormous respect for people who have religious faith " , that his wife is Catholic and that his children are being brought up Catholic .
Last month , former PM Tony Blair said he had not talked much about his faith for fear of being labelled a " nutter " .
Reshuffle
The radio interview with Mr Clegg , MP for Sheffield Hallam , came ahead of a reshuffle of the Lib Dem frontbench team expected over the next few days .
Asked whether he had ever taken illegal drugs , he replied : " I 'm going to cast a veil over that .
It 's the one thing I agree with David Cameron on .
I think politicians are entitled to a private life before they go into politics . "
If politics is going to solve the problems of people 's everyday lives , we need to listen to people
Nick Clegg
Lib Dem leader
And asked if he believed in God , he said : " No . "
In later comments to the BBC News website , Mr Clegg added : " I have enormous respect for people who have religious faith , I 'm married to a Catholic and am committed to bringing my children up as Catholics .
" However , I myself am not an active believer , but the last thing I would do when talking or thinking about religion is approach it with a closed heart or a closed mind . "
Mr Clegg was joined on his first day in the job by musician Brian Eno , whom he has brought in as an adviser on how to " reach out beyond Westminster to people who do n't get a say in politics " .
Mr Clegg said : " I will fight for a society where everyone gets a fair chance in life , and no - one is condemned by the circumstances of their birth .
" Education has got to be front and centre of Britain 's agenda if we 're going to make that happen .
So I will raise funding for the poorest children to the levels in private schools .
" And every family must be free from poverty , and feel they have a voice , and a stake , in Britain today . "
' People 's politics '
Mr Clegg added : " That requires a new kind of politics - a people 's politics .
If politics is going to solve the problems of people 's everyday lives , we need to listen to people , and act on what they say . "
Later the Archbishop of Canterbury , Rowan Williams , reacted to Mr Clegg 's declaration .
Dr Williams told Radio 5 Live presenter Simon Mayo : " It matters less to me than to know they are honest and reliable and that what beliefs they have they hold sincerely .
" This is n't a country where Christianity is imposed by law .
It 's a country with a nominally Christian majority .
And that 's good .
" And whoever becomes prime minister has to understand that and work with it rather than against the grain of it . "
Last month , Mr Blair told the BBC his Christian faith had been " hugely important " to his premiership , but that he had been wary of discussing it in case he was labelled a " nutter " .
His ex-spokesman Alastair Campbell once told reporters : " We do n't do God . "
Current Prime Minister Gordon Brown , the son of a church minister , is also a Christian who has spoken of his father 's advice acting as his " moral compass " .
Mr Clegg , an MP since 2005 , beat Chris Huhne to the Lib Dem leadership by 20,988 votes to 20,477 - a margin of just 511 .
Mr Clegg 's election follows a two - month contest caused by the resignation of Sir Menzies Campbell .

Scrutiny by NASA 's newest Mars orbiter is helping scientists learn the stories of some of the weirdest landscapes on Mars , as well as more familiar - looking parts of the Red Planet .
One type of landscape near Mars ' south pole is called " cryptic terrain " because it once defied explanation , but new observations bolster and refine recent interpretations of how springtime outbursts of carbon - dioxide gas there sculpt intricate patterns and paint seasonal splotches .
" A lot of Mars looks like Utah , but this is an area that looks nothing like Planet Earth , " said Candice Hansen of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , deputy principal investigator for the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera on NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
In addition to radially branching patterns called " spiders , " which had been detected by an earlier Mars orbiter , other intriguing ground textures in the area appear in the new images .
" In some places , the channels form patterns more like lace .
In others , the texture is reminiscent of lizard skin , " Hansen said .
Results from all six instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , which reached Mars last year , are described in dozens of presentations this week by planetary scientists in San Francisco at the fall meeting of the American Geophysical Union .
By taking stereo pictures of a target area from slightly different angles during different orbits , HiRISE can show the surface in three dimensions .
Channels found to widen as they run uphill in the cryptic terrain region testify that the channels are cut by a gas , not a liquid .
Earlier evidence for jets of gas active in the region came from fan - shaped blotches appearing seasonally , which scientists interpret as material fallen to the surface downwind of vents where the gas escapes .
Some of the fans are dark , others bright .
" The dark fans are probably dust , but the exact composition of the brighter fans had remained unknown until now , " said Tim Titus of the U.S. Geological Survey 's Astrogeology Team , Flagstaff , Ariz .
Observations by the new orbiter 's Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars suggest that the bright fans are composed of carbon - dioxide frost .
Here 's the story researchers now propose : Spring warms the ground under a winter - formed coating of carbon dioxide ice .
Thawing at the base of the coating generates carbon - dioxide gas , which carves channels as it pushes its way under the ice to a weak spot where it bursts free .
The jet of escaping gas carries dust aloft and also cools so fast from expanding rapidly that a fraction of the carbon dioxide refreezes and falls back to the surface as frost .
The processes creating the cryptic terrain are current events on Mars .
Repeated HiRISE observations of the same target area show the downwind fans can form and grow perceptibly in less than five days .
Other new findings from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter reveal processes of Martian environments long ago .
A team including Chris Okubo of the University of Arizona , Tucson , used stereo HiRISE images to examine layered deposits inside Mars ' Candor Chasma , part of Valles Marineris , the largest canyon system in the solar system .
" The high - resolution structural map allowed us to interpret the geological history of the area , " Okubo said .
" The layers are tilted in a way that tells us they are younger than the canyon . "
Spectrometer studies of the composition of these deposits had indicated water played a role in their formation , but their age relative to the formation of the canyon had been uncertain .
The new findings suggest water was present after the canyon formed .
JPL , a division of the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena , manages the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter mission for the NASA Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
Lockheed Martin Space Systems , Denver , is the prime contractor for the project and built the spacecraft .
The University of Arizona operates the HiRISE camera , which was built by Ball Aerospace and Technology Corp. , Boulder , Colo .
The Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars team , led by Johns Hopkins University 's Applied Physics Laboratory , includes expertise from universities , government agencies and small businesses in the United States and abroad .
George Bush begs Saudi King for help
Oil turns out to be too expensive for the USA .
World ’s only superpower now has to beg oil - mining countries to do something to stop oil prices from growing .
U.S. President Bush set out a hope during his meeting with Saudi King in Riyadh that OPEC would take into consideration the negative influence which high oil prices exert on the U.S. economy .
George Bush begs Saudi King for help
Bush ’s statement in Saudi Arabia , which is one of the most influential members of OPEC , means that the critical economy of the United States will not be able to purchase expensive oil at current volumes .
A barrel of fine oil is already traded on the level of $ 100 .
“ The USA is the largest oil consumer on the world market .
If the nation imposes restrictions on its own oil consumption it will lead to negative consequences for major oil suppliers , ” Mikhail Zak , a spokesman for Veles Capital Investment Corporation told Pravda.ru .
“ However , the U.S. economy greatly depends on energy carriers .
The technologies that are widely used in the U.S. economy at the moment are all based on good old oil and gas , ” the specialist added .
Oil - mining countries can only careless about Bush ’s requests or threats against such a background .
There is no chance for the USA to cut its oil consumption without causing a serious damage to its own economy .
“ Any of such restrictions will make the U.S. economy decline , which is the last thing the U.S. administration wants at the moment .
If purchasing current amounts of oil becomes unprofitable for the USA , it will start to use its own oil reserves more actively , ” Mikhail Zak said .
Bush ’s statement in Riyadh is more significant from the political point of view .
The Republicans will soon have to bid farewell to their reign in the USA .
Practically all presidential candidates stand strongly against the war in Iraq .
It brings up the idea that the next president will take maximum effort to withdraw troops from the war - torn country .
On the other hand , the puppet theater of the new Iraqi regime will not last long without American soldiers .
The ambition of U.S. oil corporations that import Iraqi oil in huge quantities may decline as well .
The activities of oil companies in Iraq are based on the production sharing agreement – their work is not transparent to say the least .
It may also happen that the USA will indeed suffer from the lack of the Iraqi oil when it ends the military presence there .
“ This is pure politics .
It is clear that oil companies will lose a certain amount of support when Democrats come to power in the USA , ” Mikhail Zak said .
One shall assume that George Bush ’s speech in Saudi Arabia demonstrated desperate attempts of American oil companies to strengthen their positions .

Do The Simplest Thing That Could Possibly Work
So when I asked [ KentBeck ] , " What 's the simplest thing that could possibly work , " I was n't even sure .
I was n't asking , " What do you know would work ? "
I was asking , " What 's possible ?
What is the simplest thing we could say in code , so that we 'll be talking about something that 's on the screen , instead of something that 's ill - formed in our mind . "
I was saying , " Once we get something on the screen , we can look at it .
If it needs to be more , we can make it more .
From the third page of this interview bit : http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest.html.
DoSimpleThings in ExtremeProgramming .
This enables design via two rules :
First , implement a new capability in the simplest [ SimplestOrEasiest ? ] way you can think of that " could possibly work " .
Do n't build a lot of amazing superstructure , do n't do anything fancy , just put it in .
Use an if statement , even .
Make the code pass the UnitTests for the new feature ( and all features , as always ) .
Second , and this is critical to the rule , refactor the system to be the simplest possible code including all the features it now has .
Follow the rule of OnceAndOnlyOnce and the other code quality rules to make the system as clean as it can possibly be .
With each increment of an IterativeDevelopment one should do the simplest thing that could possibly work .
To do this , you have to know at least two ways to do the thing .
That way , you can at least pick the simpler , if not the simplest .
Know that the ways could possibly work .
We do not mean will work , we mean could possibly work .
You need to be pretty sure it will work , but you do n't have to prove it .
Why ?
Because when you try to implement it , your implementation will tell you whether it does work .
Your tests will run , or they wo n't .
It will feel good , or it wo n't .
( Contrast this with the EinsteinPrinciple . )
We 're not looking for the quickest way ; we 're looking for the simplest result .
So , we first break the existing method into pieces .
That leaves the existing test cases running .
Then we modify ( simply , now ) one of the little methods to handle the next test case .
( KB )
Occam 's razor .
( JWRC )
Simplest does , however , mean a minimal solution .
Do n't build a giant super - efficient object , sorted and hashed and linked together , if an Array will do the job .
Simplest might mean " just use a Dictionary " .
It might mean " create a little object " .
It might mean " refactor the part hierarchy so that entitlements and deductions both have positive balance when they are normal " .
What it does mean , however , is to pick something you can do and do quickly , so that you can get on with the other things you really need to do .
Then do that thing professionally and well , complete with all appropriate refactoring .
As for the things you 're gonna need : YouArentGonnaNeedIt .
One final note : ExtremeProgramming rests , I believe , on the assumption that developers want to do well , and that when they know what is expected , they will do well .
We do , as a team , require that our rules about testing and other key processes be followed .
In almost every case , that works just fine .
If a developer does n't follow the rules , we correct or remove them .
< humour > The developer ?
Or the rules ?</ humour >
Remember , however , that " quality " is probably impossible to fully define .
Accuracy in a payroll system is only valuable up to a point .
No one expects a US payroll system to accurately deduct income taxes ; it is expected that each employee will have to make a manual adjustment with his yearly income tax filing .
Variation , however , is usually not accepted .
Depending upon the system , one usually expects a consistent total amount from period to period or expects a consistent pay rate from period to period .
Increased accuracy in withheld taxes would probably be judged as lower quality if it lead to wider variation in the amounts on pay checks .
In the end , the " quality " of a software based system must be sufficient to meet the expectations of the users ; the purpose of the system is really immaterial to the argument .
[ Please note , the intent of this is not to denigrate accounting systems , but rather to highlight the subjective nature of " quality " . ]
-- WayneMack
There are second order effects to asking yourself " What is the simplest thing that could possibly work ? " -- KentBeck
You get done sooner
Your work is easier to communicate
Duplication is obvious , so the needs and means for refactoring are clearer
Tests are easier to write
The code is easier to performance tune
Or , at least , there will be more scope for tuning performance
You feel less stress , which enhances all of the above
Be sure to see the ShakerQuote that starts , " If it is not useful or necessary , free yourself from imagining that you need to make it . "

Where I am having difficulty here is that ' simplest ' has no metric .
So " the fewest programming environment operations to get the next test case running " could actually be what is meant .
Or , " fewest lines of source code " .
Or , " source code using the what - I - consider simplest types of operations " .
-- AlistairCockburn
The ' do ' in DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork is n't how you get to the design ; it 's what is done in the design .
" The fewest programming environment operations to get the next test case running " is a possible way to get to a design .
It 's almost irrelevant in discussion of the simplicity of a design itself .

At each iteration in the evolution of the design , Fewest may well be Simplest .
But CruftMultiplies and that simplest way to get from Design N to Design N + 1 is not as simple .
-- KielHodges
DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork entails two ( 2 ) steps : first , implement the thing in a simple straightforward way ; second , refactor the code to produce the simplest system including the new thing .
In XP , we have an explicit rule and practice to keep cruft from multiplying .
When we do this ( and of course we can screw up ) , it seems to me that fewest is simplest .
I was asking you to support FewestIsntSimplest ? in the XP context . -- rj
Refactoring lets one go faster ; I 've long been convinced of that .
But one also goes faster by initially implementing the thing in a simple straightforward way .
I - and probably others - need to let go and allow myself to do that .
-- KielHodges
It occurred to me that DTSTTCPW has a near relative , SimplifyTheRequirements .
Of course , once you have simplified the requirements , you can still DTSTTCPW .
However , you might not think to simplify the requirements - most people do n't explore the dimensions of negotiation in them .
-- AlistairCockburn
This concept has been churning in my mind for a number of days .
I can definitely see advantages with minimizing the risk of over - engineering the code .
The subsystem builder in me is a little bothered however .
What I 'd be concerned about is that by concentrating on the simplest thing possible you might be painting yourself in a corner .
I am having trouble coming up with a good example however .
I think the word simplest is bringing up the wrong connotations in my mind .
I 'm equating simplest with quickest which I do n't think is what this is about .
Perhaps a better way of saying this is " implement the simplest architecture that could possibly work " .
-- GlenStampoultzis
We 're saying more than that , or less .
We 're saying consider all solutions to your task that could possibly work .
Implement the simplest solution .
Refactor from there if and when needed .
We 're saying that if you build your objects properly you wo n't ever paint yourself into a corner .
And we 're saying that when you do enhance the simple solution ( and you generally will ) , you will always wind up with a system that is just right for what it does so far .
And we 're saying that that is just where you want to be .
Everything just right , nothing added that is n't needed .
-- RonJeffries
Moreover , the cost of recovery from painting yourself into a corner is arguably ( much ! ) less than the cost of big up - front design which tries to cover lots of contingencies .
It depends on the corner , but I bet it 'll take less time to recover from an average corner than it 'll take to complete an average big up - front design .
Obviously , average is a very loaded word in this context .
-- BrentNewhall
I have found the opposite to be the case .
I have found that I am much more likely to paint myself into a corner when I try to do an expansive design .
It is far easier to add something to a simple design when needed , than having to tear apart an extensive design that is not quite right .
Too many times what looks right on paper now has obvious problems when someone tries to use it a year later .

Repeat , ad infinitum .
The worst case is that each of these programmers implements half of their giant superstructure according to their tastes during their time on the project .
The 3rd programmer sees a confused muddle .
Best case is they each DTSTTCPW .
Is DTSTTCPW another way to say " elegance ? "
I have to admit that good code gets cleaner and simpler as it evolves , but evolution takes effort .
I 'm afraid that " extreme programming " will be just a synonym for the usual boneheaded 24/7 DeathMarch , in the wrong hands .

No , it 's saying if you 're not sure what to do yet , do the simplest thing you can think of .

WhenOneLeafDiesBuyaWholeTree has some interesting and relevant stories .
( quote moved to TimeToMakeItShort )
How many people looked at the original installation and did not see a problem ?
Yes , it is easy to see in hindsight what might have been a better way , but that does not mean it would have been obvious at the time .
At the time of installation , it appears no one considered access to either the garbage disposal nor the water purifier system mounting bolts .
The problem is not the definition of " the simplest thing " but rather " could possibly work . "
The definition of " could possibly work " has changed since the installation .
For a mechanical change like this , it might have been cost effective to plan for more eventualities , however for software systems , there are really no analogies to " blocked access " nor " odd angles . "
The cost and effort to change things in software is very low and ( arguably ) it is lower than the cost of planning , and the changes rarely lead to scraped knuckles .
An extreme example is to not put safe - guards for nuclear missile launch panels UNTIL the world has been charred .
I believe it is reasonable to have a rule , " do n't block plugs ( outlets ) " even if a specific problem with it has not been identified .
It is similar to " do n't hardwire the same constant in multiple spots in a program " .
There are reasons for the experienced to hold back .
DTST is also a good way to get very experienced people to work together without spending endless hours explaining their great ideas to each other at the whiteboard .
Real systems get complex enough just solving real problems without revisiting every greybeard 's ancient history .
-- WardCunningham
I find it sometimes helpful to distinguish between " the first " , " the easiest " , and " the simplest " thing that could possibly work .
It often takes years of evolution for a design to finally acquire " the simplest " form -- I think this is why we have refactoring browsers and unit tests .
Similarly , one difference between a " greybeard " and a " rookie " is the former 's intuitive insight into " simple " solutions that work .
Mark
Twain is alleged to have written to a friend " I did n't have time to write the short letter I promised , and so I 've written a long one instead . " -- TomStambaugh ( see TimeToMakeItShort )
As an example , I am working on a web application to help judge the success of marketing through different channels .
The project uses JakartaStruts , and there are a lot of standard CrudScreen JavaServerPages / ActionForm ?/ Action sets for populating and reporting on the system 's various business objects .
It 's the same kind of stuff that I 've done on countless other projects ...
The code to validate a bunch of user input and throw it into the database , or take it out of the database and throw it to the client follows the same patterns I 've done a hundred times .
Now , TheSimplestThing would just be to implement these actions according to spec and get it done with .
But that does n't help when in a month I get another project that does similar things .
Now , I 've spent X times 2 units of time writing this CRUD code .
Realizing this , I abstracted a lot of the code into a CRUD framework that greatly reduces the amount of code in the Struts actions .
This is now part of my company 's IP , and can be used to shorten development time on future projects .
Obviously , this was not the ' simplest ' thing that I could have done , nor was it mandated by the requirements for this project .
But it has value , and made the project more interesting for myself .
It would never have happened if I only did the simplest thing that could work .
Am I an EvilProgrammer ?
for wasting the customer 's money like this , or am I just not understanding this principle very well ?

You probably had used DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWorkFirst ?
- knocte
You can only reuse what you can use .
Get to 'use ' with DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork .
Refactor if you have the same problem again , as reuse would be the simplest thing .
D .
I agree : Refactoring does not have to be only on a per-project basis .
If your group is working on multiple projects that are unrelated , but you find that you are violating DontRepeatYourself , then I see ReFactoring into a shared library the answer to DTSTTCPW .
There are limits though to inter - project refactoring , I suspect , due to library size or number of libraries required .
The point is , the shared library is a simpler solution than duplicate code ( fulfilling the same purpose in multiple projects ) and the complexity is hidden behind a common interface that is now group , department , company , or industry wide .
Hence standard libraries will , and should evolve , but remember the old adage " KISS " -- Keep it simple [ insert favorite ending here ] .
WyattMatthews
A counter example is wiki .
Its the simplest that will work , but most people find the syntax frustrating or if they are n't programmers , incomprehensible .
Its the simplest thing to a programmer .
Simple may be relative to the usage .
People may prefer bbCode , HTML , or other emphasis techniques instead of WikiML , because they are familiar with it .
Assuming DTSTTCPW was followed , would it be easier to replace the edit engine or would it be more complicated to support both ?
I am assuming that DTSTTCPW and OAOO would require that there is a single entry point for rendering a page written in WikiML , a simple addition or change to the function calls made in that module may be all that 's needed to support N editing styles or completely replace the one we currently use .

Word is , the halt was called by Ass .
Secretary of State David Scanlan , and I have just gotten a report from Vickie Karp that Gardner plans to reinstate the recount .
Every time something inappropriate was going on , I was seeing Scanlan in a huddle .
He needs a much closer look .
While I 've been in the office , he does a lot of guiding of the process .
Gardner seems to me to be the affable friendly face of NH elections , while Scanlan is making things happen .
Scanlan is aggressive and is on record in the past defying or ignoring voting rights - friendly directives from Gardner .
I 'm not defending Gardner , because the buck stops with him .
But no one will get to the bottom of what 's really going on in NH without learning the truth about Dave Scanlan .
It would be particularly bad if Gardner bites the dust and Scanlan keeps his job .
So , what do you suppose they needed the extra 2 days for ?
More behind the scenes info ---
Karp and others have been pushing Gardner to allow Albert Howard to pick the areas he wants to count , and count them as soon as the ballot van arrives , before they go into the back warehouse .
Some headway was apparently being made with this .
Then Scanlan decides they need to halt the recount for a couple days .
For what ?

Bev , you rock by the way ...
Speculation about why is irrelevant .
The point is they are blatantly breaking the law .
" I am respectfully requesting that you cite your legal authority to suspend the recount over my objections and under the current facts and circumstances ; "
They have no legal authority to do so .
Howard , you need to find some council , and contact the Attorney General .
Go ahead and sue Gardner and Scanlan , and then find out what charges should be brought against them .
There was a reason Gardner was so nervous in that video ; he knew what he was doing is a felony .
He may have pictured himself sitting in a cell next to his new boyfriends .
Let 's play matchmaker and hook him up right .

It is apparent to any half wit that the system is not only broken , but its being " molded and designed " to accommodate whatever the Joe Blow in charge latest whim is !!
How deeply sad it is to realize that the country you are so proud of has been reduced to these types of third world trickery .
It has become increasingly clear why the internet is such an enemy to the government .
American citizens are being educated though the internet about the truth of leaders and their practices , their latest spins and of our broken system .
The government has n't been able to do damage control utilizing the traditionally established avenues that they used to be able to use .
American citizens have learned the how these spin masters work and they have access to the real truth of our corrupt governments ways .
Citizens have become immuned to our governments propaganda .
This has caused the government to think of the internet as " an invisible adversary " , and that is a terrifying thought to the powers that be , when they need to perform damage control .
The internet has been the American citizens BEST advocate !
Thanks for letting us know these important facts .

I agree with Bev Harris , what about David Scanlan 's motivations ?
Was the NH SOS setup ?
Beyond that , I find myself asking .
How do you put a potential oath breaker under oath ?
Just asking a question here .
I mean does a Satanist when he puts his hand on the bible need to care ?
I say no .
If I was a Satanist , I would n't care about no damn bible .
If I was a Wiccan I would n't care either .
If I was an Atheist I would n't care either .
So how do you put an oath breaker under oath ?
We gonna use this book today that book of shadows tomorrow ?
The oath breaker laughs at us .
There can't be accountability until there can be evidence , and there can't be evidence when there 's no chain of custody .
I hope that Albert Howard tears even deeper into these mysteries , because in my honest opionion we are all just about out of time .
There has to be some serious consequences for this corruption .
It 's in everyone 's interest .
( Cept maybe the oath breaker 's . )

That to secure these rights , Governments are instituted among Men , deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed , That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends , it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government , laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form , as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness .
Prudence , indeed , will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes ; and accordingly all experience hath shewn , that mankind are more disposed to suffer , while evils are sufferable , than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed .
But when a long train of abuses and usurpations , pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism , it is their right , it is their duty , to throw off such Government , and to provide new Guards for their future security .

They violate the 2nd Amendment by confiscating guns during Katrina .
They violate the 4th Amendment by conducting warrant - less wiretaps .
They violate the 5th and 6th Amendment by suspending habeas corpus .

With this kind of continuing criminal enterprise to steal the elections yet once again there is obviosly only one real solution and that is to tear down the government via revolution and start again .
Alternatively gather via film and recordings as much evidence of fraud esp. re ' machines ' .
Istrongly believe there is a multi billion RICO lawsuit that could be filed .
Either way ' they ' will do what Israel did when the Palestinians elected HAMAS - they will simply void the people 's choice for the corporations choice .

It is time we started to create parallel institutions and abandon their system on mass .
Let 's start preparing on how best to accomplish that .
As far as elections are concerned , do n't participate in them , so doing only legitimizes their criminality .

I hope the fence sitters here , mainly the ones still considering themselves Democrats , take notice of these games being played .
You see there is something to the conspiracy theories after all .
This one in broad daylight , which begs the question , where is the Mainstream Press on this ?
They are busy deflecting this from the masses .
There is no difference in the parties at the establishment level .
Obama may be preferable to Clinton to the people but he still has Zbigniew Brzezinski( CFR , Bilderberg ) ( what do Zbig , Michael Ledeen , Bin Laden have in common ? ) as his foreign policy advisor .
This should send red flags to his supporters regarding his establishment credentials .
I have voted Republican , Democrat , and Independent in the past and would be disgusted to be considered any of the three if most candidates running or considering running are an indication of what these parties , non parties stand for .
I urge you to reconsider the " Conspiracy Theories " you previously disregarded .
Now we can discuss whether tin foil hats will be uniform or self administered .

Here is a quote from a Counterpunch article
http://www.counterpunch....rg/lindorff01112008.html
" David Scanlan , New Hampshire 's deputy secretary of state for elections , whom I contacted Thursday , said that while town election officials are required to do test runs of the Diebold machines in the days before an election , " to make sure that they are reading the ballot markings accurately , " and that at that point the machines and the memory cards are sealed until the actual election day , there is no way for his office to independently conduct a post balloting test .
The ballot boxes are sealed and the only way they can be opened if for a candidate to request ( and pay for ) a manual recount , or for a court to order one . "
Scanlan says that the same is true for the voting machines and the memory cards .
While the sealed ballots are retained " for years , " however , the memory cards will be back in the hands of the contractor , LHS Associates , in " a few months , " to be erased and prepared for use in the general election next November . "
If memory serves me correctly did n't the SoS say they have no idea where the memory cards went ?
Also I would like to add this You Tube of a interview with Scanlan the night before the primaries .

There are thought to be 11,000 radioactive items in the UK
The items come from hospitals , schools and private firms .
The Environment Agency 's programme of disposal has been running since 2005 .
The effort is also designed to prevent the materials going missing and becoming a hazard to the public .
The final cost of getting rid of these " surplus sources " is likely to be £ 7 m .
There are thought to be 11,000 radioactive items in the UK , owned by universities , schools , hospitals and private firms , which are no longer used .
In hospitals , they might be highly active sources as large as a desk which were used in radiography machines .
Private companies often use radioactive elements in measuring devices and military museums have the dials of World War II aircraft which are covered in radioactive paint .
Clive Williams , from the Environment Agency , said a sample could be " the size of a finger tip " or much larger .
People in the UK should sleep easier knowing that there are n't these sources out there
Clive Williams
Environment Agency
" Eventually it will come to end the end of its useful working life and when it reaches that point it needs to be properly and safely managed and disposed of , " Mr Williams said .
Dirty bomb
The enormous cost of disposal in the 1990s meant that many organisations simply stockpiled their surplus sources .
Mr Williams said this now presented " a security threat " .
The risk is that terrorists could get hold of the material and use it to make a so - called dirty bomb , designed not to kill but to spread low - level contamination .
" I would n't say these are weapons of destruction , so much as disruption , " Mr Williams said .
So , working closely with the police and MI5 , the Environment Agency began the Surplus Sources Disposal Programme ( SSDP ) and so far its tally of items has reached 9,000 .
The programme is due to finish next year .
Mr Williams said : " We are very keen to ensure those security issues are dealt with and that the proper protections are provided .
" People in the UK should sleep easier , just that bit easier , knowing that there are n't these sources out there . "
' Preventing dumping '
Ian Day , who trains companies and individuals in radiological awareness , said : " This is excellent news .
As the government well knows , they have no long term safe option on the table for the disposal of nuclear waste
Shaun Burnie
Independent nuclear adviser
" If you look at November alone , around the world people have dumped radiation material to get rid of it .
People have been paid to dump radiation material .
" This programme is a way of preventing dumping in this country . "
News of the SSDP programme was also welcomed by Shaun Burnie , an independent nuclear advisor , who used to run Greenpeace 's nuclear campaigns .
But he said many of the sources were being taken for storage at nuclear plants such as Sellafield or Drigg , a practice he said was not sustainable .
" As the government well knows , they have no long - term safe option on the table for the disposal of nuclear waste , " Mr Burnie said .
" To pretend otherwise is dangerously misleading . "
Obama Momentum
By : Jeff Clark Date : Mon , 25 Feb 2008
I 'm sure almost everybody reading this entry is aware of the tight race in the US democratic primary between Clinton and Obama .
There is a huge amount of coverage over this exciting and extremely important contest .
A concept much - discussed lately is momentum .
I 've created a simple graphic to try and visualize the momentum .
Data from RealClearPolitics as of Feb 25th , 2008
The darker blue area shows Clinton 's delegate counts over time .
The lighter blue shows how much Obama 's counts exceed those of Clinton .
The small numbers show the actual difference at a point in time .
For example , after Feb 5th ( Super Tuesday ) , Obama had 30 more regular pledged delegates than Clinton - not counting super delegates .
Hillary Clinton currently has an advantage in super - delegates ( 241 to 181 for Obama ) and this makes the race closer than depicted above .
However , super - delegates support is not fixed - they are free to change who they support up until the time of the convention .
The odds of Microsoft Corp. winning its $ 42.1 billion bid for Yahoo Inc. appear to be improving , but Yahoo has n't abandoned hope of finding a way to keep the software giant at bay .
Its best chance may be a deal under discussion with News Corp. , in which the media conglomerate would swap its ownership of MySpace and several other online properties for a stake of 20 % or more in Yahoo , according to people familiar with the discussions .
Yahoo has also reached out to others , including Time Warner Inc. 's AOL , although that option ...

Still , the holes in the roof meant the children got wet on rainy nights .
When she lacked money for vegetables or fish , Tita served the children rice , and when she lacked enough rice for three meals , she served two .
A Sikh they called the “ boom - bay ” lent money at the standard interest rate , 20 percent per month .
Emmet borrowed about $ 130 to open a tiny grocery store , which he planned to run as a sideline with Tita ’s help .
The thief who robbed it during Holy Week seemed to know that they were busy with a marathon reading of the “ Pasyon , ” a 24 - hour life of Christ .
A few months later , Tita became pregnant with their fifth child .
By then the Marcos labor decree was five years old , and the machinery was humming .
Saudi Arabia was modernizing overnight .
It needed roads , schools , apartments , hospitals and laborers to build them .
Filipinos worked hard , spoke English and took orders .
Tita and Emmet had seen the workers coming home with the Look — leather jackets , Ray - Bans and enough gold around their necks to turn their skin yellow with a case of Saudi “ hepa . ”
But most of the jobs were controlled by recruiting agencies , which charged placement fees of a month ’s salary or more .
Only the privileged among the poor could leave .
In the spring of 1980 , Tita ’s brother Fortz took a loan from his father to try his luck in Riyadh .
He had just landed when Emmet ’s boss asked if he wanted to do the same pool - cleaning work in Dhahran .
“ Yes , yes , yes , ” Emmet said .
The firm that managed the stadium had a contract there , so there were no recruiters ’ fees .
Tita ’s brother Fering came the following year , and soon after , her brother Servando .
Of the 11 siblings in her generation , nine either became overseas workers or married one .
“ First timers ” have it rough .
Emmet shared a comfortable company apartment and a cook with three other Filipinos , but the loneliness was worse than anything he had known .
Outside of work , there was nothing to do .
Alcohol and churches were banned .
Looking the wrong way at a Saudi woman was an invitation to arrest .
( That is one theory behind the Ray - Bans . )
Emmet paced Dhahran malls and stared at Dhahran skies , fantasizing that the planes overhead had come to take him home .
Tita ’s loneliness was costly , too , but she had Emmet ’s earnings .
With a monthly salary of $ 500 , he made as much in two years in Dhahran as he did in two decades in Manila , and he sent two - thirds of it home .
Tita bought better food , and she bought Rowena medicine .
She bought each child a second school uniform , so she would not have to wash every night .
She bought an electric fan and a television — her habit of watching through a neighbor ’s window was a source of alleyway discord .
Emmet , who talked to the family on cassette tapes , surprised Tita by sending one with a $ 100 bill inside .
When Emmet got home in 1982 , he gave himself a party , patched the walls and replaced the leaky roof .
Then he signed another two - year contract .
After his second tour , he replaced the wooden walls with cement block and added an upstairs .
After his third contract , he paid the government $ 2,000 and got title to the land .
Though neither Tita nor Emmet finished high school , all five children started college ; four got degrees .
Emmet , overseas paying the bills , missed every graduation .
It takes a lot to move him to anger , but even now he gets furious when someone says that overseas workers leave their children to grow up without love .
“ You can not look at each other and say it ’s love if your stomach is empty , ” he said .
“ I sacrificed ! ”
I first met Tita and the kids in 1987 , as Emmet was finishing his third contract .
I had a fellowship from the Henry Luce Foundation to study urban poverty ; a Leveriza nun , Sister Christine Tan , introduced us , and Tita agreed to let me move in .
With Cory Aquino finishing her first year , the country was in transition , and Tita was , too .
She was no longer quite so talkless .
I awoke in the mornings to the blare of Tagalog news radio and once found her studying an English newspaper with a dual - language dictionary .
“ What ’s imperialism ? ” she asked .
When Congress wanted a witness for a hearing on urban poverty , Sister Christine had Tita testify .
Tita told me she had been asking God , “ Why are so many Filipinos poor ? ”
When I asked if God had answered , she laughed .
“ Not yet , ” she said .

" Much has been written about panics and mania … .
But one thing is certain ; that at particular times a great deal of stupid people have a great deal of stupid money .
At intervals … the money of these people — the blind capital , as we call it , of the country — is particularly large and craving : it seeks for someone to devour it and there is a ' plethora ' ; it finds someone and there is a ' speculation ' ; it is devoured and there is a panic . "
– Walter Bagehot , " Essay on Edward Gibbon "
The New Model Army
Right up to the second half of July , not only were commodity markets strong , but world equities were still raging ahead in utter denial of the spreading cracks in the credit boom , with both the S&P and the emerging markets ' indices making new highs in that time .
All this despite the fact that there were elevated sentiment readings : record - high margin longs on the NYSE ; record - low mutual fund liquid asset percentage holdings ; a major turn in the breadth of the market ( that for the NASDAQ has , indeed , since hit new multi- year lows ) ; and volatility indices were climbing with — rather than against — the rise in stocks .
It is now clear that the sense of invincibility displayed by so many players was singularly ill judged .
Far from forming a " permanently high plateau , " the early summer seems to have marked nothing less than the nose - bleedingly vertiginous pinnacle of what has arguably been the most spectacular mass hysteria in the whole sorry history of financial market manias — namely , the multi-trillion - dollar Ponzi scheme of credit we have created since the collapse of the technology frenzy .
Though there were those who had occasionally sniffed that " irrational exuberance " had begun to appear in any number of asset classes , the majority lacked the crucial insight that the cause of all this mischief was none other than the credit bubble that had continuously been inflating prices everywhere you looked ( though , ironically , everywhere the central banks were choosing not to look , at the same time ) .
The real bubble was in credit : all others — whether in uranium companies , LBO targets , Patek Philippe watches , or Modernist daubings — were ancillary to what the woefully uncomprehending ex-Fed chairman once called a " conundrum , " but which was , in reality , all too understandable a phenomenon .
In saying this , we were often haughtily dismissed by institutional investors who could nod in knowing agreement that , say , nickel might be overstretched in the near term , or that oil contangoes made energy indexes a mug 's game , but who were still perfectly content to buy yet another pease pottage of dubious , rag - tag credits from their overeager investment bank account managers , each secure in the belief that the statistical hocus pocus that purported to value these baskets afforded him a wide margin of safety .
As the events of the past few weeks have begun to reveal , however , this last presumption has proved just as fatal as all of its many less - than - illustrious predecessors in the perpetration of mathematical hubris .
As one hedge fund manager icily told his shell - shocked investors , " [ T ] he fund was doing well until the market suddenly became inefficient … ! "
Such is the unquestioning faith placed by a generation of self - serving technocrats in the alchemical mummery of the " models " by which they market their skills to investors .
A House Divided
Despite the journalistic fixation with the term , " sub - prime , " we must not allow ourselves to be misled into thinking that the world is going to go into a tailspin solely because of the travails of the odd hundred - thousand poor fools whose painful desire to make a fast buck flipping condos met a none - too - choosy lender with similarly short - sighted motives .
The plain fact is , however , that the laxity of lending and the euphoric rush of freebasing on risk never limited itself to such a low - rent corner of the world , for far more sophisticated financial operators were also all too eager to don their beads and boaters and to join in the Chuck Prince Charleston , for as long as the band was playing .
So , the whole colorful motley of hedge - fund gunslingers , private - equity barons , bond insurers , CDO traders , and fixed - income investors — the whole out - of - control business of steepling M&As , of vast share buybacks ( and hence of main - market equity market performance , as well as emerging market re-rating ) — the whole self - aggrandizing swagger of the Bulge Bracket bonus bonanza — all of it — every last red cent of it — has been , in turn , cause and effect of the build - up of the storm system which now threatens to sweep this Big Easy of false prosperity away , leaving little but the matchwood of shattered dreams and disabused expectations in its wake .
Therefore , even if we , personally , have not been knowingly playing the ragged edges of the credit game , the fact that the mighty hurricane which looms above us made its first landfall in the sprawling , plasterboard suburbs of sub - prime is no reason for complacency , for , as is just beginning to be glimpsed , sub - prime is itself no more than a particularly indefensible subset of the far more widespread dangers we all now face .
It is indeed a testimony to today 's utterly Carrollean mentality that the sight of the some of the world 's largest banks elbowing each other in the queue to secure penalty rate funding from the central banks has been near - unanimously taken as a positive development and a signal to buy back some of the more beaten - down stocks !
With little chance of enjoying anything other than a poor gruel of corporate and economic bad news in coming months , the callow eagerness to go bottom - fishing after such a shallow correction should only serve to confirm the belief that the herd will come a cropper over its unwillingness to admit that hard times lie ahead .
In truth , the whole Grand Guignol presently being performed on Wall Street and in the Square Mile is nothing but a highly dramatized and extremely compressed allegory of the misery a credit inflation serves to inflict on real businesses and real people .
While it may be hard to suppress entirely a touch of Schadenfreude at the difficulties now being posed to hedge funds peopled by the sort of individual who had " forgotten " that he had left his $ 150,000 custom Maserati sitting for months on a London parking meter , a sense of long - overdue comeuppance should not obscure either the wider lessons to be drawn from the crisis , nor hide the fact that the ensuing pain is all too likely to keep bankruptcy lawyers burning the midnight oil far beyond the Hamptons and the Home Counties ' hideaways of the fallen Lucifers of leverage .
The Usual Suspects
The common denominator to all these recurring episodes of avoidable madness is nothing other than loose money .
This may be fostered deliberately by policy makers ; it may be the result of some such historical accident as the conquest of the New World , or the discovery of gold in California or Kalgoorlie ; or it may result from the adoption of a financial innovation which economizes on the existing stock of money — possibly by introducing new , highly geared derivative instruments , such as Renaissance fractional reserve banking , options on tulip bulbs , partly paid Mississippi Company shares , New Era margin debt , or today 's vastly more powerful implements of Frankenfinance .
Overeasy credit — and the artificially suppressed real , risk - adjusted interest rates it engenders — unfailingly encourages too much investment in too many false projects .
Financiers become reckless , investors switch what savings they still make into more speculative , longer - lived vehicles and — showered with the resulting bounty — entrepreneurs are misled , en masse , to see real opportunity where there is only the shimmering mirage given off by hot money .
The resulting surge of new project financings , of increased bank lending and bond issuance , and the enthusiastic provision of venture capital soon gives rise to a marked resurgence of general business activity and to falling levels of unemployment .
Until costs make up their initial lag and begin to rise in proportion to selling prices , the injection of new credit and the stimulation of new investment will also have the effect of boosting accounting profits at both the micro- and at the aggregate levels and will thus appear to justify the mass hysteria that this latest of " New Eras " will , by now , have unleashed .
Sadly , the whole of this gleaming superstructure will be built on sand .
For , as Leon Walras once put it , here in Lausanne : " The expansion of … credit does not create [ physical ] capital , but a new demand for capital and the capital itself remains to be created . "
It is in the pervasive semantic confusion over the meaning of the word " capital " that most of the problems arise , for the fact that too many cloakroom tickets have been printed ( too much new , unsaved credit has been granted ) is likely to mean that a fight breaks out in the foyer after the final curtain falls .
Even if fisticuffs do not ensue , the simple fact is that some trusting soul is going to end up going home unprotected against the winter chill .
Thus , the crucial flaw in the development of the boom will lie in the fact that entrepreneurs and their financiers make the mistake of taking an abundance of financial capital ( which they themselves have largely created out of thin air ) for a correspondingly deep pool of physical capital and labor resources upon which to draw , without altering the prices plugged into their ROI calculations too adversely .
In essence , market interest rates — which are supposed to express the degree of our preference for jam today over jam tomorrow — become scrambled by the credit expansion and are not signaling that savings have been voluntarily increased ( less jam today , please ) so that a greater pool of resources lies available for redeployment into new investment projects ( more jam tomorrow , thank you ) .
Thus , the timetable for the delivery of sufficient consumer goods to meet income earners ' sequential demands will be thrown awry .
Lower rates may well allow promoters access to finance , but they do nothing to ensure that they will be able to turn it into the physical capital they need to carry out their plans — at least not without putting themselves dangerously at odds with the desires of the very consumers they think they are serving .
Long time - scale investment rises , yet no one voluntarily saves any more .
To the contrary , given the increase in money incomes that all that extra business activity will bring about , taken in combination with the prevailingly low - interest - rate environment , saving may well go down , both proportionately and absolutely .
This is especially the case if people are gulled into believing that the asset price appreciation that is a likely accompaniment to these conditions has somehow made them effortlessly wealthier .
Of itself , this is enough to introduce a debilitating degree of abrasiveness into the system for , while credit can serve well enough as a fuel , it turns out to be a poor lubricant .
Effective ( though not always imagined ) managerial horizons are now foreshortened ( in executive speak , there is little " visibility ' ) even as plans have become more grandiose .
To paraphrase von Clausewitz : Everything is very simple in an inflationary boom , but the simplest thing is difficult .
These difficulties accumulate and produce a friction that no man can imagine exactly who has not seen inflation .
Let Them Eat Cake
But this is only an interim stage , for the inevitable consequence is that final goods prices will begin to rise , narrowing the gap — and finally overtaking — the gain in prices being paid for investment and intermediate goods .
Once this happens , the seeds of disaster , sown by the credit expansion , will begin to germinate , for this is the point at which the less - specific ( or , if you prefer , the more - versatile ) " factors " ( people , machinery , land , and raw materials ) will be bid away from work on the longer - horizon , slower - amortizing undertakings — or , just as calamitously , from the later processing of their output somewhere amid their convoluted progression from mine and machine shop to the mall .
Instead , they will be enticed away into now - more - lucrative activities directly seeking to fulfill the desires of the crush of would - be consumers , eagerly cluttering up the high street and haunting the estate agents ' offices .
After seventy years of Keynesian indoctrination , this crucial point — that too much consumption , rather than too little , is the most likely cause of an economy - wide cardiac arrest — has become harder to grasp than it should be .
In truth , there is not that much difference in the mechanism at work ( even if the ramifications are here less momentous ) when horizontal , rather than vertical , competition arises — when people decide they will buy sneakers , not sandals ; or a Lexus , not a Lotus .
The winner thrives and can pay more for its inputs : the loser cannot respond as its revenues are shrinking fast .
Think " Betamax . "
Perhaps the reason that this makes intuitive sense is that is founded in microeconomics — in truth , the only viable subset of the modern canon .
Once we move up to macroeconomics , however , the ludicrous convention exists that a homogeneous slug of new consumption demand instantly and automatically prods owners of a similarly monotonous block of capital into taking the action appropriate to meet it .
This leads straight to a belief that while competition for resources across a given slice through the productive structure is a commonplace , a similar contest up and down it must be decisively ruled out .
Yet , if we start from the other end , we can perhaps illustrate how this stultifying disharmony between investment and consumption may sometimes spring up by taking the case of a nation at war , or by looking at the brutal , peacetime industrialization pursued by Europe 's red - and brown - shirts in the 1930s .
The popular fallacy persists that these acts of violent mass coercion served as the only effective remedy to the Depression which had plagued that dark decade — a misperception that confuses a process of genuine recovery with the bare truth that the whole workforce had at last found employment — whether as the ultimate exhaustive consumers who peopled the state 's vast , conscript - slave armies , or as the factory hands busy hammering out , not goods for their own enjoyment , but the tools of destruction ( the " bads " ) with which their brothers and sweethearts in the front line would be fitted .
The truth is that all this " investment " was , in fact , crowding out the satisfaction of the individual 's everyday wants .
Flags may have waved and anthems bravely blared , but the workers ' lot was to endure the enforced penury of an unrelenting toil , their only real reward one of shortages , queues , and rationing , while being browbeaten into sinking the unusable surplus of their earnings into war bonds — a singularly inapt vehicle for preserving their wealth in such an inflationary milieu .
Though a deal less extreme in its choice of means , it must be recognized that there is little a priori economic difference between this particular tyranny and the much more commonly practiced attempt to deny the free expression of the individual 's choice in disposing of his income — the so - called " forced saving " — which takes place under the conditions of an investment - led credit expansion .
This may , indeed , be much the more efficient method precisely because it does not need the overseer 's whip or the threat of the gulag to effect it ( as the rather milder , collectivist planners of today 's China have long since worked out ) .
The fact that the worker at first colludes in his own expropriation may appear at the outset as the main strength of this approach , but , once the deception is rumbled , this misguided voluntarism rapidly degenerates into a critical failing if he should at last decide that he 'd actually like to taste some of the pie he 's been slaving over in the collective kitchen .
In all such examples , an underlying sense of aggregate impatience — of " time preference , " in the jargon — has at last reasserted itself and shaken off the initial distortions of the credit injection to determine , once more , the relative prices of cash ( or goods ) today and the promise of cash ( or goods ) tomorrow .
It is at this critical juncture that — absent a further intervention to re-energize it by injecting yet more producers ' credit into the system so that higher - end firms may once again enjoy a transient lag between the rise in input costs and selling prices — the great ocean roller of the boom is likely to topple over and crash as it races over the reefs of its own internal contradictions .
Thrown a Curve
Assuming that no fresh influx of funds does appear , this may also be the point where the dreaded omen of a negative yield curve may appear .
Short - term money rates will soar as hard - pressed businessmen find themselves embroiled in a bidding war for the factors they so urgently need to complete the transformation of their wares to saleable final goods — factors whose reward their own internal cash flow has suddenly become too meager to encompass .
Another feature of the aggravated need for working capital may be that some of those caught out by this uncoiling of the inflationary tangle will choose to finance a store of unsold inventory , or to extend further credit to a customer by way of shifting it off their own books and temporarily avoiding scrutiny .
Unwilling , just yet , to admit defeat and to clear it out at whatever disappointingly lowly price the market will currently bear , they have thus become no more than leveraged speculators on a resumed rise in that inventory 's price .
In sum , anxious to salvage anything they can from the wreckage of their plans , the swelling ranks of struggling producers will be willing to pay interest not merely up to the level of their expected profit , as before , but even up to the full extent of their ( soon to be foregone ) depreciation allowances as well — a phenomenon Hayek termed : " investment that raises the demand for capital . "
Whatever specific form it takes , the inescapable denouement to this drama is that the fatal divide between entrained investment and the ex ante desire to save will come to reveal the utterly false premises on which the boom was launched .
As costs rise and revenues fall at the multitude of firms undergoing this excruciating dislocation , they will begin by freezing all discretionary spending — especially that earmarked for new capital outlays ( note that this will reduce macro measures of profits , as well as pressuring genuine micro ones , by lowering the total of revenues not matched by the same - period booking of costs in the tally ) .
Next , outside business services deemed " non-essential " will be curtailed and , finally , redundancy notices will be issued to the workforce .
The first of these countermeasures will tend to focus much of the pain up into the higher - goods sectors .
Here , revenues derive much more from expenditures made by their fellow businessmen below the line rather than above it , the type of spending which is much the more deferrable of the two .
Moreover , those bearing the brunt typically turn out the most narrowly specific range of products , goods themselves often requiring the most specialized equipment to make .
These are therefore the types of companies least likely to find any alternate outlet , once orders fail to be renewed or start being canceled by their regular clientele .
Whatever the specific trigger for the turn , once we have reached the point where the investment boom cracks , we find it typically takes the form of a cascade of failure and retrenchment spreading downwards — not upwards — from the capital goods manufacturers to the High Street .
Since , in a modern economy , business spending dwarfs the total of final , " retail " outlays , in contrast to popular belief , the intensity of the end - consumer 's penchant for spending is far from being a leading sign of distress , for it is only now , when the malign influence of rising unemployment makes itself felt that boom - swollen incomes shrink and the tinkle of cash registers begins to fade .
The recession has now truly arrived , though not , you will note , from any lack of " effective demand , " but rather due to a surfeit of defective — that is , mutually incompatible — demand .
In saying this , we should not lose sight of the fact that each bust has its own idiosyncrasies that diverge in some fashion or other from this bald stereotype .
For example , in our current performance of the tragedy , though the classic top - down avalanche of failure is still likely to make its appearance among the " real " industries as the entrepreneurial disruption spreads in the wake of the credit shock , the twist to the familiar plot is that , this time , Dame Finance may well be the first to succumb to the trauma of her many self - inflicted wounds .
Modern " finance " is , of course , itself an industry of significant scale ; accounting for over one sixth of US gross output .
It is the one , to boot , which is being most seriously discommoded at present , largely as a result of its own egregious behavior during the boom .
Indeed , as a business that has undergone a period of remarkable hypertrophy — whether we look at growth in assets , traded volumes , securities in issuance , derivative contracts outstanding , floor space , payrolls , or pay packets ! — a protracted suspension of the present asset inflation cannot fail to reveal a degree of collective managerial error among bankers , brokers , and fund managers on a scale likely to dwarf the puny travails of the overambitious steel magnates or disappointed copper miners who may be staring nervously down the same barrel of restriction as the one now threatening their larger creditors .
As one of the prime beneficiaries of this latest episode of inflationary wealth transfer , finance has done far more than simply channel cheap funds to real business .
Rather , its own spending decisions have come to loom overlarge in the consciousness of all too many others — whether superstar architects , IT salesmen , business travel facilitators , yacht brokers , or Savile Row tailors — meaning that the smoke rising over the Valhalla of value - at - risk will prove a portent of much hardship ahead for all those who have thus far helped lighten the bulging pockets of the financiers in their turn .
Sifting Through the Rubble
How long will the downturn last ?
That 's very hard to say , but it must be noted that — as Hayek confessed in later life — our modern interventionist state and its favored floating currency regime does allow the authorities much leeway to " smooth " ( in truth , to disguise ) the amplitude of the cycle , but only at the expense of stretching its wavelength and embedding its errors more deeply into the system .
As this particular boom teeters on the abyss of readjustment , the first impulse will be to continue to try to reinvigorate the dropsical financial network , which has been the first casualty of the crisis .
After all , next to financing the predatory organs of the state , central bankers principally exist to underwrite their local cartel of perpetrators of that imperfect fraud we call fractional reserve banking .
Here , one suspects , they might face a more difficult task than is widely supposed at present .
For while the use of open market operations , discount windows , and special facilities can help overcome a bout of illiquidity ( a state that arises when maturing liabilities are of much shorter tenor than are the fundamentally sound assets that correspond to them ) , the problem of insolvency ( when the worth of those assets falls well below that of the said liabilities ) is far more intractable .
Sadly , it is the latter case that seems to be the more pertinent as we attempt to pick a path through the soaring massifs of highly compromised , pseudo - AAA debt .
These mountains of unsound finance , you may be aware , were originally nothing but swamplands of unsaleable junk before the wondrous metamorphosis occurred when the presumed ( but , it transpires , the drastically underpriced ) residual risk was crammed into those improvised explosive devices of extreme leverage so favored by players themselves geared up to the eyeballs and funded , at root , by yet more leverage — that of last resort which is the modern banking system .
The degree of twisted ingenuity involved in all this infernal repackaging means that putting Humpty Dumpty back , intact , on his wall may well prove beyond the ken of all the king 's horses and all the king 's men , even if they do respond to the crescendo of political exhortations to " use all the available tools " — presumably that " technology we call the printing press " — perhaps by taking the " unconventional actions " ( monetizing promiscuously first and asking questions later ) previously arrogated to their box of tricks in the wake of the last fiasco .
As officialdom struggles to overcome the banking crisis , per se , thoughts will already be turning to other measures targeted at the real economy .
For instance , the otherwise impeccable counsel of Bill Gross at PIMCO has been for Leviathan to prepare to mop up the mess and to send the bill later to the thrifty and prudent for the privilege of bailing out their greedier or less - foresighted neighbors .
Then , as already advocated in an intellectually dire FT op - ed penned by Martin Wolf , attempts will be made to foster sheer , mindless spending somewhere around the globe in a virulent pandemic of Keynesianism , spearheaded , perhaps , by those in charge of the trillions of dollars of forex reserves piled up in the centralized coffers of the Asian exporters and major energy producers .
If their export markets dry up along with the wellsprings of their consumers ' credit , their governments will doubtless cajole the people into buying more of their own output as an offset .
To the extent such goods themselves contain a high level of imports — and trade deficits thus threaten to replace the current surpluses — those same reserves , they will reckon , can readily be run down in order to pay the bill .
And if the home currency weakens along the way ?
All well and good , from their typically mercantilist perspective .
Though this may indeed provide a breathing space if carried out with sufficient " in the long run , we 're all dead " resolve , we shudder to think of the time a few years hence , when the Last Emperor is found naked and shivering in the half - finished halls of his jerry - built Forbidden City , as China 's ramshackle scaffolding of bad debt , needlessly duplicated industries , rudimentary accounting , and pervasive corruption is no longer shrouded in the bright silks of oriental propaganda and occidental wishful thinking — and the wash of hot money consequently turns from swelling flood to roaring ebb .
However , even if the consumption - biased GDP aggregates do start to look better , as a result of a mass exercise of " bail out and build , " do n't forget that as the upswing gathered force , the cycle manifested itself in what we called a " lengthening " of the productive structure — in the undertaking of investments increasingly removed from the immediate provision of consumer goods , and especially of consumer staples .
A crushing asymmetry has come to bear here , as a result .
This lies in the fact that it is far easier to achieve such a lengthening — to use easy money and expensive shares to build plant , lay pipelines , and fill the factory with banks of shiny , new , specialized machinery — than it ever is to shorten it again : to retool the assembly line for a different ( more exhaustively consumable ) use ; to bring a different ore out of the same mineshaft ; to break the equipment profitably up for scrap — when the premise on which these bold steps were taken proves to be a mere falsehood spun amid the intoxicating mood of financial incontinence .
Since the quantity of capital , likely to be stranded when the tide of fortune goes out , will be both so large and so immobile , there will subsequently be little , if any , enthusiasm for an outright dismantling of that capacity .
In the West , an expedient bankruptcy filing can both lift the burden of heavy dividend and interest payments and break now - insupportable labor covenants while leaving capacity intact : in the East , the central state will prevent liquidation just as effectively by other means .
Neither will do much to speed the process of readjustment .
As a consequence , there will probably ensue a long period of submarginal economic returns to be endured in any such overbuilt business as its capital slowly dissolves amid a gnawing corrosion of high - grading , undermaintenance , and neglected depreciation .
Doubtless , too , some Broken Window - befuddled idiot will pipe up that it has all been worth it — that we would n't have all these factories , all these international trading hubs , and technology parks if it were n't for the bubble , but that 's a little like trying to comfort yourself for your loss by saying you would n't have all those near - pristine Italian suits hanging in the wardrobe if you 'd known you were going to put on that much weight right after you bought them .
However rose - tinted the perspective , the fact remains that much precious capital has been needlessly wasted during the boom and since the accumulation of productive capital is the only means by which we can ever improve our general standard of living , that loss cannot fail to be a meaningful one , even if its consequence can only be conditionally reckoned by way of a counterfactual narrative .
Under a more rational financial system , this regathering of strength would generally be accompanied by the higher real interest rates which are consonant with the reduced level of real capital now available and the next upswing would therefore begin on a sounder foundation , if to a timetable more considered than your average vote grubber might wish .
In practice , therefore , such political intemperance will mean that official interest rates are likely to be held too low , for too long , all over again — at the cost of encouraging another two - act drama of inappropriate optimism and crushing disappointment a few years down the line .
East of Eden
In trying to visualize what the economic landscape will look like after this hurricane of deleverage has finally dissipated itself , we suggest you draw the lesson from sub - prime and start by looking for the corporate , financial , and sovereign equivalents of those who took out ( as well as those who looked like geniuses for extending ) larger and larger chunks of " NINJA " loans ( " No Income , No Job or Assets " ) , even as the ship was visibly heading for the rocks .
Among these will be found the most likely casualties of the bust .
Another hurdle we will have to overcome arose because , as Bagehot ( again ) put it ,
The good times too of high price almost always engender much fraud .
All people are most credulous when they are most happy ; and when much money has just been made , when some people are really making it , when most people think they are making it , there is a happy opportunity for ingenious mendacity .
Almost everything will be believed for a little while , and long before discovery the worst and most adroit deceivers are geographically or legally beyond the reach of punishment .
But the harm they have done diffuses harm , for it weakens credit still farther .
As we have just drawn the curtain down on the most lavish exhibition of mass credulity ever experienced , we can well imagine that the scandal sheets will soon be running extra editions in order to fit in all the coming revelations of " ingenious mendacity . "
Just as we did after the tech - telecom bubble , we can also wearily expect that what seemed at the time to have been a Gilded Age of corporate profitability will be rendered a good deal less extraordinary , once the accounts have been properly recast , in an era of temporarily greater rigor in such matters .
But that 's as it should be .
Prodigious amounts of capital were wasted in the boom and much of what was spent as income in the good times clearly included a large element of that squandered capital .
The chief vices of the upswing — fraud , foolishness , and frippery — were terribly costly to sustain and — as they give way for a while to their opposite virtues of scrupulousness , skepticism , and sobriety — our records will have to be amended to reflect that fact .
At least it will give us something to do until we figure out where next to hitch up the engine of inflation .
At which point we can once again cast off the hair shirts , put on our gladrags , and throw another wild , exuberant , but ultimately destructive , orgy of high living and hot money — and devil take the hindmost !
Ohio Congressman and Democratic presidential candidate , Dennis Kucinich , appeared on Tucker today and easily held his ground against the ever - whiny host .

Reports show that 50 % of all people using BitTorrent at any given point in time do so to download TV - series , quite an impressive number .
In total , over a billion TV - shows are downloaded every year , and this number continues to rise .
It is safe to say that BitTorrent is slowly replacing Tivo .
Some episodes of popular TV - shows such as “ Lost ” , “ Prison Break ” and “ Heroes ” get up to 10 5 million downloads per episode , spread over hundreds of sites .
This number is getting awfully close to the average number of viewers on TV in the US .
However , the major difference is that the BitTorrent “ viewers ” come from all over the world .
In January TorrentFreak published the list of “ most downloaded TV - shows “ , where we showed that the most popular episode of “ Heroes ” was downloaded 2.5 million times on Mininova alone .
Even more impressive - across all BitTorrent sites - more than a billion episodes are downloaded every year worldwide .
The graph below shows the percentage of . torrent files per category downloaded on Mininova over the last 2 years – over 40 percent are TV - shows .
To support this , we analyzed a sample of 400,000 torrents earlier this year .
That data indicated that approximately half of all the people using BitTorrent at any given point in time , were using it to download a TV - show .
The popularity of TV - torrents has n’t gone unnoticed .
In fact , there are reports of TV - studios that allegedly use BitTorrent as a marketing tool , by leaking unaired pilots intentionally .
While the movie and music studios continue to fight their “ war on piracy ” , most of the TV - studios lay low .
On the contrary , Anne Sweeney - the president of the Disney - ABC television group - admitted that she was “ inspired ” after seeing a pirated copy of the hit - show “ Desperate Housewives ” .
The pirated copy of this popular TV show was the main reason ( besides the money ) for Disney to sell their shows online .
“ Coming ‘ face to face ’ with the high - quality , commercial - free pirated version ( of Desperate Housewives ) told Disney that it was not just competing with other broadcasters , but with digital pirates and as such was an experience that prompted us to do the iTunes deal with Apple . ”
Sweeney said at the time .
BitTorrent ’s popularity has n’t gone unnoticed by actors either .
Masi Oka who plays Hiro Nakamura in the popular show “ Heroes ” , made some pro-BitTorrent comments earlier this year .
When he was in France to promote the series ( before they aired ) , he was surprised to see how many people had already seen the show thanks to BitTorrent .
Oka said that BitTorrent is a great promotion tool , but added “ Hopefully , if they can buy the DVD after they watch it on BitTorrent , that would be great . ”
One of the members of EZTV , the leading TV - torrent distribution group , told TorrentFreak in an earlier interview that he does n’t think their work has a negative impact on the TV - industry either .
“ The only possible impacts can see are positive ones , ” Boggibill said “ it is free publicity , which may lead to higher ratings when people “ discover ” new shows and also larger numbers of DVD purchases – it is my understanding that many of the people that download TV shows from us are avid TV fans and will usually buy DVD boxsets of shows they like . ”
A factor that plays a role in the rise of unauthorized downloading of TV - shows is that most people simply do n’t see it as stealing .
It is a signal that customers want something that is not available through other channels and it ’s more about availability than the fact that it ’s free .
It ’s not a threat , but more an opportunity .
In the past few months , against all odds , Bush has scored two incredible victories in Iraq .
They are , of course , over his favorite enemies , the media and the American public .
Now , at last , the enemy in Iraq is being called Al Qaeda !
It does n’t matter who they are , if we ’re fighting them , they ’re called Al Qaeda on CNN , NPR , NBC , Fox News , everywhere !
Why it ’s as if we ’re actually fighting the people who attacked us on 9/11 !
Instead of a wide variety of groups and gangs and who knows what .
The victory runs deep .
It not only transforms the present , it rewrites history .
This morning , NPR did a report on Fallujah .
In it , they said , at least four times , that back in 2004 we were fighting Al Qaeda there .
We were n’t .
A look back at contemporary accounts shows that at the time the ‘ enemy ’ there was referred to as “ insurgents , ” “ Sunni fighters , ” “ Saddam supporters , ” and “ Sunni extremists . ”
Not a word about being Al Qaeda .
One has to assume that some intelligent PR person in the administration , or in the Pentagon , has given orders that in all military press releases and in all military press conferences , the people we are fighting are to be referred to as “ Al Qaeda ! ”
No evidence required .
After all , the American media needs no evidence .
They simply quote .
Then the quotes enter their own language , mind set , and reference systems .
They become an echo chamber , working relentlessly , though often unconsciously , to conquer the minds of the American people for Bushionics , the transformation of reality through re-labeling .
The second victory is the new certainty that “ The Surge is Working . ”
We saw it in the Democratic presidential debates .
The moderator asked the candidates the question this way : “ Now that everyone agrees that the surge has worked , how do you evaluate your opposition to it ? ” ( I do n’t have the transcript .
That may not be the exact words , but to the degree it is a paraphrase , it is an accurate one . )
It is now a matter of accepted fact , in the media , that the surge has worked .
It may be acknowledged that the goals of the surge , a set of achievements by the Iraqi government , have not been met at all .
It is occasionally pointed out , by nay sayers , that the decrease in violence has been achieved through ethnic cleansing , mass forced migrations , and by making common cause with exactly those people whom we were fighting in Fallujah and renaming them as ‘ enemies of Al Qaeda . ’
It may be acknowledged that in order to maintain conditions in Iraq , even at the level of relentless disaster that exists now , will require the presence of US forces for ten or twenty or fifty years .
( It is never mentioned that one of the real goals in Iraq was precisely that , to establish a permanent military presence , exactly like those we have in Germany , Japan and Korea ) .
But in the minds of the primary audience , the media , and the minds of the ultimate audience , the American public , those are but footnotes , arcane trivialities , lost beneath that definitive headline : The Surge Has Worked .
With that established , and the enemy renamed , Bush has won his victory – the Iraq War is off the table as a campaign issue and the political conventional wisdom is massive drift toward accepting a permanent US military presence there .
This is an astounding triumph .
It should be recognized as such .
Recognition must go , also , to those members of the news media who made it possible , by mindlessly inserting administration PR claims into their ‘ news ’ reporting as fact .
“ Fool me once , shame on you .
Fool me twice , shame on me , ” is a colloquialism , a line in a blues song ( BB King ) , and occasionally misspoken by George Bush .
But what are we to say about America ’s media , including such “ reputable ” members as NPR , CNN and the NY Times ?
“ Fool me once , fool me twice , fool me again and again , I ’ll always be a fool for you . ”
What does that make them ?
Fools for Bush .
Agents of delusion .
Conduits for PR offensives .
Enemies of reality .

" Numbers are Essential " : Victory in the North Atlantic Reconsidered , March - May 1943 by Rob Fisher
Introduction The Germans conceded defeat in the North Atlantic towards the end of May 1943 after sustaining heavy U - boat losses in a string of convoy battles since the beginning of the month .
Allied forces destroyed forty U - boats during May after averaging only fourteen per month from January to April 1943 .
(1) The U - boat men called it " Black May " ; others have called it the " Stalingrad at Sea " .
The magnitude of the German defeat was all the more surprising because February and March had witnessed several dramatic victories for the wolf packs against elite British and American escort groups .
What happened in the North Atlantic between March and May 1943 to cause this dramatic turnaround ?
There is no shortage of explanations .
These months have been the most closely studied of the Battle of the Atlantic .
Naval historians have attributed the Allied victory of May 1943 to a number of different factors : the development of sophisticated electronic equipment such as 10 - cm radar and ship - borne High Frequency / Direction - Finding ; improved tactics and training of escorts ; special intelligence from breaking the Enigma codes ; and more surface escorts and very - long - range or VLR aircraft .
Undoubtedly all of these factors played an important role in the defeat of the U - boats in 1943 .
Most historians have been reluctant to point to a single factor that was decisive .
Recent historians have emphasized that the victory of May was qualitative : obsolete U - boats were outclassed by the quality - technological and tactical - rather than the quantity of Allied surface and air escorts .
(2) I do not doubt the tremendous importance of Allied improvements in intelligence , technology , training , and tactics .
Significant developments , however , did not occur at sea in these areas between March - the month of defeat - and May - the month of victory .
These qualitative improvements took effect gradually and contributed to Allied victory over the long haul in the Atlantic campaign .
None of them adequately explain the sudden change of fortunes that took place in April and May .
Decryption intelligence had played an important role since late December 1942 but although there were temporary blackouts no major shift had occurred since that time .
Indeed , to some extent , the Germans had the intelligence advantage at this stage .
The tremendous technological advantage conferred by centimetric radar and High Frequency Direction - Finding is also inadequate as an explanation for the sudden - ness of Allied victory .
The British and American escort groups involved in the convoy disasters of February and March had carried this electronic equipment .
It had been standard equipment on British escorts since early 1942 .
The impact of advances in anti-submarine training and tactics is more problematic to assess but the refinements in tactics since late 1942 seem to have been subtle rather than significant .
Admiral Max Horton brought a renewed emphasis of training to Western Approaches Command in late 1942 which - as Marc Milner has demonstrated - resulted in the removal of the Canadian escort groups from the North Atlantic run in January .
(3) Still , the prime beneficiaries of this training - the C groups - did not play a leading role in the May victory and the slow rotation of British escorts through the training establishments cannot explain the sudden change of fortunes .
What changed the balance between wolf packs and convoys ?
Numbers .
Between late March and early May , the Allies reinforced the North Atlantic dramatically with large numbers of surface escorts , VLR aircraft , and escort carriers .
Decisions made in March freed up surface escorts for the North Atlantic by suspending the dangerous Arctic convoys to Russia and scaling back the escort commitments for Operation Torch in North Africa .
Western Approaches used this new - found wealth to enlarge the Mid-Ocean Escort Force and create six new support groups .
In addition , two new VLR squadrons joined the lone VLR squadron operating in the North Atlantic .
This reinforcement crushed the wolf packs in a sudden and convincing fashion .
Convoy Battles of Late 1942 and Early 1943
Time only permits a brief review of the major convoy battles of this period to demonstrate the impact of this reinforcement .
In November and December 1942 , two Canadian - escorted convoys suffered heavy attack .
SC 107 lost fifteen merchant ships to a pack of sixteen submarines - Siegfried von Forstner in U - 402 sank five ships alone .
The close escort consisted of six escorts : one destroyer and five corvettes , all without 10 - cm radar or HF / DF .
It had to defend the convoy for several nights in the Greenland air cover gap without air or surface support .
Canadian aircraft destroyed two U - boats at the outset of the battle but did not affect its outcome .
Next month , the westbound convoy ONS 154 lost fourteen ships to a group of eighteen submarines .
Its close escort consisted of six warships : one destroyer and five corvettes , newly - equipped with centimetric radar and HF / DF .
HMCS St. Laurent destroyed one U - boat .
Again , little support was offered .
British authorities blamed the losses in both battles on the poor training of the Canadian escorts and had the C groups removed from the North Atlantic run .
(4) Allied code breakers cracked the four - rotor Enigma codes in mid-December 1942 .
From then until the climax of the battle in May 1943 , both sides would have good signals intelligence .
In early February , the Allies fared slightly better with convoy SC 118 .
It had an abnormally large British escort of nine warships : four destroyers , four corvettes , and one Coast Guard cutter .
This powerful escort destroyed two U - boats but still lost eleven merchant ships .
Again , it was von Forstner in U - 402 who sank six ships in two attacks .
Long - range air cover from Iceland and Northern Ireland ended the pursuit and destroyed one more submarine .
The Germans intercepted two convoys escorted by the American escort group A3 in February and March .
ON 166 lost fourteen merchant ships to a pack of nineteen U - boats over four nights .
The close escort had the latest equipment and consisted of seven warships : two large veteran US Coast Guard Cutters and five RCN corvettes .
It destroyed one U - boat and VLR aircraft destroyed another .
On its return to the United Kingdom with SC 121 , the same group was hit hard again .
This time it had only five escorts .
In hurricane force weather , it lost twelve ships to a group of twenty - plus submarines .
The arrival of aircraft and warships from Iceland put an end to the battle after three nights .
Surface and air escorts did not sink a single U - boat .
(5) This Allied defeat set the stage in mid-March for two of the best known convoy battles of the war - SC 122 and HX 229 .
The British escort of SC 122 consisted of eight escorts : two destroyers , one frigate , and five corvettes .
It was well - equipped with centimetric radar and HF / DF and , being British , was presumably well - trained .
SC 122 lost nine merchant ships to a pack of about twenty submarines over three nights .
Simultaneously , HX 229 was under attack by another fifteen to twenty U - boats .
Its British escort consisted of only five escorts : two destroyers and three corvettes , similarly well - equipped .
The pack sank thirteen ships .
Intense air cover by VLR aircraft and the arrival of three warships from Iceland put an end to the slaughter of the two convoys .
VLR and long - range aircraft flew eleven sorties on the 18th and destroyed one sub - the only loss to the enemy .
(6) The surface escorts had lost twenty - three ships without sinking a U - boat .
It was a disaster of the magnitude of SC 107 and ONS 154 .
The much vaunted British escort groups - fitted with the latest electronic equipment and weapons systems - fared little better in the air cover gap than the American and Canadian escort groups had before them against slightly - better odds .
The result proved that even a well - equipped and highly - trained close screen of six or seven escorts could not prevent heavy losses to a large wolf pack in the air cover gap .
The defeat , understandably , caused dismay and soul - searching in the Admiralty .
April and May would bring a much different result .
Reinforcing the North Atlantic
My argument hinges on numbers so we should consider the size of the forces arrayed against the wolf packs in the North Atlantic in March 1943 .
The Mid-Ocean Escort Force consisted of ten escort groups which normally sailed with two destroyers and four corvettes .
The average for this period was 6.8 escorts per convoy , up slightly from 6.4 in November .
(7) In terms of long - range and very - long - range air cover , Coastal Command had nine VLR Liberators in Iceland and nine more in Northern Ireland for a total of eighteen - none with 10 - cm radar or Leigh Lights .
Long range aircraft consisted of about fifty aircraft - mainly Catalinas and Fortresses - based in Newfoundland , Iceland and Britain .
(8) In total , the North Atlantic defences consisted of about 75 surface escorts , eighteen VLR and about fifty long - range aircraft .
Decisions made in early 1943 caused a transfer of resources to this theatre in late March and April .
The Casablanca Conference decided that " the defeat of the U - boat must remain a first charge on the resources of the United Nations " .
The Combined Chiefs of Staff agreed to several measures to bring this about , including ( a ) Provision of auxiliary escort carriers for the protection of Atlantic convoys at the earliest practical moment ; ( b ) Provision of long - distance shore - based air cover as a matter of urgency for the transatlantic convoy routes ; ( c ) Development of air fields in Greenland ; and ( d ) Non-ocean - going escorts should be used for Operation Husky ( the invasion of Sicily ) to the maximum extent possible .
(9 ) Resources were not made available until late March .
The suspension of the Arctic convoys to Murmansk freed up fifteen fleet destroyers and one escort carrier - HMS Dasher - for transfer to Western Approaches .
These destroyers formed the basis of three new support groups in April .
Furthermore , reductions in the supply convoys for Operation Torch released additional escorts - including the escort carriers HMS Biter and Archer - for the North Atlantic .
The result was two more support groups composed of sloops and frigates .
In addition , the return of the C - groups and adjustments to the convoy cycles allowed the Mid-Ocean Escort Force to be increased from ten to twelve close escort groups .
The loss of HMS Dasher to an internal explosion on March 27th was a heavy blow but the loan of the carrier USS Bogue and its destroyer - escort to Western Approaches offset the loss .
By mid-April , Western Approaches had six brand new support groups - three of them with escort carriers .
( 10 ) This transfer of strength had an immediate impact .
The twelve close escort groups of the Mid-Ocean Escort Force averaged about 7.9 escorts per convoy in April and May - as the force increased from about 75 to 95 escorts .
( 11 ) When we add the six support groups which averaged about four destroyers , frigates or sloops at sea , and the three escort carriers - the theatre experienced an increase in fighting force in the range of 70 - 90 % .
It is tempting to speculate that the heavy losses to A3 and the B - groups in February and March spurred the Allies to action .
Still , it is clear that this reinforcement had support at the highest political levels in Great Britain and the United States - suspension of the convoys to Russia and transfers from Operation Torch would not have happened without it .
( 12 ) The numbers of VLR aircraft increased similarly in the North Atlantic theatre in April .
Coastal Command had eighteen Liberators in Iceland and Northern Ireland on March 15th .
This figure had risen by mid-April to twenty - seven Liberators , and by mid-May to thirty - five VLR Liberators in three squadrons : an increase of almost 100 % .
Ten of the new aircraft had centimetric radar ( partially contradicting my claims that there was no technological improvement in this period ) but none had Leigh Lights .
The doubling of the number of VLR aircraft was crucial because only they could operate in the Greenland air gap .
Service and national rivalries , however , prevented the deployment of them to Newfoundland until the summer of 1943 .
( 13 ) In short , in a few weeks , Allied anti-submarine resources in the vital North Atlantic theatre had virtually doubled in terms of numbers and fighting force .
The knowledge of this coming reinforcement produced optimism at Western Approaches in spite of the devastating losses of SC 122 and HX 229 .
Within days of those battles , Admiral Max Horton wrote to Rear Admiral R.B. Darke on March 23rd : " This job has been pretty sombre up to date , because one had n't the means to do those very simple things for which numbers are essential , and which could quash the menace definitely in a reasonable time ; but in the last few days things are much brighter and we are being reinforced , and I really have hopes now that we can turn to another and better role - killing them .
The real trouble has been basic - too few ships , all too hard worked with no time for training and all that that entails " .
Horton continued that " The Air carried afloat is now turning up to an extent which may be almost embarrassing in the next few months ....
All these things are coming to a head just now , and although the last week has been one of the blackest on the sea , so far as this job is concerned , I am really hopeful " .

ONS 5 and the Convoy Battles of May 1943
This strength made an immediate difference in the North Atlantic .
U - boat Command failed to mount a major convoy operation in April .
Towards the end that month , however , the Germans had stationed over fifty U - boats in two patrol lines in the western Atlantic off Newfoundland and another fifteen boats in the eastern Atlantic ( 15 )
It was this smaller group that intercepted convoy ONS 5 on April 28th southwest of Iceland .
The close escort , B7 , consisted of nine British warships : two destroyers , a frigate , four corvettes , and two anti-submarine trawlers .
Five or six U - boats made contact in bad weather and sank one merchant ship .
Western Approaches ordered the newly - created support group EG 3 , consisting of five destroyers , to sail from St. John 's to reinforce ONS 5 .
They arrived on the 30th increasing the screen to fourteen escorts .
In view of the disappointing results , U - boat Command called off the pack on May 1st .
The heavy seas , however , had also scattered the convoy and caused the close escort to run low on fuel .
Four of the destroyers - including the Senior Officer - had to detach for port leaving the convoy with a screen of three destroyers , a frigate , four corvettes , and one trawler .
The battle was not over .
Ahead , two patrol lines northeast of Newfoundland lay in wait for an eastbound convoy .
Instead , much delayed by the storm , on May 4th ONS 5 blundered into a patrol line of twenty - nine U - boats from the other direction .
Western Approaches sailed a second support group of frigates and sloops , EG 1 , from St. John 's to bolster B7 .
An RCAF Canso from Newfoundland attacked U - 209 on the 4th and damaged it so heavily that it sank a few days later .
Indeed , VLR aircraft from Iceland provided protection at extreme range on the 5th , revealing how the Greenland air gap had closed .
Even though the convoy had already reached the outer limits of air cover , U - boat Command ordered the pack to converge upon the convoy while there was still a chance .
A wild and confused battle ensued .
Initially , the Germans had the upper hand sinking twelve ships during the 4th and 5th of May while the escort destroyed one sub .
The tide turned against them on the 5th , however , as heavy fog set in - bad conditions for U - boat lookouts - and the rough seas calmed - good conditions for Allied radar .
The reinforced escort seized the initiative and destroyed five more U - boats on the 6th - turning defeat into victory .
The close escorts took the honours , sinking four subs solo but the support groups had a hand in sinking two of the subs .
The balance sheet for ONS 5 showed seven U - boats lost in return for thirteen ships sunk - a disastrous rate of exchange for the Germans .
All told , about forty U - boats stalked the convoy which received protection from no less than nineteen warships - seven destroyers , four frigates , two sloops , four corvettes , and two trawlers .
British authorities hailed the result as a decisive victory and historians have called it a turning point in the war at sea .
It is well to remember that only eight escorts were present when most of the merchant ships were lost and things might have been much different had the convoy had to transit the air cover gap for several nights far from surface reinforcement .
( 16 ) From here , things went from bad to worse for the Germans .
Efforts to mount large wolf pack operations against several convoys in May cost them dearly .
The pursuit of HX 237 - defended by the seven escorts of C2 and support group EG 5 ( including the carrier HMS Biter ) - resulted in the destruction of three U - boats in exchange for three stragglers lost .
HMCS Drumheller and RCAF Squadron 423 shared in the kills with other Allied surface and air escorts .
( 17 ) The balance sheet for SC 129 - protected by a British group of eight escorts and reinforced by EG 5 with Biter - showed one U - boat destroyed and two merchant ships sunk - both by our old friend von Forstner in U - 402 .
The attack on SC 130 was even less successful .
Thirteen warships - nine from the close escort and four from the support group EG 1 - prevented the pack from sinking a ship and destroyed one U - boat .
On the last two days of the battle , VLR Liberators made twenty - seven U - boat sightings and destroyed one .
German operations also failed against ON 184 , defended by six close escorts and the four destroyers and USS Bogue of support group EG 6 .
The pack could not penetrate the powerful screen to sink a single ship and carrier aircraft destroyed one U - boat .
The results against HX 239 resembled this action .
Eight close escorts , four support group destroyers and HMS Archer prevented any losses from the convoy and carrier aircraft destroyed one U - boat .
( 18 ) In two months , the Allies had solved the wolf pack .
As the magnitude of " Black May " set in , U - boat Command conceded defeat .
On May 24th it ordered submarines to withdraw from the North Atlantic to the central Atlantic beyond the range of shore - based air cover .
Another order instructed them to remain submerged when conditions of poor visibility prevailed .
With the benefit of hindsight , Admiral Karl Dönitz wrote in his memoirs : " We had lost the Battle of the Atlantic " .
U - boat Command blamed the defeat on Allied air cover and the performance of radar , and underestimated the number of U - boats destroyed during convoy battles .
( 19 ) Allied forces destroyed forty U - boats in May ; thirty - two of them in the North Atlantic .
Surface and air escorts of transatlantic convoys destroyed twenty of these U - boats .
Including shared kills , surface escorts had eleven kills , land - based aircraft had eight , and carrier aircraft had three kills .
In return for the loss of twenty U - boats in the convoy battles , the wolf packs sank only nineteen merchant ships ( including stragglers ) from the transatlantic convoys , most of them in the opening battle for ONS 5 .
Not including ONS 5 , the exchange was six merchant ships for thirteen U - boats .
( 20 ) The key to the sudden reversal of fortunes was the increase in the strength of the surface and air escort provided to convoys .
Not only were there more close escorts , but support groups reinforced twenty of the twenty - two convoys that sailed between April 6th and May 19th .
In fact , four of these convoys received protection from two support groups .
For all intents and purposes the three escort carriers and two additional VLR squadrons had closed the Greenland air gap .
Admiral Horton wrote with confidence at the end of May : " We now know ... what strength and composition of forces is necessary to deal with the U - boat menace against convoys " ( 21 )
Conclusions
The results of the convoy battles of May are testimony to the decisive impact of numbers .
But the German U - boat fleet was also growing rapidly in the spring of 1943 .
The front - line Atlantic U - boat fleet consisted of 167 attack boats on February 1st and 186 boats on May 1st ; an increase of about 15 % and enough to keep about sixty on active operations in the North Atlantic .
( 22 ) The steady growth of U - boat strength did not have the same impact as the increase in the numbers of surface and air escorts because of the dynamics of convoy battles and wolf pack tactics .
U - boat Command stationed submarines twenty miles apart in patrol lines perpendicular to the convoy routes .
The more U - boats , the longer the patrol lines , and the less likely that a convoy could be routed safely around the line .
The disadvantage was that the longer the patrol line , the further from the point of interception would be the subs at the opposite end of the line .
The dynamics of convoy battles also favoured large escorts over large packs .
Most of the sinkings in convoy battles of the 1942 to 1943 period were achieved by the two or three boldest and most aggressive U - boat commanders in the pack - men like Siegfried von Forstner .
The initial attacks forced the escort to counter - attack and rescue survivors .
This opened up the screen for the less aggressive commanders to move in and swamp the defenders .
A close escort of six or seven warships would become disorganized quite quickly after two or three sinkings .
An escort of ten to twelve warships including several destroyers or frigates and strong air cover was much less susceptible to this kind of disorder .
The bold U - boat commanders found it much more difficult to penetrate the screen , and if they did manage to attack , the escort regrouped quickly to prevent further losses .
The Admiralty 's Operational Research unit , led by the scientist P.M.S. Blackett , demonstrated mathematically the superiority of a large escort .
Blackett found that " that the chance that a U - boat would penetrate the screen depended only on the linear density of escorts , that is , on the number of escort vessels for each mile of perimeter to be defended " .
Indeed , increasing the size of the convoy did not increase the size of its perimeter by the same proportion so that a convoy of sixty merchant ships and twelve escorts was in fact much more strongly protected than a convoy of thirty ships and six escorts .
Blackett described convoy battles as " unstable equilibriums " where , when the advantage went to one side , it went completely to that side .
In April and May 1943 , Allied surface and air reinforcements tipped the balance decisively in favour of the defenders .
( 23 ) Can we draw some larger conclusions from this analysis ?
Could these anti-submarine resources have been made available earlier ?
The Royal Navy had four escort carriers in October 1942 : three assigned to Operation Torch and one to the Russian convoys .
They did not share in one U - boat kill in either of these assignments between September 1942 and April 1943 .
( 24 ) In addition , these routes absorbed scores of fleet destroyers and other escorts .
The wastefulness of this deployment for Operation Torch was tacitly admitted at Casablanca by the decision that non -ocean - going escorts be used to the fullest extent possible for Operation Husky .
Moreover , by October 1942 ships sailing in the coastal convoys of the United States received as much protection as those in the North Atlantic in spite of the much diminished threat in coastal waters and the close proximity of shore - based aircraft .
It was the same story with air cover .
Coastal Command assigned two new squadrons of long - range Liberators to the protection of the Torch convoys .
( 25 ) Scores of aircraft that could have tipped the balance against the wolf packs in late 1942 were lost in bombing raids over Germany .
It is difficult not to conclude that had the Allied resources been dedicated to the task , victory in the North Atlantic could have come in the fall of 1942 .
It would have been a more gradual and less dramatic victory than that of May 1943 to be sure , but victory nonetheless .

WASHINGTON 
The Bush administration is imposing restrictions on the ability of states to expand eligibility for Medicaid , in an effort to prevent them from offering coverage to families of modest incomes who , the administration argues , may have access to private health insurance .
The restrictions mirror those the administration placed on the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program in August after states tried to broaden eligibility for it as well .
Until now , states had generally been free to set their own Medicaid eligibility criteria , and the Bush administration had not openly declared that it would apply the August directive to Medicaid .
State officials in Louisiana , Ohio and Oklahoma said they had discovered the administration ’s intent in negotiations with the federal government over the last few weeks .
The federal government has leverage over states , because it pays a large share of the costs for Medicaid and the State Children ’s Health Insurance Program , and states have to comply with federal standards to get federal money .
The insurance program was created for children whose families have too much income to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance .
Fox News : Media would have skewered us for planting questions David Edwards and Jason Rhyne
Published : Sunday December 2 , 2007

This CNN is getting a free pass for selecting questioners with ties to Democrats during its recent YouTube Republican debate , according to hosts on the Fox News morning program Fox and Friends , who say their own network would have been far more harshly treated in the press had it " planted " questions in a debate .
Shortly after the Wednesday evening 's debate , bloggers discovered that one questioner , a retired gay brigadier general , was a member of a Clinton steering committee .
CNN acknowledged the connection , but said the network had not been aware , and the Clinton campaign denied planting the general .
Fox and Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson , however , suggested that the media was holding Fox News to a double standard .
" Some Democrats , most of the Democrats running for president have said 'hey we 're not going to go on Fox News to do a debate , because , well you know how we feel about Fox News , ' " she said .
" Just put that into perspective here .
Now you have this CNN debacle , and you 've got to wonder if Fox News had planted questioners at any debate that they did , what kind of trouble would we be in ?
It would be a huge , huge mainstream media story . "
The hosts pointed to right - wing blogger Michelle Malkin , who says she has identified other " planted " questioners with Democratic connections or sympathies .
" This is a problem for CNN right now , " said Kelly .
" Even when you were looking at the individuals , they did not ... it did n't seem terribly Republican .
They seemed like they were from a left - wing constituency . "
He later cautioned that there was no proof that any political campaigns had orchestrated any of the questions .
But co-host Steve Doocy agreed that the " mainstream media " would have been far harsher to Fox than it had been to CNN .
" Had Fox done it , it would have been the cover of the New York Times every day for the next month , " said Doocy .
" Why is it when we do stuff , we become fodder for the mainstream media , but when CNN does it , nothing ? "
He later asked viewers to vote on whether CNN 's chosen questioners were due to " conspiracy or incompetence . "
Later in the program , Dick Morris , a Republican strategist who formerly advised President Bill Clinton , said the debate appearance by the general was a Nixon - style " dirty trick " orchestrated by Sen. Clinton .
" You know , listen , let 's put the blame where it 's due -- this is a dirty trick by the Hillary Clinton campaign , " said Morris .
The former consultant also said he believed Clinton was behind the recent story , broken by Politico , that Rudy Giuliani obscured security expenses to disguise an extra-marital affair during his tenure as New York mayor .
In 1996 , Morris stepped down from managing President Clinton 's reelection campaign after it was revealed that he had allowed a prostitute to eavesdrop on telephone calls with the president .

A ( true ) love story to kick off the year .
I have talked to the couple and they gave me permission to tell their story .
It ’s longer than most of my postings , but I hope you ’ll take the time to read it .
…
Kate is a dyed - in - the - wool atheist .
She was raised in a non-religious home , but had relatives who were Christians .
She recalls her aunt once yelling at her mother over Christmas dinner because Kate had not been baptized .
Kate began calling herself an atheist when she was old enough to explore the issues on her own .
This was n’t a big deal in the community she lived in , where religion was kept private and most people she knew were not very religious to begin with .
Still , Kate was very outspoken about her non-belief in God .
She had a Darwin Fish symbol on the back of her car .
She admits she sometimes sought out Christians for the sole purpose of starting an argument — and she would make jokes about Christianity .
Not often , but it happened .
It was n’t until she went to college that she learned her views on religion actually put her in a minority .
When Kate moved into her dorm room her freshman year , she was greeted with cut-outs of Christian sayings that were placed on the wall .
Her religious roommate could n’t have been a more exact polar opposite to Kate .
When the roommate opened a biology textbook , she said , “ Kate , this book says that evolution is the foundation of biology ! ”
As Kate waited for more , the roommate added , “ That ’s it …
I did n’t think they were allowed to write that ! ”
As hard as they tried to get along , it was difficult .
It did n’t help that the roommate told Kate she was going to hell .
When Kate appealed to the roommate to be nicer , she responded that since she was already “ saved , ” she did n’t have to be nice .
The dorm was n’t Kate ’s only source of religious strife .
The Campus Crusade for Christ chapter was a “ large , intimidating presence ” at her university .
A separate group put up a banner in the central part of campus on April 1 .
It read : “ Happy Atheist Day : Psalm 14:1 . ”
( That verse states “ The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God . ” )
When a student ripped the poster down , it was he who was vilified , not those who put the poster up mocking non-believing students .
Kate managed to endure the Christian environment through the social support network she had back home , but that support was several hundred miles away .
Her experience with Christians finally changed during her junior year of college .
She met a guy named Erik in one of her Spanish classes and they became friends .
Though , as with many college acquaintances , once the class ended they lost touch .
They did n’t reconnect until a year later when they found each other on Facebook .
Facebook profiles give people a chance to write a short description about themselves — they can also list their religion affiliation .
Kate and Erik quickly shifted their eyes to see what the other had written in the biography field .
It was a shock for both of them .
Kate saw Bible verses on Erik ’s page .
Erik saw the phrase “ I ’m proud to be an atheist ” on Kate’s .
They decided to go out , but neither brought up what they had seen on Facebook .
However , a couple outings later , they realized just how different their views were .
Erik was a devout Christian who led a Bible study group .
Kate owned several books about atheism and later joined her campus ’s freethought group .
They wondered : could you date someone who was n’t on the same religious ( or non-religious ) path as yourself ?
Yet , as Kate and Erik got to know each other , they found that they shared interests and beliefs on just about everything outside the realm of religion .
They were becoming good friends and a tight bond was forming .
“ I was a little disappointed , since we got along so well , ” Kate said .
Not long after , they began dating , which was as surprising to them as it was for everyone who knew them .
And their relationship helped them realize how badly they were treating people who held different viewpoints .
Kate says she learned how to speak appropriately around Christians .
When she had previously heard Christians tell Bible stories , she would n’t hesitate to say , “ Do you really believe that ? ”
The implication was that most Christians were gullible .
As she began to know more about Erik , however , she discovered there were educated Christians in the world .
Erik changed as well .
Before meeting Kate , he had held the view that all atheists were the product of a bad childhood experience with religion or the result of abuse in the church .
Essentially , he believed atheists were atheists because they hated God or Christianity .
Through Kate , he learned that it was possible to be an atheist based on reasoned , logical arguments .
It was a well - thought - out system of ( non -) belief .
It was n’t always the result of a bad experience or a case of teenage rebellion .
Erik did n’t agree with the arguments , but he admits many of them do have merit .
It was a tough transition for the couple , but they began to get used to their differences .
Now try to imagine the reaction of Erik ’s parents when they found out Kate was an atheist , a month after they had met her for the first time .
“ But , Kate ca n’t be atheist ! ” said Erik ’s mom .
“ She ’s nice , and I get along with her ! ”
At the time , his parents thought his attraction to a girl who is an atheist was just a phase .
When they found out he was serious about this relationship , they attempted to stop him , telling him that if he married an atheist he would be disobeying God .
They were worried that Kate would change Erik ’s views about faith .
They just wanted what they thought was best for him .
When that did n’t seem to be working , though , they focused their energies on Kate , trying to help her accept Christ as her savior .
They told her how much they cared about her , but they were worried about her not sharing their son ’s faith .
They were also scared .
Their dream of having Christian grandchildren was slipping away .
Even worse , they were afraid they would lose their son and not see him in Heaven .
At one point , Erik stopped speaking to his parents .
He understood where his parents were coming from : he , too , had once believed that deep inside everyone wanted to be a Christian — it was just a matter of having the opportunity to hear the gospel .
It never crossed his mind that other viewpoints could have merit .
It was as if their pastor ’s reasons for believing in God had worked for Erik ’s parents , but the reasons were n’t good enough for Kate .
In church , they were taught that these types of theological conversations stopped with the proper Christian answer .
They were n’t expecting rebuttals , and when they heard them they did n’t know what to do .
Once , around the time Kate was filling out applications for graduate school , Erik ’s mom invited her over for “ girl time . ”
It was going to be just cross-stitching and tea , Kate thought .
But during the meeting , the mother brought out the Bible and began reading a verse about how God was in control of the situation .
Erik ’s mom also mentioned how she wished Kate believed in God — it would lessen her stress about the grad school applications .
Kate nodded politely , but inside she was irritated .
When Erik ’s father joined in the discussion later that evening ( as Erik says , for “ tag team evangelism ” ) , the topic turned to evolution and how the parents ’ pastor had told them it was flawed for a number of reasons .
When Kate heard the reasons , she knew exactly the proper explanations to respond with , but this time she kept her mouth shut .
It was the polite thing to do , and for Erik ’s sake she wanted to keep the peace .
His parents kept their cool .
They told Kate she was n’t a bad person .
She was a sinner just like everyone else .
However , what was an innocuous statement for them was incredibly offensive to Kate , who did not feel sinful at all .
This conversation lasted for more than five arduous hours .
( Erik describes this talk as the time his parents “ ninja evangelized . ” )
It was this type of interaction that had pushed her even further away from Christianity during college .
Several months later , his parents demanded that either Kate convert to Christianity or Erik put a stop to the relationship .
Despite these harsh words and Kate ’s belief that the parents were extremely misguided , she knew their intentions were good .
They wanted the best for her , and to their way of thinking , the best involved God .
You may wonder about Kate ’s parents ’ reaction .
Her mother told Kate not to change for Erik .
That is , if Kate became a Christian only because Erik was one , it was n’t the right reason to do so .
But her parents knew they taught Kate how to think , not what to think , so they were not worried .
Both of Kate ’s parents told her they would accept her regardless of her decisions .
It was a far cry from Erik ’s Christian home , where his parents essentially told him it was mandatory that Kate change ( if marriage was in their future ) , but it was not permissible the other way around .
Kate continued dating Erik because she knew he was different from his parents .
But how does a relationship like this last ?
If you ask Kate and Erik , they ’ll laugh and tell you they have no idea .
( That ’s not a joke ; they ’re serious . )
But it turns out they both share core values and a passion to find the truth , whatever it may be .
They also have strong communication and conflict - resolution skills .
They both strive to understand each other instead of trying to change the other .
If an interfaith relationship with two passionate people is going to work , they say , you ca n’t be under the delusion that you will change your partner .
Not when it comes to faith .
If the subject of God comes up , Kate has learned how to speak about her beliefs without making inappropriate comments .
Erik no longer speaks in “ us versus them ” terminology nor does he use phrases like “ being saved ” which carry no weight outside conservative Christianity and actually offend non-religious people .
They both also share values and morals , though the reasons for those beliefs come from different places .
Erik is more liberal on social issues and focuses on society ’s needs such as helping the poor .
He sees the Bible as the best guide book for life , not a book filled with literal truths .
As he says , he is a follower of Jesus , not the Bible .
Kate says that Erik helped her become a different kind of atheist : one who is more compassionate and understanding .
Christians are no longer “ the enemy ” for her .
She removed the Darwin Fish emblem from her car out of respect to others and stopped telling ( or laughing at ) jokes that ripped on Christians .
For them , love is conquering the barriers that arise between people with such differing beliefs .
Erik no longer sees atheists as a threat to his religion .
Instead , he sees them as people who have well - thought - out beliefs .
In fact , he says that one of the most difficult challenges to his faith has been Kate ’s continued atheism .
He believed that if non-Christians were exposed to God ’s Word , or a kind Christian who could explain it well , or at least a good church , belief in Jesus ’ divinity was unavoidable .
Kate was an exception to that unwritten rule .
Speaking of churches , they even go to them together .
( Yes , that ’s churches , plural . )
They spend time going to places of worship and discussing them afterward .
Each visit provides them with an opportunity to discuss faith ( and non-faith ) in a positive way .
Kate once visited the church of Erik ’s parents , a Baptist church where the pastor made inaccurate statements about Christianity ’s origins without providing any references to where he found this information and appeared to be hostile toward other faiths .
It was a dramatic change from another church they visited which was more contemporary and catered to young adults .
Erik had enjoyed this church at one time , attending it for nearly two years and playing a large role in the planning and operation of various ministries .
He loved their casual nature , their decision not to speak in “ Christian - ese , ” and the music they sang .
When he had visited this church more frequently , he thought it to be accessible for everyone , not just other Christians .
Eventually , it became too conservative for his tastes and the ethos of the church became combative against non-Christians .
But when he visited with Kate , he still hoped she would see it for the good it contained .
Kate was not impressed .
Erik could n’t understand it at first :
“ What I considered to be the best effort of Christianity was woefully inadequate at influencing people like Kate .
It was then that I began to see things through her eyes .
I saw how offended she was when she was depicted as being “ in the dark ” and “ lost . ”
I saw the absurdity of people who claim Christ as their Lord yet live lives of wastefulness and intolerance . ”
Both of them even went to a Unitarian Universalist church .
This time , they both had a positive experience .
It was hard to disagree with what they were hearing — the church did n’t seem to be taking a stance on the existence of God , merely how there was a need to nourish one ’s spirituality .
When discussing the beauty of nature , Erik could see it through a Christian filter ( nature was beautiful thanks to God ) .
Kate could understand nature purely through the elegance of natural selection .
Not only do they visit churches , but Erik has also attended Kate ’s campus atheist group ’s meetings .
He was surprised how , sometimes , they did n’t even discuss atheism or religion very much — they were just happy to be spending time with like - minded people .
At one group event , he saw a movie by atheist director Brian Flemming called The God Who Was n’t There .
The other students did n’t know there was a Christian in their midst .
After the movie , as Kate says , Erik “ dropped the C - bomb . ”
But the other students were n’t offended or upset .
They were curious and interested .
They had a good discussion with Erik and constantly asked his opinion on certain parts of the movie .
Of course , some of the skeptics were … well … skeptical of his motives .
However , after speaking with him , they found out he was a Christian who had given serious thought to why he held his beliefs .
He could think for himself instead of merely parroting what he had been told in a church , and they respected him for that .
Kate and Erik joke about how forcing atheists and Christians to date would bring about more peace , tolerance , and understanding .
Even without the close relationship , the idea that people with such different worldviews can get along so well is an important message in itself .
One question I had for them was how they would raise children if that time ever came .
While neither has a definite answer , they both feel like giving the child a broad range of religious experiences is the best way to go .
Erik wants to provide the child with answers from multiple sources — what mommy believes , what daddy believes , and what others believe .
Kate would prefer a more secular approach , but also understands the value of seeing the wider range of beliefs .
She wants her children to know it ’s okay that their parents have different beliefs .
Questions are also encouraged .
It wo n’t be easy , but it will have to be discussed , and they have time before the issue of children becomes a potential reality .
In the meantime , Erik is considering adding a bumper sticker on the car to replace Kate ’s old Darwin Fish .
It would read : Jesus was a liberal .

God ’s Constitution January 15 , 2008
You knew it was going to happen eventually :
That Southern Baptist preacher boy running for president has claimed he wants the Constitution to be Christian :
“ I have opponents in this race who do not want to change the Constitution , ” [ Republican Presidential candidate Mike ]
Huckabee told a Michigan audience on Monday .
“ But I believe it ’s a lot easier to change the Constitution than it would be to change the word of the living god .
And that ’s what we need to do — to amend the Constitution so it ’s in God ’s standards rather than try to change God ’s standards so it lines up with some contemporary view . ”
The beauty of smaller information websites ( i.e. just me with no staff ) is that I have an opportunity for speed that some other sites do not have .
I am , in this example , beating the Huffington Post to what will almost certainly be their predictable “ See , we told you the Christians want theocracy ! ! ” article .
Let me leave no uncertainty : I am a Christian whose theology is probably remarkably similar to that of the former Governor .
There is no theo - mongering or theophobia here .
I would like to ask a serious question .
My question is this :
Is it more unsettling that Huckabee talks about making a Christian constitution , or that he is obviously talking about something he wo n’t do ?
Think about it :
What Congress can you conceive that would allow ( and rightly so ) President Huckabee to enforce sodomy laws , adultery laws , witchcraft laws , etc etc ?
The answer : None .
Furthermore , Huckabee is discussing something which only those completely unaware of the existence of the Supreme Court could possibly believe .
“ Conservative ” judges need to be conservative in the sense that their interpretation of said Constitution is tight and strict .
I think our present court has that ; it certainly is not the kind of court to enact Biblical changes within American law code .
So we have it .
Mike Huckabee is not , in any conceivable circumstance , going to get his Biblical constitution .
Why is he telling these things to a volatile and oftentimes politically ignorant ( I say this with the love only a fellow evangelical could give ) conservative Christian crowd ?
Answer :
To win votes .
Huckabee is telling constituents what they want to hear .
It ’s politics .
The reservations I have pertain to politicking with God .
Huckabee is clearly invoking Christianity and an isssue many Christians feel strongly about in order to promote his campaign , and what he says is empty .
Is this reverance ?
Is this what God ’s standard really is for America ?
To banally recite talking points , peppered with spiritual vocabulary , in order to gain power ?
I do n’t think so .
The actual saint was not , in fact , famous for making dispirited public appearances at shopping malls .
Rather , he was known for throwing purses of gold into a man 's home in the cover of night so that the man would n't have to sell his daughters into prostitution .

So , back then Christmas was n't " get a new Xbox day . "
It was , " you do n't have to become a filthy whore day . "
While it could be argued that this basically makes Nicholas the anti-pimp , we prefer to think of him as the Bible 's answer to Travis Bickle .
Later , Martin Luther invented his own Christmas symbol , Kristkindl , as part of his rejection of all things Catholic .
What he came up with is by far the gayest of all Christmas symbols , as Kristkindl is portrayed as a " blond , radiant veiled child figure with golden wings , wearing a flowing white robe and a sparkling jeweled crown , and carrying a small Christmas tree or wand . "

This is why you sometimes hear Santa referred to as " Kris Kringle . "
Not surprisingly , most of the world has rejected his weird - ass version and over the years we 've cobbled together our own Santa Claus : part Saint Nikolas , part Sinterklaas and part Norse god Odin .
By the 19th century American writers were describing Santa as wearing a red sash with a skin - tight red suit with white spotted fur at the fringes .
He was basically all those other figures with a little Freddie Mercury thrown in .
Writers at the time were still calling Santa an " elf , " including Clement Clark Moore in his famous poem The Night Before Christmas .
Perhaps the image of a dwarf - sized intruder seemed less threatening than a Chris Farley - sized version , but we 're pretty sure we'd be more likely to piss our pants if an overly jolly costumed dwarf magically appeared and started hopping around our living room floor .
The little person might just end up with a bullet in the head .
Not that there 's anything wrong with frolicking little people with a propensity for wearing elf garb , of course .
Except that there totally is .
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer Some of you are disappointed that we explained Santa without mentioning that the modern image of him was invented for a Coca - Cola ad , as the Internet has probably told you .
That 's because it is n't true .
Come on , guys .
Not everything in the Western World is based on some crass marketing campaign .
Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer , however , is .
This signature character in Christmas folklore , with his own song and movies and a mountain of yearly merchandise , was slapped together by the Montgomery Ward marketing team for a coloring book they were giving out .
Prior to inventing Rudolph , they used to just buy the books and hand them out each Christmas , but in 1939 they figured it'd be cheaper to have one of their guys draw one up in his spare time .
It 's not like toddlers are great at detecting quality in these things .
So copywriter Robert L. May wrote it up , and created what turned out to be a marketing bonanza ... of which he did n't get paid a penny .
A few years later the company actually let May have the rights to Rudolph , which was either an act of amazing corporate generosity or else they just assumed the Rudolph fad was over .
After that , May 's brother - in - law wrote up the song that you 've no doubt heard every Christmas since you were born .
It became a huge hit and the Rudolph marketing empire was born , along with a permanent addition to the Santa legend .
That 's right ;
Europe brought their real - life saints , Norse gods and rich cultural traditions to the table , and America slapped on a promotion from a department store .
Who knows , maybe 300 years from now Santa 's sleigh will be towed by Energizer Bunnies , long after society has forgotten what an " Energizer " is .
And , maybe Santa will sport a cheap cardboard crown and a creepy frozen grin .
Making out under the mistletoe
First of all , we 'd love to know who actually puts up mistletoe in the first place .
Everybody knows about it , but does anybody actually do it ?
We only see it in sitcoms and the occasional Hall and Oates Christmas video , but we 're 99 percent sure no one actually uses it in the 21st century .
Nevertheless , people who have enough sickening Christmas spirit to purchase the plant , then find a nail , then grab a chair , then remember they forgot to get the hammer , go retrieve the hammer from the freakin ' garage , and then hang the mistletoe , might be less likely to do so if they knew the origins of the plant .
The word " mistletoe " may be derived from the old German " mist , " for dung , and " tang , " for branch .
That 's right , the shit stick .
As in , " let 's go kiss under the shit stick , baby . "
So how did people ever make the connection between the shit stick plant and romance ?
It goes back to the pagan belief that the white , sticky goo from the berries was the semen of the gods .
There was also a Norse tradition that if two warriors should meet under some mistletoe in the forest ( it 's a parasite that grows on tree branches ) that they would lay down their arms and declare peace for the day .
History does not indicate if this included sweaty , Norse man-kissing so we 're forced to assume it did .
Both the Celts and the Druids used the plant as in ceremonial rituals , and as antidotes to poison , which was unfortunate , since mistletoe is , in fact , poisonous .
But , it was the English who finally made mistletoe part of the holiday tradition .
They used to cut a sprig of it from the previous year 's holiday greens , then hang it in the house in some sort of voodoo attempt to ward off lightning and evil spirits .
Somehow all of that ridiculousness combined to create the " girl has to kiss you " tradition as it exists today ( again , mostly on sitcoms ) .
The invaluable American addition to the tradition is , of course , the drunken male placing the mistletoe over his crotch .
Again , give it another couple centuries and that 'll be the standard .

It is a scientific icon , which belongs , some claim , alongside E=mc2 and the double helix .
Its name - the Keeling Curve - may be scarcely known outside scientific circles , but the jagged upward slope showing rising carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) levels in the atmosphere has become one of the most famous graphs in science , and a potent symbol of our times .
It was 50 years ago that a young American scientist , Charles David Keeling , began tracking CO2 in the Earth 's atmosphere at two of the world 's last wildernesses - the South Pole and the summit of the Mauna Loa volcano in Hawaii .
His very precise measurements produced a remarkable data set , which first sounded alarm bells over the build - up of the gas in the atmosphere , and eventually led to the tracking of greenhouse gases worldwide .
The curve set the scene for the debate over climate change , and policies , sometimes controversial , that address the human contribution to the greenhouse effect .
Without this curve , and Professor Keeling 's tireless work , there is no question that our understanding and acceptance of human - induced global warming would be 10 - 20 years less advanced than it is today
Dr Andrew Manning , UEA " It was n't until Keeling came along and started measuring CO2 that we got the evidence that CO2 was increasing from human activities , " says Professor Andrew Watkinson , director of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of East Anglia ( UEA ) , UK .
" The graph is iconic from a climate perspective . "
Dr Alistair Manning of the UK Met Office agrees .
" It was the first real indication that CO2 levels were rising , " he says .
" That therefore started scientists thinking about the impact such a change would have on the climate . "
' Tireless work ' Back in the 1950s , when Keeling began his experiments , no - one knew whether the CO2 released from the burning of fossil fuels ( coal , oil / petroleum and natural gas ) would end up in the atmosphere or be fully absorbed by oceans and forests .
Keeling had to work hard to justify his work " The goal behind starting the measurements was to see if it was possible to track what at that time was only a suspicion : that atmospheric CO2 levels might be increasing owing to the burning of fossil fuels , " explains biogeochemist Dr Andrew Manning , also from the UEA , who worked with Professor Keeling in the 1990s .
" To do this , a location was needed very far removed from the contamination and pollution of local emissions from cities ; therefore Mauna Loa , high on a volcano in the middle of the Pacific Ocean was chosen .
" Without this curve , and Professor Keeling 's tireless work , there is no question that our understanding and acceptance of human - induced global warming would be 10 - 20 years less advanced than it is today , " adds Dr Manning .
Sleepless nights Professor Keeling discovered that carbon dioxide was rising continuously and that there were annual fluctuations in carbon in the atmosphere ( the little squiggles on the line ) , caused by seasonal variations in plant growth and decay .
When he started his measurements in 1958 , CO2 levels were around 315 ppmv ( parts per million by volume - that is 315 molecules of CO2 for every one million molecules in the air ) ; by the year 2005 they had risen to about 378 ppmv .
Yet despite the importance we place on climate change research today , Professor Keeling , known as Dave to friends and colleagues , struggled to secure funding for his monitoring efforts .
The work focussed attention on the impact of greenhouse emissions " Dave Keeling suffered many sleepless nights , even as late as in the 1990s , being forced again and again to justify continued funding of his programme , " recalls Dr Manning .
" The fact that we are celebrating 50 years now is due purely to his incredible perseverance , courage and optimism . "
He says the technical , analytical and logistical challenges of the work are enormous .
" To measure such tiny changes in the composition of the air , high on a remote mountain top in the middle of the Pacific Ocean is extremely challenging even today in the 21st Century , " he explains .
" That Dave Keeling was able to successfully begin and continue such highly demanding measurements in the 1950s is a tribute to his brilliance . "
Detailed monitoring Today , carbon dioxide levels are sampled weekly at about 100 sites around the world .
Flasks filled with air are taken to a laboratory , where they are analysed for carbon dioxide , other greenhouse gases and pollutants .
Aircraft collect similar samples at higher altitude , while space - borne sensors detect some gases remotely throughout the atmosphere .
Monitoring efforts continue atop the Mauna Loa volcano " Without the fifty - year carbon dioxide record , we would n't understand the cause of the climate change we are observing today , " says James Butler , deputy director of The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( Noaa ) Earth System Research Laboratory .
" The carbon dioxide record has allowed us to connect the dots between increasing fossil fuel emissions and a warmer world . "
Charles Keeling died in 2005 , aged 77 .
He continued his research into carbon dioxide at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego , US , until his final day .
By then he had authored nearly 100 research articles and had received the National Medal of Science - the US 's highest award for lifetime achievement in scientific research .
His son , Professor Ralph Keeling , also a geochemist at Scripps , continues his work .
TIMELINE : carbon monitoring 1957 : Charles David Keeling starts work monitoring CO2 at the South Pole and Mauna Loa Observatory , Hawaii 1958 : Keeling starts first direct continuous atmospheric measurements of CO2 Early 1970s : Noaa , the US federal agency , starts monitoring CO2 worldwide 1995 - 2003 : Noaa 's Earth System Research Laboratory ( ESRL ) at Boulder , Colorado , develops and maintains the world 's standard references for CO2 and other greenhouse gases

aaaaaaaaaDeveloping Story : Obama accused of taking a cab ride with a Muslim in 2006
Claim : A study undertaken by the World Health Organization concluded that natural blondes are likely to be extinct within 200 years .
FALSE
Origins : Some
factoids are just too intriguing , their hold on our imaginations too tenacious , for us to let go of them — no matter how often or how thoroughly they may be debunked .
One such factoid , about a scientific study ’s supposedly predicting that the naturally blonde - haired segment of the human population will die out within the next few centuries , gets trotted out when something prompts a mention of blondes in news stories .
Take , for example , this concluding paragraph from a Sunday Times article about the origins of blonde hair :
A study by the World Health Organisation found that natural blonds are likely to be extinct within 200 years because there are too few people carrying the blond gene .
According to the WHO study , the last natural blond is likely to be born in Finland during 2202 .
As factoids go , this one is generally accompanied by a fair amount of detail , such as :
The name of the group that conducted the study — the World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
The reasons why blondes are headed towards extinction — because blonde hair is produced by a recessive gene , and because “ bottle blondes ” are more attractive to men than natural blondes and are therefore more likely to be chosen as mating partners .
blonde hair is produced by a recessive gene , and because “ bottle blondes ” are more attractive to men than natural blondes and are therefore more likely to be chosen as mating partners .
Exactly when and where the extinction will occur — the last blonde will probably be born in Finland around the year 2202 .
( Finland is named because it ’s claimed to be the country with the highest proportion of natural blondes , and the year 2202 is cited because the putative study was conducted in 2002 and predicted blondes would “ die out within 200 years . ” )
But all that detail ca n’t make up for the fact that the WHO never announced or conducted any such study .
The “ blondes are going extinct ” factoid sprang from a spate of news stories that were aired by major news outlets in September 2002 ( such as BBC News ) and attributed the information to “ a study by the World Health Organization ” or the even more vague source of “ experts in Germany . ”
As the Washington Post noted shortly afterwards , the source of the story appeared to be an article of questionable provenance published in a German women ’s magazine two years earlier :
The World Health Organization says there is no such study — and that most journalists did n’t call to check .
The World Health Organization says there is no suchthat most journalists did n’t call to check .
“ We ’ve certainly never conducted any research into the subject , ” WHO spokeswoman Rebecca Harding said from Geneva .
“ It ’s been impossible to find out where it came from .
It just seems like it was a hoax . ”
The health group traced the story to an account on a German wire service , which in turn was based on a two - year - old article in the German women ’s magazine Allegra , which cited a WHO anthropologist .
Harding could find no record of such a man working for the WHO .
Harding says the WHO made no attempt to contact the news outlets that went with the bogus report but decided to issue a news release yesterday .
“ Honestly , we have better things to spend our time on , ” she said .
Where did the “ blonde extinction ” idea originate ?
Normally we ’d be tempted to chalk it up to the work of an anonymous prankster , or expect to find it began as yet another Weekly World News story that made the jump from a supermarket tabloid to the mainstream news media , but we were surprised to discover the notion of blondes ’ being completely supplanted by brunettes has been bouncing around for a very long time .
For starters , we learned that in 1961 a number of newspapers reported a similar study predicting blondes might be disappearing from most parts of the world within 50 to 140 years :
Blondes Are in Global Fade - Out Blondes — real and bottled — are disappearing on a worldwide scale at increasingly rapid rates , according to a scientific study made in France .
Natural blondes , the kind gentlemen prefer most , may be extinct in 50 years , The Insider ’s Newsletter reports .
Though nobody knows why , the International Committee for Demographic Studies , which made the study , believes the trend is related to Darwin ’s “ survival of the fittest ” law .
Blondes are believed to be more fragile than brunettes who are better able to adjust to climatic and other environmental changes .
Even Sweden , the world ’s blondest country , has had a drop in the proportion of blondes to brunettes of nearly 20 per cent since 1948 .
The committee predicts that by the year 2100 Swedish blondes may be a rarity and that the golden girl will be virtually extinct in the rest of the world .
The decline of the natural blonde has been paralleled by the “ evaporation ” of girls with bottled yellow tresses .
Several years ago one in three French girls was a peroxide blonde .
Today the proportion is closer to one in six .
Stylists , noting a trend toward coloring the hair in dark shades , say western women are entering a “ brunette cycle ” certain to last a decade or more .
Going back even further , we find the same concept being expressed in 1906 , with this example anticipating the demise of blondes within the next 600 years :
BLONDES DOOMED TO VANISH FROM EARTH Major Woodruff Sounds Their Deathknell —
It ’s Science .
The girl with the golden tresses is doomed , and within six hundred years blondes will be extinct .
The fate of the blonde was foretold today by Major C. E. Woodruff in a lecture at the Association for Advancement of Science at Columbia university .
The major said the blondes were on the toboggan and were scheduled to disappear in six centuries .
The gallant major said her peroxide sister might endure , but the real twenty - two karat blonde would be only known in history in future ages .
Major Woodruff said science might discover some method of controlling the color of hair .
Backing up further still , we find evidence that the possible extinction of blondes was a subject of discussion in the 19th century as well , with this 1890 article anticipating their downfall due to a stronger male preference for brunettes as matrimonial partners :
THE BLONDES DISAPPEARING
Condition of Affairs the Government Should Investigate Blondes are said to be disappearing both in Engand and America , says the Illustrated American .
Persons who can look back half a century unite in declaring that there is a marked change in this respect .
For every red - haired person seen now , 10 could have been met with 20 years back .
In New England we are told the blonde has well - nigh disappeared .
In New York a reporter recently made an interesting experiment which any one who doubts it may repeat .
In the course of 15 minutes ’ walk on Broadway he counted 200 women , young and old , with hair ranging from a medium brown to the darkest shades which all but artists call black .
He passed only 13 women of the pronounced blonde type .
Three of these had red hair , and the hair of two had apparently been bleached .
At the theatre the same evening he scrutinized 50 women within easy range , and only six had fair skins , blue eyes and light hair .
They sat surrounded by a bevy of dark women , who gave its prevailing tone to the complexion of the house .
The public schools yielded a similar result .
One class of 80 girls had eight blondes among them , another of 65 had 16 , a third of 57 had only seven .
Another observer hazards the statement that not more than 10 per cent of New York women are blondes .
“ Go anywhere where pretty girls congregate , and you meet tall , striking - looking figures with dark hair and big , dark eyes .
The blondes are disappearing .
And why ? ”
Science steps in with an explanation .
Dr. Beddoes of the British Royal Infirmary in London declares that after examining the hair of nearly 1000 young women who came before his notice , he has arrived at the conclusion that in matrimony the brunette was preferred over the blonde in the ratio of three to two , and so , gradually but surely , through the selection of dark women for wives and through the hereditary transmission of brunette traits , the blondes become extinct .
This excerpt from an 1865 article approving of recent Parisian fashion changes favoring the blonde look dates rumors concerning the extinction of the fair - haired to at least as far back as the American Civil War :
GOLDEN HAIR
Not long ago , the admirers of blue eyes and fair hair were disgusted by certain wise men announcing that the blonde was becoming rapidly extinct , failing to hold her own even in her native North .
Let them take heart and rejoice , and laugh to scorn the evil prophecies of Darwinian doctrinaires .
Fashion , in Paris , has determined to thwart the disciples of the new school , and set natural selection at defiance , and the fiat has gone forth that the blonde is the true type of beauty , and golden your only hair .
Amber - colored locks are literally worth their weight in gold , and all the hair - markets of Europe are being ransacked to enable Parisian belles to witch mankind with beauty not their own , except by right of purchase .
No matter how old and ingrained this extinction belief may be , however , blondes and blonde - lovers probably need not fear the imminent demise of natural blondeness .
Most scientists asked to comment on the faux study in recent years have opined that although the proportion of blondes in the population might decrease a bit in coming years , it wo n’t drop to zero any time in the foreseeable future .

Volunteers with no background in art theory were shown an original image of a sculpture , Doryphoros by Polykleitos ( center ) as well as distorted versions ( left and right ) .
The original obeys the golden ratio , a mathematical figure often found in nature that Renaissance artists thought embodied ideal beauty .
The original activated certain sets of brain cells more than the distorted versions , suggesting the brain judges beauty by at least partly hard - wired standards .
Is art beautiful because we are taught so , or are notions of beauty hard - wired into the brain ?
When people were shown pictures of sculptures in a new study , brain scans suggest they judged beauty by at least partly hard - wired standards .
Researchers in Italy showed volunteers original and distorted images of Classical and Renaissance sculptures .
The scientists picked 14 volunteers with no experience in art theory to try to see what role pure biology had to do with judging art .
The golden ratio
The proportions of the statues themselves reflect " the golden ratio , " a mathematical figure known since ancient Greece that Renaissance artists often thought embodied ideal beauty .
In nature , the golden ratio can be found in the way nautilus shells curve or how seeds spiral on strawberries .
It describes hurricanes , galaxies and the flight pattern of a falcon on the hunt .
Specifically , the golden ratio is equal to roughly 1.618 .
It is unique in that its value is equal to the ratio of its integer part to its fractional part — that is , 1.618 is roughly equal to 1 divided by 0.618 .
In art , the golden ratio has arguably been found in the Parthenon in Athens , the Great Pyramid of Giza and the Mona Lisa .
Strong reactions
The proportions of the sculptures in the study followed the golden ratio .
And the original images of them strongly activated sets of brain cells that the distorted images did not — including the insula , a brain structure that mediates emotions .
" We were very surprised that very small modifications to images of the sculptures led to very strong modifications in brain activity , " researcher Giacomo Rizzolatti , a neuroscientist at the University of Parma , told LiveScience .
In addition , instead of asking volunteers to simply enjoy these pictures , the researchers also had them judge how beautiful or ugly each was .
The images thought of as beautiful activated the right amygdala , a brain structure that responds to memories laden with emotional value .
( The original images were often judged by the test subjects as more beautiful than distorted ones . )
The results indicate that the sense of beauty is based on hard - wired notions triggered in the insula and one 's experiences , and then activated in the amygdala .
Still , the scientists caution the findings cannot necessarily be generalized across cultures .
" We only know that Classical and Renaissance art is generally considered beautiful in Western culture , " said researcher Cinzia Di Dio , a neuroscientist at the University of Parma .
" It would be interesting to propose a similar study across cultures to see whether these principles are universal or culture - bound . "
Remaining questions
Future work can also investigate how the brains of art experts respond , the researchers said .
In addition , experiments could try showing artwork other than sculptures to subjects — for instance , paintings .
The study leaves an interesting open question :
When a given trend in art fades , can any examples of such work survive " without a resonance induced by some biologically inherent parameters ? "
Di Dio asked .
The scientists detailed their work online Nov. 20 in the journal PLoS ONE .

Sky News sources tonight claimed that Anne Darwin had confessed to knowing her husband was alive during that period .
John Darwin was arrested in Basingstoke , Hampshire , where he was staying at the home of his son Anthony , 29 .
Darwin , from Cleveland , walked into a London police station on Saturday appearing tanned and claiming to be a missing person who had lost his memory .
Cleveland Police , who are leading the investigation , said they would be examining photographs that allegedly show Darwin with his wife in Panama City in July 2006 .
Detective Superintendent Tony Hutchinson said : " That is one line of inquiry we will be following . "
But he added : " Photographs can be doctored . "
A couple named John and Anne were shown on the Move to Panama website with the firm 's boss , Mario Vilar .
Vilar has said they did not use the surname Darwin .
Hutchinson said police had no immediate plans to extradite Anne Darwin or to travel to Panama to interview her .
Hutchinson said Darwin 's reappearance had " raised a lot of questions " .
He said : " We needed to speak to John Darwin - clearly it 's only right and proper that we spoke to him under caution . "
He confirmed that Darwin would be medically examined .
" He may have been suffering from amnesia for five and half years , " he said .
Hutchinson made a public appeal for information , telling reporters : " We want to piece together exactly where he 's been since he went missing in 2002 . "
Asked whether the investigation was being led by the media , Hutchinson said journalists had more " latitude " than the police , and added : " The press have certainly been providing us with a lot of information . "
Hutchinson confirmed that the police had been told of a possible financial link between Darwin and Panama three months ago .
Anne Darwin yesterday told reporters she had believed her husband dead and had claimed in " good faith " on his life insurance .
She moved to Panama City six weeks ago after selling the couple 's two homes in Seaton Carew , but has now said she hopes to fly back to Britain to see her husband .
Yesterday the force appealed for anyone who had lived near or worked with John Darwin in the last five years to contact them .
He disappeared after paddling out to sea in a red canoe in Seaton Carew , near Hartlepool .
The following year an inquest was held into his assumed death .
Anne Darwin , 55 , had initially said she first heard from her husband in a phone call on Saturday night .
When he came on the line he told her he could not remember anything since a holiday to Norway in 2000 .
" There must have been an accident when he went out on the canoe .
He must have hit his head or something , " she told reporters .
She said the insurance payouts that she claimed " in good faith " after her husband was declared dead by a coroner in 2003 may now have to be repaid .
John Darwin worked as a science and maths teacher , then for a bank and , at the time of his disappearance , was a prison officer at Holme House jail , Stockton - on - Tees .

BBC News , Mumbai
The statue was unveiled on 12 January
They say the posterior of the bull , placed at the footsteps of the exchange building , points towards the traders which makes it inauspicious .
It has been a tough time for financial markets around the world with bourses being volatile recently .
Brokers in Mumbai have been hard hit with the sharp falls in share prices .
This has left them extremely concerned and worried .
Symbol of optimism
Some of the Bombay brokers are convinced that the root of all their troubles lies with the five - foot - tall bronze bull .
They want the religious experts to consult astrological charts to see if its rear end should point in a more auspicious direction .
The bronze bull - a symbol of this market 's optimism and previously soaring fortunes - was put in place on 12 January by the Bombay Stock Exchange 's management team .
Unfortunately for them , it coincided with some of the worst falls in Indian shares in recent years .
When contacted by the BBC , the exchange said it had no plans for now to seek astrological advice on the bull .
India Business Report is broadcast repeatedly every Sunday on BBC World .
Talk about the ultimate iPhone hack .
Mobile Complete , a software - services company , has pulled an iPhone to pieces and lashed it to a remote - controlled server .
Every input and output on the dissected iPhone is electrically hooked up to the net , providing access to would - be iPhone programmers over the web .
" It 's all occurring electrically on the handset , " says Faraz Syed , CEO of Mobile Complete .
" They are surprisingly reliable and robust , even though they look like we 've cut them open and killed them . "
The service , called DeviceAnywhere , offers about a thousand disassembled cell phones of every description running 24/ 7 for real - time remote testing .
It ’s a boon to developers who must test their work cross-platform and cross-carrier , but are unwilling to spend a small fortune on handsets and contracts .
When Apple releases its iPhone software developers kit in February next year , Mobile Complete will be ready .
It 's already figured out how to tap into the machine 's multi- touch display and accelerometer .
But for now , the remote iPhones will be configured for Apple - sanctioned web - based development only .
There 's one iPhone already hooked to the net .
Three more are coming only in the near future , and the company is planning to add more in time for Apple 's February SDK .
Every input and output on the dissected iPhone is electrically hooked up to the net , providing access to would - be iPhone programmers over the web .
It can even be used to call for pizza .
Screenshot : Courtesy of Mobile Complete " Apple 's announcement underscores the need for innovative mobile testing and development tools , especially to create applications for the iPhone , a device that is so different than other mobile devices , " Syed says .
Backed by Motorola , the DeviceAnywhere service appears to be unique .
According to phone programmers , only Nokia has a similar remote - testing system for its phones , but it offers less functionality .
The DeviceAnywhere system seems to be popular with the cellular industry .
All the major carriers , and device makers Sony Ericsson , Motorola and Palm are among the company 's clients , partners and investors .
The client roster spreads beyond the handset industry to big entertainment and game developers , including AOL , Disney , Electronic Arts and ESPN .
The racks of Mobile Complete 's cell phones are presented to the programmer as an onscreen replica , but they function just as they would in the flesh – because that 's exactly what 's happening , albeit at a distance .
And in lots of little pieces .
The service 's online - collaboration tool presents a sequence of screen grabs from the test phone , useful for recording a sequence of events or creating an audit trail .
Screenshot : Courtesy of Mobile CompleteButtons may be pressed and dials turned .
Flip phones may be flipped .
Batteries may be removed and USB cables hooked up .
It does n't physically happen , but the phone 's hardware – hooked up to The Matrix – does n't know any better .
" We 've turned the table on the machines , " jokes Mobile Complete spokesman James David .
" At least until they turn them on us . "
" The iPhone was the most challenging handset we 've added , " says David .
" As soon as Apple opens it up , there 's going to be a rush to develop . "
Racks of other cell phones are set up at well - connected co-locations in San Francisco and New York , as well as in London and other European cities .
Phone access is sold in packages , by the hour .
For example , one might buy access to Sprint 's entire current lineup , or only those that include a Java runtime .
Access to the phones starts at about $ 200 , and runs to $ 17 an hour and up .
" There 's no substitute for the real thing , " says Java developer Carlos Enrique Ortiz , who used DeviceAnywhere on recent projects .
" But that 's the wrong question to ask .
DeviceAnywhere will make sure your app will run across the gamut of devices and network carriers you do n't have access to . "
It 's not just developers who like the service .
Chris Arens , director of marketing at mobile - marketing firm Ad Infuse , says his company has used it for a year as a way to demo its service and show ad agencies how its work appears in the flesh .
" We have to test mobile ads on as many carriers as we possibly can , " says Arens .
" There 's so many out there , it would be impossible to do it in an individual level . "
In the early days , Ad Infuse took photos of phones displaying its ads and dumped the pictures into PowerPoint presentations .
Now it can quickly perform real - world ad validation for every network and handset in North America and Western Europe .

The system also includes the ability to rent time on rare , prototype handsets before they become publicly available .
All the phone 's inputs and outputs can be recorded and pored over frame by frame , using online collaboration tools .
Tomas Zeman , of Czech mobile game developer Cotopia , said in a blog post that it's a great service , but " quite expensive . "
" Their tool is ideal for testing , " he says .
" We do n't need fast graphics , and their remote phones have SIM cards , so we can test even the network latency . "
Mobile Complete claims about 8,000 to 9,000 individual developers .
The client application is written in Java and runs on any virtual machine , allowing Linux and OS X to develop using the same software as Windows developers .
" The company is a very technology - driven company , " Syed says .
" We 've invented a very unique approach . "
It ’s not uncommon nowadays to drive down a street and play the “ Guess a number between 1 and 10 ” game .
The winner ?
The person who picks the correct number of “ For Sale ” signs on that street .
The loser ?
The homeowner .
Foreclosure can be a terrifying ordeal and it all starts with that one piece of paper in the mail reminding you of your failure to make your last payment .
The Arizona Republic reports that in Gilbert and Ahwatukee , homeowners were hit especially hard .
However , other areas were also heavily affected .
Foreclosure notices in Gilbert and Ahwatukee Foothills jumped 240 percent in the first six months compared with the same period a year earlier , as more homeowners struggle to afford the higher - priced homes in these communities .
Other areas of the Southeast Valley also were hit hard , especially in the south .
Notices jumped 183 percent in Chandler and Sun Lakes , 116 percent in Mesa , and 97 percent in Tempe , according to the Information Market .
Foreclosure notices mean homeowners are at least three months behind in their mortgage payments but do n’t necessarily mean a foreclosure will follow .
Homeowners are struggling throughout the Phoenix area .
It has become harder to sell homes , and lenders have tightened their standards and are less likely to allow refinancing .
The Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service said about 19,000 homes were on the market in June in the Southeast Valley , with 1,973 selling , taking an average of 90 days .
Why Are There So Many Foreclosures About To Take Place ?
As most agents and speculators have been saying :
“ The majority were investors , and those who bought late in the cycle and they overbought , ” Kramer said .
“ They got late into the game , and they did n’t do their homework .
They got a little greedy . ”
One of the agents asked also goes on to mention :
… the real estate market eventually will recover .
Of course , at the moment .. defining “ eventually ” is task nobody wants to bet their next commission check on .
Still , unlike in Michigan , the other state that defied the Democratic National Committee and went ahead with an early primary , the names of Mrs. Clinton , Mr. Obama and a third candidate , John Edwards , a former North Carolina senator , are on the ballots that Floridians saw when early voting started 15 days before the primary and on absentee ballots that were distributed as early as Dec. 15 .
The Democratic surge here is hardly taking place in a vacuum .
Mrs. Clinton has a network of supporters , including elected officials , who have organized get - out - the - vote efforts and are planning statewide victory parties .
One prominent Clinton supporter , Gerald W. McEntee , the president of the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , was headed here this weekend to urge union members to turn out for Mrs. Clinton .
“ We have 26,000 members and we probably have a like amount of retirees there , ” Mr. McEntee said by telephone .
“ We are going to have three or four meetings and give our pitch in terms of Hillary Clinton and ask them to be active in the remaining days of the campaign with the specific focus of trying to bring out three our four neighbors next Tuesday . ”
Mrs. Clinton is scheduled to fly here on Sunday for two fund - raisers .
Although the events are not open to the press or public  her aides said she would attend no public event that would result in her breaking her word  her arrival here the day after the South Carolina vote seems likely to produce coverage on Florida television stations and newspapers on the day before the vote .
On Friday , her campaign issued a statement saying that she would urge her delegates at the Democratic convention this summer to seat the Florida delegation .
Even as Mr. Obama ’s advisers have sought to play down the results , his campaign has bought television time on national networks that has been hard to miss on Florida television stations .
Grass - roots groups who say they are operating independently of Mr. Obama ’s headquarters in Chicago have also been organizing across the state , trying to encourage support for him .
Terry Watson , who heads one of the grass - roots groups , said his organization handed out thousands of leaflets promoting Mr. Obama and asked Floridians to vote for him at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day parade in St. Petersburg last Monday .
Mr. Watson said his group was “ the largest grass - roots organization ” in the state and was preparing to help Mr. Obama should he win the presidential nomination .
Mrs. Clinton ’s aides are hoping that , delegates or not , the attention paid to a potential big victory in Florida , the nation ’s fourth - largest state , if not as prominent as a victory in other states to date , will at least give her a public relations boost heading into Feb. 5 , and will mitigate their defeat Saturday in South Carolina .
Coming to Django from the PHP - world , running a local development server ( as opposed to Apache or a full LAMP - machine set up for just testing ) and doing real offline development is something that takes a little bit of learning .
After two years of active development with Django , I 'd like to share some of my learnings .
Why Offline ?
There are many benefits for developing your site someplace other than the same server which powers the site .
I 'm sure most of us do development this way .
Generally speaking offline development could mean any development that does n't happen on the production server .
The meaning for offline development in this article is more literal : by offline I mean literally offline , that is without [ requiring ] a connection to the Web .
A well configured development environment helps you write better code efficiently — anywhere .
On a side note , do n't blame me if you end up coding Django your whole winter vacation at an idyllic remote cottage ;)
Best Practices
In the same way that Django lets you separate models , templates and views , it also lets you easily separate production and testing environments .
Django also offers several tools for local development , such as the built in Web server and DEBUG - mode .
In short , Django encourages you to follow best practices .
One thing that I 've been trying to unlearn is the PHP - esque way of doing small modifications on the production server and at the same time accidentally breaking the site from two other places .
Luckily when using Apache and modpython the lure of doing this is a bit smaller because every modification to a python file needs a server restart .
By keeping the development strictly off the production server , the probability of breaking something on the live site reduces significantly .
( Because you _do want to test your changes before deploying , right ? )
Loosely related to local development is version control .
When working with version control , you generally do n't want to check in non-functional code .
That means that you must test the code before you check it in .
Having a local development environment helps with this :)
Prepare Your Site — Thoroughly
I 've been doing web development for nearly ten years now .
Everything I do goes trough dedicated testing servers and version control .
I 've always thought my sites to be well prepared for offline development .
Then , in spring 2007 , I had some problems switching ISPs and I was cut off from web for two weeks .
( What a long two weeks they were :)
Turns out this was a very good thing since I discovered tons of problems while trying to work really offline .
Use the Settings , Luke
Using different settings for development and production makes it possible to do truly offline development .
At work we keep different settings for every development machine in the project - root and separate them by naming convention of settings - hostname.py and settings - production .py .
We then symlink the appropriate settings on the machine as settings.py and everything Just Works .
You might also want to learn to keep things portable .
Furthermore , there is a good tip in Django documentation about limiting serving static files to DEBUG=True .
The given example is a bit un -DRY , though .
And it also adds the static url as last element of the URLconf , which sometimes just does n't work .
Here is what I use :
from django.conf.urls .defaults import * from django.conf import settings if settings .
DEBUG : # Serve all local files from MEDIA_ROOT below / localmedia / urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ( r ' ^ localmedia / ( ? P< path > . * ) $ ' , ' django.views.static.serve ' , { ' document_root ' : settings .MEDIA_ROOT , ' show_indexes ' : True } ) , ) else : urlpatterns = patterns ( '' , ) urlpatterns += patterns ( '' , # your urlpatterns here )
I do n't like the else - part because it looks ugly , but it works .
Point is that you want to add the media path as a first urlpattern so it wo n't get overwritten by any of your other urls .
Also remember to configure INTERNAL_IPS so you 'll get debug - variable to your templates .
This template snippet is a good example how to use that debug data .
In addition to these built - in settings , I also use a custom LOCALDEV boolean for explicitly handling situations that may not work well without internet connection .
This way I can just ignore things that should do something over the web when I want without breaking the site .
( Ie. if DEBUG and LOCALDEV , do n't fetch this over the Web but use this fixed variable instead , etc . )
The combination of these two settings add up to very easy to use and flexible development environment .
Avoid Hardcoding Media Files
For me , most typical problems with offline development come from media links ( that is links to images , CSS and JavaScript ) .
Often these files are stored on a separate server(s ) , like recommended in Django documentation .
Instead of hardcoding the links ( relative or absolute ) to media files , you should use your settings file and let Django take care of the rest .
If you 're using SVN - version of Django , you probably already have a default context processor that sets MEDIA_URL in your RequestContext .
If you 're using older version of Django , here is how to do this yourself :
# myprojects/misc/mediacontext.py from django.conf import settings def media_url ( request ) : " " " Returns MEDIA_URL url to context . " " " return { ' MEDIA_URL ' : settings .MEDIA_URL } # and in settings.py TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS
= ( " django.core.context_processors.auth " , " django.core.context_processors.debug " , " django.core.context_processors.i18n " , " myproject.misc.mediacontext.media_url " )
Now you have MEDIA_URL variable in all your templates that have been rendered with RequestContext instance .
Generic views use RequestContext , but unfortunately helpers like render_to_response use Context , not RequestContext , so we 're out of luck there .
Luckily these kind of things are really easy to come by in Django .
One easy solution is to use a simple wrapper to render_to_response method .
To get your media links work offline , just put MEDIA_URL it in front of any media links like this : < img src= " {{ MEDIA_URL }}images/myimage.png " alt= " " /> .
That way the media links Just Work — also offline ( if you have the needed media files locally on your machine , of course ) .
Note that this technique works only for content that is rendered via Djangos template - engine .
This means that with CSS - files , for example , you have to separate the parts that have media URLs in them and render them with Django templates .
This works great for medium and small sites , but on a high - volume sites you 'll definitely want to make different arrangements to let those static elements be delivered via a separate media server .
Use Sample Data
Local developing means also that you do n't have access to the production database .
It 's often necessary to have some data in the database before you can do any development at all .
Django provides you a way for setting basic initial data automatically after syncdb - command , and it also helps you move all your data across different databases via fixtures .
A fixture is a collection of data that Django knows how to import into a database .
You can export your whole production ( Django - ) database ( or just one app ) to a fixture with dumpdata - command .
You can then move this fixture to your local machine and import it with loaddata .
This way you can easily make copies of your production database and use them in your local development .
I 've found two compelling reasons for using fixtures with development :
Using a copy of real data from a live production server in development is great because that way you 'll be able to work with those kind of inputs from real users that you 'd never dream up writing yourself in your tests — before something breaks and you have to .
It also feels nice to work on a site with real content instead of endless lorem ipsum paragraphs .
Also , lately I 've been developing small sites entirely offline and deployed them via fixtures ; I start up with an empty site , test and iterate it offline , add data and finally dump it ( mostly from sqlite ) , and then load it to MySQL or PostgreSQL on the production server .
Being able to move data easily from one database backend to another is great !
Conclusions
Offline - development is all about agility and portability .
By keeping things not dependent on any specific database , media server or development machine , you 're giving yourself more freedom .
In addition to easier development , portability adds to easier deployment , too .
Django provides great tools for fully offline - development .
Hopefully this post gave you some ideas why you 'd want to do it .
I 've been trying to better my own developing practices with Django for over two years .
I 've learned a lot , but I also believe that there 's still much to learn .
Your tips and experiences are more than welcome in the comments !
Zed 's rant triggered some patently false anti-Ruby memes that have now been bouncing around the programming blogsphere echo chamber for a few weeks .
Disturbingly so .
It 's time to put a bullet to the head of the idea that Ruby is experiencing a widespread backlash , that it was just a fad , or that it is inferior to competing technologies such as Groovy .
As far as I can tell , the originators of these ideas are people that betray agendas against the success of Ruby and / or Ruby on Rails .
Specifically , I 'm calling one of them out by name :
Daniel Spiewak ( for being a liar )
His post , The End of the Ruby Fad ?
really set me off and was the final straw that made me write this post .
As a community , I do n't think we can just let the FUD and lies perpetuate unchecked .
Daniel 's post in question is full of wrong - headed opinions , but it also has lies in it that I believe are specific enough to be called out as willful deception :
Daniel : " Ruby posts to link sites like DZone or Reddit get voted down before they have a chance to see the light of day . "
Simply browse the ruby links on programming .
reddit.com or the list of over 2000 ruby - related links on DZone to disprove that lie .
My contention , which I think is fairly obvious to people on this side of the Ruby / Anti-Ruby divide , is that the people echoing the Ruby backlash theme are all folks with entrenched anti-Ruby stances and agendas .
There are no neutral observers chiming in on the matter .
It 's the same old FUD , repackaged :
Daniel : " ... while Ruby may not be suitable for an enterprise level , high - traffic web application , "
Peter Cooper of RubyInside calls him out on that one better than I could hope to do so :
Peter : " You say you do n’t like the hype or the backlash , but then you come out with this sort of vague non-statement to keep the fire burning .
Any language “ may ” or may not be suitable for any task , but you seem to be implying in the context here that Ruby is “ not ” suitable for developing enterprise level , high - traffic Web applications without actually going the whole hog and just saying it .
In any case , this , of course , is not true .
At least , it ’s no more true for Ruby than it is for Python , Perl , PHP , or Scala , say . "
What about the most general of facts , about the nature of Ruby itself as a programming language ?
Daniel : " ( Ruby is ) hardly a general - purpose language , so it could never replace Java and company . "
Ruby is by definition , a general - purpose language .
( Wikipedia makes a contrast between domain - specific and general - purpose languages . )
You have to question the actual knowledge of someone making such blatantly wrong assertions .
In other words , does Daniel know what the hell he 's talking about ?
He answers that question himself in the comment trail :
Daniel : " It has been pointed out that my " Rails " example is quite foolish and naive .
This is absolutely true . "
Oh the irony !
How folksy and cute to write blatant crap in your blog , enjoy the publicity and then admit that you knew it was crap to begin with .
To that I say " UNACCEPTABLE ! "
Even his rhetoric is faulty , like this plainly false categorization of developers :
Daniel : " Developers these days fall into two camps : those who have heard the hype and rejected what it stands for , and developers who are totally carried away by the emotion of the fad . "
Maybe not technically a lie , more of an opinion , but certainly bad rhetoric .
There is a huge third camp , that dwarfs the extremists on both sides , full of intelligent , pragmatic individuals that are choosing to use the tools available to us without prejudice .
That includes Java , Ruby , Python , Scala , etc .
There is no silver bullet , and all that jazz ...
Oppression
Daniel 's post led me to question , what is the motive for piling on to the heap of negativity started by Zed and perpetuated by Rick Hightower , Graeme Rocher and others ?
Why pick on the Ruby community ?
Is it simply a reaction to the hype cycle ?
Daniel : " Perhaps now that the bubble has burst , we ’ll finally get to see the popularity of Ruby in its proper place . "
Aha !
Above all , that sentiment is the common thread amongst the haters of the progressive Ruby community .
Oppression !
They want to keep Ruby ( and by extension Rubyists ) in our proper place !
What is that proper place I wonder -- perhaps it is out of the mainstream , out of the limelight , out of the enterprise , out of the places where we threaten the status quo !
I had to send my Wii in for repairs last spring , and many readers want to know if I have experienced any problems since .
For the most part , my Wii works great .
No more display problems .
But I did have a problem with Miis .
While I did n't lose any Miis I made before the repair , my new Wii thinks those Miis were made on a different console .
That means they have blue pants instead of black pants , and I can't edit them .
That problem escalated Sunday when Nintendo rolled out the Check Mii Out Channel , a free download that allows
Wii owners to share the Miis they have created , vote on their favorites and download the ones they want to keep .
Since my older Miis ( including the casts of " Veronica Mars " and " Firefly " ) have blue pants , I can't share them using Check Mii Out .
I can't even use my Tim Agne Mii as an avatar .
Here 's what happens :
As long as people knock it off with all the duplicate Jesus and Michael Jackson Miis , I think the Check Mii Out Channel will be a lot of fun in spite of this problem .
Making Miis was one of the most fun things about the Wii when it came out , and I think this channel will re-invigorate these once - cherished avatars .
Since I can't upload all my classic creations right now , I added a few new ones instead .
Find my Miis , download and favorite them so I can retire from journalism and live my dream to be the world 's greatest celebrity Mii artisan .

1 ) I am so sick of my period !
One - third of every month is negatively affected by my period .
I am either sick from cramps , bloated beyond belief , on it , finishing it , too emotional , not emotional at all , or just simply not myself .
The right months are worse than the left ones .
Ortho , Depo and the others do nothing to help .
2 ) I hate make - up .
I went to work today without make - up ( I feel like crap already ) and the first thing I hear when I sit down is a co-worker saying " I see you woke up late this morning , you should put your face on before anyone else sees you like that " ...
WTF , this is my face ... it is a cute face ...
I like it just the way it is .
Why do I have to put on a show for everyone around me , hell some of the guys here do n't even shave before coming to work ... they wear the same tired clothes every week ... so why do I need to bother ?
3 ) I have to be a slave to fashion .
Same as the make - up situation , god forbid if I wear my most comfortable pants to work , or an out of style outfit that I personally like .
Why do I have to spend a couple thousand dollars a year on clothes and accessories , why do all of my friends want to shop all of the time .
This is a sickness , and I am sick of it .
I wish I could dress like a guy , in the same suit I bought in 1999 and the same tie that I have worn every week for the past three years .
That would be nice !
4 ) My bra has never fit me right !
Why can't I find a bra that fits me perfectly ?
One that is slightly adjustable to compensate for my ever changing body ?
With the right cup just slightly larger than the left cup , one that provides just the right amount of support .
Is this too much to ask , retailers have put significant effort into the feminine hygiene realm , perhaps they could divert some of their R&D monies away from moisture lock technologies and into making the perfect bra .
If only I was a little smaller , then I could go without .
5 ) I hate the following terms : Pussy , Slit , Cooche , Cunt , Snatch , Cooter , Beaver , Hole , Muff , Twat , and Clam ...
I also hate Titties , Boobies , Funbags , Melons and any other idiotic name people come up with for my body parts .
I have a vagina and breasts or tits .
Easy as that .
Can you say Vagina ?
I hope so .6 ) Double standards :
Men get away with murder in the business world .
Women are held to a much higher degree of scrutiny and to a much higher standard than men .
When men talk they are networking , when women talk we are gossiping ... when men make mistakes they are risk takers , when women make mistakes we are incompetent , when men argue they are debating , when women argue we are being catty .
You get the idea .
I am just as smart , if not smarter than most of my coworkers , but I will always get stuck behind a guy with ' ambition and drive ' , especially when I spend a good portion of my month focusing on my insides ( see # 1 ) .7 )
Sex is different for women .
Men take great pride in bedding women , as many and as often as possible .
If a women expresses her sexuality she is a whore , tramp or slut .
Rightly so sometimes ... there is no female equivalent to the blow job , a blow job is a power trip for the guy ...
I am on my knees in front of him or with my head around his waist in some fashion , pleasuring him until he finishes , then it is up to me to clean up while he basks in the satisfaction .
If he goes down on me , it is a different experience , there is no power exchange , he is still in a powerful position ( legs apart is always vulnerable ) and he is still happy to see my vagina .
The picture alone is worth ten minutes of licking on his part .
Do n't even get me started on penetration ... 8 )
My yearly gyno appointment .
enough said , I wish I could just turn my head and cough , just once !
9 ) The bathroom !
Ok , I am not going to talk about the cleanliness of bathrooms and the hygiene habits of women , that has been covered ad nauseum on this board .
I am going to say that I wish I could be a little neater when I pee , I can't stand that first dribble that tends to go somewhere other than in the bowl if I am not sitting .
The squat pee ( which I have to do given the state of the restrooms in some places ) is never neat for me .
No need for graphic details here .
10 ) My mother and all other women who feel that I am breaking the social contract by not having children .
I have enough issues with my girly parts already , I can't imagine what having a child would do to me .
I also do n't feel like bringing new babies into the current world , so do n't tell me that I should .
Do n't say that I should ' start looking for a husband ' { wink} because I am getting older ... why do n't you tell the guys , ' better get serious about a family , your time is ticking '... I hate the double standards , the 1950s restrictions that still apply today , the fact that every body that sees me thinks that I am a walking baby factory , that I need to put on a show for them to attract a suitable man to take care of me so that I can bear his children .
I want comfortable clothes , a man to truly understand vulnerability , especially sexual vulnerability without getting freaky about it .
I want the same priveleges that men have .
Is that too much to ask ?
With big potential for computing , researchers develop a quantum ‘ light switch ’
Steve Castillo
The team of scientists from Stanford included , from left , Andrei Faraon ; Jelena Vuckovic , assistant professor of electrical engineering ; Dirk Englund ; and Ilya Fushmann .
Their study was in the Dec. 6 issue of Nature .
Infinitely secure cryptography that renders any computer unhackable .
Computers that can solve the structure of a complicated protein at the drop of a hat .
Programs to decrypt complicated enemy secrets .
Optical data connections up to 100 times faster than current technology allows .
Photons and atoms hold the power to make these innovations reality ; scientists just have to figure out how to unlock their potential .
Now , researchers at Stanford and the University of California - Santa Barbara have developed a quantum " light switch " that could have implications for the future of certain kinds of computing .
A team of scientists led by Jelena Vuckovic , assistant professor of electrical engineering , has succeeded in directly probing a solid quantum system with light .
This finding could be a milestone on the road to building a functional " quantum computer , " a machine where information is coded in individual particles that flip between different states instead of in transistors switching on and off .
The finding could lead to better quantum cryptography and faster optical data connections .
Their study was published in the Dec. 6 issue of Nature .
" This effect has been previously demonstrated only in complicated atomic physics systems , " Vuckovic wrote in an e-mail , " but ours is the first demonstration in solid state . "
Previous demonstrations of the technique on atoms suspended in a gaseous state used machines that would dwarf an office desk .
Vuckovic 's team used solid material on a chip smaller than a thumbnail .
Scientists have been dreaming of a quantum computer for over 25 years .
In such a machine , bits of information would be encoded in systems that walk to the beat of quantum mechanics — the field of physics that describes the quirky behavior of tiny atomic and subatomic particles .
Certain problems that scientists want to answer , such as predicting the way a complicated protein will fold , which might aid drug discovery , or factoring large integers into prime numbers to decrypt encoded messages , are extremely difficult to do with classical computers .
In 2005 , a 200 - digit number was decomposed into prime numbers using multiple computers running for 18 months — scientists estimated that it would have taken one relatively speedy computer over 50 years to do the same task .
A single powerful quantum computer , if it existed , could have done it in minutes .
One of the difficulties in actually creating a quantum computer comes from the fact that no one particle can do it all , said Dirk Englund , doctoral student in applied physics and one of the lead authors of the study .
Photons are great for carrying information , and they are easy to move around , but they can't interact with each other .
Conversely , atoms can interact , but can't easily communicate information .
Scientists hope to get around this problem by using both , through something called a quantum network that would connect a series of atoms with a photonic channel .
" In this approach , you 're trying to exploit the best parts of both the atom and the photon , " Englund said .
" Communicate with the photon , interact with the atom . "
But the problem of how to transfer the information between a single atom and a single photon still remains .
If you just lob a photon at an atom , chances are it will miss , Englund said .
So to give the photon a fighting chance at finding the atom , the scientists built a cavity of mirrors .
The photon shoots into the cavity from a finely tuned laser beam and , like a pinball in a pinball machine , it ricochets around and around until it finally hits its target .
In this case , the target is an artificial atom termed a " quantum dot " — a microscopic blob of semiconductor material — nestled in a cavity inside another semiconductor .
The blob confines charged particles to a tiny volume , much like an atom confines electrons in the tiny boundaries of its shell .
Because of this confinement , the quantum dot behaves much as an artificial atom , including the ability to occupy different energy states that could represent the binary " ones " and " zeros " of digital information .
If you think of the quantum dot like a spinning top , Englund said , " you 'd call a spinning top that 's upright a ' one ' and a spinning top that pointed down a ' zero . ' "
When the quantum dot is inside the semiconductor cavity , the cavity can be switched from transparent to opaque when the laser beam shines on it — meaning the team of researchers has succeeded in making a light switch out of just one photon and one quantum dot .
The team includes study co-authors Andrei Faraon and Ilya Fushman , doctoral students in applied physics .
Previous groups had probed the quantum dot / cavity pair using indirect methods , but nobody had ever directly accessed the quantum system with photons before , Englund said .
A research team from the California Institute of Technology published a study in the Dec. 6 issue of Nature that also demonstrates direct probing of a quantum system with photons , using a different system and technique .
The tiny chips used by Vuckovic 's group have the advantage that they could easily be manufactured using technologies similar to those for computer chip manufacturing , Englund said .
While it will probably be a while before Vuckovic 's system challenges the transistor as a new computational unit of information , it has that potential , Englund said .
The next important step is to make some changes to the quantum dot to demonstrate that information can actually be transferred from the photonic channel to the dot — that is , to show that a piece of information from the photon could be relayed by changing the dot 's energy state or spin direction .
Quantum dots might pave the road to the computer of the future , but that does n't mean quantum computers will stock the shelves of your local electronics store , Englund said .
Quantum information devices are most sought after because of their special applications to certain problems , such as unbreakable encryption systems and simulations of intricate molecular structures .
" In the next 20 years you might well see a quantum computer in a scientific research setting or defense , " Englund said , " but you wo n't see Dell making one . "

On Monday evening , President Bush will stand before a joint session of Congress and give a speech about the state of the Union – and perhaps about the state of his place in history , as well .
This does n't mean that Mr. Bush 's final State of the Union address will be a nostalgia - fest of retrospection .
Bush , like his father before him , famously is averse to dwelling on the past .
But he 's unlikely to unveil bold new initiatives , say experts , given his low approval ratings and the lack of time left in his term .
At best Bush might push items already in the legislative pipeline , such as a revised No Child Left Behind education law , while claiming progress in Iraq and the war on terror – the most consequential events of his administration .
" Given his political situation , the task is to make the best case for his legacy rather than to set an ambitious agenda for his last year , " says Thomas Mann , senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution , a Washington think tank .
Administration officials insist that Bush 's speech will be focused on the future .
Twelve months is enough time to get some things done in politics , and Bush has often expressed a desire to " sprint to the finish , " said White House spokeswoman Dana Perino on Jan. 25 .
Bush will highlight items of unfinished business that he believes should be priorities for the Democratic congressional leadership , said Ms. Perino .
These include the economic stimulus package , an item on which Bush has reached a quick accord with House Democrats , and updated warrantless eavesdropping legislation , a bill that 's been the subject of heated partisan fights .
Bush will also mention some actions that he can take without congressional approval , via executive orders or other administrative action , spokeswoman Perino said .
President Bill Clinton often promoted such small - bore steps as a means of appearing dynamic despite facing a Congress controlled by the political opposition .
Notably absent from the speech will be the unveiling of new initiatives on immigration or Social Security reform , or similar big problems .
Perino blamed the likelihood of congressional inaction for this omission – not waning political strength or the shortness of Bush 's remaining time in the Oval Office .
On foreign affairs , Bush will highlight recent successes in Iraq , according to White House officials , and talk about the fact that US troops levels there will soon start to decline .
He 'll discuss the Middle East peace process and the prospect of Israeli - Palestinian reconciliation , and work in mentions of US aid in the fight against global hunger and disease .
" He 's put all of his soul and all of his might into being president , and this year will be no exception , " said Perino .
That might be one of the points of this year 's State of the Union – the beginning of a push to present his overall effort as president in positive terms .
After all , few people still are looking to Bush for political leadership , says George Edwards III , a presidential scholar at Texas A&M University .
Only about one - third of the country approves of his job performance .
A majority of Americans believe that beginning the war in Iraq was a mistake , according to many polls .
Many voters have tuned out the White House to focus on the contenders for the 2008 presidential election , Dr. Edwards says .
" He 's got very little political capital , " says Edwards of Bush .
Thus this final State of the Union may be one of the chief executive 's last chances to argue his case before the nation .
He will likely present the recent decline in violence in Baghdad as evidence that he will pass an improving situation in Iraq along to his successor .
He might hold up his stimulus deal with the House as an example of how he has worked to keep the economy humming along .
" To try to begin to set the rhetorical terms for judging his presidency in the years ahead – that 's what [ the State of the Union ] may be about more than anything else , " says Mr. Mann of the Brookings Institution .
Not that Democrats will allow these assertions to remain unchallenged .
Democratic congressional leaders last week produced what they called a " pre-buttal " to the State of Union , in which , among other things , they challenged the president to renounce the use of waterboarding during interrogations and to close the Guantánamo Bay prison for detainees .
" Our first goal as a country must be to restore . . . moral authority , " said Senate majority leader Harry Reid ( D ) of Nevada .
Bush is certain to argue otherwise .
A president 's early State of the Union addresses are usually used to present grand plans ; his middle ones , to support his agenda and subtly attack opponents .
But nearing the end of their time in office , presidents cannot avoid being retrospective , in addition to forward - looking , says Southern Methodist University professor of political science Cal Jillson .
" I do think he will argue for sustaining much of his earlier policymaking , " says Dr. Jillson .
