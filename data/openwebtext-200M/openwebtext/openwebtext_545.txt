( CNN ) -- Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin accepted the GOP vice presidential nomination at the party 's convention Wednesday with a speech highly critical of Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Barack Obama .
Green Party supporter Rick Seno described Palin as " the female version of Barack Obama . "
Palin , who was mayor of a small town before she became governor of Alaska almost two years ago , slammed Obama for what she insisted was his lack of political experience and accused him of being two - sided when he is appealing to voters .
Her speech received raucous applause from the convention crowd in St. Paul , Minnesota , and an equally strong reaction from iReporters across the country .

" She came in with bats swinging and hit a home run with me , " said iReporter Barbara Grant of New Haven , Connecticut .
Grant , who voted for Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry in 2004 , said she plans to vote for Republican candidate Sen. John McCain in November .
She is pleased with his choice of running mate .
" [ Palin ] seems like a very solid person , " Grant said .
" I look forward to hearing more of what she has to say . "
Darla Jones described Palin 's speech as " refreshing . "
Jones , a McCain supporter , said she has watched the entire convention so far .
" Amazing that two weeks ago we knew nothing about this woman , and tonight I sit very moved by her speech , " she said .

McCain announced Palin as his vice presidential pick Friday .
The relatively unknown politician and mother of five has since been the focus of media and voters ' attention .
As a small - town resident , Jones said Palin 's words " express my views and my friends ' and family 's views . "
Jones lives in Roseburg , Oregon , a town with a population around 21,000 .
Green Party supporter Rick Seno sees Palin as " the female Republican version of Barack Obama . "
The Dallas , Texas , resident said he noticed several similarities between the two politicians as Palin delivered her convention speech .
" She 's a talented speaker .
She gives a great speech .
She has the ability to capture people 's attention and give them hope and make them excited , " he said .
" But when it comes to her record and her lack of experience , she is equally unprepared to be in the White House . "
To Rob Crawford of Washington , D.C. , Palin appeared " condescending and elitist " during her acceptance speech .
Crawford , who supports Obama , described last week 's Democratic National Convention as " inclusive " and the Republican convention as " divisive . "
" I feel as if this country will be more divided than ever tomorrow morning , " he wrote on iReport.com after watching Palin 's address .
" I did not feel this way last week .
I saw the same thing eight years ago with a charming , affable guy from Texas who had very bad ideas . "
James Martin of Mooresville , Nouth Carolina , described Palin as " nasty , crude and totally unacceptable as VP . "
He was especially offended by the " cheap shots " she took at Obama and Democratic running mate Joe Biden .
" I can't see how America can be better off electing someone who shows so little respect , " he added .

Canadian Marcie M. Farsea said it was obvious why Palin earned the nickname " Sarah Barracuda , " given her criticism of Obama and Biden Wednesday night .
" The most surprising thing was to see the humor and how she absolutely shredded both Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden , " Farsea said .
Although she is ineligible to vote in the presidential election , Farsea said she and other Canadians have taken a strong interest in the race .
She is not leaning toward a particular candidate .
As for Palin , Farsea said the Alaska governor " certainly makes it much more of a contest . "
Steve Duffy of Salt Lake City , Utah , was dismayed by Palin's " snarky " comments during her speech .
Duffy , a former supporter of Republican Ron Paul , said he and other Americans hoped for uplifting speeches rather than political attacks .
" This does not help the political discourse and it does not make people admire you for being selected as the Republican candidate for vice president , " said Duffy , who recently decided to support Obama .
While Kuntal Warwick agreed that Palin was an impressive speaker , she found the Alaska governor 's tone offensive .
" Yes , she was tough , yes , she spoke well and yes , she sold herself , " Warwick said .
" However Sarah Palin will not get my vote in November for some of the same reasons that I was reluctant to vote for [ Sen. Hillary Clinton ] during the primaries .
She came across as angry and overconfident . "
Political pundits consider McCain 's choice of Palin as his running mate to be an attempt to reach out to disillusioned Clinton supporters .
Palin is the first woman to run on a Republican presidential ticket .
Clinton and Obama engaged in a long and heated battle for the Democratic presidential nomination , one that the McCain campaign has acknowledged throughout the election season .
Although former Democratic candidate Clinton has since encouraged her supporters to vote for Obama , many say that his choice of Sen. Joe Biden -- rather than Clinton -- as running mate was an insult .
Warwick , who lives in King of Prussia , Pennsylvania , said she and other female independents are likely to " vote for someone who believes in bringing people together , who does not resort at will to negativism , who understands the far - ranging issues of this diverse nation and the complex realities of a globally independent world . "
She added that Palin had little to say about policy and that her speech was full " of smugness and mockery . "
Independent voter Sheryl Langdon said Palin appears to have " the heart and spirit of a servant . "
The Bedford , Indiana , resident said she loved Palin 's straightforward talk and sense of humor .
" This is something I get , " Langdon said .
" I identify with her and her ideals . "
Langdon supported Clinton during the presidential primaries .
She described herself as an undecided voter who had " been waiting for a champion . "
McCain 's choice of Palin as a running mate won her vote , she said .

" If you would have come up to me a year ago , five years ago , 10 years ago , and said that you would have supported a Republican ticket ...
I would have called you a liar , " she said .
Langdon said she looks forward to hearing more from Palin and is now more energized about the rest of the election season .
" I 'm excited , " she said .
" How could you not be ? "
DULUTH , Minnesota – Threat Level is here outside U.S. District Judge Michael Davis ' courtroom ahead of a scheduled 10 a.m. central time hearing in the Jammie Thomas file sharing case .
Ten months ago to the day , a federal jury here dinged the Minnesota woman $ 222,000 for making 24 copyrighted songs available on the Kazaa network .
But Davis , on his own motion , called the Recording Industry Association of America and lawyers for Thomas back here to his courtroom for Monday 's hearing .
He wants to hear arguments on whether to declare a mistrial for an instruction he read to the jury .
He told jurors that the young mother of two was liable for copyright infringement if she was " making copyrighted sound recordings available " over a peer - to - peer network " regardless of whether actual distribution has been shown . "
Law professors and digital rights groups have lined up on Thomas ' side , saying the under the Copyright Act the RIAA must prove that someone downloaded the tracks under the Copyright Act .
There 's no such thing as implied , or attempted copyright infringement , they said .
The RIAA and the Motion Picture Association of America have told the judge that it 's impossible to know whether others had downloaded copyrighted music from Thomas ' Kazaa share folder .
Threat Level will provide news of developments as quickly as possible .
It is not known whether the judge will rule Monday .
The judge does not allow computers in his courtroom .
Jammie Thomas was the first , and so - far only , defendant in an RIAA peer - to - peer lawsuit to go to trial .
Here is the complete story and background .

As I type this we 're a bit over 12 hours from blastoff for a new season of Mythbusters , set for 9 tonight .
We 'll have to wait three more weeks , however , for what will be one of the myth - busting gang 's most eagerly awaited episodes : puncturing the fairy tale that the moon landings were faked , as in filmed in a studio .
When I first heard that the famous and mighty Mythbusters were going to take on this particular piece of tired hokum on Aug. 27 , I frankly thought it beneath them ... as in way , way beneath them .
After all , believing that the moon landings were faked is akin to believing that the government has for 50 years successfully suppressed physical evidence of alien beings visiting Earth -- and regular readers know what I think about that fantastic voyage into the world of the impossible .
But I need to cut Adam and Jamie a little slack here .
After all , they are producing a television program that does not exactly aspire to be a documentary ( tonight , for example , they 're taking on " exploding meat " and " do n't drive angry " ) and there is no doubt this moon - landing silliness will prove tremendously entertaining .
And they 're certainly pulling out all the props , as you can see in this YouTube clip above that shows the guys preparing their model lunar surface and a wicked cool lunar lander .
( Bad Astronomy blogger Phil Plait , who knows the guys and has consulted with them on the moon landing hoax episode , wrote last night that he would give Jamie " a million bajillion dollars for your lander model . "
Not sure I 'd pay a million bajillion , but as you 'll see in the video , it is truly a work of art .
( At least one of my sons would pay a million bajillion . )
Of course , if the set and the lander are too convincing , maybe and the whole thing looks too real ... nah .

The BBC has obtained documents suggesting that Zimbabwe 's military is actively involved in running Robert Mugabe 's re-election campaign .
The documents outline plans by ruling party Zanu - PF to harass and drive out opposition supporters , especially from rural areas .
A run-off presidential vote is due to take place later in the month .
More than 60 people have been killed , thousands beaten and many more driven from their homes in related violence .
Testimony from eye - witnesses and victims from across Zimbabwe as well as internal party documents show that violence and intimidation are being used to try to guarantee the re-election of Robert Mugabe against the challenger , Morgan Tsvangirai of the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) , on 27 June .
MDC supporters say they have been attacked by Zanu - PF supporters
The documents suggest that the Joint Operations Command ( JOC ) is now running logistics and operations .
The JOC is made up of the heads of the military and state security organisations .
Another document lays out the party 's tactics , including the use of scarce food supplies as a political weapon .
" Basic commodities should be sold from either people 's shops or pro-Zanu - PF shops , " it says .
" Emphasis should be in party strongholds . "
It talks about giving the notorious and feared war veterans , responsible for much of the violence in Zimbabwe , a " leading role in Zanu - PF campaigns " .
Fight for survival
The document also outlines the use of covert operations against the MDC including harassing supporters and driving them out of Zanu - PF strongholds and declares a " no - go area " to rural constituencies for the MDC .
Opposition leaders arrested Key role for security chiefs Ruling party secret documents Harare diary : Descent into violence
The BBC is banned from reporting in the country , which makes it difficult to authenticate some of this material but our investigations found that all of the tactics mentioned in the document are being used by Zanu - PF and its supporters .
The Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Information , Bright Matonga , denied that the ruling - party is responsible for the violence and he refused to comment on what he described as " illegal documents . "
But speaking anonymously , a Zimbabwean police officer confirmed to the BBC that officers had been given orders to support Zanu - PF and turn a blind eye to violence perpetrated against MDC supporters .
We met in a dark car park in Harare .
He told me : " We 're told to vote for Zanu - PF and they told us it's not now a secret vote , you have to vote in front of your commanding officer . "
He complained that the police were no longer independent : " Our police is now politically motivated , whereas it is supposed to be an organisation that stands for not taking part . "

Posters supporting Robert Mugabe are plastered across the walls of the capital .
The party has brought in private PR consultants to give the campaign a far more positive image .
It is a slick strategy that promotes sovereignty , independence and empowerment .
But under - writing the campaign are the resources of the central bank and a monopoly of air - time in the state - controlled media .
Often the MDC and its supporters are portrayed as the perpetrators of much of the violence but all the evidence points the other way and that is also the conclusion of many observers .
The US ambassador to Harare insisted that Robert Mugabe wants to " to retain power through any means possible " .
He said Zanu - PF , the military and the war veterans were responsible for most of the violence against those who voted for the MDC in the first round , " ensuring that , number one , they 'll be too afraid to vote and , number two , that they 're not in their district and cannot vote " .
I asked him whether there was any way you could conclude that this election was either free or fair .
His answer was swift : " Absolutely none . "
We met people across Zimbabwe who all had almost identical stories to tell .
Many had been beaten or burnt , many had broken limbs , some had relatives killed , thousands had been driven from their homes .
They were all targeted because they voted for the opposition .
Robert Mugabe has called this an " all - out war " .
He and his supporters are engaged in a fight for survival and what is now clear is that they will use any means necessary to achieve that .

Omnivorous Engine Could Run on Gasoline , Ethanol , and Butanol
September 9th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Would n’t it be nice to have car with an engine that would happily accept any fuel regardless of its origins ?
The US Department of Energy ’s Argonne Laboratory is developing an engine that may make that dream a reality .
The lab is attempting to create an “ omnivorous engine ” that can run on any blend of gasoline , ethanol and butanol .
And unlike flex - fuel engines currently on the market that use ethanol or gasoline , the omnivorous engine could theoretically run at peak efficiency regardless of the fuel mixture .
The omnivorous engine will use sensors to evaluate the characteristics of the fuels being used .
If sensors determine that the engine is n’t running at peak levels , it will make adjustments to parameters like spark timing and injection strategy .
Since the lab ’s approach is both simple and cost - effective , it can be rolled out for commercial use quickly .
Argonne has n’t released details of the engine ’s release date , but it will be a welcome advance in vehicle technology .

Analysts said the market would be watching closely how the Treasury Department structured its planned purchases of troubled assets from financial firms .
The government has suggested it might use auctions to establish prices for the securities and loans it plans to acquire .
Mr. Zandi said the Treasury should disclose more details in the next several weeks and conduct its first auctions soon after the presidential elections .
Once investors have a better sense of what the troubled assets are worth , they will become more willing to invest in ailing financial firms that have not been able to raise capital because analysts fear they have not fully disclosed the quality of their assets .
“ We need to get clarity with respects to which institutions need to write down their assets and which institutions are well - capitalized , ” Mr. Zandi said .
“ That would provide solace to investors who would then provide capital to the system . ”
Furthermore , once financial firms have raised more capital , a crucial test will be whether they plow that new money back into the market through loans and investments in businesses , said Mr. Webman .
If banks remain fearful and hoard cash instead , as they have done in recent months , the rescue effort will only have a modest impact on the economy and financial system .
“ We need more capital coming into the market and actual investor money coming through the banks into economic activity , ” Mr. Webman said .
“ That ’s what I would really like to see happen . ”
But even if the government intervention is successful , economists and investors said it would not restore the days of easy credit that prevailed during the recent housing boom .
Mortgage rates should come down , but they are unlikely to return to the levels seen in 2003 and 2004 .
Also banks are unlikely to make many adjustable - rate loans without verifying the incomes and assets of borrowers .
Furthermore , the rescue might not forestall a recession , said G. David MacEwen , chief investment officer for the bond department at American Century Investments .
Though he thinks the rescue efforts will help the economy , Mr. MacEwen expects bankruptcies to spread , home prices to fall and unemployment to rise .
“ Having this plan contains the damage to some extent , ” Mr. MacEwen said .
But , he added , “ I think we are going to see slowing in economic activity .
This is like steering a battleship , you make course adjustment but they take time to take effect . ”

In this so - called Hering illusion , the straight lines near the central point ( vanishing point ) appear to curve outward .
This illusion occurs because our brains are predicting the way the underlying scene would look in the next moment if we were moving toward the middle point .
Humans can see into the future , says a cognitive scientist .
It 's nothing like the alleged predictive powers of Nostradamus , but we do get a glimpse of events one - tenth of a second before they occur .
And the mechanism behind that can also explain why we are tricked by optical illusions .
Researcher Mark Changizi of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in New York says it starts with a neural lag that most everyone experiences while awake .
When light hits your retina , about one - tenth of a second goes by before the brain translates the signal into a visual perception of the world .
Scientists already knew about the lag , yet they have debated over exactly how we compensate , with one school of thought proposing our motor system somehow modifies our movements to offset the delay .
Changizi now says it 's our visual system that has evolved to compensate for neural delays , generating images of what will occur one - tenth of a second into the future .
That foresight keeps our view of the world in the present .
It gives you enough heads up to catch a fly ball ( instead of getting socked in the face ) and maneuver smoothly through a crowd .
His research on this topic is detailed in the May / June issue of the journal Cognitive Science ,
Explaining illusions
That same seer ability can explain a range of optical illusions , Changizi found .
" Illusions occur when our brains attempt to perceive the future , and those perceptions do n't match reality , " Changizi said .
Here 's how the foresight theory could explain the most common visual illusions — geometric illusions that involve shapes : Something called the Hering illusion , for instance , looks like bike spokes around a central point , with vertical lines on either side of this central , so - called vanishing point .
The illusion tricks us into thinking we are moving forward , and thus , switches on our future - seeing abilities .
Since we are n't actually moving and the figure is static , we misperceive the straight lines as curved ones .
" Evolution has seen to it that geometric drawings like this elicit in us premonitions of the near future , ” Changizi said .
" The converging lines toward a vanishing point ( the spokes ) are cues that trick our brains into thinking we are moving forward — as we would in the real world , where the door frame ( a pair of vertical lines ) seems to bow out as we move through it — and we try to perceive what that world will look like in the next instant . "
Grand unified theory
In real life , when you are moving forward , it 's not just the shape of objects that changes , he explained .
Other variables , such as the angular size ( how much of your visual field the object takes up ) , speed and contrast between the object and background , will also change .
For instance , if two objects are about the same distance in front of you , and you move toward one of the objects , that object will speed up more in the next moment , appear larger , have lower contrast ( because something that is moving faster gets more blurred ) , and literally get nearer to you compared with the other object .
Changizi realized the same future - seeing process could explain several other types of illusions .
In what he refers to as a " grand unified theory , " Changizi organized 50 kinds of illusions into a matrix of 28 categories .
The results can successfully predict how certain variables , such as proximity to the central point or size , will be perceived .
Changizi says that finding a theory that works for so many different classes of illusions is " a theorist 's dream . "
Most other ideas put forth to explain illusions have explained one or just a few types , he said .
The theory is " a big new player in the debate about the origins of illusions , " Changizi told LiveScience .
" All I 'm hoping for is that it becomes a giant gorilla on the block that can take some punches . "
CIA vet may face repercussions for revealing agency secrets Andrew McLemore
Published : Saturday August 2 , 2008

This A 25 - year CIA veteran has written a unauthorized , 384 - page book that sharply criticizes the mismanagement and misdoings of the agency , creating an unprecedented test of the rights of former employees to reveal potentially harmful information .
" The Human Factor : Inside the CIAs Dysfunctional Intelligence Culture " was written under the pseudonym " Ishmael Jones " to protect people the author has met who did n't know he was working undercover , CQ Politics reported .
Jones denies that the work contains any classified information and said he wrote the book to " improve the system and help it defend ourselves and our allies . "
" I realized the CIAs clandestine service was broken , " the author said in an interview with FrontPage Magazine .
" My mission has always been to defend America , and for many years I sought to do this by producing intelligence as an active CIA officer .
Today , using this book as a tool , I seek to defend America by working to fix our broken clandestine service . "
Jones is donating the book 's earnings to the family of a soldier killed in Iraq and said he is ready for the consequences of publishing his book .
" Im ready to take whatever they have to do , " Jones said of his former employer .
He may have a lot to take .
Former CIA operative Frank Snepp faced heavy repercussions after he skipped agency censors and published an account of his Vietnam tour titled " Decent Interval : An Insiders Account of Saigons Indecent End , Told by the CIAs Chief Strategy Analyst in Vietnam . "
The CIA sued him and won in landmark Supreme Court case that ended with the confiscation of Sneep 's earnings by the agency .
The court justified the decision on the basis that Snepp violated his employment contract by not submitting the book to the agency 's censors .
Snepp said Jones is " inviting big trouble " because he actually submitted the book to the CIA for review , which approved only about one percent of it , according to Jones .
Undeterred , Jones published the whole thing anyway .
" God knows what the hell could happen to him , " Snepp said .
CIA spokesman Paul Gimigliano told CQ Politics that Jones ' book was fiction and declined to say what , if any , legal action the agency might take in response .
Jones ' book describes at length the inefficiency of his former agency and its poor tactics to gather intelligence in Baghdad .
" We probably had more case officers in California than we did in Iraq , " he writes .
But the author also details the less than exemplary behavior of the agency 's employees .
Jones said secretaries and security guards would have group sex in Green Zone parking lots oblivious to security cameras .
" All of the culprits were identified and sent home , " he writes , but not before " senior employees got to watch the video the next day . "
Jones also said the CIA 's problems must be addressed by the next president .
" Whether we have President Obama or President McCain , history suggests that the major crises they face will feature a lack of good human source intelligence , " Jones said in the interview with FrontPage Magazine .
" It s deadly serious . "
An excerpt from the article by CQ Politics follows : # The system valued " industrial " production over quality , he writes .
" Some people had enormous output ; a few , although they sat at their desks for twelve hours , had none ... Sending e-mail to friends throughout the organization was a common time - waster .
If anyone giggled while sitting at his desk , it was a safe bet he was ' instant - messaging ' with a friend in the agency .
If two people giggled alternately , it usually meant they were sending messages to each other . "
But Jones saves his hottest anger for what he describes as self - dealing CIA managers who , he says , have avoided or mismanaged clandestine operations around the globe .
Since 9/11 , he writes , many CIA " mandarins " ( its most senior officials ) have retired from the agency to " get rich " as private contractors with their old employer .
And they re not being replaced by people with on - the - ground counter - terrorism experience , he says , despite the agency 's constant ballyhoo about gearing up for " the long war " against terrorist groups . #
Polling Biden
With all the usual caveats — this was a single polling call , reported by a single source — a Democratic activist in eastern Iowa I know fairly well got an interesting call last night .
He e-mails :
I got polled today about my views as " An Iowa Democratic Activist . " on Joe Biden ...
They asked : Did I have a positive or negative view of Biden ?
Does he have the expereince to be VP ?
Would he make you more or less likely to vote for the " Democratic Ticket " ?
weird word choice .
He did n't catch the name of the pollster .
Anybody else getting calls like that ?

Barbara Bradley , an editor with the Memphis Commercial Appeal , moved into the River City ’s reviving downtown about a year and a half ago , loving its “ energy and enthusiasm . ”
But a horde of invading panhandlers has cooled her enjoyment of city life .
Earlier this year , she recalled in a recent column , as she showed some visitors around the neighborhood , “ a big panhandler blocked the entrance to our parking area and demanded his toll . ”
Now a nervous Bradley avoids certain downtown areas , locks her car when fueling up at local gas stations , and parks strategically , so that she can see beggars coming before getting out of her car .
“ When I hear someone call out ‘ ma ’am , ma’am ’ anywhere in downtown or midtown , I run . ”
She ’s not alone .
Cities have overcome myriad obstacles in revitalizing their downtowns , from lousy transportation systems to tough competition from suburban shopping malls .
But nearly 15 years after New York City mayor Rudolph Giuliani and his police chief , William Bratton , vanquished Gotham ’s notorious squeegee men and brought aggressive panhandling under control , other cities are facing a new wave of “ spangers ” ( that is , spare - change artists ) who threaten their newfound prosperity by harassing residents , tourists , and businesses .
Unlike their predecessors in the seventies and eighties , many of these new beggars are n’t helpless victims or even homeless .
Rather , they belong to a diverse and swelling community of street people who have made panhandling their calling .
Like most countries , America has always had its share of itinerant travelers , vagabonds , and hoboes .
But panhandling became a more pervasive and disturbing fact of urban life in the 1970s — a by - product of the explosion in homelessness that resulted from rising drug use and the closing of state - run mental institutions , which released scores of helpless psychiatric patients back into society .
Though studies showed that only a small percentage of homeless people panhandled — mostly alcoholics and drug addicts seeking their next fix — the sheer numbers of street people still meant lots of beggars .
By the crack epidemic ’s late - eighties peak , New York City in particular was home to a massive panhandling presence .
A 1988 survey by New York ’s Metropolitan Transportation Authority found that 80 percent of subway riders disliked the constant harassment .
“ I was raised never to pass a beggar by , but there are too many of them and I ’m sick of it , ” one Manhattanite told the New York Times .
“ I feel like this is becoming beggar city . ”
The problem soon turned from irritating to alarming in “ beggar city , ” as incidents of aggressive panhandling leading to violent crime began showing up regularly in the headlines .
In 1988 , an itinerant panhandler on Manhattan ’s Upper West Side murdered his girlfriend ’s three - year - old daughter , whose dead body he then stuffed into a baby carriage and took out on his rounds , along with the girl ’s still - living brother .
A year later , an aggressive panhandler stabbed to death a 32 - year - old computer engineer in a confrontation on West 114th Street in Manhattan .
Shortly after , in the Bronx , an 18 - year - old boy died from stab wounds inflicted by a panhandling immigrant who knew just four English words : “ Give me a dollar ! ”
The escalation — and other cities faced it , too — should n’t have been surprising .
“ If the neighborhood cannot keep a bothersome panhandler from annoying passersby . . . it is even less likely to call the police to identify a potential mugger or to interfere if a mugging actually takes place , ” wrote political scientist James Q. Wilson .
One change in policing that had contributed to the growing disorder , observed Wilson , was curtailing foot patrols in favor of squad cars .
In the past , an officer on the beat would discourage panhandlers ; now he just drove on by .
New York , fed up with the disorder , began to crack down on panhandling in the early nineties .
The effort started in the subways , spearheaded by the Bratton - led Metropolitan Transit Authority police , who combined policing with outreach efforts for homeless beggars willing to come in off the streets .
The cleanup continued when Bratton became Giuliani ’s first police commissioner in 1994 and took on the squeegee men— insistent panhandlers who intimidated Manhattan drivers by washing their car windows and then demanding payment .
After a study by criminologist George Kelling found that three - quarters of the squeegee men were n’t homeless and that half had felony records , cops began arresting them for blocking traffic .
That put an end to the shakedowns in a matter of weeks .
The city then extended the anti-panhandling campaign to other parts of the city , including beggar - dominated Times Square .
Central to the crackdown was the Midtown Community Court , an experimental judicial body to which police could drag quality - of - life arrestees the very day they issued citations .
Working with social - services providers who offered help to those needing it , the court acted with lightning speed , usually giving community - service sentences to those willing to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges , so that someone arrested for panhandling in the morning could be cleaning the neighborhood by the afternoon .
The immediate results gave police a strong incentive to enforce the city ’s long - moribund quality - of - life statutes ; previously , if an officer issued a quality - of - life citation , the panhandler had a month or longer to respond to the summons and often did n’t show up in court on the appointed day .
As with the subways and the squeegee men , the campaign was a huge success .
Other cities , following New York ’s lead , worked to reduce their own ( much less severe ) panhandling blight during the nineties — adopting community courts , forcing beggars to register for licenses ( which discouraged them ) , and passing new anti-panhandling laws .
These measures , though rarely as tough as Gotham ’s , helped spark new development and interest in downtown districts across the country .
But over the last several years , the urban resurgence has proved an irresistible draw to a new generation of spangers .
And while New York City ’s aggressive emphasis on quality - of - life policing under two successive mayors has kept them at bay , less vigilant cities have been overwhelmed .
Indeed , panhandling is epidemic in many places — from cities like San Francisco , Seattle , Austin , Memphis , Orlando , and Albuquerque to smaller college towns like Berkeley .
“ People in New York would be shocked at what one encounters in other cities these days , where the panhandling can be very intimidating , ” says Daniel Biederman , a cofounder of three business improvement districts in Manhattan , including the Grand Central Partnership , which grappled effectively with homelessness in the city ’s historic train station in the early 1990s .
“ Panhandling has gotten especially bad in cities that have a reputation for being liberal and tolerant .
They have tried to be open - minded , but now many of them see the problem as out of control . ”
A big part of the cities ’ woes is the professionalization of panhandling .
The old type of panhandler — a mentally impaired or disabled homeless person trying to scrape together a few bucks for a meal — is giving way to the full - time spanger who supports himself through a combination of begging , working at odd jobs , and other sources , like government assistance from disability payments .
Some full - time panhandlers are kids — “ road warriors ” who have largely dropped out of society and drift from town to town , often “ couch surfing ” at friends ’ homes , or “ street loiterers ” who daily make their way downtown from the suburbs where they live .
Some , like New Yorker Steve Baker , have turned begging into a full - time job .
“ If you ’re inside a bank , you ’re a doorman , ” he says from his perch inside a bank lobby .
“ You ’re not gonna rob from nobody or steal from nobody — you come in here and make a job for yourself . ”
People ’s generosity encourages the begging .
About four out of ten Denver residents gave to panhandlers , city officials determined several years ago , anteing up an estimated $ 4.6 million a year .
Anecdotal surveys by journalists and police , and even testimony by panhandlers themselves , suggest that begging can yield anywhere from $ 20 to $ 100 a day — though police in Coos Bay , Oregon , found that local panhandlers were taking in as much as $ 300 a day in a Wal - Mart parking lot .
“ A panhandler could make thirty to forty thousand dollars a year , tax - free money , ” Baker says .
In Memphis , a local FOX News reporter , Jason Carter , donned old clothes and hit the streets earlier this year , earning about $ 10 an hour .
“ Just the quasi - appearance of being homeless filled my cup , ” Carter observed .
That all the money is beyond the tax man ’s clutches adds to the allure of professional panhandling .
Carter prepared for his stint on the street by surfing the Internet , where a variety of websites dispense panhandling advice .
NeedCom , for example — subtitled “ Market Research for Panhandlers ” — offers tips from Baker and other pros on how to hustle .
The website ’s developer , Cathy Davies , wants it to get people “ thinking about panhandling as a realistic economic activity , rather than thinking that panhandlers are lazy or do n’t work very hard . ”
The rise of online panhandling advice helps explain why panhandlers and “ sign flyers ” — beggars who use signs to solicit donations — exhibit remarkably similar methods around the country .
Currently , the direct , humorous approach is in vogue .
That ’s why in many cities today you ’ll hear some version of : “ I wo n’t lie to you , I need a drink . ”
Panhandlers also report that asking for specific amounts of money lends credibility to pitches .
“ I need 43 more cents to get a cup of coffee , ” a panhandler will declare ; some people will give exactly that much , while others will simply hand over a buck .
If it seems unlikely that a homeless person would surf the Web for advice on how to panhandle , that ’s exactly the point : many are n’t homeless and are lying about their circumstances .
A reporter for KUTV in Salt Lake City followed and filmed panhandlers for several months , documenting their scams .
One twentysomething woman wielded a sign informing people that she was homeless and needed a bus ticket back to Seattle .
The reporter followed her one day , however , and discovered that she lived in a nearby suburb .
Confronted by the reporter , the woman explained away her deception : “ I do n’t say anything to anybody .
I hold this sign .
I do n’t make anybody give me money . ”
Her story is n’t unique : homeless advocate Pamela Atkinson told KUTV that some 70 percent of panhandlers in Salt Lake City are n’t describing their situations accurately .
Like their counterparts back in the eighties , some spangers refuse to take no for an answer .
Aggressive begging has grown so common in Memphis that a group of residents , members of an online forum called Handling - Panhandling , have begun photographing those who act in a threatening manner , seeking to help police catch those who violate the law .
“ One of the guys we photographed for the Handling - Panhandling group last summer was obviously a loose cannon , ” forum host Paul Ryburn writes .
“ When employees of a Beale Street restaurant asked him to stop begging in front of their door , he threatened to stab them . ”
Reports of similar incidents are on the increase in many cities .
A pizzeria manager in Columbus , Ohio , told the Columbus Dispatch earlier this year that panhandlers were entering the store asking for money , then following women back to their cars to scare them into giving it .
“ One of the bums threatened to stab me when I asked them to leave two women alone , ” the restaurateur added .
In Orlando , panhandlers have started entering downtown offices and asking receptionists for money , prompting businesses to lock the doors .
San Francisco police have identified 39 beggars who have received five or more citations for aggressive panhandling , racking up a total of 447 citations .
Tourist guidebooks and online sites are replete with warnings from travelers .
A business visitor to Nashville , sharing his experiences on Fodor.com , writes : “ Every day I was there I was not just approached but grabbed or touched by folks asking for money . ”
A traveler to San Francisco , describing his trip on Virtualtourist.com , warns prospective tourists about the pervasiveness of persistent beggars : “ If you come to San Francisco and are not hit up for change , you have spent too much time in your hotel room . ”
Widespread begging bears much of the blame for lingering public impressions that downtowns remain unsafe , even in places like Minneapolis , where crime has fallen .
In a survey last year , more than a fifth of Minneapolis ’s downtown workers called the area “ extremely unsafe ” in the evening , largely because of extensive panhandling ( nine out of ten downtown workers report getting asked for money at least several times a month ) .
Aggressive beggars have tried to extort cash from waitresses at local restaurants by threatening to harass customers .
Families visiting downtown report panhandlers following them down the street and cursing at them if they refuse to give , according to the head of the Downtown Council , a local business group .
The bullying shakedowns are having an economic effect on the city : some firms have balked at renewing leases .
Downtown business owners in Nashville now rank panhandling as their Number One problem .
In St. Louis , another city battling perceptions that it ’s dangerous , two - thirds of respondents to an online poll by the St. Louis Post - Dispatch said that they ’d encountered aggressive panhandling .
Matt Kastner , a real - estate agent who has moved back to St. Louis from the suburbs , believes that panhandlers are perpetrating much of the minor crime — such as car break - ins — that plagues parts of St. Louis .
Many solicit him on the city ’s roads .
“ They ’ll come right at the car as you ’re getting off an exit ramp , ” he says .
“ I ’m afraid one of these days I ’m going to hit one of them . ”
Kastner ’s fears are n’t misplaced : in Austin , where persistent begging has given new meaning to the term “ Texas panhandle , ” the police chief noted last August that more than a third of the people killed in traffic accidents that year had been cited for begging in the past .
Confronting the new panhandling plague , many cities have been hamstrung by local factors that have made it hard to attack the problem in the aggressive , enforcement - driven New York style .
Some places , for instance , never transformed their police forces to emphasize quality - of - life crime and the importance of the cop on the beat .
Certain states , such as California , prohibit community courts for misdemeanors .
And sometimes a city ’s political tradition is so liberal that the notion of cracking down at all is anathema .
When Seattle city attorney Mark Sidran proposed muscular anti-panhandling restrictions in the early 1990s , protesters burned him in effigy ; today , despite complaints from visitors , Seattle pols still have no real plans to deal with the new wave of panhandling .
Anti-panhandling efforts in Oregon and other states also have run into legal obstacles from state courts , which have broadly interpreted begging as a protected form of free speech and shot down new laws curtailing it .
Still , some locales , while not going to New York ’s lengths , are experimenting with innovative ways to curb panhandling .
Orlando allows begging only in “ panhandling zones , ” demarcated by blue boxes painted on the sidewalks in several locations .
A more common response has been to educate the public about panhandling and to offer alternative ways to help those who really need it .
The Nashville Downtown Partnership , for instance , has launched a publicity campaign , “ Please Help , Do n’t Give , ” which explains through posters that money given to panhandlers often supports drug and alcohol addictions .
The partnership asks people to donate instead to organizations that provide local services .
Denver ’s anti-panhandling initiative seems particularly promising .
The city has turned 86 old , unused parking meters into donation boxes and placed them around downtown .
The meters allow people to give directly on the street , where they ’re likely to encounter panhandlers , assuring donors that their money will go to programs to assist the truly needy .
“ $ 1.50 provides a meal for a homeless person , ” the meter proclaims .
Between donations and corporate sponsorship , the meter program is generating about $ 100,000 a year , distributed to local groups to provide housing , job training , and other services , says Jamie Van Leeuwen , head of the city ’s homelessness - combating Road Home program .
The meter initiative is also deterring spanging — the city estimates that it ’s down a striking 90 percent .
“ Panhandling and homelessness are not synonymous , ” says Van Leeuwen .
“ Our homeless underscore that just because they are homeless , that does not mean that they panhandle . ”
Several cities are already copying the Denver initiative , including Chattanooga , which calls its version “ The Art of Change , ” and Minneapolis ; others , like Las Vegas , are considering it .
Cities are also coming up with new anti-panhandling legislation designed to pass muster in the courts .
Several cities have passed “ sit , lie ” ordinances , for example , which say nothing about panhandling but ban people from sitting or lying on streets and sidewalks .
Portland officials proposed a “ sit , lie ” law and then won over local homeless advocates by promising new spending on services for the truly needy .
“ In Portland , only about 10 percent of the people loitering on downtown streets and begging during the day were homeless , ” says Mike Kuykendall , president of the city ’s downtown business improvement district .
He credits the anti-panhandling initiative with playing a part in a 29 percent decline in street crime downtown over the last three years .
Similarly , several cities and smaller communities have banned motorists from giving to beggars , framing the legislation as safety ordinances .
Courts have also upheld laws that prohibit beggars from touching people without their consent , intentionally blocking their path , and using obscene or abusive language .
Yet even as cities experiment with new approaches , those traditionally opposed to restrictions on panhandling are fighting back — notably , civil liberties groups and some homeless advocates , who oppose any actions that might criminalize conduct by even a minority of the homeless .
In 2003 , San Francisco residents overwhelmingly passed a ballot proposition authored by then - supervisor ( and now mayor ) Gavin Newsom outlawing in - your - face panhandling .
But the ordinance has been ineffective because scores of volunteer lawyers , many from the city ’s biggest law firms , have fought every citation .
People cited for panhandling do n’t even need to appear in court .
They simply drop their citations in boxes at various advocacy groups , and the lawyers pick them up and appear in court , where judges have ruled that cops must file lengthy reports in order to get a conviction .
The courts are dismissing about 85 percent of all tickets handed out under the ordinance , frustrating police , prosecutors , politicians , and residents who voted for it .
“ If you had been here several years ago , before the ordinance passed , and came back today , you would n’t see a difference in the level of panhandling .
There ’s as much as ever , ” says supervisor Sean Elsbernd .
Such battles between civil libertarians and those who want to limit panhandling remain common .
Austin civil rights advocates got the city ’s ban on panhandling along roadsides overturned ; the court ruled that the city had n’t adequately demonstrated that panhandling was a safety issue .
Even New York City , which has long been able to stave off court challenges to its panhandling ordinance , is n’t immune .
A local judge has ruled that police have sometimes overstepped the bounds of the city ’s aggressive panhandling legislation and arrested people for peaceful solicitation .
Last year , a court awarded $ 100,000 to a beggar arrested eight times in the Bronx .
But there ’s no doubt that some cities have been more effective than others at building anti-panhandling campaigns .
“ I recently visited New York City and was shocked to discover that for a city with ten times our population , it has one tenth as many beggars , ” one San Franciscan wrote on the San Francisco Chronicle ’s website .
“ The few I did see sat silently with their signs and said nothing .
I did n’t witness a single instance of aggressive panhandling .
The reason for this ?
The city passed laws against such conduct and has enforced those laws .
If it can work over there , it can work here . ”
The real first step in the home buying or selling process is to find an agent to help you do it .
Real estate can be a complex business , and you do n’t want to leave something so important in the hands of just anybody .

Advertisement Thousands of people braved the rain to watch a 50 ft ( 15 m ) high mechanical spider come to life in Liverpool .
About 5,000 people watched La Princesse come out of " hibernation " outside the city 's arena at King 's Dock on Friday .
An estimated 20,000 more were in the city on Friday evening to see her crawl down The Strand before heading for a resting place at the Cunard building .
The £ 1.5 m street theatre production , operated by French company La Machine , is a Capital of Culture event .
La Princesse was unveiled to the public on Wednesday morning , hanging from a redundant office block next to Lime Street railway station .
She was woken in a hail of fireworks and smoke at 1130 BST on Friday , before striding up and down in front of the arena in front of the cheering crowd .
At £ 1.5 m I think it 's actually cheaper than Macca and it has got us on the front of the South China Morning Post
Phil Redmond , Liverpool Culture Company French " scientists " - La Machine 's street theatre artists - attempted to subdue her with water and snow against a backdrop of music from musicians on top of 16 cherry pickers .
Liverpool Culture Company artistic director Phil Redmond hailed the opening part of the show as " fantastic " .
" When you are planning this - and 350 people have been working for a year on this thing - you expect it to go well but you still keep your fingers crossed . "
Mr Redmond also dismissed criticism of the cost of the five - day spectacle , which he said was in the region of £ 1.5 m .
" At £ 1.5 m I think it 's actually cheaper than Macca and it has got us on the front of the South China Morning Post .
So it 's good value for money . "
Helen Marriage , of show producers Artichoke , said the money spent on the production was generating far more cash for the city as a whole .
' Enormous benefit '
" We ourselves have hotel bills of over £ 100,000 , which is money going straight back into the local economy .
" We 're employing lots of local people as crane drivers , cherry picker drivers - the benefit back to the city is enormous . "
After entertaining crowds at King 's Dock , the 37 - tonne beast explored Liverpool on Friday evening .
She will continue popping up at various landmarks around the city over the weekend , culminating in what organisers say will be a spectacular finish on Sunday evening .
On Saturday , she will again parade through the city centre and later climb up the Concourse Tower in Lime Street .
On Sunday evening , the spider will move towards the Queensway Tunnel .
Travel warning Anyone travelling to Liverpool to catch a glimpse of La Princesse is urged to use public transport .
Merseytravel said more ferries would be running and Merseyrail trains would be " strengthened " with extra carriages .
The Queensway Tunnel will also be closed to traffic from 0600 BST on Sunday until 0630 BST on Monday .
The spider is made out of steel and poplar wood and is operated by up to 12 people strapped to her frame .
The creature was built in Nantes before being shipped to Merseyside to be assembled in a secret location .
In May 2006 , the company 's Sultan 's Elephant drew an estimated one million people to the streets of London .

SAN FRANCISCO — Apple Inc. CEO
Steve Jobs took the wraps off a revamped line of iPods on Tuesday and trumpeted a truce with NBC Universal that means the TV network will begin selling programs again on iTunes .
The iPod announcements were largely expected , and investors were less than energized , sending Apple 's shares down $ 6.24 , 4 percent , to close at $ 151.68 .
The iPod upgrades Jobs revealed Tuesday in a theater in San Francisco include two slick new Nano models , oval - shaped devices that Jobs said are the thinnest iPods Apple has ever made .
They are less than a quarter - inch thick .
A $ 149 version comes with 8 gigabytes of memory ( enough for 2,000 songs ) ; a 16 - gigabyte version ( which holds 4,000 songs ) is $ 199 .
The new models acknowledge the incredible appetite for iPods -- Jobs said Apple has sold 160 million iPods since their introduction in 2001 , making them the runaway leader among portable music players .
But Apple has to work hard to differentiate them from the iPhone , Apple 's cell phone / iPod / Internet device that threatens to cannibalize some of the demand for iPods .
Jobs also showed off three new versions of the iPod Touch , which is much like an iPhone except that does n't make calls .
An 8 - gigabyte version of the new model will sell for $ 229 ; a 16 - gigabyte Touch will be $ 299 and a 32 GB model will be $ 399 .
Apple hopes the 32 - gigabyte unit will appeal to people who download a lot of games and other programs , and would n't be able to store them all on an iPhone , which tops out at 16 gigabytes .
Jobs said people have downloaded a " mind - blowing " 100 million applications for iPhones and iPod Touch devices since Apple began offering the programs online two months ago .
" We do n't think of it as cannibalization , " said Philip Schiller , Apple 's senior vice president of product marketing .
" As long as they want an Apple product , we 're happy . "
But Ross Rubin , an analyst with market researcher NPD Group , said Apple 's focus on the Nano and its new features indicates otherwise .
Among the new twists : A " shake to shuffle " feature that lets people mix up their iPod playlists by giving the device a hard , abrupt shake .
Jobs also showed off a new " genius " feature in iTunes and the iPod 's onboard software .
If a user clicks the genius button while listening to a song , the program automatically creates a new playlist of similar songs from the user 's own library .
The software determines similarity in part by analyzing which songs other people have together in their libraries .
In the deal with NBC , the television network is coming back to iTunes a year after pulling out in a dispute over the prices Apple charges for shows it sells on the online service .
At that time , programming controlled by NBC Universal , a unit of General Electric Co. , made up an estimated 40 percent of the video downloads on iTunes .
At the height of the spat , Apple said NBC had sought more than double the wholesale prices for its shows , which would have resulted in shows selling for $ 4.99 each .
NBC disputed that , and said it wanted only to be able to sell programs at different prices .
But with its muscle in the market for digital downloads , Apple largely appears to have won the battle .
NBC 's programming will sell for the same prices as other TV shows available on iTunes .
High - definition shows , a new addition for iTunes , will sell for $ 2.99 each .
Shows in standard definition cost $ 1.99 .
Some older shows are available for 99 cents apiece .
NBC was able to wring some concessions .
Jean - Briac Perrette , NBC Universal 's president for digital distribution , said NBC will be allowed to bundle programs together and set prices for those packages as well as for full seasons of shows .
Apple was n't willing to budge on those requests in earlier negotiations .
Perrette said NBC is " thrilled to be back on iTunes " but noted the network also has " a lot of other avenues " to sell shows online , including its own site and a video Web site , Hulu.com , that it created with News Corp .
Jobs gave the start of the event some buzz by flashing a message on a screen behind him :
" The reports of my death are greatly exaggerated . "
Jobs borrowed that line from Mark Twain in reference to obituary preparedness on Jobs that was accidentally posted by Bloomberg News and then retracted .
News outlets regularly prepare obituary material on famous people .
Questions about Jobs ' health swirled after he appeared gaunt at a recent Apple event .
Apple has since said Jobs , 53 , a survivor of pancreatic cancer , suffered from a bug and is better .
He appeared thin but energetic Tuesday .

McCain's Ambien Use : a Security Threat ?
While the sleep drug is known for its side effects , experts say they are rare .
May 23 , 2008  --
In a presidential race marked by references to preparedness in the face of the 3 a.m. call , the revelation that presumptive Republican nominee Sen .
John McCain has taken the sleeping pill Ambien during his travels raises concerns that the rare side effects of the medication could impair his judgment .
" Taking more than the recommended dosage of Ambien or combining it with other sedative - hypnotics — for example , alcohol — may result in amnesia , fugue states and sleep walking , " said Dr. Peter A. Fotinakes , medical director of the St. Joseph Sleep Disorders Center in Orange , Calif .
" Used appropriately , Ambien is a relatively safe medication . "
Though rare , such side effects associated with Ambien have made headlines .
Patients who claimed that they engaged in a bizarre variety of activities while asleep after taking the drug — from binge eating to driving their cars while asleep — lodged class action lawsuit in 2006 against Sanofi -Aventis , the maker of the drug .
The unusual side effects of the drug once again made headlines a few months later , when Rhode Island Rep. Patrick Kennedy smashed his Ford Mustang into a barrier near Capitol Hill .
He later released a statement saying that he had been disoriented by two prescription medications he had taken , one of which was Ambien .
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has uncovered more than a dozen reports of sleep - driving , all linked to the drug .
Partly in response to such reports , the FDA urged sleep drug manufacturers on March 14 , 2007 to strengthen their package labeling to include warnings of sleep walking , " sleep driving " and other behaviors .
Still , some sleep experts maintained that the rarity of these side effects , coupled with the wide use of the drug , make it unlikely that a problem would arise if the commander - in - chief were taking the pills .
" I suspect that drugs like Ambien are used very commonly by government officials , particularly when crossing time zones , " noted Dr. Donald W. Greenblatt , director of the Strong Sleep Disorders Center at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
" Temazepam was used extensively to facilitate British troop transport to the Falkland Islands years ago , " he added .
" You may recall the talk of President Bush Sr. taking his " little blue pill " — Halcion — to help sleep when traveling .
These drugs —
Ambien less so than Halcion — have the potential to alter behavior and actions if the person taking them tries to stay awake . "
Dr. Emmanuel Mignot , professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Stanford University School of Medicine , agreed that McCain 's use of Ambien would likely pose little concern .
" It is perfectly legitimate to use Ambien when traveling , " he said .
" I would say that overall I would prefer to have a commander - in - chief well rested when he is traveling after taking Ambien rather than someone who is sleep - deprived because of jet lag .
" The only potential issue is if there is an emergency in the middle of the night , but honestly , I am not sure it is worse than being sleep - deprived there too .
Of course , Ambien can have side effects , for example on memory — sleep deprivation too .
Life is a trade off . "
Timing Is Everything
But while the overall risks of behavioral and judgment effects due to Ambien may be low , sleep experts agree that in a high - importance role such as the presidency , proper planning is needed when considering its use .
" Ambien should only be taken when you have a window of seven to eight hours for sleep , " Greenblatt said .
" Your staff should know that you 've taken the medication , and that you should not be involved in any decision - making during that time . "
Fotinakes added that sleeping pills and other sedatives have been proven to be more potent in the elderly .
In light of this , he said , " It may not be the best idea for the commander - in - chief to be under the influence when he or she may have to make a snap decision regarding national security in the middle of the night ; Hillary 's so - called telephone call at 3:00 a.m . "
Other sedatives — such as antihistamines and alcohol — could have similar effects , he added .
" Yet , most people would not turn a hair if the president had a few shots before retiring to bed . "
And as long as he is cautious in his timing , McCain may have little problem with the side effects of Ambien — a widely used drug which accounted for more than 45 million prescriptions in the United States in 2005 .
" The key is to use Ambien - like sleeping medications in moderation and do n't mix them with other sedative drugs or alcohol , " Fotinakes said .
" Most importantly , avoid use in the event you have to consider escalation from Defcon 4 to Defcon 3 . "
This is the day of reckoning for Wall Street .
The bankruptcy of
Lehman Brothers , the sale of Merrill Lynch , and the troubles at
American International Group have combined to send huge shock waves throughout the financial world .
Who could be next and when does the credit storm ease up ?
How does Washington deal with the fallout ?
Here is where we stand :
The Fallout :
Stocks fell sharply around the world , with the benchmark Dow Jones industrial average in the U.S. tumbling more than 300 points , or more than 2.5 percent , before rebounding slightly .
London fell as much as 5
percent and Frankfurt as much as 4 percent before recovering somewhat ;
European indexes generally were down 3 to 4 percent as floor trading ended .
Bank stocks are among the biggest losers .
The major Asian markets — Tokyo , Hong Kong , and Shanghai — were closed for a holiday today .
Australia closed down 1.8 percent , while Singapore fell 3.3 percent .
Credit default swaps also soared across the board .
Even financially sound companies like General Electric were hit by investors suddenly skittish about everyone 's creditworthiness .
G.E.'s finance unit , GE Capital , saw its swaps jump by more than half today , to 348 basis points from 209
basis points on Friday .
That means the cost to protect $ 10 million of
GE Capital 's debt rose to $ 348,000 a year today from $ 205,000 last week .
The Unwinding : The parent company , Lehman Brothers Holdings , filed
for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in U.S. bankruptcy court in
Manhattan .
None of its broker - dealer subsidiaries are included in the filing , and they are continuing to operate .
Lehman 's bankruptcy is the biggest by a financial institution since Drexel Burnham Lambert , the firm whose fortunes rose and crashed with the junk - bond market , filed for Chapter 11 in 1990 .
Like Drexel , Lehman is expected to ultimately go into a runoff as it unwinds its trades .
Whether an unwinding can be orderly in the current environment is the $ 1 trillion question .
On Sunday , the International Swaps and Derivatives Association , a trade group , organized an extraordinary ad hoc Sunday trading session .
The goal was to give financial institutions a chance to offset their exposure to credit derivatives tied to the weakest of the stricken banks , Lehman Brothers .
But analysts say that the liquidation of Lehman will put the financial markets under pressure for some time as banks are forced to take additional write - downs and credit spreads widen .
And the * Wall Street Journal * reports that some traders are having trouble trying to find new counterparties for their trades with Lehman .
The Next Victim :
The financial firm seen as the most vulnerable is now clearly the
American International Group .
The insurance giant , desperate for new capital as its losses mount , may announce asset sales as soon as today .
The company has also reportedly asked the Federal Reserve for $ 40
billion in short - term financing .
A.I.G. lost more than $ 13
billion in the first half of this year , most of it due to investments in mortgaged - backed securities and other debt - related instruments .
And there may be others .
Still overhanging the financial - services industry is the fate of Washington Mutual , one of the nation 's largest mortgage lenders .
A team of private equity firms pumped $ 7 billion into the thrift last April , but its losses have continued to mount and its shares barely paused in their slide .
They have lost more than 90
percent of their value in the last year , and closed on Friday at just over $ 2 .
The End of the Investment Bank : With Bank of America's $ 44 billion acquisition
of Merrill Lynch , only two independent Wall Street firms remain :
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley .
Will they now feel pressure to merge with a big commercial bank ?
When it was clear that there would be no rescue deal for Lehman , Merrill Lynch chose to welcome a suitor before its own situation was untenable .
With the deal ,
Bank of America leaps over Citigroup to become a behemoth in every niche of finance , from credit cards to derivatives .
Is the financial supermarket back ?
First , let me clear up a misstatement .
I am not a co-creator of Unix .
I suppose I am described that way because I am co-author ( with Brian Kernighan ) of a book about Unix , but neither Brian nor I would want to take credit for creating Unix .
Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created Unix and deserve all the credit , and more .
I joined their group - the Computing Science Research Center of Bell Labs - after 7th Edition Unix had come out .
Comparing patents to nuclear weapons is a bit extreme .
I was very careful to define my terms in that talk ( it was never a paper ) .
I was speaking primarily about operating systems and most of what I said then ( early 2000 ) is still true .
Here at Google the issues are quite different .
The scale of the problem we 're trying to solve is so vast there are always challenges .
I find it interesting that the slide in that talk about ' Things to Build ' is a close match to the stuff we 're doing at Google , if you squint a bit .
To summarize : GUI : Google put the cleanest , prettiest UI on the internet and work continues to find new ways to present data and make it easy to explore .
Component architectures :
We use a number of big ( BIG ! ) piece parts like the Google File System ( GFS ) and MapReduce ( see the paper by Jeff Dean and Sanjay Ghemawat in the upcoming OSDI http://labs.google.com/papers/mapreduce.html ) to build massive engines for processing data .
Using those pieces we can harness zillions of machines with a few keystrokes to attack a problem like indexing the entire internet .
( OK , it 's not quite that easy , but it 's still amazing . )
I have a daily test job I run to monitor the health of one of the systems I 'm developing ; it uses a week of CPU time but runs for only a few minutes of real time .
Languages for distributed computing : I 'm part of a team working on something along those lines that we hope to write up soon .
Bringing data to the user instead of the other way around :
Those damn browsers are still in the way , but other ways of connecting to data are starting to appear , things like the Google API .
However , the surface is barely scratched on this topic .
System administration : Google 's production people are phenomenal at keeping all those machines humming and ready for your queries .
They demonstrated that there was real progress to be made in the field of system administration , and they continue to push forward .
Is n't it just that today there are a lot more computers , a lot more programmers , and most people are familiar with what computers and programmers do ?
I 'm not sure I understand your reference to 1995 , but twenty or thirty years ago , computers were big expensive temples of modernity and anyone who could control their power was almost by definition a wizard .
Today , even musicians can use computers ( hi gary ) .
One of the most interesting projects out there , one I am peripherally ( but only peripherally ) involved with , is the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope http://www.lsst.org , which will scan the visible sky to very high angular precision , in multiple colors , many times a year .
It 's got an 8.4 meter aperture and 10 square degree field , taking an image every 20 seconds with its 3 gigapixel ( sic ) camera .
The resulting data set will be many petabytes of image and catalog data , a data miner 's dream .
The software for the telescope is as big a challenge as the instrument itself ; just the real - time pixel pipeline on the mountain will make today 's compute clusters look wimpy .
This is not the first time databases and file systems have collided , merged , argued , and split up , and it wo n't be the last .
The specifics of whether you have a file system or a database is a rather dull semantic dispute , a contest to see who 's got the best technology , rigged in a way that neither side wins .
Well , as with most technologies , the solution depends on the problem ; there is no single right answer .
What 's really interesting is how you think about accessing your data .
File systems and databases provide different ways of organizing data to help find structure and meaning in what you 've stored , but they 're not the only approaches possible .
Moreover , the structure they provide is really for one purpose : to simplify accessing it .
Once you realize it's the access , not the structure , that matters , the whole debate changes character .
One of the big insights in the last few years , through work by the internet search engines but also tools like Udi Manber 's glimpse , is that data with no meaningful structure can still be very powerful if the tools to help you search the data are good .
In fact , structure can be bad if the structure you have does n't fit the problem you 're trying to solve today , regardless of how well it fit the problem you were solving yesterday .
So I do n't much care any more how my data is stored ; what matters is how to retrieve the relevant pieces when I need them .
Grep was the definitive Unix tool early on ; now we have tools that could be characterized as `grep my machine ' and `grep the Internet ' .
GMail , Google 's mail product , takes that idea and applies it to mail : do n't bother organizing your mail messages ; just put them away for searching later .
It 's quite liberating if you can let go your old file - and - folder - oriented mentality .
Expect more liberation as searching replaces structure as the way to handle data .
It 's unfair to say `systematically dismantled ' , as though it was a deliberate process and there 's nothing left .
A more honest assessment might be that changes in the market and in government regulation made it harder to keep a freewheeling research lab thriving at the scale of the old Bell Labs .
Bell Labs
Research is much smaller these days , but there are still some very bright people working there and they 're doing great stuff .
I hope one day to see Bell Labs restored to its former glory , but the world has changed enough that that may never happen .
I could go on for pages about the old Bell Labs culture , but I must be brief .
When I arrived , in 1980 , the Computing Science Research Center , also known as 127 ( later 1127 ; therein lies a tale ) had recently launched 7th Edition Unix and the Center , after a long period of essentially zero growth , was just entering a period of rapid expansion .
That expansion brought in a lot of new people with new ideas .
I was a graphics guy then , and I hooked up with Bart Locanthi , another graphics guy , and we brought graphics to Research Unix with the Blit .
Other folks brought in new languages , novel hardware , networking ; all kinds of stuff .
That period in the early 80s generated a lot of ideas that influenced Unix both within the Labs and in the outside community .
I believe the fact that the Center was growing was a big part of its success .
The growth not only provided new ideas , it also generated a kind of enthusiasm that does n't exist in the steady state or in a shrinking group .
Universities harness a variant of that energy with the continuous flow of graduate students ; in industrial research you need to create it in other ways .
One odd detail that I think was vital to how the group functioned was a result of the first Unix being run on a clunky minicomputer with terminals in the machine room .
People working on the system congregated in the room - to use the computer , you pretty much had to be there .
( This idea did n't seem odd back then ; it was a natural evolution of the old hour - at - a - time way of booking machines like the IBM 7090 . )
The folks liked working that way , so when the machine was moved to a different room from the terminals , even when it was possible to connect from your private office , there was still a ` Unix room ' with a bunch of terminals where people would congregate , code , design , and just hang out .
( The coffee machine was there too . )
The Unix room still exists , and it may be the greatest cultural reason for the success of Unix as a technology .
More groups could profit from its lesson , but it 's really hard to add a Unix - room - like space to an existing organization .
You need the culture to encourage people not to hide in their offices , you need a way of using systems that makes a public machine a viable place to work - typically by storing the data somewhere other than the ' desktop ' - and you need people like Ken and Dennis ( and Brian Kernighan and Doug McIlroy and Mike Lesk and Stu Feldman and Greg Chesson and ... ) hanging out in the room , but if you can make it work , it 's magical .
When I first started at the Labs , I spent most of my time in the Unix room .
The buzz was palpable ; the education unparalleled .
( And speaking of Doug , he 's the unsung hero of Unix .
He was manager of the group that produced it and a huge creative force in the group , but he 's almost unknown in the Unix community .
He invented a couple of things you might have heard of : pipes and - get this - macros .
Well , someone had to do it and that someone was Doug .
As Ken once said when we were talking one day in the Unix room , " There 's no one smarter than Doug . " )
The future does indeed seem to have an OO hue .
It may have bearing on Unix , but I doubt it ;
Unix in all its variants has become so important as the operating system of the internet that whatever the Java applications and desktop dances may lead to , Unix will still be pushing the packets around for a quite a while .
On a related topic , let me say that I 'm not much of a fan of object - oriented design .
I 've seen some beautiful stuff done with OO , and I 've even done some OO stuff myself , but it 's just one way to approach a problem .
For some problems , it 's an ideal way ; for others , it 's not such a good fit .
Here 's an analogy .
If you want to make some physical artifact , you might decide to build it purely in wood because you like the way the grain of the wood adds to the beauty of the object .
In fact many of the most beautiful things in the world are made of wood .
But wood is not ideal for everything .
No amount of beauty of the grain can make wood conduct electricity , or support a skyscraper , or absorb huge amounts of energy without breaking .
Sometimes you need metal or plastic or synthetic materials ; more often you need a wide range of materials to build something of lasting value .
Do n't let the fact that you love wood blind you to the problems wood has as a material , or to the possibilities offered by other materials .
The promoters of object - oriented design sometimes sound like master woodworkers waiting for the beauty of the physical block of wood to reveal itself before they begin to work .
" Oh , look ; if I turn the wood this way , the grain flows along the angle of the seat at just the right angle , see ? "
Great , nice chair .
But will you notice the grain when you 're sitting on it ?
And what about next time ?
Sometimes the thing that needs to be made is not hiding in any block of wood .
OO is great for problems where an interface applies naturally to a wide range of types , not so good for managing polymorphism ( the machinations to get collections into OO languages are astounding to watch and can be hellish to work with ) , and remarkably ill - suited for network computing .
That 's why I reserve the right to match the language to the problem , and even - often - to coordinate software written in several languages towards solving a single problem .
It 's that last point - different languages for different subproblems - that sometimes seems lost to the OO crowd .
In a typical working day I probably use a half dozen languages - C , C++ , Java , Python , Awk , Shell - and many more little languages you do n't usually even think of as languages - regular expressions , Makefiles , shell wildcards , arithmetic , logic , statistics , calculus - the list goes on .
Does object - oriented design have much to say to Unix ?
Sure , but no more than functions or concurrency or databases or pattern matching or little languages or .... Regardless of what I think , though , OO design is the way people are taught to think about computing these days .
I guess that 's OK - the work does seem to get done , after all - but I wish the view was a little broader .
Those days are dead and gone and the eulogy was delivered by Perl .
Neither .
When I was a lad , I hacked up the 6th Edition ed with Tom Duff , Hugh Redelmeier , and David Tilbrook to resuscitate qed , the editor Ken Thompson wrote for CTSS that was the inspiration for the much slimmer ed.
( Children must learn these things for themselves . )
Dennis Ritchie has a nice history of qed at http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/qed.html>
I liked qed for one key reason : it was really good at editing a number of files simultaneously .
Ed only handled one file at a time .
Ed and qed were command - driven line editors designed for printing terminals , not full - screen displays .
After I got to Bell Labs , I tried out vi but it could only handle one file at a time , which I found too limiting .
Then I tried emacs , which handled multiple files but much more clumsily than qed .
But the thing that bothered me most about vi and emacs was that they gave you a two - dimensional display of your file but you had only a one - dimensional input device to talk to them .
It was like giving directions with a map on the table , but being forced to say " up a little , right , no back down , right there , yes turn there that 's the spot " instead of just putting your finger on the map .
( Today , emacs and vi support the mouse , but back in 1980 the versions I had access to had no support for mice .
For that matter , there were n't really many mice yet .
)
So as soon as the Blit started to work , it was time to write an editor that used the mouse as an input device .
I used qed ( mostly ) and emacs ( a little ) to write the first draft of jim , a full - screen editor that showed you text you could point to with a mouse .
Jim handled multiple files very smoothly , and was really easy to use , but it was not terribly powerful .
( Similar editors had been at Xerox PARC and other research labs but , well , children must learn these things for themselves . )
A few years later I took the basic input idea of jim and put a new ed - like command language underneath it and called it sam , a locally popular editor that still has its adherents today .
To me , the proof of sam 's success was that it was the first full screen editor Ken Thompson liked .
( He 's still using it . )
Here 's the SP&E paper about sam from 1987 : http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/sam/sam.pdf
A few years later , I decided the pop -up menu model for commanding an editor with a mouse was too restrictive , so I started over and built the much more radical Acme , which I 'm using to write these answers .
Here 's the Acme paper : http://plan9.bell-labs.com/sys/doc/acme/acme.pdf
I do n't expect any Slashdot readers to switch editors after reading these papers ( although the code is available for most major platforms ) , but I think it 's worth reading about them to see that there are ways of editing - and working - that span a much larger gamut than is captured by the question , ' Emacs or vi ? 'Ken Thompson and I started Plan 9 as an answer to that question .
The major things we saw wrong with Unix when we started talking about what would become Plan 9 , back around 1985 , all stemmed from the appearance of a network .
As a stand - alone system , Unix was pretty good .
But when you networked Unix machines together , you got a network of stand - alone systems instead of a seamless , integrated networked system .
Instead of one big file system , one user community , one secure setup uniting your network of machines , you had a hodgepodge of workarounds to Unix 's fundamental design decision that each machine is self - sufficient .
Nothing 's really changed today .
The workarounds have become smoother and some of the things we can do with networks of Unix machines are pretty impressive , but when ssh is the foundation of your security architecture , you know things are n't working as they should .
Looking at things from a lower altitude : I did n't use Unix at all , really , from about 1990 until 2002 , when I joined Google .
( I worked entirely on Plan 9 , which I still believe does a pretty good job of solving those fundamental problems . )
I was surprised when I came back to Unix how many of even the little things that were annoying in 1990 continue to annoy today .
In 1975 , when the argument vector had to live in a 512 - byte - block , the 6th Edition system would often complain , ' arg list too long ' .
But today , when machines have gigabytes of memory , I still see that silly message far too often .
The argument list is now limited somewhere north of 100 K on the Linux machines I use at work , but come on people , dynamic memory allocation is a done deal !
I started keeping a list of these annoyances but it got too long and depressing so I just learned to live with them again .
We really are using a 1970s era operating system well past its sell - by date .
We get a lot done , and we have fun , but let 's face it , the fundamental design of Unix is older than many of the readers of Slashdot , while lots of different , great ideas about computing and networks have been developed in the last 30 years .
Using Unix is the computing equivalent of listening only to music by David Cassidy .
At the risk of contradicting my last answer a little , let me ask you back :
Does the kernel matter any more ?
I do n't think it does .
They 're all the same at some level .
I do n't care nearly as much as I used to about the what the kernel does ; it 's so easy to emulate your way back to a familiar state .
Applications - web browsers , MP3 players , games , all that jazz - and networks are where the action is today , and aside from irritating little incompatibilities , the kernel has become a commodity .
Almost all the programs I care about can run above Windows , Unix , Plan 9 , and on PCs , Macs , palmtops and more .
And that , of course , is why these all have a POSIX interface : so they can support those applications .
And then there 's the standard network protocols to glue things together .
It 's all a uniform sea of interoperability ( and bugs ) .
I think the future lies in new hardware as much as in new software .
A generation from now machines will be so much more portable than they are now , so much more powerful , so much more interactive that we have n't begun to think about the changes they will bring .
This may be the biggest threat to Microsoft : the PC , the desktop , the laptop , will all go the way of the slide rule .
As one example , when flexible organic semiconductor displays roll out in a few years , the transformation in how and where people use computers and other devices will be amazing .
It 's going to be a wild ride .===============

Barack Obama continued his relentless assault directed at John McCain ’s remarks about the economy tonight in Peublo , Colorado .
Obama has pounced on McCain for repeating earlier today that he believes that the fundamentals of the American economy are strong .
After he caught seven shades of hell for saying this , he clarified that what he really meant to say was that American workers are the backbone of our economy .
This led Obama to reply , “ Now come on , Senator McCain .
We know you meant what you said the first time because you ’ve said it before .
And your chief economic advisor – the man who wrote your economic plan – said that we ’re in a “ mental recession ; ” that this is all in our heads ; that we ’re a nation of whiners . ”
“ I think it ’s good that Senator McCain is celebrating the American worker today .
But it would have been nice if he stood up for them over the last twenty - six years .
It would ’ve been nice if he did n’t vote against the minimum wage nineteen times ; or if he did n’t vote to privatize Social Security and hand it over to Wall Street
…
It would be nice if he had a plan to lower the health care costs of American workers – or get them any health care at all ; and if he had championed a single plan to make college more affordable , ” Obama continued .

Obama told McCain that he ca n’t run away from his record , “ Senator McCain – you ca n’t run away from your words or your record .
When it comes to this economy , you ’ve stood firmly with George Bush and a failed economic theory , and what you ’re offering the American people is more of the same . ”
It seems that John McCain feels otherwise when it comes to his record because he is doing everything in his power to run away from it as fast as he can .
McCain does n’t offer any answers when it comes to the economy .
When he is asked about it , all he does is mumble the same tried and flawed Republican theories that got us into this mess in the first place .
McCain might have been able to get away with this statement , if this was the first time that he had stated his belief in the strength of the economy , but this was n’t the first time that he has said this , or even the second , or third .
However if McCain really believes that the economy is so good , why is trying so hard to avoid talking about it ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - New York Gov. David Paterson on Monday said Wall Street might lay off 40,000 workers in a worst - case scenario following Lehman Brother ’s bankruptcy filing and problems at other big financial firms .
Paterson , speaking a news conference where he also noted the impact of Bank of America ’s surprise agreement to purchase Merrill Lynch and problems threatening insurer American International Group , said the impact of the financial sector ’s downturn may not be known for months or even years .
The Democratic governor at the news conference also announced plans to aid American International Group , allowing the insurer access to $ 20 billion of its own capital , staving off a liquidity crisis .
Paterson , who said he would not put any taxpayer dollars at risk , said his efforts to shore up AIG focused on clearing the way for the New York - regulated company to shift money to its parent company from its insurance subsidiaries .
The transaction will serve as a bridge loan .
Paterson blamed the lack of transparency in credit markets for the financial sector ’s meltdown , saying many transactions were “ beyond the perusal ” of regulators .
“ We will not expose the taxpayers of this state to any risk or any reorganization where we do n’t have the ability to scrupulously understand and research the facts , ” he said .
New York ’s banks and brokerages generate one of every five tax dollars in the state .
The state ’s budget is already suffering from declines on Wall Street , and Paterson last month had said that tax revenues would be hurt by declines in Wall Street bonuses .

Paterson , who got lawmakers to cut the state ’s budget by more than $ 400 million in August in an emergency session , on Monday said he might have to recall lawmakers again , saying he would not be surprised if the deficit spiraled back up .
In addition to job cuts on Wall Street , Paterson as many as 120,000 jobs might be cut if positions in service industries that rely on Wall Street are included .
Bankers , brokers and traders earned an average salary and bonus of $ 340,312 a year in 2006 , according to James Brown , a labor market analyst with the state Labor Department .
AIG employs 8,500 people in the state , including 6,000 who work in the city , Paterson said .
Merrill Lynch has around 60,000 employees around worldwide , while Lehman Brothers has about 26,000 workers .
Wall Street ’s job force totaled 181,000 in July , which was down 11,000 from July 2007 , Brown said .
Employment on Wall Street peaked at 200,300 in December 2000 .
Financial sector jobs help create as many as four other positions in services ranging from legal to sales , according to Ross DeVol , director of regional economics , for the Santa Monica , California - based Milken Institute .
The total amount of compensation Wall Street pays is equal to almost 35 percent of all salaries and wages earned in the city , according to city officials .
They 're weird , vulgar and men do n't even like them .
So why do 26,000 British women a year disfigure themselves with breast enlargements ?
The first time I saw a pair of surgically enhanced breasts with my own eyes was around eight or nine years ago , in the changing rooms of the gym at a private members ' club where a friend had taken me for a workout .
I remember it distinctly .
I was getting undressed , nervously , as I do n't like disrobing in front of strangers ; and there was another woman , a few feet away , topless , with oddly firm , projectile breasts pointing skywards .
My first reaction was shock .
Two very weird , alien body parts , brazenly displayed right in front of me .
They did n't look real or natural in the slightest .
They looked like what they were : breasts that had been bought and paid for .
Not soft and slightly saggy , like a thirtysomething embonpoint should be ; but plastic , hard - looking and aggressively perfect .
I felt like I 'd been slapped in the face .
Unapologetically false :
The surgically ' enhanced ' Victoria Beckham , Pamela Anderson and Jordan
They announced aspiration .
They said : ' I 'm considerably richer than you ' , and ' I 'm considerably more attractive than you ' , and even ' Money well spent ' .
There was an unmistakable air of conspicuous consumption in this woman 's light golden tan and bizarrely pert orbs .
I felt instantly sickened , and turned away .
I put it down to our surroundings .
This was , after all , an overtly moneyed members ' club .
I told myself it was precisely these types of people - rich , successful , conventionally attractive - who had such things ' done ' .
This woman 's fake , tanned bosom seemed to symbolise a jet - set lifestyle : a vulgar , ostentatious and knowing signifier of social status .
It galvanised my opinion , anyway .
I did n't like what I 'd seen , and would never have it done myself .
But I 'd always assumed men liked them .
Do n't all men like big , voluptuous , bountiful breasts ?
But that , perhaps , was where I went wrong .
A few years later , a boyfriend told me an apocryphal story about how the Los Angeles pornography industry was importing Russian and Eastern European actresses with real breasts , because the video directors in LA were fed up with the way their American counterparts ' silicone breasts did n't move and bounce with the same sensual jiggle .
Even so , I 'd brushed that aside , still convinced that the average man would rather fondle a burgeoning cup that had been surgically enhanced than a modest A , or even B - sized , pillow .
Fake breasts have lost their shock value : Pamela Anderson
And so it was with great relief that this month I read in GQ magazine an impassioned polemic - Fear Of Fake Breasts , by the novelist Tony Parsons .
Parsons 's argument runs as follows : fake breasts are ' like plastic fruit ' - good to look at , but not to touch .
' They are not there to be fondled , kissed or felt ; they are there to be admired , discussed , lusted after and photographed .
The moment they are touched - and I mean in the heat of passion , rather than out of curiosity or in the interests of scientific research - then the spell is broken .
' And this is true of all fake breasts , no matter how much money has been spent on this act of female selfmutilation . '
The scales fell from my eyes .
I 'd always considered my problem with fake breasts to be just that : a problem with me .
I was n't post - feminist enough ; I was n't post - modern enough .
I was still entranced by those early feminist texts I 'd read aged 16 - The Female Eunuch , The Women 's Room - books that railed against women 's representation in society as doll - like male fantasy figures .
In particular , I hated the idea of women undergoing general anaesthetic , and thus risking life and limb , to adhere to some ideal of pneumatic , Barbie - like ' perfection ' .
So for me it 's been truly liberating to find that men ( whom I had assumed might sanction or applaud any degree of painful female body modification if it titillates their sexual peccadilloes ) feel the same way , too .
Has she gone false ?
Jessica Simpson
In fact , on several dates recently , I 've found that many modern sensitive male souls are hardly the body fascists of yore .
Men like women of all shapes and sizes .
Contrary to what women themselves think about their bodies , some men find small breasts sexy ; others actively prefer ' overweight ' size 16s over ' perfect ' size 10s .
What 's more , many men find the supposed mammarial perfection of Jordan / Katie Price far more objectionable than women do .
As an archetype of what men might like , the beach - ball sized , unapologetically false look insults their taste and intelligence .
All of which begs the question : if they 're so horrible , and men do n't really like them , why on earth are thousands of woman going under the knife ?
As Parsons says : ' Why are n't there armies of thinking women protesting about the grotesquely booming trade in bogus breasts ? '
He may be wrong on this point .
Some women clearly do find breast enlargement procedures as needless as he does .
' Breast surgery has become just another part of the beauty regime - like applying make - up - and it's unnecessary and unpleasant , ' says the writer Joan Smith .
' It 's treated the same as getting a haircut .
It 's become normalised .
I think any woman considering breast surgery for cosmetic reasons should spend a month in Darfur and then decide if body image is a really important issue . '
Former Cosmopolitan editor Marcelle D'argy Smith agrees .
' Fake breasts have become inescapable , but I think the main reason why women do it is to please men .
They 're trying to fulfil a male fantasy .
' It might make women feel more confident - but it is , ultimately , for men . '
Like me , broadcaster Joan Bakewell finds the synthetic look repellent .
' Fake breasts simply look false .
They lack any kind of beauty , or the softness associated with real breasts .
Implants look like two oranges stuffed in your top . '
These are just a few voices of dissent .
But , generally , women are n't shouting loudly enough .
Yes , we may not like plastic breasts , but there is no denying they play an increasingly prominent role in our society .
Since that first shocking encounter of mine nearly a decade ago , surgically enhanced breasts - or at least images of them - are everywhere .
From Jordan to Victoria Beckham , Jodie Marsh to Pamela Anderson , fake breasts have lost their shock value .
Brigitte Nielsen even had her breast silicone drained live on television last week .
Every series of Big Brother has a requisite pair .
Lisa is this year 's model , purchased by her boyfriend , Mario .
There 's been speculation that Britney , Nicole Richie , Jessica Simpson and Kelly Rowland have had them .
These days , it seems as if no one knows where real ends and fake begins - and that goes for representation of curves in photography , too .
This week , Keira Knightley made a stand against the tyranny of the unnatural bosom when she prevented the makers of her new film , The Duchess , from ' airbrushing ' bigger cups on to her naturally flat chest .
Naturally flat : Keira Knightley
What happens in the world of celebrity now has ramifications for any young woman who watches TV or opens a magazine .
Last year , 26,000 British women went under the knife in the pursuit of bigger breasts , and only 6,497 of those procedures were registered by BAAPS ( the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons ) .
But breast augmentation was still the most popular cosmetic surgical procedure recorded by BAAPS - up 6 per cent from the previous year .
And then there are the ordinary housewives or girls - next - door checking in for their fifth or sixth op , as explored on the recent BBC3 documentary , Addicted To Boob Jobs .
' One woman on the show had had five operations , ' recalls presenter Louise Roe .
' Three were cosmetic and two were reconstructive .
One of the cosmetic operations went wrong and the implant leaked , so she had to have two reconstructive operations after that .
' A lot of the women were very scarred from all the surgery .
There was one lady in particular whose boobs did n't even look like boobs any more . '
And like some of the celebrities , a minority of patients have become psychologically addicted to having their breasts altered and end up having multiple operations .
Breast augmentation , it should be remembered , is n't like going for a blood test .
It is a two - hour general - anaesthetic - and - all operation , with all the usual risks of organ failure and cardiac arrest .
After a successful procedure , drainage tubes are placed in the incision for several days to help eliminate excess fluid .
The chest is wrapped in gauze for a week , and the patient is advised to minimise arm movements to prevent separation of muscle and tissue around the implants .
The enhanced breasts will still droop with age , and implants have a lifespan of around 16 years , so , depending on the woman 's age , will need replacing .
Then there 's the cost .
Although prices have become more ' competitive ' , the guide price for breast implants at Transform , a national chain of cosmetic surgery clinics , costs £ 3,950 for the round , silicone type .
Teardrop shapes are more expensive .
' Glamour model ' sizes are pricier still , since they have to be manufactured specially .
The fallout from the less successful procedures can be catastrophic .
Even the best surgeons admit that risks include lumpy - bumpy appearance , indentations , mismatched breasts , infection , loss of sensation , formation of calcium around implant , bleeding , blood clots , skin loss and implant rupture or leakage .
The advent of the casual , lunchhour op - this week , Sarah Cox , a 27 - year - old beauty therapist from West Bromwich , proudly showed off the results of her injectible boob ' jab ' in one paper - hardly seems to offer a better prognosis .
Why any person would risk so much because a B cup ' just was n't big enough ' seems a triumph of folly over reason .
Consultant plastic surgeon and BAAPS member Patrick Mallucci is indignant about the exposure of breast implants in the media .
He claims that many women in the celebrity spotlight have implants through vanity and the desperate search for fame - which he , like me , finds deeply problematic .
Jodie Marsh recently got a ' double - G' cup boost
However , he reckons that the majority of his patients are women with mastectomies seeking reconstructive surgery , women who 've been born with unnaturally flat chests , and women whose breasts have been ' devastated ' post - pregnancy .
' Very few of my patients are the glamour model types we see in the media , ' says Mallucci .
' I tell them to go to somebody else if they say they want to be like Jordan . '
Mallucci points out that very extreme augmentations - such as those chosen by Katie Price , Pamela Anderson and glamour model Jodie Marsh ( who recently got a ' double - G cup ' boost ) - can ravage the human body and lead a patient on a rocky road towards further corrective operations .
' Big implants cause drooping over time ; they stretch the skin and squash the breast tissue .
' Women who 've had them will definitely need more operations over time - which will , in turn , cause more scarring . '
Despite Mallucci's protestations that the majority of women are not having implants for reasons of vanity , the message conveyed by celebrity magazines is that a boob op has been the answer for women who 've felt dissatisfied with a B cup and wanted a ' little boost ' - to a double D , or more .
I have no issue with the woman who has had a mastectomy ; or the woman whose breasts , abnormally , did not develop at puberty .
What I have a problem with is believing that it is acceptable for consumers to treat themselves to new breasts as they might a new handbag .
The proof , if further were needed , of this dangerously casual attitude to potentially life - threatening surgery are the numerous ads in the back of glossy magazines and on platform - side advertising on London 's Tube .
Companies such as Transform and the Harley Medical Group present the acquisition of fake breasts as being a consumer choice comparable to the purchase of a new car or a sofa , with pay - by - instalment price plans to boot .
And that , in my view , is simply grotesque .
So I take heart from Tony Parsons and his ' Fear of Fake Breasts ' .
If only there were also men out there who would rail against all the other elements of the culture of pornography that seem to have invaded and pervade our everyday lives and beauty predilections - the orange tans , Hollywood bikini waxes and bleach - blonde extensions .
But women , too , need to stop aspiring to the fake silhouette .
Women want new breasts for a variety of reasons , but those in their 30s and 40s who have augmentations because their bosom was slightly sagging are attempting to turn back the clock .
Surely , like facial wrinkles , we need to learn to love the slight imperfections that ageing bestows ?
These are signs that our bodies have travelled and worked and experienced emotions , not scars or disfigurements that should be erased .
If Parsons is right , then men are n't half as critical of our bodies as women might imagine they are .
And while male approbation is the last reason women should avoid cosmetic procedures , we need to start loving ourselves a little more - and stop worshipping dumb- assed celebrities who mutilate their breasts in the name of vanity .

of surfaces .

This innovation is actually the first time where microcontact printing has been used to manufacture and arrange microbattery electrodes .
Furthermore , it is also the first implementation of virus - based assembly in such a procedure .
The technique itself does not require precise conditions ( it can be performed at room temperature ) and void of any expensive equipment .
The design of the battery comprises of two electrodes ; an anode and cathode , which are divided by an electrolyte .
At the present moment , the team at MIT have only developed the anode and the electrolyte .
The process of creating the battery starts with a clear , rubbery material , where the team used a familiar technique labelled soft lithography to form a pattern of tiny posts either four or eight millionths of a meter in diameter .
On top of these posts , several layers of two polymers , which act hand in hand as the solid electrolyte and battery separator , are deposited .
To form the anode , the engineers used viruses that are able to preferentially self - assemble a top the polymer layers on the posts .
This idea was adapted from findings published in 2006 , where Hammond , Belcher , Chiang , and colleagues reported on how to form the anode .
Furthermore , the MIT team modified the virus ’ genes to enable it to produce protein coats that accumulate molecules of cobalt oxide to shape ultrathin wires together with the anode .

The final step was to stamp each tiny post , which were covered with layers of electrolyte and the cobalt oxide anode .
The testing of the current system was performed using lithium foil and by turning the stamp over , the transfer the electrolyte and anode to a platinum structure was made possible .
The latest findings are positive with the team concluding that the resulting electrode arrays are able to display full electrochemical functionality .
Future plans for this engineering team is to research more on using the battery stamp on curved surfaces and integrating the batteries with biological organisms .
TFOT has previously written about Sony ’s sugar - powered batteries , which generate electricity from carbohydrates ( sugar ) .
The device was developed based on the same power generation principles found in living organisms .

Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari has said he will not allow Pakistan 's territory to be violated by terrorists or foreign powers fighting them .
The newly elected president vowed instead to " root out terrorism and extremism wherever and whenever they may rear their ugly heads " .
This was his first speech to MPs since he replaced Pervez Musharraf in August .
Pakistan has been a key ally of the US in its " war on terror " , but relations have become strained over tactics .
In recent months , Pakistan has voiced growing disquiet over US raids targeting militants in its territory , launched from neighbouring Afghanistan .
On Wednesday , at least five people were killed when a US drone fired missiles at a suspected militant target in north - west Pakistan .
Never before in the history of this country has a president given away his powers
Asif Ali Zardari
" I ask of the government that it should be firm in its resolve to not allow the use of its soil for carrying out terrorist activities against any foreign country , " Mr Zardari told MPs .
" We will not tolerate the violation of our sovereignty and territorial integrity by any power in the name of combating terrorism . "
Al - Qaeda and Taleban militants based in Pakistan 's north - west tribal region have repeatedly carried out attacks across the border in Afghanistan .
Militants have also carried out waves of attacks in Pakistan in recent years .
Mr Zardari - generally considered pro-American - is expected to meet US President George W Bush during a visit to the United Nations next week .
' Fewer powers '
The Pakistani president , widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto , also urged parliament to " revisit " the right of the president - introduced by Mr Musharraf - to dissolve the assembly and dismiss the government .
" Never before in the history of this country has a president given away his powers , " he said , eliciting applause from the chamber .
" Another responsibility rest on your shoulders : this is the removal of the distortions in the constitution made by successive dictators to prolong their rules , " he said .
Pakistan returned to full civilian rule last month for the first time since Mr Musharraf came to power in a military coup in 1999 .
" Democracy in Pakistan has finally been restored but it is still a tender sapling which needs nurturing before it becomes a great , sheltering tree , " said Mr Zardari .
" There are still elements who want to derail it yet once again .
With faith in democracy and a national reconciliation as envisioned by Benazir Bhutto , we must remain vigilant against such elements , " he warned .

Colbert : Blaming the woman remains an ' ironclad alibi ' David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday August 14 , 2008
Print This Email This While Attorney General Michael Mukasey says he has no interest in prosecuting any of the former Justice Department officials accused of illegally and improperly inserting politics into hiring decisions , Comedy Central host Stephen Colbert offers a better solution .
" You see , Muskasey knows throwing the people responsible for this mess in jail in jail wo n't fix this mess , " the Colbert Report host said Wednesday night .
" There 's a better solution , and it 's tonight 's word .
Blame Monica Goodling . "
The straight - faced Colbert said the former Justice Department White House liaison and Bush sycophant accused of weeding out potential federal prosecutors based on their political leanings or sexual orientation could only have acted on her own accord in inserting politics into the Department that is supposed to rise above politics .
" Somehow Goodling got the idea to use politics in hiring decisions with out -- and this is important -- without any of her superiors ' knowledge , " he said .
( " They were too busy drafting torture memos , " read the text alongside Colbert . )
Colbert called Goodling an " ironclad alibi " for the beleaguered department .
While the Justice Department 's politicization probe should stop at Goodling , we know she can't be blamed for all the administration 's fault , Colbert said .
For example , the abuses at Abu Ghraib were the fault of Lyndie England .
Colbert also listed other women that could be blamed for various " crimes " or wrongdoings .
Since Valerie Plame " sent her husband to not find evidence Saddam was buying yellowcake uranium , so we can also blame her for there not being WMDs . "
Paris Hilton is also responsible for narcissism infecting politics , Colbert claims .
" Attorney General Mukasey , make sure you make an example of Monica Goodling , " he said .
" Because while it is important that we never have this type of abuse again , it is far more important that we have someone expendable to blame . "

This one is recycling a long debunked July 29 Wall Street Journal op - ed piece by Michael Boskin , chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George H.W. Bush .
The column included some faulty assumptions about Obama 's proposals .
For example , it said Obama might place a new tax of up to 12.4 percent on earnings now exempt from the Social Security payroll tax .
Obama has said his new tax would not exceed 4 percent , and it would apply only to annual incomes above $ 250,000 .
It is also recycling the beyond cynical lying " out of context cut - n - paste use " of FactCheck.org 's actual debunking of McCain 's lying about Obama 's tax proposals .
Fred Eshelman , a pharmaceutical executive -- former Senior VP for Glaxo & board member of Anton Phrama -- is the primary backer of Rightchange.com and is also a max - out donor to McCain , and has contributed more than $ 200,000 to Republicans since 2002 .
Beyond the typical factual lying , it is the right wing faux populism style that really annoys me as in this video .

America Ferrera Thinks TV Has Turned Mean
Ugly Betty staris n't so keen on the way 90210 , The Hills and Gossip Girls portray young adults and the relationships that they have with their friends and enemies .
She believes the shows convey a meanness that is helping to shape the behavior of impressionable viewers .
In a recent interview that America did with Seventeen magazine she shared her thoughts on growing up in the world of television :
" Close , genuine female relationships are not what generally gets depicted in movies and TV shows .
Like , if your watching The Hills or 90210 , all the backstabbing shapes the way we act - you go to school and you think your job is to find a sworn enemy and be jealous of each other .
Shows like Gossip Girls condition us to be mean to each other . "
She is probably right and how about all of the reality shows out there that feed on turmoil .
Perhaps Ferrera should find herself a few actors and actresses who feel the same way and bring back more family oriented television .

On CNN a little while ago , Jeffrey Toobin threw a monkey wrench into the media narrative that persists in crediting John McCain with having “ suspended ” his campaign :
Late Update : The Obama camp tells TPM Election Central that the McCain campaign is directing TV stations across the country to start airing its ads again beginning Saturday , which would mean McCain will be off the air all day Friday only .
It also suggests that McCain is n’t waiting until the bailout plan is approved to resume campaigning .
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?

When the investigations on the Heathrow runway are finished , what will happen to the plane wreckage ?
There are about 143 tonnes of wrecked Boeing 777 lying on and off the runway at Heathrow Airport .
Experts from the Air Accidents Investigation Branch ( AAIB ) are examining the plane and the data recorders to assess what went wrong .
When their interim investigation is finished - probably within the next 24 hours - the clear - up will begin so the runway can open as soon as possible .
THE ANSWER
It will be removed from the runway and taken away to be broken up
The undamaged components will be sold as spares
Any scrap metal will be disposed of by a specialist
As for the wreckage , there 's a range of options .
The plane is most likely a write - off , say aviation commentators , although some of its fittings could be re-used , they speculate .
Judging by the television pictures , it looks like a wreck , says Mark Knight of AMS Systems Engineering , which supplies aircraft recovery equipment to Heathrow Airport and British Airways .
" They will remove it as quickly as possible without much consideration to secondary damage .
I do n't think it will be put back into service . "
Break - up
Had the wings been unscathed and there was a chance the aircraft could fly again , a delicate recovery operation would begin , by lifting the aircraft on airbags , he says .
SECOND LIFE OF A PLANE 1988 : Fragments of Pan Am 103 , blown up above Lockerbie , could end up in a museum in Glasgow 1999 : Qantas Flight 1 was returned to 747 service after overrunning the runway at Bangkok in heavy rain , at a cost of $ 100 m 2008 : BA 's Boeing 777 faces being broken up
The more likely scenario , he thinks , is the wings will be removed , the fuselage lifted by crane on to a truck and taken away to be stripped .
The insurance surveyors will be assessing the damage and making a report , says David Gleave , an independent accident investigator , to decide whether to repair or write it off .
" If they scrap it , they will start to look at bits and pieces that they can recover and are of significant value , " he says .
Horizontal and vertical tail surfaces may not have been damaged and could be kept by Boeing as spare parts .
The engines are worth about £ 10 m each , he says , and will probably be sent to an engine repair centre , firstly for accident investigation and then for salvage purposes .
There are a lot of parts that could be used again even if they 're not put back on to an aeroplane
David Gleave
Accident investigator
The nose cone , weather radar , furnishings and cockpit window could be sold as spare parts if undamaged .
" It looks as if all the avionics under the cockpit will be able to be salvaged and all the cockpit instrumentation , " says Mr Gleave .
" If that can't be sold for spares for operational use it could be sold to a simulator centre who would rebuild the cockpit from there .
" There are a lot of parts that could be used again even if they 're not put back on to an aeroplane . "
Some components are beyond repair
For instance , a training school could bid for the front section of the fuselage , he says .
Planes have been known to return to service after surviving crash landings .
In 1999 a Qantas 747 overran the runway at Bangkok in heavy rain and hit a ground radio antennae , but a $ 100 m repair got it back to work .
However , the insurer will not allow any components to be re-used unless fully certified and as good as new , says Professor Graham Braithwaite , from Cranfield University , which runs a course in aviation accident investigations .
" Seats and furnishing may not be that damaged and may be reusable but airlines will not want customers to feel they are sitting on seats from a crashed plane , " he says .
" The insurer would be very conscious that it does n't want these components getting out of a controlled system . "
WHO , WHAT , WHY ?
A regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ?
aims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines Souvenir hunters hoping to pocket a piece of the plane will be disappointed , says Mr Braithwaite .
The industry is very strict on provenance and will not want any wreckage to appear on the second - hand market .
That means scrap metal from a plane like this cannot just be handed over to a scrap merchant , but has to go to a specialist for disposal .
Some aircraft are just too significant to be scrapped , however mangled .
Almost 20 years after Pan Am flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland , discussions continue about what will happen to fragments of the plane .
The fuselage , about 10 metres tall , is currently held at the AAIB headquarters in Farnborough as evidence in the long - running trial .
But with the appeal about to be concluded , there are several interested parties including the Glasgow 's Museum of Transport .
And while the British Airways plane which crash landed on Thursday , is still largely in one piece , " as far as the integrity of the aircraft is concerned , " says aviation expert Chris Yates , " this is an aircraft that will never fly again .
Essentially it 's a great big lump of scrap metal . "

What are these ?
The Wall Street Journal :
John McCain has made it clear this week he does n’t understand what ’s happening on Wall Street any better than Barack Obama does .
But on Thursday , he took his populist riffing up a notch and found his scapegoat for financial panic — Christopher Cox , the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission … .
Mr. McCain clearly wants to distance himself from the Bush Administration .
But this assault on Mr. Cox is both false and deeply unfair .
It ’s also un-Presidential … .
In a crisis , voters want steady , calm leadership , not easy , misleading answers that will do nothing to help .
Mr. McCain is sounding like a candidate searching for a political foil rather than a genuine solution .
Could the Mars Phoenix lander have been contaminated by bacteria from Earth ?
The possibility was raised by rumor - multipliers feasting on an Aviation Week report that the White House had been briefed on " major new Phoenix lander discoveries concerning the ' potential for life ' on Mars . "
The buzz has since quieted , but it raised the prospect , if only wildly , that the Phoenix found Martian soil so habitable because transplanted microbes flourished there .
But that , say researchers , is highly unlikely .
Mars explorers have a profound self - interest in ensuring that bacterial hitchhikers do n't confound their results : imagine asking for NASA funding after claiming a plucky strain of underarm bacteria as extraterrestrial life .
And if Earthly bacteria survives a trip and then flourishes , it could upset an alien ecosystem – the equivalent of finding something rare and priceless by stepping on it .
" Not every mission is something we worry about .
The concern is when we go to a place where life could exist .
The Phoenix lander is in Category Four , the highest level of concern , " said Margaret Race , a planetary protection expert at the SETI Institute .
The lander was assembled in a chip fabrication - style clean room , said Race , and thoroughly cleaned afterwards .
A few microbial spores inevitably make it through , or are picked up during launch – " but what 's probability that it will stay through launch , go through re-entry , and stay on the spacecraft ? " she said .
" And then , if it gets jostled off , could it survive ?
And grow and reproduce ?
At each point there 's a lower and lower probability . "
Of course , bacteria are fabled for their ability to colonize extreme environments : strains have evolved to survive everything from Antarctic ice to nuclear reactors to deep - sea volcanoes .
" But of all the organisms on Earth that might survive in unusual places , what are the chances you 'll find those in a clean room at the
Kennedy Space Center ? " said Race .
The Phoenix lander does contain water taken from Earth for mixing with
Martian soil .
( Since water is ubiquitous in the chemistry of life on
Earth , adding it to just about any Earthly organism gets some sort of rise ; the same , we hope , holds for Mars . )
But Jim Bell , a Cornell University geologist who served on a National
Academies of Science panel on Mars mission contamination , is n't worried .
" There are rigorous controls on the purity of that water , " he said .
It 's distilled , purified , and rigorously checked for the presence of anything other than hydrogen and oxygen .
The last remaining contamination possibility resides in sabotage :
perhaps , tempted by the God - like act of introducing life to another planet , an engineer secretly tucks away microbes modified to withstand solar radiation , deep - space cold and the heat of atmospheric entry .
There 's no guarantee against that .
Though spacecraft assembly is tightly monitored , and contamination is measured at every step of the process , final responsibilities lie with a small group of people – and people can be tricked or corrupted .
But between conscientious , competent engineers and the rigors of interplanetary travel , the odds against contamination are astronomical .
Of course , there 's nothing a good conspiracy theory likes more than astronomical odds , but that could be a positive thing .
Contemplating the possibility of contamination forces people to confront questions of environmentalism in space : what 's our responsibility to non-Earthly life ?
More on that question soon .
In the meantime , read " What to Do About Little Green Goo . "
Note : The* Aviation Week * story that kicked off the life - on - Mars rumor - storm has since been follwed by a report that
Martian soil is unexpectedly bad for life .
The latter story , at least , was sourced and seems plausible : NASA 's scheduled a press conference tomorrow to review the soil results .
But to engage in a little rumor - mongering myself : my own sources suggest that upcoming findings will ease any disappointment you might feel tomorrow . *
* Update : I originally posted that the * Aviation Week story was " retracted . "
This was not the case ; my apologies to the journalist , Craig Covault , for my careless reporting .

How much does sharing " Waiting For A Girl Like You , " " Money For Nothing , " and " Sweet Child O' Mine " on P2P networks cost defendants if they end up in court ?
Arizona resident Jeffrey Howell has just found out the hard way .
While Jammie Thomas came in for more than $ 200,000 of statutory damages in her Minnesota trial last year , Howell escaped with a ( mere ) $ 40,850 fine .
Perhaps he should be grateful , though we doubt that 's the emotion he 's feeling today .
Few of the RIAA 's thousands of cases against individual file - swappers ever make it to trial ; fewer still reach a judgment , making these awards quite unusual .
Howell , who served as his own counsel throughout the trial , did himself no favors by intentionally destroying evidence of his computer activity after being ordered by a judge to preserve it .
According to the RIAA , Howell uninstalled KaZaA and deleted everything in the shared folder , reformatted his hard drive , downloaded and used a file - wiping program , and then nuked all the KaZaA logs on his PC .
Anyone who has seen even a single episode of Perry Mason knows that this is a huge no -no .
Ruling last week that Howell had acted in bad faith , the judge was forced to call the case to a premature close and issue judgment against Howell .
Howell 's punishment was to come at a later date , and the judge has now issued his ruling .
Howell is ordered to pay $ 350 in court costs — an incredible bargain when set against a whopping $ 40,500 in statutory damages .
In addition , he will pay 2.12 percent interest on the unpaid balance until the entire amount is paid off ; in essence , Howell has just taken out a pricey new car loan , except that instead of a car , he gets a big pile of nothing to park in his driveway .
The judge also ordered him to stop infringing copyrights , " including without limitation by using the Internet or any online media distribution system to reproduce ( i.e. , download ) any of Plaintiffs '
Recordings , or to distribute ( i.e. , upload ) any of Plaintiffs ' Recordings . "
And , just for good measure , Howell is instructed to " destroy all copies of those downloaded recordings transferred onto any physical medium or device in Defendant 's possession , custody , or control . "
Given that Howell did n't have the cash even to pay a lawyer , the RIAA may never see all of this money .
Not that it matters ; the PR value of winning these sorts of cases is no doubt reward enough .
The RIAA takeaway from the case will surely be a lesson about how the group will hunt down and then win cases against file - swappers .
The lesson that EFF staff attorney Fred von Lohmann takes from the case , though , is a different one : get yourself a lawyer .
" He never had an adequate opportunity to explain what happened on his PC , while the RIAA had forensics experts and lawyers to tell the story , " von Lohmann told us last week .
" I think if Howell had an expert and lawyer to speak for him , he would have told a different story . "
WASHINGTON —
In another unnerving day for Wall Street , investors suffered their worst losses since the terrorist attacks of 2001 , and government officials raced to prevent the financial crisis from spreading .
Trading opened sharply down Monday morning , and the mood later turned even gloomier , despite efforts by President Bush and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , in separate appearances at the White House , to reassure markets that Wall Street ’s deepening problems would not weaken an already anemic economy .
Amid worries that the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers and the sale of Merrill Lynch over the weekend might not be enough to stop the downward spiral , stocks fell sharply in the last half hour of trading .
By the end of the day , the Dow Jones industrial average had dropped 504.48 points , or 4.4 percent , as a record volume of more than 8 billion shares traded hands on the New York Stock Exchange .
It was the biggest decline since Sept. 17 , 2001 — the day the index reopened after the 9/11 terrorist attacks — when it fell 7 percent , or 684.81 points .
A concern hanging over the market is the fate of other financial companies , most notably the American International Group , one of the world ’s largest insurers .
After the Fed rebuffed a request by the company for a $ 40 billion temporary loan , federal and state officials worked on Monday to stabilize A.I.G. , with the State of New York relaxing rules to allow the company to borrow as much as $ 20 billion in much - needed cash , while the New York Federal Reserve Bank was engaged in talks with JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs on a $ 75 billion loan for the insurer .
The researchers found that restricting the cookies had a profound effect : consumption more than tripled compared with when the cookies were served on plates .
Other studies show that children whose food is highly restricted at home are far more likely to binge when they have access to forbidden foods .
The lesson for parents ?
Do n’t bring foods that you feel the need to restrict into the house .
Instead , buy healthful snacks and give children free access to the food cabinets .
Dieting in front of your children Kids are tuned into their parents ’ eating preferences and are far more likely to try foods if they see their mother or father eating them .
A Rutgers study of parent and child food preferences found that preschoolers tended to like or reject the same fruits and vegetables their parents liked or did n’t like .
And other research has shown girls are more likely to be picky eaters if their mothers do n’t like vegetables .
Given this powerful effect , parents who are trying to lose weight should be aware of how their dieting habits can influence a child ’s perceptions about food and healthful eating .
In one study of 5 - year - old girls , one child noted that dieting involved drinking chocolate milkshakes  her mother was using Slim - Fast drinks .
Another child said dieting meant “ you fix food but you do n’t eat it . ”
A 2005 report in the journal Health Psychology found that mothers who were preoccupied with their weight and eating were more likely to restrict foods for their daughters or encourage them to lose weight .
Daughters of dieters were also more likely to try diets as well .
The problem is , restrictive diets do n’t work for most people and often lead to binge eating and weight gain .
By exposing young children to erratic dieting habits , parents may be putting them at risk for eating disorders or a lifetime of chronic dieting .
“ Most mothers do n’t think their kids are soaking up this information , but they are , ” Dr. Birch said .
“ They ’re teaching it to their daughters even though it does n’t work for them . ”
Serving boring vegetables Calorie - counting parents often serve plain steamed vegetables , so it ’s no wonder children are reluctant to eat them .
Nutritionists say parents should n’t be afraid to dress up the vegetables .
Adding a little butter , ranch dressing , cheese sauce or brown sugar to a vegetable dish can significantly improve its kid appeal .
And adding a little fat to vegetables helps unlock their fat - soluble nutrients .
The few extra calories you ’re adding are a worthwhile tradeoff for the nutritional boost and the chance to introduce a child to a vegetable .
Grant Frear writes about the demise of the knowledge worker after reading Daniel Pink ’s book A Whole New Mind .
Pink says people in rich countries need to move away from left - brain ( linear , organised ) thinking towards more right - brain ( or creative ) thinking .
Frear says ;
“ Well maybe not a complete demise but most certainly a geographic shift ” .
So we wo n’t accuse him of an exaggerated report of the death of knowledge work .
Automation
Frear says work involving logical , repeatable left - brain tasks is better done by computer .
Bosses can offload tasks which are n’t easily automated to Asia where there ’s a cheaper workforce , hence the “ geographic shift ” .
It makes sense .
Low - value work has moved from Australia and New Zealand to Asia for at least a decade .
How often have you rung telephone banking and spoken to someone with a strong Indian accent ?
To make up for this geographic shift , Frear ( or more accurately Frear quoting Pink ) says people in richer countries need to work on their right - brain activities which are largely creative , non-linear and conceptual .
The problem he identifies is most rich - world employers favour left - brain thinking .
They reward people based on these values and not on their creativity .
All of this is true .
Knowledge work , left - brain right - brain
Frear ( or maybe Pink ) assumes knowledge work is a left - brain activity .
It can be but is not always : writing is creative , but a form of knowledge work .
Also , while there are people who seem 100 percent left - brain or right - brain , in reality most show a healthy mix of both .
Rather than requiring a disorienting binary switch from one type of thinking to a totally different one , a smarter strategy might just be to steer one ’s thinking more towards creativity .
If Frear and Pink are right , the good news is that in the future there will be less boring knowledge worker jobs in the richer world and more stimulating work .

Marvel Comics already gave postmodern comedian Stephen Colbert Captain America 's shield .
So why not a shot at saving the world with the help of his friendly neighborhood Spider - Man ?
The two cultural icons will join forces in an eight - page narrative inside the supersize *
Amazing Spider - Man No. 573* , which will mark Colbert 's full Marvel Universe appearance , in continuity no less .
For those interested in the full back story , the unhinged newscaster 's prodigious influence on comics is being tracked on Comedy Central 's Indecision 2008 blog .
Evidently , he is not only safeguarding Cap 's shield here in reality , but also running for president in the Marvel Universe .
Oh , if only life was like comics .

A friend recently pointed out to me that artists of all kinds often make their discoveries early in their working lives .
Writers , painters and musicians , he suggested , frequently know what they want to say and how they want to say it by the time they are 30 .
The rest of their careers are then spent refining these initial discoveries .
It 's an idea that has a great deal of truth .
Look at the retrospective of Francis Bacon that has just opened at Tate Modern , and you see an artist who discovered as a relatively young man a small but resonant set of images that spoke to him .
He then refined this personal iconography over decades .
Major events in his life may have rearranged the furniture a little , but the twisted bodies in the little rooms remain essentially the same .
Samuel Beckett is perhaps the starkest example of a writer whose work was not about discovering new perspectives as he got older , but about refining his vision ; his diminishing word count is evidence of this .
After emerging from the shadow of Joyce , Beckett moved from the novel to the theatre , and his theatre work gradually became shorter and sharper .
The four rootless adults , the boy and the tree in the two - act Waiting for Godot , seem recklessly extravagant compared with the stark images of his later work : the isolated , babbling mouth in Not I , the brief glimpse of litter and the sound of exhalation that constitute the tiny play Breath .
Great artists such as Bacon and Beckett distil ; lesser artists become self - referential and self - conscious as their work goes on .
A personally defined landscape can easily become an enclosed and introverted prison , referring only to itself .
I like to think I 'm open to new experiences and new ways of writing , even though I am now , by anyone 's definition , middle - aged .
It gets harder to encounter new people and new experiences as you get older - not just for artists , but for all of us .
The wide network of friends that I moved in as a young person has now become a handful of familiar faces .
When I was in my 20s I worked in the laundry of a mental hospital , a building society and a drug rehabilitation centre .
Now I sit at a desk all day and write .
Whenever a novel starts with the character of a writer sitting in a Hampstead kitchen , struggling to finish a novel , I throw the book straight in the bin .
I recognise where that impulse to write about writing comes from .
From time to time , I find myself thinking of ideas for plays about screenwriters working in Hollywood , or actors putting on a play .
This terrifies me .
There has been some great writing about writing , terrific films about films , brilliant television about television .
There 's an inevitability about the fact that Ricky Gervais began by telling us stories about an ordinary workplace ( The Office ) , and then , once he was massively successful , moved on to stories about showbusiness ( Extras ) .
But this seems to me something of a dead end .
If it 's a struggle to stay connected to the world as you get older and more established , I think it 's worth it .
It 's not as though the outside world is n't ready to embrace artists .
Recently , I ventured out into north London with a group of young actors , stopping Camden market - goers and asking them about their lives .
We started nervously , assuming that approaching strangers with the opening line , " Hello , I 'm a writer and this is an actor and we 're researching a play , " would meet with a frosty response .
But almost everyone wanted to talk to us , often at great length .
We were humbled by the way many of these people told us deeply personal and often painful things about their lives .
We came away with a great sense of responsibility for the complex and difficult insights into other existences we had been given , often within minutes of meeting people .
No doubt a Freudian would tell me that the outside world only reflects back to me my own inner conflicts .
They may be right : work that seems objectively researched when I 'm writing it is often surprisingly autobiographical when I look back at it later .
Still , I remain committed to seeking new experiences to inform my writing .
If you 'd like to invite a writer to your factory , or mosque , or family get - together , please get in touch .
Kafka once advised writers to sit in a room and wait for the world to reveal itself to them .
Right now , I 'd rather get out and explore .
Algae : Biofuel of the future ?
In the world of alternative fuels , there may be nothing greener than pond scum .
Algae are tiny biological factories that use photosynthesis to transform carbon dioxide and sunlight into energy so efficiently that they can double their weight several times a day , producing oil in the process — 30 times more oil per acre than soybeans , according to the U.S. Department of Energy .
Like soybean oil , the algae oil can be burned directly in diesel engines or further refined into biodiesel .
University of Virginia researchers have a plan to greatly increase algae oil yields by feeding the algae extra carbon dioxide ( the main greenhouse gas ) and organic material like sewage , meaning the algae could simultaneously produce biofuel and clean up environmental problems .
" We have to prove these two things to show that we really are getting a free lunch , " said Lisa Colosi , a U.Va .
professor of civil and environmental engineering who is part of the interdisciplinary research team .
Most previous and current research on algae biofuel , explained Colosi , has used the algae in a manner similar to its natural state — essentially letting it grow in water with just the naturally occurring inputs of atmospheric carbon dioxide and sunlight .
This approach results in a rather low yield of oil — about 1 percent by weight of the algae .
The U.Va. team hypothesizes that feeding the algae more carbon dioxide and organic material could boost the oil yield to as much as 40 percent by weight , Colosi said .
Proving that the algae can thrive with increased inputs of either carbon dioxide or untreated sewage solids will confirm its industrial ecology possibilities — to help with wastewater treatment , where dealing with solids is one of the most expensive challenges , or to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide , such as coal power - plant flue gas , which contains about 10 to 30 times as much carbon dioxide as normal air .
Research partner Mark White , a U.Va. finance professor , will be quantifying the big- picture environmental and economic benefits of algae biofuel compared to soy - based biodiesel under several hypothetical scenarios .
For instance , if the nation instituted a carbon cap - and - trade system , that would increase the monetary value of algae 's ability to dispose of carbon dioxide .
Increased nitrogen regulations would also bump up the appeal of algae , since it can also remove nitrogen from air or water .
" The main principle of industrial ecology is to try and use our waste products to produce something of value , " Colosi said .
This research will quantify just how much " free lunch " algae biofuel promises .
Total Syntheses from A to Z

Total Synthesis - An Introduction
As a scientific discipline , total synthesis has its formative roots in the mid-19th century , primarily as means for confirmation of structure .
In those early days , the analytical tools available to the synthetic chemist were extraordinarily basic , so following in nature 's footsteps was essential in the process of characterisation .
In the centuries which have passed , the phenomenal advances in spectroscopy and crystallography have left few unknowns in the course of structure determination - so , why in this day of such powerful analytical tools , do we continue to emulate nature ?
Perhaps the most important rationale is as a ' real - world ' test - bed for new synthetic methodology .
Sometimes the methodology is well - understood through model studies prior to the total synthesis ; other times , the methodology is created as a means to an end during the synthetic campaign .
But nothing quite confirms the utility of a new method than it 's employ in the critical stages of a total synthesis .
Another excellent grant - winner is confirmation , scale - up and analogue synthesis of recently uncovered biochemically active species .
To fully understand their potential therapeutic potency , the vanishing small samples obtained via in - situ isolation are rarely enough - so we rely on synthetic means to keep the biologists busy .
But perhaps the most important impact a total synthesis can have is the excellent training it provides for the next generation of synthetic chemists - both in their chemical education , and also in the softer skills of problem - solving and project management .
Losing your job could send you into a tailspin in which you withdraw from social and community activities .
Layoffs can turn social butterflies into near hermits who shun such outlets as book clubs and even church groups , finds a new study .
Workers who experienced just one layoff or involuntary loss of a job were 35 percent less likely to be involved in their communities than their always - employed counterparts , according to the survey that will be published in the September issue of the journal Social Forces .
The researchers suggest the reason could come down to tit for tat , or an attitude of " you do n't scratch my back , why should I scratch yours ? "
" Social engagement often involves an element of social trust and a sense that things are reciprocal — that you give some support if you get some support , and you benefit from society if society benefits from you , " said lead researcher Jennie Brand , a sociologist at UCLA .
" When workers are displaced , the tendency is to feel as though the social contract has been violated , and we found that they are less likely to reciprocate . "
Dirt on downsizing
The results were based on data on nearly 4,400 participants in the Wisconsin Longitudinal Study , which has tracked a group of 1957 Wisconsin high school graduates for more than 45 years .
Born between 1939 and 1940 , the participants are of an American age group that is inclined to participate in community and social groups , the researchers say .
Of the six forms of involvement , youth and community groups experienced the strongest exodus by displaced workers followed by church and church groups , charitable organizations and leisurely activities .
Professional and political groups remained just as popular on average in displaced and non-displaced workers .
" Displaced workers may be more likely to keep up with professional groups than other groups because they 're trying to make up for lost ground with respect to their careers , " Brand said .
Workers who got flung out of their jobs during their peak earning years , between the ages of 35 and 53 , were the most likely to withdraw from the social buzz throughout their lives .
Employees who got the boot between 53 and 64 years of age , at the tail end of their careers , were just as likely to participate in social and community groups as their non-displaced counterparts .
" Being laid off does n't appear to be as socially damaging for older workers as younger ones , " Brand said .
" The shame factor of downsizing your lifestyle just is n't there , because your peers may be downsizing as well and you can play off your displacement as an early retirement even though it may be forced retirement . "
Double whammy
The latest findings have considerable ramifications , Brand said .
" Whether citizens participate is important for the effective functioning of neighborhoods , schools , communities and democracies , " Brand said .
In addition , such withdrawals from society can cause a vicious cycle of unemployment .
" If workers withdraw socially after being laid off , then they 're experiencing double - jeopardy , " Brand said .
" They 're losing their jobs , and then they 're not participating in society , so they 're not keeping up with social contacts that might help them find a new job . "
From Idea to Production in Six Hours Share
This :
There has been some commotion over the past few days regarding Congresstional Web use restrictions .
The rules are inadequate for the current state of the Web and must be rewritten to reflect changes in technology .
Republicans and Democrats have been going back - and - forth over proposed changes to the existing rules ; one side claiming the other is trying to stifle their communication .
While they keep on bickering , we wanted to raise awareness of these Web use restrictions and get people involved .
We decided to launch a petition - like site that uses Twitter as the organizing method ; using one of the very technologies that are impacted by Congressional Web use restrictions .
We knew this had to be timely to have an impact , so the decision was made to have the Web site completed by the end of the day .
That gave Kerry Mitchell , our fearless Creative Director , and I about six hours to get the site completed .
So how did it go ?
Twitter
As LOCT is a petition - like site , it is important to get a list of the people that are following the LOCT Twitter account .
Twitter has a very nice API that makes it easy to pull information from the service .
To get JSON list of people following your Twitter account , just send an HTTP GET request to http://twitter.com/statuses/followers.json using HTTP
Basic Authentication with your username and password .
You can also get a list of people following other user accounts from http://twitter.com/statuses/followers/<username>.json ; no authentication necessary .
We query Twitter for this information and cache it locally in a database .
Unfortunately , due to Twitter ’s recent performance issues , many of the nicest features have either been limited or disabled , making it almost impossible to use Twitter exclusively for LOCT .
We needed to get a list of tweets that mentioned LOCT , but could n’t with the current performance restrictions in place .
If only there was another service that provided this functionality .
And there is !
Summize rocks .
Based right here in the greater Washington metropolitan area , Summize is tweet search service that has one of the few direct feeds into every tweet that is twittered .
They also have an awesome API that makes it dead simple to search all tweets .
http://summize.com/search.json?q=%23loct08
.
That is all you need to get search results in JSON .
Just like the list of followers from Twitter , the results are cached locally for Maximum PerformanceTM .
I would follow Django if it had a Twitter account
As with almost all projects created by Sunlight Labs , Let Our Congress Tweet is writting using Django , a Python Web development framework .
I love Django .
It simplifies development by providing object - relational mapping , templating , and other features in an unobtrusive way .
Developing in Django is already quite rapid , but by reusing existing code we can develop at an unheard - of pace .
Writing a reusable Django application is quite easy as it is nothing more than a standard Python module that can be used in any project .
Feedinating the countryside
A few weeks ago we released a new version of the Sunlight Foundation Web site .
The old , infuriating Drupal installation was replaced with a slick Django application that was written in - house .
One of the main features of the new site is feed aggregator that pulls in the recent blog posts from across the Sunlight - influenced transparency network .
To accomplish this , we wrote Feedinator , a Django feed aggregator application that makes it easy to pull in feeds from multiple blogs and display them in different ways on a Web site .
We use Feedinator on Let Our Congress
Tweet to pull in the feed of Tweets from the LOTC08 twitter account and a del.icio.us feed of Web sites that have mentioned LOCT .
By writing Feedinator in a way that makes it easily reusable , we were able to start incorporating feeds into LOCT in a matter of minutes .
If you would like to use Feedinator in your own project , you are in luck .
We plan on releasing the code in the near future as well as the code for a few other Django applications and Python modules .
Designers are useful
While I was coding , Kerry took care of the design , CSS , and HTML .
A few minutes of converting the HTML into Django templates and the site was up and running .
So that ’s it !
After throwing in a few cron entries and some Apache configuration files , the site went live .
We went from an idea to a production ready Web site in about six hours .
Sure , the it is n’t overly complicated , but we ’re proud of it nonetheless .
Introduction
Lunatic Python is a two - way bridge between Python and Lua , allowing these languages to intercommunicate .
Being two - way means that it allows Lua inside Python , Python inside Lua , Lua inside Python inside Lua , Python inside Lua inside Python , and so on .
Why ?
Even though the project was born as an experiment , it 's already being used in real world projects to integrate features from both languages .
Please , let me know if you use it in real world projects .
Examples
Lua inside Python
A basic example .
>>> import lua >>> lg = lua.globals ( ) >>>
lg.string < Lua table at 0x81c6a10 > >>> lg.string.lower < Lua function at 0x81c6b30 > >>> lg.string.lower
( " Hello world ! " ) ' hello world !'
Now , let 's put a local object into Lua space .
>>> d = {} >>> lg.d = d >>> lua.execute ( " d [ ' key ' ] = ' value ' " ) >>>
d {'key ' : ' value'}
Can we get the reference back from Lua space ?
>>> d2 = lua.eval ( " d " ) >>> d is d2 True
Good !
Is the python interface available inside the Lua interpreter ?
>>> lua.eval ( " python " ) < Lua table at 0x81c7540 >
Yes , it looks so .
Let 's nest some evaluations and see a local reference passing through .
>>> class MyClass : pass ... >>> obj = MyClass ( ) >>> obj < __main__.MyClass instance at 0x403ccb4c > >>> lua.eval ( r" python.eval ( 'lua.eval ( \" python.eval ( \' obj\ ' ) \ " ) ' ) " )
< __main__.MyClass instance at 0x403ccb4c >
Are you still following me ?
Good .
Then you 've probably noticed that the Python interpreter state inside the Lua interpreter state is the same as the outside Python we 're running .
Let 's see that in a more comfortable way .
>>> lua.execute ( " pg = python.globals ( ) " ) >>> lua.eval ( " pg.obj " ) < __main__.MyClass instance at 0x403ccb4c >
Things get more interesting when we start to really mix Lua and Python code .
>>> table = lua.eval ( " table " ) >>> def show ( key , value ) : ... print " key is %s and value is %s " % ( `key` , `value` ) ... >>> t = lua.eval ( " {a=1 , b=2 , c=3} " ) >>> table.foreach(t , show ) key is ' a ' and value is 1 key is ' c ' and value is 3 key is ' b ' and value is 2 >>>
Of course , in this case the same could be achieved easily with Python .
>>> def show ( key , value ) : ... print " key is %s and value is %s " % ( `key` , `value` ) ... >>> t = lua.eval ( " {a=1 , b=2 , c=3} " ) >>> for k in t : ... show ( k , t[k ] ) ... key is ' a ' and value is 1 key is ' c ' and value is 3 key is ' b ' and value is 2
Python inside Lua
Now , let 's have a look from another perspective .
The basic idea is exactly the same .
> require ( " python " ) > python.execute ( " import string " ) > pg = python.globals ( ) > =pg.string < module ' string ' from ' /usr/lib/python2.3/string.pyc ' > > =pg.string.lower( " Hello world ! " ) hello world !
As Lua is mainly an embedding language , getting access to the batteries included in Python may be interesting .
> re = python.import ( " re " ) > pattern = re.compile ( " ^Hel ( lo ) world ! " ) > match = pattern. match ( " Hello world ! " ) > =match.group(1 ) lo
Just like in the Python example , let 's put a local object in Python space .
> d = {} > pg.d = d > python.execute ( " d [ ' key ' ] = ' value ' " ) > table.foreach(d , print ) key value
Again , let 's grab back the reference from Python space .
> d2 = python.eval ( " d " ) > print (d == d2 ) true
Is the Lua interface available to Python ?
> =python.eval ( " lua " ) < module ' lua ' ( built - in ) >
Good .
So let 's do the nested trick in Lua as well .
> t = {} > =t table : 0x80 fbdb8 > =python.eval ( " lua.eval (' python.eval ( \" lua.eval ( \\'t\\ ' ) \ " ) ' ) " ) table : 0x80 fbdb8 >
It means that the Lua interpreter state inside the Python interpreter is the same as the outside Lua interpreter state .
Let 's show that in a more obvious way .
> python.execute ( " lg = lua.globals ( ) " ) > =python.eval ( " lg.t " ) table : 0x80 fbdb8
Now for the mixing example .
> function notthree ( num ) >> return ( num ~= 3 ) >> end > l = python.eval ( " [ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 ] " ) > filter = python.eval ( " filter " ) > =filter ( notthree , l ) [ 1 , 2 , 4 , 5 ]
Documentation
Theory
The bridging mechanism consists of creating the missing interpreter state inside the host interpreter .
That is , when you run the bridging system inside Python , a Lua interpreter is created ; when you run the system inside Lua , a Python interpreter is created .
Once both interpreter states are available , these interpreters are provided with the necessary tools to interact freely with each other .
The given tools offer not only the ability of executing statements inside the alien interpreter , but also to acquire individual objects and interact with them inside the native state .
This magic is done by two special object types , which act bridging native object access to the alien interpreter state .
Almost every object which is passed between Python and Lua is encapsulated in the language specific bridging object type .
The only types which are not encapsulated are strings and numbers , which are converted to the native equivalent objects .
Besides that , the Lua side also has special treatment for encapsulated Python functions and methods .
The most obvious way to implement calling of Python objects inside the Lua interpreter is to implement a __call function in the bridging object metatable .
Unfortunately this mechanism is not supported in certain situations , since some places test if the object type is a function , which is not the case of the bridging object .
To overwhelm these problems , Python functions and methods are automatically converted to native Lua function closures , becoming accessible in every Lua context .
Callable object instances which are not functions nor methods , on the other hand , will still use the metatable mechanism .
Luckily , they may also be converted in a native function closure using the asfunc ( ) function , if necessary .
Attribute vs. Subscript object access
Accessing an attribute or using the subscript operator in Lua give access to the same information .
This behavior is reflected in the Python special object that encapsulates Lua objects , allowing Lua tables to be accessed in a more comfortable way , and also giving access to objects which use protected Python keywords ( such as the print function ) .
For example :
>>> string = lua.eval ( " string " ) >>> string.lower < Lua function at 0x81c6bf8 > >>> string [ " lower " ]
< Lua function at 0x81c6bf8 >
Using Python from the Lua side requires a little bit more attention , since Python has a more strict syntax than Lua .
The later makes no distinction between attribute and subscript access , so we need some way to know what kind of access is desired at a given moment .
This control is provided using two functions : asindx ( ) and asattr ( ) .
These functions receive a single Python object as parameter , and return the same object with the given access discipline .
Notice that dictionaries and lists use the index discipline by default , while other objects use the attribute discipline .
For example :
> dict = python.eval ( " {} " ) > =dict.keys nil > dict.keys = 10 > print ( dict [ " keys " ] )
10 > =dict {'keys ' : 10} > =dict.keys = 10 n.asattr( dict ) > =dict.keys function : 0x80fa9b8 > =dict.keys ( ) [ ' keys ' ]
Lua inside Python
When executing Python as the host language , the Lua functionality is accessed by importing the lua module .
When Lua is the host language , the lua module will already be available in the global Python scope .
Below is a description of the functions available in the lua module .
lua.execute( statement )
This function will execute the given statement inside the Lua interpreter state .
Examples :
>>> lua.execute ( " foo = ' bar ' " )
lua.eval ( expression )
This function will evaluate the given expression inside the Lua interpreter state , and return the result .
It may be used to acquire any object from the Lua interpreter state .
Examples :
>>> lua.eval ( " ' foo ' .. 2 " ) ' foo2 ' >>> lua.eval ( ' string ') < Lua table at 0x81c6ae8 > >>> string = lua.eval ( ' string ' ) >>> string .
lower ( " Hello world ! " ) ' hello world ! '
lua.globals ( )
Return the Lua global scope from the interpreter state .
Examples :
>>> lg = lua.globals ( ) >>> lg.string.lower
( " Hello world ! " ) ' hello world ! ' >>> lg [ " string " ]. lower ( " Hello world ! " ) ' hello world ! ' >>> lg [ " print " ] < Lua function at 0x8154350 > >>> lg [ " print " ]
( " Hello world ! " )
Hello world !
lua.require( name )
Executes the require ( ) Lua function , importing the given module .
Examples :
>>> lua.require ( " testmod " ) True >>> lua.execute ( " func ( ) " )
I 'm func in testmod !
Python inside Lua
Unlike Python , Lua has no default path to its modules .
Thus , the default path of the real Lua module of Lunatic Python is together with the Python module , and a python.lua stub is provided .
This stub must be placed in a path accessible by the Lua require ( ) mechanism , and once imported it will locate the real module and load it .
Unfortunately , there 's a minor inconvenience for our purposes regarding the Lua system which imports external shared objects .
The hardcoded behavior of the loadlib ( ) function is to load shared objects without exporting their symbols .
This is usually not a problem in the Lua world , but we 're going a little beyond their usual requirements here .
We 're loading the Python interpreter as a shared object , and the Python interpreter may load its own external modules which are compiled as shared objects as well , and these will want to link back to the symbols in the Python interpreter .
Luckily , fixing this problem is easier than explaining the problem .
It 's just a matter of replacing the flag RTLD_NOW in the loadlib .c file of the Lua distribution by the or'ed version RTLD_NOW|RTLD_GLOBAL .
This will avoid " undefined symbol " errors which could eventually happen .
Below is a description of the functions available in the python module .
python.execute( statement )
This function will execute the given statement inside the Python interpreter state .
Examples :
> python.execute ( " foo = ' bar ' " )
python.eval ( expression )
This function will evaluate the given expression inside the Python interpreter state , and return the result .
It may be used to acquire any object from the Python interpreter state .
Examples :
> python.execute ( " import string " ) > =python.eval ( " string " ) < module ' string ' from ' /usr/lib/python2.3/string.pyc ' > > string = python.eval ( " string " ) > =string.lower ( " Hello world ! " ) hello world !
python.globals ( )
Return the Python global scope dictionary from the interpreter state .
Examples :
> python.execute ( " import string " ) > pg = python.globals ( ) > =pg.string.lower( " Hello world ! " ) hello world ! > =pg[" string " ]. lower ( " Hello world ! " ) hello world !
python.locals ( )
Return the Python local scope dictionary from the interpreter state .
Examples :
> function luafunc( ) >> print ( python.globals ().var ) >> print ( python.locals ( ).var ) >> end > python.execute ( " def func ( ) :
var = ' value '
lua.execute( ' luafunc ( ) ' ) " ) > python.execute ( " func ( ) " ) nil value
python.builtins ()
Return the Python builtins module dictionary from the interpreter state .
Examples :
> pb = python.builtins ( ) > =pb.len ( " Hello world ! " ) 12
python.import( name )
Imports and returns the given Python module .
Examples :
> os = python.import ( " os " ) > =os.getcwd( ) /home/niemeyer/src/lunatic-python
python.asattr( pyobj )
Return a copy of the given Python object with an attribute access discipline .
Examples :
> dict = python.eval ( " {} " ) > =dict.keys nil > dict.keys = 10 > print ( dict [ " keys " ] )
10 > =dict {'keys ' : 10} > =dict.keys = 10 n.asattr( dict ) > =dict.keys function : 0x80fa9b8 > =dict.keys ( ) [ ' keys ' ]
python.asindx ( pyobj )
Return a copy of the given Python object with an index access discipline .
Examples :
> buffer = python.eval ( " buffer ( ' foobar ' ) " ) > = buffer [ 0 ] stdin: 1 : unknown attribute in python object stack traceback : [ C ] : ? stdin : 1 : in main chunk [ C ] : ? > buffer = python.asindx ( buffer ) > = buffer [ 0 ] f
python.asfunc( pyobj )
Return a copy of the given Python object enclosed in a Lua function closure .
This is useful to use Python callable instances in places that require a Lua function .
Python methods and functions are automatically converted to Lua functions , and do n't require to be explicitly converted .
Examples :
> python.execute ( " class Join :
def __call__( self , * args ) :
return '- '.join ( args ) " ) > join = python.eval ( " Join ( ) " ) > =join < __main__.Join instance at 0x403a864c > > = join ( ' foo ' , ' bar ' ) foo - bar > =table.foreach( {foo= ' bar'} , join ) stdin : 1 : bad argument # 2 to `foreach ' ( function expected , got userdata ) stack traceback : [ C ] : in function `foreach ' stdin : 1 : in main chunk [ C ] : ? > =table.foreach({foo='bar'} , python.asfunc( join ) ) foo - bar

I ’ve been working my way through Kevin Smith ’s Erlang In Practice screencast series and decided to write some eunit tests for episode 6 ( covering Mochiweb ) .
The plan was to do a basic test which would register a nickname , then register the recipient which would also send back the waiting message and give me a chance to compare it with the original message .
Well , it took a LOT longer than it should have .
The tests were inconsistent and would fail often but not predictably .
Reworking the tests and underlying code did n’t yield much help .
Debugging and tracing were not helpful either .
There ’s some timeouts in mochiweb or the http handling that are triggered when stepping through the code in the debugger .
The get on the right track , I created a more specific test for the message_store .
Eventually it became clear that mnesia : start has some delay and that the unit tests run so fast that accessing the table becomes a race .
If mnesia cannot see the table yet when we try to read the table , there ’s an error that looks like this
CORNING , NY — Corning Incorporated ( motto : “ Who cares if it ’s half empty or half full as long as it ’s our glass . ” ) announced it has obtained a patent for a solid glass ceiling that appears to be fractured with 18 million cracks .
The product will be called the Glass Sheiling and is expected to be marketed primarily to female - owned corporations , companies that market primarily to women , and supporters of Hillary Clinton and Sarah Paling .
“ The time is right for a product like this , ” said Corning marketing director Rhonda Silica .
“ Hillary Clinton proved a glass ceiling can be cracked .
Sarah Paling proved a glass ceiling can be shattered with a moose gun .
And now Corning will prove a glass ceiling help us crack profits of 10 cents per share per quarter over at least the next four years . ”
Corning scientists are tightly guarding the secret behind the solidity of the Glass Sheiling , which appears about to break and come crashing to the floor , especially when stared at intently by men in business suits .
“ Let ’s just say it ’s part glass , part magic and part clear nail polish , ” said Dr. Crystal Vitreous , Vice President of R&D at Corning .
“ One thing I can assure you , ” said Dr. Vitreous , “ No woman ’s lips touched a blowpipe in the making of this glass . ”
Pre-orders for the Glass Sheiling have been placed by Mary Kay Cosmetics , Bayer ( makers of Midol ) , Oprah Winfrey , former HP CEO Carly Firoina and former President B*ll Cl*nton , who asked that his name be disguised since it ’s a surprise birthday gift for his wife .
Since the US federal government is still stalling and bickering instead of renewing the Investment Tax Credits for solar and residential solar subsidies are still in the proposal stage , states ( such as New Jersey and Florida ) have become the saving grace for many solar companies ' US hopes .
And now Connecticut has upped the ante by launching a subsidized residential solar leasing program .
Release :
Governor M. Jodi Rell today announced a program to help low - and moderate - income residents cut their electricity expenses and build on the state ’s commitment to renewable energy .
The Connecticut Solar Lease Program , the first of its kind in the nation , is a new initiative designed to eliminate the high initial costs associated with the purchase and installation of residential solar photovoltaic systems .
Through the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund ( CCEF ) , a combination of rebates and tax credits can be used to lower the cost of leasing solar systems , helping more residents obtain clean , renewable solar energy .
While First Solar ( FSLR ) has not made a play at the residential market yet , the more incentive there is to do so , the better .
For now , this type of legislation more directly benefits a pure residential - focused solar play such as Akeena Solar ( AKNS ) .

With the debris from the current financial storm still swirling , Congress must not overlook the other massive spending bill speeding its way through Congress .
As a result of Congress ’s stubborn refusal to fulfill their constitutional responsibility to fund the government ( not passing a single appropriations bill this session ) they must now pass a continuing resolution ( CR ) to avoid a government shutdown .
Unfortunately , instead of crafting a well thought out clean bill , Congress predictably larded it up with billions of dollars in false “ emergency ” spending , and believe it or not , even included a multi-billion dollar bailout of privately owned automotive companies .
The peculiar logic behind this massive spending hike is that if Congress can afford to spend massive amounts to rescue the economy , then the government can surely afford a mere $ 25 billion to bailout the auto - industry , and $ 24 billion in disaster aid .
However , the reality is the opposite .
It is because Congress has been spending so much money on other priorities that it can not afford additional spending hikes .
The bill raises several concerns :
• Members of Congress have likely not read the bill .
The current language for the CR was only recently released .
With the continuing turmoil in the financial markets requiring close Congressional attention it is highly unlikely members of Congress have had time to properly scrutinize the bill .
The CR funds the entire federal government .
The least Congress should do is take the time to read the bill .
• The CR doles out a $ 25 billion loan to bail out the auto industry .
The companies involved have repeatedly proven to be inefficient and highly flawed .
Other automotive companies across the country have flourishing plants relying on the free market alone .
Continuing to prop up failing companies under the logic that one bailout necessitates another is a quick recipe for disaster .
• The CR also includes billions in bogus “ emergency ” spending .
Although many of these programs such as $ 2.8 billion in “ emergency spending ” for low - income heating assistance , pull the emotional vote , the fact remains the best way to help families with high energy costs is to lower to price of energy .
• The bill also provides $ 24 billion in undefined disaster assistance , much of which will be funneled through the ineffective Community Development Block Grant Program .
Such a large disaster aid package deserves significantly more scrutiny – and possible spending offsets – than has been provided so far .
The One Victory
Fortunately the CR is n’t all bad .
After months of pressure by conservative leaders to allow the congressional moratorium banning offshore drilling to lapse , the CR finally makes that possible .
Beginning October 1st energy companies will be permitted to begin the slow process of obtaining leases to drill for additional oil off American shores .
One can only hope the next Congress does not overturn this accomplishment .
Although many Americans may celebrate the lapse of the drilling moratorium , then shift their focus to the financial markets , one must not forget this bill also spends billions of taxpayer dollars .
Despite other responsibilities , Congress should recognize the continued funding of the federal government as a top priority and properly scrutinize the bill .

It was a surprisingly lightly attended session that initiated Austin GDC's WorldsInMotion virtual worlds focused conference track - surprising because you 'd imagine that the entrance of a company with the massive resources and cultural ubiquity as only Google has would be just the sort of disruption that would threaten to set the industry on end .
While product manager Mel Guymon was n't able to make his scheduled speech , creative director Kevin Hanna gave no less a revealing look into the future of Lively , Google 's recently debuted web - embeddable 3D virtual world .
Formerly an Xbox developer at Microsoft and a Disney Interactive art director , Hanna is creative VP of X - Ray Kid Studios , a " content spinoff " of Google responsible for both creating the project 's distinctively " soft but edgy " look , as Hanna described it , and for continuing to create further enhancements and customisations to its characters and rooms .
Most importantly , Hanna quietly announced that while you can currently embed any Google Gadget into Lively 's world – such as YouTube videos or weather reports running on virtual TVs - the company will soon be providing an API for developers to create new interactive gadgets to run in the space .
" Imagine a scenario with a virtual arcade , " explained Hanna , where users can stand over the shoulder of other Lively users and watch them play games , something he said hearkened back to that " old arcade ideology " and atmosphere .
And , taking that idea to its logical conclusion , Hanna said that the Lively team also had on its roadmap opening the API further to create entire 3D games entirely through Lively , to use , he said , " the economy that we 've set up ... and build own games on top of that - it opens up a world of possibilities " from his 11 year old daughter creating content to a startup building their " dream game " - not one based on what a publisher dictates .
Hanna said developers are already being allowed to join its program to create Lively content - most recently a group of 120 - and that plugins were on the way for 3ds Max , Maya , and Google 's own SketchUp 3D tool for both modelling and animation .
" This is just one more bullet in the gun - more ammunition for Google , " Hanna explained of Google 's desire to enter the virtual world space , part of its philosophy of " empowering the user and deepening the experience ...
One more way of selling a bigger picture and philosophy of Google . "
In keeping with that philosophy , and one of the pressing questions from the audience , Hanna said that officially Google has no intention of setting up a system of its own monetization or microtransactions - there will likely never be " Google Bucks " to buy - but it is putting in place a system for peer to peer transactions so developers can sell their own content and creations .
Over the long term , Hanna said that while he could n't speak for Google 's official stance , his hope is that Lively becomes " invisible " as much as Flash , Java or HTML are as the backbone of the web experience , that it becomes a " core architecture . "
" Google has already been in 3D world space , if you think of like Google Earth - a tool a lot of us use every day , " he concluded .
" Google in 3D space and online space is here to stay as much as any online company . "
NEW YORK ( MarketWatch ) -- U.S. stocks fell sharply Thursday , with the Dow industrials suffering a 344 - point decline , as rising jobless claims data , mixed retail sales and weaker oil prices fueled concerns about slowing growth both at home and abroad .
And in the backdrop , fear about ailing financial companies remained firmly in place .
Rumors that hedge fund Atticus Capital was liquidating positions and closing down also made the rounds , although the fund denied the rumors .
See related story on WSJ.com .
" There 's basically not much good news at the moment , " said Ken Tower , vice president at Quantitative Analysis Service .
" The main concern is about growth and that there is a global slowdown now in the offing . "
The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA , - 0.47 % fell 344 points , or 3 % , to end at 11,216 , its worst percentage drop since June 26 .
Shares of Caterpillar Inc. CAT , - 0.18 % were among the biggest decliners among blue chips , off 5.6 % .
The stock fell in tandem with fellow farm and machinery equipment maker Terex TEX , +1.68 % , which issued a profit warning , citing slower business .
" The idea from 10 months ago that there was some sort of decoupling [ between the U.S. and other economies ] has fallen flat on its face , " Tower said .
Overseas , both the European Central Bank and the Bank of England kept interest rates unchanged , as they signaled rising concerns about weakening economic growth .
Meanwhile , crude - oil futures continued to slide , a sign that some analysts say also reflects concerns about slowing global growth .
See Futures Movers .
Among other Dow components , even shares of Wal - Mart Inc. WMT , - 0.08 % lost earlier gains , scored after the giant discounter 's monthly sales topped projections .
But while " news on the retail front was mixed - to - firmer , led by a rise in Wal - Mart same - store sales for August [...] others were not quite so fortunate , " said Action Economic analysts .

The S&P 500 index SPX , - 0.48 % fell 38 points , or 3 % , to end at 1,236 , while the Nasdaq Composite COMP , - 0.29 % fell 74 points , or 3.2 % , to end at 2,259 .
No more love for multinationals
By sector , industrials and materials were leading the way lower , both falling more than 4 % .
" There 's a big shift between what 's working in the market and what 's not , " said Owen Fitzpatrick , head of U.S. equities at Deutsche Bank .
" That last group that had held up so well -- multinational industrials and materials are -- now leading the way down , " he said .
" But in an environment where economies are slowing , you need to see every sector roll . "
Fresh data fueled concerns about the state of the economy ahead of Friday 's key August jobs report .
The Labor Department said jobless claims rose last week to a seasonally adjusted 444,000 , up 15,000 from the previous week .
It marked a shift after three weeks of declines , surprising analysts who expected a slight drop .
See Economic Report .
Separately , the ADP employment index had private - sector employment dropping 33,000 in August , suggesting nonfarm payrolls fell about 13,000 in August , according to media reports .

Financials stocks also weakened , led by shares of Lehman Brothers LEH , and Merrill Lynch MER , +27.69 % , which were hurt by reports they may be having some trouble clearing up their balance sheets .
Separately , Lehman analysts cut their earnings estimate on American Express AXP , - 1.08 % , with shares of the blue chip slipping 5.6 % .
Stocks briefly came off lows after news that activity in the nonmanufacturing sectors of the U.S. economy expanded slightly in August , according to the Institute for Supply Management .
The ISM nonmanufacturing index rose to 50.6 % in August from 49.5 % in July .
In a separate and more upbeat report , the government said the productivity of U.S. nonfarm businesses was revised higher in the second quarter than previously estimated , climbing at a 4.3 % annual rate in the quarter , up from 2.2 % in the earlier estimate .

" The market is really just paying close attention to the fundamentals of the economy , not speeches by Fed officials .
Traders pretty much know the Fed is on hold right now and would rather focus on the economic numbers when making purchase and sale decisions , " said Kevin Giddis , managing director at Morgan Keegan & Co .
On Wednesday , stock indexes closed mixed , with the Dow industrials striking its first gain in three sessions , rising 15.96 points to close at 11,532.88 , leaving it down 13.06 % year - to - date .
I 'm surprised this has n't happened before now .
This is n't a story about security ( although it is about securities ) , but it 's so remarkable I thought I 'd include it here anyway .
A worker at a Miami investment advisory firm called Income Securities Advisors , which publishes news alerts that get distributed through the Bloomberg News Service , did a Google search on bankruptcies this morning and got back search results that included a six - year - old story published in the South Florida Sun Sentinel about the 2002 bankruptcy filing by United Airlines .
The employee mistook the news for a current story – despite the date clearly marked on it ( see update below ) and other information in the article " that would clearly lead a reader to the conclusion that it was related to events in 2002 " – and included it in a subscription newsletter that was distributed through Bloomberg .
Panic ensued , as they say , and United Airlines stock price plummeted 75 percent ( down from $ 12.30 to $ 3 a share ) before someone realized it was an old news story and things righted themselves .
The stock rebounded to $ 10.92 a share by Monday 's closing .
But not before United Airlines contacted the * Sun Sentinel * and demanded the newspaper retract its ( 6 - year - old ) story .
UPDATE 1 : The head of Income Securities Advisors is now saying that the article had a current date on it .
Or maybe the article had no date on it .
His account to various news outlets is inconsistent .
Either way , what seems to be clear is that the archived article appeared within a frame of current headlines – which is how many web sites display archived material , to draw readers to current stories .
What could have happened , was that the person who read it did n't see a date on it but saw current headlines around it and jumped to the conclusion that the United Airlines piece was current .
UPDATE 2 : The story gets more convoluted and more interesting .
According to a follow - up investigation , the article in the Sun Sentinel 's archive had no date on it .
But when Google 's spider grabbed it , it assigned a current date to the piece , which then resulted in the article being placed in the top results of Google News .
When the employee from Income Securities Advisors ran a Google search on " 2008 bankruptcies , " the old United Airlines story appeared as the top link in the results , with a September 6 , 2008 date on it .
( Google has now released a screenshot that shows the UAL story as it appeared on the Sun Sentinel web site .
The only date in the screenshot is September 7 , 2008 , the date Google accessed the page .
There is no date under the story 's headline to indicate when it was published . )
At 11 am Monday , the employee added the story to a feed that is included in a Bloomberg subscription service and within minutes , 15 million shares of United Airlines stock had been sold before trading on the stock was halted .
As I wrote at the top of this post , it 's surprising something like this has n't happened before .
But , unfortunately , it looks like the wrong lessons are being learned from this .
Richard Lehmann , president of Income Securities Advisors , told the Washington Post that the incident " shows ( that ) the market apparently reacts to a headline as much as anything else . "
He acknowledges that it would have been nice if his employee " had been more grounded in what 's going on out there in the world . "
Presumably he means that if his employee had read the article carefully , he or she would have noticed information in the piece that made it obvious it was referring to a 2002 bankruptcy and therefore did n't jibe with the 2008 publication date on the piece .
But Lehmann nonetheless attributes the whole problem to how the stock market reacted to his employee 's action , not to the action itself .
" The fact that this happened with a major corporation like United based on one headline coming across Bloomberg , that you'd get this kind of knee - jerk reaction , there 's something wrong with the trading mechanism , " Lehmann said .
Actually , the market reacted exactly the way someone would expect it to react to a headline like this .
The problem was n't the market , it was the newspaper 's archive , which stored the story without a publication date attached to it – not a completely uncommon occurrence .
The problem was also a by - product of how information is published instantly these days , and passed around the internet , without any independent vetting .
The fact that Bloomberg 's news service publishes content provided by non-journalist sources – such as Income Securities Advisors – without having an editor vet the material first , puts the news service at risk of being caught up in a mistake like this again .
But the problem is n't just Bloomberg .
We 're all at risk of doing this today when all it takes to publish something is to click " send , " and when blogs and mailing lists propagate information that 's published elsewhere without independently verifying it .
Let 's say the information in the United Airlines article was n't obviously about a 2002 bankruptcy filing .
There would n't have been any obvious red flags to make someone question the publication date on the piece .
Someone would have caught the mistake only if Bloomberg had a regular policy of independently verifying information before sending it to subscribers .
Prior to the internet , if a news outlet like Bloomberg picked up information that another news publication broke , Bloomberg would have made phone calls to vet the information – as much as that was possible – before publishing its own story about the subject .
That still happens in the case of articles that are published in the print versions of newspapers .
But that happens much less with information that 's picked up on blogs , and it almost never happens with information that 's picked up by online mailing lists and newsletters .
Duke Nukem Movie Planned
" As is the case with all of my game adaptations , I 'd rather not make the movie than make a poor adaptation , " Faye told Kotaku .
He added , " I 'm working at establishing a Duke film scenario that will compel a studio to finance a feature version .
Certainly , there 's a large audience that knows and loves this character . "
According to the report , Miller 's Radar Group will be involved in every step of the film 's production .
" Why go out of your way to acquire an [ intellectual property ] if you 're not going to use as much of it as you can in the adaptation process ? "
Faye asked .
Details on the film were scant , but Faye promised to stay faithful to the series : " We 're expanding Duke 's ' storyverse ' in a very significant major way without abandoning or negating any element that 's being used to introduce Duke to the next gen platforms . "
Faye also told Kotaku about Max Payne star Mark Wahlberg 's interest in making a sequel as well as his method for video game adaptation , saying , " If I 'm going to play a videogame based on a feature film , the last thing I want to do is play through the film narrative . "
The Shacknews editorial staff humbly reminds readers that a Duke Nukem film is actually old news .
THE USE OF VOCALIZATIONS , such as grunts , songs or barks , is extremely common throughout the animal kingdom .
Nevertheless , humans are the only species in which these vocalizations have attained the sophistication and communicative effectiveness of speech .
How did our ancestors become the only speaking animals , some tens of thousands of years ago ?
Did this change happen abruptly , involving the sudden appearance of a new cerebral region or pattern of cerebral connections ?
Or did it happen through a more gradual evolutionary process , in which brain structures already present to some extent in other animals were put to a different and more complex use in the human brain ?
A recent study in Nature Neuroscience yields critical new information , uncovering what could constitute the “ missing link ” between the brain of vocalizing nonhuman species and the human brain : evidence that a cerebral region specialized for processing voice , known to exist in the human brain , has a counterpart in the brain of rhesus macaques .
Neuroscientist Christopher I. Petkov of the Max Planck Institute for Biological Cybernetics in Tbingen , Germany , and his colleagues used functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the macaque brain .
They measured cerebral activity of awake monkeys that were listening to different categories of natural sounds , including macaque vocalizations .
The researchers found evidence for a “ voice area ” in the auditory cortex of these macaques : a discrete region of the anterior temporal lobe in which activity was greater for macaque vocalizations than for other sound categories .
This region was observed in several individuals , even under the condition of total anesthesia .
More surprising , the region showed repetition - induced reduction of activity — or neuronal adaptation — in response to different calls coming from the same individual .
This finding suggests that this brain region processes information about the identity of the speaker , a phenomenon that is also observed in the human voice area .
Long History of Voice ?
Perhaps the most remarkable implication of these findings is that the voice area previously identified in the human brain is not uniquely human and that it has a counterpart in the brain of nonhuman primates .
That discovery , in turn , implies that the voice area has a long evolutionary history and was probably already present in the common ancestor of macaques and humans some 20 million years ago .
It is known that the cognitive talents underlying voice perception , such as speaker recognition , are shared with many other animal species , but the findings of Petkov and his colleagues provide a cerebral location for these abilities .
Ironically , most of the research into the evolutionary basis of language has focused so far on a single function — speech perception — which is unique to humans , and thus evolutionary precursors are hard , if not impossible , to identify .
The present findings hint at another , possibly more rewarding , strategy : perhaps looking at what we have in common with other animals — that is , a rich cerebral substrate to process vocalizations and extract speaker - related information — will allow us to understand the evolution of speech .
Indeed , Petkov ’s findings indicate that when our ancestors began to talk , they already were equipped with sophisticated neural machinery specialized in voice processing .
Another important implication of Petkov ’s findings concerns the functional lateralization of the macaque voice area .
A well - established property of the human cerebral substrate for speech ( particularly speech production ) is its lateralization to the left hemisphere .
This known asymmetry has led researchers to investigate whether a similar left - hemispheric bias could be found in other animals , as a possible evolutionary precursor of human language .
Unfortunately , this long - standing belief has possibly resulted in a strong bias in the literature , whereby studies uncovering any leftward asymmetry in nonhuman primates are much more likely to be published in leading journals .
A Role for the Right
A counterintuitive but essential feature of Petkov ’s results , similar to the corresponding findings in the human brain , is that voice - selective activity was stronger in the right hemisphere .
Furthermore , the identity - specific neuronal adaptation was observed only in the right hemisphere of the macaque brain , exactly as in the human studies .
This finding means that the right hemisphere may well have played a major role in how speech appeared in our ancestors and that a response to the puzzle of speech evolution may lie not only in the left hemisphere .
We have much work ahead before we can attain a complete understanding of the functional role of the voice area , in macaques as well as in humans .
Several alternative hypotheses remain to be tested :
Does the voice area represent a hardwired preference for the particular acoustical structure of vocalizations from one ’s own species ?
Or is it more simply a “ formant ” detector , a structure specialized in detecting vocal features in general ?
Another possibility is that this voice area is actually a “ social ” structure , tuned to vocalizations because they are cues for social interaction and not because they share a particular acoustical structure .
In conclusion , Petkov ’s findings provide an exciting common substrate for high - level , or complex , auditory cognition that can be studied in parallel in humans and in macaques .
Now that the location of the voice area in the macaque brain has been established , researchers will obtain critical additional information in the near future by exploring the monkey ’s voice area using more conventional electrophysiological techniques , such as recording directly from neurons .
Even more important , this seminal work opens the road for comparative neuroimaging studies in which humans and other animals perform similar tasks using similar methodologies , and the results can be analyzed using similar strategies .

In an apparent swipe at Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama , George W. Bush recently decried those who favor talking to nations or groups which are hostile to America , comparing them to appeasers of the Nazis .
Comedy Central 's Stephen Colbert was especially intrigued by Bush 's statement during a speech delivered as part of Israel 's 60th anniversary celebrations that " as Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American senator declared , ' Lord , if I could only have talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . ' "
" This can only mean one thing , " Colbert suggested .
" The American senator who wanted to talk to Hitler back in 1939 was in fact , Barack Obama .
He is not just a secret Muslim .
He 's a secret time - traveling Nazi Muslim . "
This video is from Comedy Central 's The Colbert Report , broadcast May 15 , 2008 .

Partial Transcript COLBERT : Meanwhile , our actual present President is in Israel to commemorate that country 's 60th anniversary .
Mr. Bush gave a speech on the floor of the Knesset .
COLBERT : The president also used his speech to take a bold swipe at those who would talk to our enemies .
BUSH : We 've heard this foolish delusion before as Nazi tanks crossed into Poland in 1939 , an American Senator declared , " Lord if I could have only talked to Hitler , all this might have been avoided . "
COLBERT : Mr. Bush , of course , was alluding to Barack Obama , who last year said that as President , he would be willing to sit down and meet with Iranian President Mahmoud " achma gonna kill myself if the primary season does n't end soon ijad " .
( applause )
Now , this can only mean one thing , folks -- the American Senator who wanted to talk to Hitler back in 1939 was , in fact Barack Obama .
( laughter )
He is not just a secret Muslim .
He 's a secret time - traveling Nazi Muslim .
( cheers and applause )
That is a good look .
not everybody can pull that off .

I was walking up the 16th Street Mall this morning when I got stopped by a man offering me a small newspaper called the Denver Voice .
It ’s a paper written in large part by the homeless , about the homeless , and sold on the streets of Denver by the homeless .
For a suggested donation of $ 1.00 , I got a metaphorical smack upside the head , and an article inside the the Voice brought made it smart even more .
I had n’t even noticed , and my lack of noticing was something unusual .
Downtown Denver is missing something .
Where are the homeless ?
Before the DNC , there were rumors flying around that the homeless would be rounded up and carted away to some other part of the city , or given money for a meal and a bus ticket out of Denver entirely , or even arrested and held for a week on trumped - up charges that would be conveniently dropped Friday or Saturday after the election .
But no - one knew for sure .
According to the Voice article “ Denver Wo n’t Hide Homeless for the DNC ” , New York city police issued “ quality of life ” tickets in advance of the 2004 convention , and Denver ’s homeless were concerned that the same thing would happen here .
The article quoted Denver ’s Road Home project manager Jamie Van Leeuwen as saying that the DNC would be largely business as usual for homeless shelters , with a few “ extending hours or involving the homeless in politics related activities . ”
And Commander Deborah Dilley , the Denver Police Department ’s downtown district commander said in the article that “ the homeless wo n’t be unfairly targeted by any law enforcement during the DNC . ”
So where are they ?
Most of Denver ’s homeless live in the public spaces of downtown and LoDo , panhandle along the 16th Street Mall and the Cherry Creek Path , and sleep in the large parks and public space that have been taken over or blocked off by the DNC , various security forces , and protesters .
But they ’re all gone .
I ’ve been getting into downtown between 7 and 8 AM since Monday , walking from one end of downtown to the other , and the only possible homeless people I ’ve seen all week were on Sunday up on Capitol Hill , well outside the main areas where the homeless would congregate .
And you ’d think that , with such a huge influx of people and wealth , panhandlers would be all over the place trying to get as much money from the delegates , press , staff , and politicians as they possibly could .
But they are n’t there .
They ’re not just invisible , they ’re actually gone .
I ’ve heard rumors that the homeless were given movie tickets during the day to keep them off the streets .
But fellow Scrogue Edmundo Rocha , who used as a homeless specialist for the Harris County Community Development Department says that most cities do exactly what DPD Commander Dilley and Van Leeuwen said they were n’t going to do – they round up the homeless and either detain them at an undisclosed detention center , or they ship them off to economically depressed suburbs and away from the throngs of visitors like all of those attending the DNC .
I ’ve asked my fellow Scrogues if they ’ve seen any homeless , and the only one of us who has seen more than one or two is Edmundo .
It ’s terrible thing to be picked up and hauled away , even temporarily , for the “ crime ” of not being able to afford a home .
But they ’re not here in downtown Denver , so they have to have gone somewhere .
If you know where they ’ve gone , if you ’ve talked to some of the sudden influx of homeless in your area and they ’re from Denver , let us know .
We ’d like to know who to point a finger at and accuse of caring more for public appearances during the DNC than for the homeless of Denver .
Juneau , Alaska
ABOUT the closest most Americans will ever get to a polar bear are those cute , cuddly animated images that smiled at us while dancing around , pitching soft drinks on TV and movie screens this holiday season .
This is unfortunate , because polar bears are magnificent animals , not cartoon characters .
They are worthy of our utmost efforts to protect them and their Arctic habitat .
But adding polar bears to the nation ’s list of endangered species , as some are now proposing , should not be part of those efforts .
To help ensure that polar bears are around for centuries to come , Alaska ( about a fifth of the world ’s 25,000 polar bears roam in and around the state ) has conducted research and worked closely with the federal government to protect them .
We have a ban on most hunting  only Alaska Native subsistence families can hunt polar bears  and measures to protect denning areas and prevent harassment of the bears .
We are also participating in international efforts aimed at preserving polar bear populations worldwide .
This month , the secretary of the interior is expected to rule on whether polar bears should be listed under the Endangered Species Act .
I strongly believe that adding them to the list is the wrong move at this time .
My decision is based on a comprehensive review by state wildlife officials of scientific information from a broad range of climate , ice and polar bear experts .
The so - called rescue - package that will sink further whatever is left of the economy could be the political opportunity of Ron Paul to rally all those in Congress , Democrats and Republicans , who just cannot support that kind of swindle .
This is the major political decision of this time and it could end up redefining political lines .
Many of us have always believed that states need utter disaster , like military defeats or dire economic conditions , to collapse and leave way to freedom .
We might very well be right there .
Or not far from there .
If Ron Paul could take such a leadership , he would be in great position to bring about his revolution .
Better than President of the United States because all political action has to go through Congress .
Constitutionally at least .
I am catching myself dreaming that Ron Paul would garner enough traction to become Speaker of the House .
Let 's not waste our time with that ridiculous presidential campaign .
I understand that Ron Paul endorsed Baldwin but I think the move is really about marginalizing that political fraud named Bob Barr who , day after day , press release after press release , redefines libertarianism as conservatism .
The real battle is in Congress .
Representatives and senators are under huge pressures to chose between the deep conviction of the American people that the bailout is wrong and their allegiance to the state .
Let 's help Ron Paul win the battle on Capitol Hill .
All over the world , protesters are engaged in a heroic battle with reality .
They block roads , picket fuel depots , throw missiles and turn over cars in an effort to hold it at bay .
The oil is running out and governments , they insist , must do something about it .
When they 've sorted it out , what about the fact that the days are getting shorter ?
What do we pay our taxes for ?
The latest people to join these surreal protests are the world 's fishermen .
They are on strike in Italy , Spain , Portugal , France and Japan , and demonstrating in scores of maritime countries .
Last month in Brussels they threw rocks and flares at the police , who have been conspiring with the world 's sedimentary basins to keep the price of oil high .
The fishermen warn that if something is n't done to help them , thousands could be forced to scrap their boats and hang up their nets .
It 's an appalling prospect , which we should greet with heartfelt indifference .
Just as the oil price now seems to be all that stands between us and runaway climate change , it is also the only factor which offers a glimmer of hope to the world 's marine ecosystems .
No east Asian government was prepared to conserve the stocks of tuna ; now one - third of the tuna boats in Japan , China , Taiwan and South Korea will stay in dock for the next few months because they can't afford to sail .
The unsustainable quotas set on the US Pacific seaboard wo n't be met this year , because the price of oil is rising faster than the price of fish .
The indefinite strike called by Spanish fishermen is the best news European fisheries have had for years .
Beam trawlermen - who trash the seafloor and scoop up a massive bycatch of unwanted species - warn that their industry could collapse within a year .
Hurray to that too .
It would , of course , be better for everyone if these unsustainable practices could be shut down gently without the need for a crisis or the loss of jobs , but this seems to be more than human nature can bear .
The EU has a programme for taking fishing boats out of service - the tonnage of the European fleet has fallen by 5 % since 1999 - but the decline in boats is too slow to overtake the decline in stocks .
Every year the EU , like every other fishery authority , tries to accommodate its surplus boats by setting quotas higher than those proposed by its scientific advisers , and every year the population of several species is pressed a little closer to extinction .
The fishermen make two demands , which are taken up by politicians in coastal regions all over the world : they must be allowed to destroy their own livelihoods , and the rest of us should pay for it .
Over seven years , European taxpayers will be giving this industry € 3.8 bn .
Some of this money is used to take boats out of service and to find other jobs for fishermen ; but the rest is used to equip boats with new engines and new gear , to keep them on the water , to modernise ports and landing sites ; and to promote and market the catch .
Except for the funds used to re-train fishermen or help them into early retirement , there is no justification for this spending .
At least farmers can argue - often falsely - that they are the " stewards of the countryside " .
But what possible argument is there for keeping more fishermen afloat than the fish population can bear ?
The EU says its spending will reduce fishing pressure and help fishermen adopt greener methods .
In reality , it is delaying the decline of the industry and allowing it to defy ecological limits for as long as possible .
If the member states want to protect the ecosystem , it 's a good deal cheaper to legislate than to pay .
Our fishing policies , like those of almost all maritime nations , are a perfect parable of commercial stupidity and short - termism , helping an industry to destroy its long - term prospects for the sake of immediate profit .
But the fishermen only demand more .
The headline on this week 's Fishing News is " Thanks for Nothing ! " , bemoaning the British government 's refusal to follow France , Spain and Italy in handing out fuel subsidies .
But why the heck should it ?
The Scottish fishing secretary , Richard Lochhead , demands that the government in Westminster " open the purse strings " .
He also insists that new money is " not tied to decommissioning " : in other words no more boats should be taken off the water .
Is this really a service to the industry , or only to its most short - sighted members ?
I have a leaked copy of the draft proposal that European states will discuss on Thursday .
It 's a disaster .
Some of the boats which , under existing agreements , will be scrapped and turned into artificial reefs , permanently reducing the size of the fleet , can now be replaced with smaller vessels .
The EU will pay costs and salaries for crews stranded by the fuel crisis , so that they stay in business and can start fishing again when the price falls .
Member states will be able to shell out more money ( €100,000 instead of € 30,000 per boat ) without breaking state aid rules .
They can hand out new grants for replacing old equipment with more fuel - efficient gear .
The proposal seems to be aimed at ensuring that the industry collapses through lack of fish rather than lack of fuel .
The fishermen wo n't go down without taking the ecosystem with them .
What makes the draft document so dumb is that in some regions , especially in British waters , the industry is just beginning to turn .
While Spanish , French and Italian fishermen clamour for a resumption of bluefin tuna fishing - knowing that if they are allowed to fish now this will be the last season ever - around the UK it has begun to dawn on some fishermen that there might be an association between the survival of the fish and the survival of the fishing .
Prompted by Young 's seafood and some of the supermarkets , who in turn have been harried by environmental groups , some of the biggest British fisheries have applied for eco-labels from the Marine Stewardship Council , which sets standards for how fish are caught .
Fishermen around the UK also seem to be taking the law more seriously , and at last to be showing some interest in obscure issues such as spawning grounds and juvenile fish ( which , believe it or not , turn out to have a connection to future fish stocks ) .
By ensuring that far too many boats , and far too many desperate fishermen , stay on the water , and that the remaining quotas are stretched too thinly , the EU will slow down or even reverse the greening of the industry .
Why is this issue so hard to resolve ?
Why does every representative of a fishing region believe he must defend his constituents ' right to ensure that their children have nothing to inherit ?
Why do the leaders of the fishermen 's associations feel the need always to denounce the scientists who say that fish stocks decline if they are hit too hard ?
If this is a microcosm of how human beings engage with the environment , the prospect for humanity is not a happy one .

1846 : Dentist William Morton uses ether to anesthetize a patient in Boston .
It was not the first such use , but it began a train of events leading to the widespread adoption of ether for surgical anesthesia .
Dr. Crawford Long of Jefferson , Georgia , removed a tumor from the neck of James Venable under ether anesthesia on March 30 , 1842 .
( Long may have started using ether a year earlier while he was attending medical school at the University of Pennsylvania . )
But Dr. Long , perhaps giddy with excitement or perhaps giddy from experimenting with ether as a recreational drug ( the " ether frolics " ) , did not rush to publish or patent his discovery .
Dr. Morton was a pre-med student , who was practicing dentistry in Boston apparently without the benefit of a formal dental education .
He had arranged in 1845 for his dental mentor and former dentistry partner Horace Wells to demonstrate the use of nitrous oxide , or laughing gas , as an anesthetic .
The demonstration at Massachusetts General Hospital was a failure , caused perhaps by not using enough gas .
Wells left Boston , but Morton and his pre-med tutor , Dr. Charles Jackson , both followed up by trying a different gas , ether .
Morton secretly experimented on small animals and himself at his home in nearby West Needham .
Then , in his Boston dental office at 9 in the evening , Sept. 30 , 1846 , Morton used ether to painlessly extract a tooth from Eben Frost , a local merchant .
Morton continued the use of ether , and word spread .
Then it got in the newspapers .
Just 16 days after he first used ether on a dental patient , Morton put a surgical patient under for Dr. John Warren in a well - attended demonstration at Mass .
General .
Unlike the failed nitrous oxide experiment of the year before , this was a resounding success .
Edward Abbot , the 20 - year - old who had just had a congenital vascular formation removed from his neck , told those assembled , " I did not experience pain at any time , though I knew that the operation was proceeding . "
Surgeon Warren declared , " Gentlemen , this is no humbug . "
Another of the surgeons , Henry Bigelow , published the procedure in the Boston Medical and Surgical Journal a few weeks later on Nov. 18 .
( Dr. Long did not publish his results until 1848 . )
At the urging of the son of a patent commissioner , Morton and Jackson applied for a patent Oct. 27 , 1846 , and it was granted a swift 16 days later on Nov. 12 .
They called their anesthetic Letheon and tried to keep the formula secret .
That drew angry protests from much of the medical profession .
Soon , however , doctors identified the gas by its distinct smell .
Morton tried petitioning Congress for money to compensate him for the widespread use of " his " discovery .
Despite two decades of campaigning , he got nothing , and he died in poverty at age 49 on July 15 , 1868 .

Terminally ill rodents with type 1 diabetes have been restored to full health with a single injection of a substance other than insulin by scientists at UT Southwestern Medical Center .
Since the discovery of insulin in 1922 , type 1 diabetes ( insulin - dependent diabetes ) in humans has been treated by injecting insulin to lower high blood sugar levels and prevent diabetic coma .
New findings by UT Southwestern researchers , which appear online and in a future issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , suggest that insulin is n't the only agent that is effective .
Leptin , a hormone produced by the body 's fat cells , also lowers blood glucose levels and maintains them in a normal range for extended periods , they found .
" The fact that these animals do n't die and are restored to normal health despite a total lack of insulin is hard for many researchers and clinicians to believe , " said Dr. Roger Unger , professor of internal medicine and senior author of the study .
" Many scientists , including us , thought it would be a waste of time to give leptin in the absence of insulin .
We 've been brainwashed into thinking that insulin is the only substance that can correct the consequences of insulin deficiency . "
The mechanism of leptin's glucose - lowering action appears to involve the suppression of glucagon , a hormone produced by the pancreas that raises glucose levels .
Normally , glucagon is released when the glucose , or sugar , level in the blood is low .
In insulin deficiency , however , glucagon levels are inappropriately high and cause the liver to release excessive amounts of glucose into the bloodstream .
This action is opposed by insulin , which tells the body 's cells to remove sugar from the bloodstream .
In type 1 diabetes , which affects about 1 million people in the U.S. , the pancreatic islet cells that produce insulin are destroyed .
Type 1 diabetics must take insulin multiple times a day to metabolize blood glucose and regiment their diets .
In comparison , patients with non-insulin dependent , or type 2 , diabetes make insulin , but their bodies do n't respond well to it .
Type 2 diabetes affects between 18 million and 20 million people in this country .

In the current study , researchers tested for the first time whether a single injection of the leptin gene given to insulin - deficient mice and rats on the verge of death from diabetic coma could reverse the severe condition and prevent the animals from dying .
The animals that received the leptin gene began producing excessive amounts of leptin , which reversed all the measurable consequences of type 1 diabetes including weight loss , hyperglycemia and ketoacidosis , a potentially fatal condition that develops when the body does n't have enough insulin to meet basic metabolic requirements .
Much of the effect was mediated by complete suppression of the high glucagon levels , said Dr. Xinxin Yu , assistant instructor of internal medicine and lead author of the study .
" These animals were actually dying , " Dr. Yu said .
" But if we gave them the leptin gene , within two weeks , the terminally ill rodents were restored to full health without any other treatment . "
Dr. Unger said it 's too premature to know whether leptin might someday replace insulin as a treatment for diabetic patients , but this study demonstrates that leptin could at least handle some of insulin's job requirements and do it for longer periods of time .
Injected insulin is biologically active for only three to four hours .
" My hope is that you could give leptin for one type of action – glucagon 's suppression , for example – and insulin for another .
Or perhaps give a substance other than insulin entirely , " Dr. Unger said .
" What would be a tremendous advance would be the ability to give an oral agent that suppresses glucagon without injections . "
Dr . Yu said the research team hypothesizes that leptin combats diabetes not only be suppressing glucagon 's action on the liver , but also by boosting the insulin - like actions of IGF - 1 ( insulin - like growth factor - 1 ) , a hormone that promotes growth and mimics insulin .

" One of the things that happens when a child gets type 1 diabetes is their growth is stunted until they 're given insulin , " Dr. Unger said .
" The same is true with these mice .
However , we found that if you take a diabetic rat that 's not receiving insulin and make it hyperleptinemic , it almost catches up growthwise . "
While the treated animals ' blood glucose levels inched back up over time , their hyperglycemia ( high blood sugar ) consistently remained well below the elevated pre-treatment levels .
The untreated rodents , on the other hand , died within two or three days .
The researchers tracked the treated rodents for 25 weeks .
The next step is to study other potential glucagon suppressants and begin leptin clinical trials within the next year .
Other UT Southwestern researchers involved in the study were Dr. May - Yun Wang , assistant professor of internal medicine ; Dr. Zhao Wang , postdoctoral researcher in internal medicine ; and former postdoctoral fellow Dr. Byung - Hyun Park .
The work was supported by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases , the Department of Veterans Affairs , and the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation .
I thought automated public pay toilets were a sure thing .
I mean , auto - cleaning , high - tech robo toilets that allow the occupant to remain inside for as long as they want , and then clean up all the evidence after the fact ... what could go wrong ?!
Oh right , hookers and drugs , that 's what .
Which is exactly why the five automated toilets in Seattle were recently sold off for a multi-million dollar loss .
How big a loss ?
Well , when they were installed four years ago the toilets cost $ 5 million .
This week , after an online auction , they sold for just $ 12,549 .
The lucky buyer who took a load off for Seattle was Butch Behn , owner of Racecar Supply in Rochester , Wash .
He plans to use two of the units at the South Sound Speedway .
The other three will be resold or reused later .
" It 'd probably be good to have a couple around for spares .
We get pretty busy at the track sometimes , " he said ( double entendre , anyone ? ) .
The article over at the USA Today mentions nothing about whether or not the fine city of Seattle refurbished these things before sending them along .
From the sounds of things that might be OK , as they were used for anything but nature 's call .

The New Democratic Party has reached a new high in voter support , a poll released Saturday suggests .
Perecentage of respondents supporting each party Party Sept. 23 -26 Sept. 17-20 Sept. 10 - 13 Conservative 38 39 40 Liberal 23 23 26 NDP 19 17 15 Green 9 11 9 Bloc 9 8 8 Source : Canadian Press / Harris - Decima polls
The four - day Canadian Press / Harris - Decima polI shows the party with 19 per cent , up from 14 per cent when the election was called .
The Conservatives are still leading with 38 per cent , followed by the Liberals with 23 per cent .
The Green party and the Bloc Québécois each has nine per cent .
" The gains for the NDP appear to be coming largely at the expense of the Green party and the Liberals , " Harris - Decima president Bruce Anderson told CBC News .
The NDP gains were likely the result of leader Jack Layton 's move toward the centre of the political spectrum , while Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion " still struggles to be heard , " Anderson said .
The figures were based on the question : " If a federal election were held tomorrow , who do you think you would be voting for in your area ? "
It then lists the parties .
The average sample was 1,305 , with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points .

After years of being the victim of a convicted pedophile , a teenager treaded heavily , stabbed and strangled his abuser .
After being pleaded guilty of killing the 56 - year old Jeffrey Edwin Payne in Adelaide last year , the 19 - year old teenager , whose name is Timothy Hemi Schaefer , faced sentencing submissions of murder in the South Australian Supreme Court , which was told that police found no clues that can prove the fact that Schaefer was sexually abused by Payne .
However , being involved in a drunken fight , the teenager punched the man in the nose , then he stabbed him in the leg and afterwards , before killing the man , he followed across a park where Schaefer accused Payne of sex abuse .
According to Greg Mead , who appears to be the lawyer of Mr. Schaefer , the boy was the victim of his violent alcoholic father , who abused him from an early age , beating him nearly every day .
" He was fed rotten meat , that his father would have to scrape the slime off before feeding the children " , said Mr. Mead .
Some of his children were sexually abused by Schaefer father 's friends , who supposed to take care of them while his father left the family for weeks at a time .
The lawyer said that is seemed that something had snapped in the teenager 's mind when Schaefer decided to kill Payne .
He added that the teenager was sent into the " primal rage " , which pushed him to attack the man who represented everyone who abused him .
According to the prosecutor Jane Powell , the teenager had no regret of murdering Payne , who was described by Schaefer as " a sack of sh**t " .
She added that during the attack the teenager had taken a break to have a cigarette .
Judge John Sulan ordered a neurological report and sent Schaefer back in custody .
The sentencing date is still to be set .

PAUL — Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska introduced herself to America before a roaring crowd at the Republican National Convention on Wednesday night as “ just your average hockey mom ” who was as qualified as the Democratic nominee , Senator Barack Obama , to be president of the United States .
An hour later Senator John McCain , a scrappy , rebellious former prisoner of war in Vietnam whose campaign was resurrected from near - death a year ago , was nominated by the Republican Party to be the 44th president of the United States after asking the cheering delegates , “ Do you think we made the right choice ” in picking Ms. Palin as the vice - presidential nominee ?
The roll - call vote made Mr. McCain , 72 , the first Republican presidential candidate to share the ticket with a woman and only the second presidential candidate from a major party to do so , after Walter F. Mondale selected Geraldine A. Ferraro as his running mate for the Democratic ticket in 1984 .
But the nomination was a sideshow to the evening ’s main event , the speech by the little - known Ms. Palin , who was seeking to wrest back the narrative of her life and redefine herself to the American public after a rocky start that has put Mr. McCain ’s closest aides on edge .
Ms. Palin ’s appearance electrified a convention that has been consumed by questions of whether she was up to the job , as she launched slashing attacks on Mr. Obama ’s claims of experience .
July 1 , 2008 - Robin Walker
As Gabe mentioned in his lengthy response to an email recently , the next class pack will focus on the Heavy .
For the Medic and Pyro packs we kept our goals for the pack pretty close to our chest , but for the Heavy we 've decided to open up the process a little .
Our hope is that you 'll get a better insight into how we approach design problems , and have some fun thinking about the problem yourself .
We do design collaboratively at Valve , and one of the side effects of it is that we really need to be able to evaluate design ideas as objectively as possible .
Otherwise design meetings would devolve into subjective arguing .
We 've found that the best method of working objectively is to have clear goals up front .
Once we 've got clear goals , we can throw a bunch of ideas up on the board and measure how well each idea achieves those goals .
Often the work of testing those ideas against the goals causes us to further refine or clarify the goals .
Here 's a list for how to help define the problems we want to solve with the Heavy pack .
It 's pretty much exactly what we would start a design meeting with .
Try coming up with a new unlockable for the Heavy that addresses the goal , while staying within the constraints as much as possible .
The extra section includes other details that are useful when trying to compare two viable ideas .
Goal : Make the Heavy more viable when he has no Medic to pair with .
Constraints :
It should n't have a cumulative effect when being healed by a Medic as well .
Heavy / Medic pairs do pretty well as it is .
It should n't significantly change the Heavy 's role , relative to other classes .
In particular , it should n't significantly encroach on another class 's role .
It should be understandable for both the user and the player it 's being used on .
How much work is it ?
How many new models , sounds , effects , etc ?
Does it deepen the Heavy 's skill curve ?
Is it easy to learn ?
Hard to master ?
Is it an interesting tool to choose relative to the base Heavy weapon it 's replacing ?
What scenarios can you envision in which each is useful ?
What arguments can you raise for why each is better than the other ?
How often does the Heavy need to think about it ?
Is it something he uses once every 5 minutes , or is it something he needs to be constantly thinking about ?
A greater impact on player decision making is generally a good thing .
How many other features of the game does it affect ?
Often , the best ideas are " economical " , with a small set of required actions , but a wide set of resulting effects .
Being in the right place before he starts firing , because he has little ability to move while firing .
Good anticipation of enemy behavior , for both the above point and because his minigun needs to be spun up before firing .
The ability to estimate the amount of damage he 's taking .
It takes time for the minigun to spin down , so he needs to be able to know when it 's time to retreat several seconds before his health has run out .
The ability to keep firing at a target while still keeping an eye out for other dangers , in particular Snipers & Spies .
Extra : Finally , keep in mind the skillset required to be a good Heavy .
He does n't really rely on fine aim , since his minigun has such a wide spread , instead relying on more tactical skills , like these :
Obviously , there are many more , like the full set of skills required to be a good user of an invulnerability charge .
If you compare his combat related skills to that of the Soldier or the Demoman , you 'll see he has a unique set that 's less about aiming & dodging , and more about commitment choices and accurate battle evaluation .
When thinking about your new unlockable idea , think about the new skills , or changes to old skills , that it 'll require the Heavy to learn .
It 's best if those new skills are n't identical to ones required of other classes , or class distinctions become less interesting .
In the end , solutions almost always require tradeoffs , from the breaking of a constraint to the addition of a large chunk of work to solve understandability .
A framework for objective evaluation is a great tool , but ultimately , something also needs to be fun , and that 's hard to evaluate on paper .
We try to end our design meetings with three potential solutions , and then implement crude versions of each .
Playtesting those crude versions usually shows us some pros and cons that we did n't see in the meeting .
Solving those cons , without giving up any of the pros , is the real meat of game design .
I hope you have some fun thinking about this with us .
Internationalization Activity leader Richard Ishida comments on the HTML 5 draft ,
The formerly deprecated b and i elements of HTML are defined in terms of their appearance : for example , the name of a ship can be bracketed with < i >… </i> , because ship names are italicized .
The problem is , of course , that this applies to English , but not to Japanese , for example .
Should these tags be suppressed in favour of something ‘ more semantic ’ ( whatever that means ) ?
Where it Started
HTML inherited its inline elements from the Texinfo format .
In Texinfo , there were directives for the types of emphasis expected in computer documentation ( @kbd , @samp , @code , @file , @dfn , @var , ... ) , many of which have no equivalent in non-technical prose .
To be honest , most of them are not used in most technical documentation , because of ignorance or unconcern induced by the use of Microsoft Word , whose default styles do not include anything for computer text .
Because there were no tags for book titles , foreign tags , binomial names ( as in Homo sapiens ) , and all the other things we conventionally use italic for , the advice was to just use < em > … </ em > , which frankly is no more semantic than using < i >…</i> .
If anything it is worse , because it means em is no longer consistently representing emphasis .
It Gets Worse
To make things worse , Microsoft Internet Explorer ’s default rendering of the var and dfn element shows they misunderstood their purpose , hastening their obsolescence .
The var element was originally for ‘ variables ’ such as x and y in mathematics or placeholders in syntax definitions , as in the following example :
Type the command rm - rf dir to delete the directory dir and all its contents .
The usual convention is to distinguish the varaiable ( dir in this example ) using italics .
MSIE instead used the monospace ( ‘ typewriter ’ ) font used for computer text , seemingly thinking that var was for identifiers found in computer programs .
The dfn element was for defining instances of a term , as in the following example ( stolen from Wikipedia ) :
A definition is a statement of the meaning of a word or phrase .
The term to be defined is known as the definiendum ( Latin : that which is to be defined ) .
The words which define it are known as the definiens ( Latin : that which is doing the defining ) .
The typographical convention used varies from book to book ; I have seen italic , bold , and bold italic used .
Italics makes sense to me because it corresponds to the emphasis that is given to the term when speaking a definition aloud .
Boldface makes sense because it allows one to find the term later when skimming backwards to remind yourself of the definition .
Most web browsers do not distinguish text enclosed in < dfn >… </ dfn > at all .
Both of these problems are non-issues nowadays , since we can override the default styles using CSS .
But during the late 1990s this was not possible , so even the vanishingly small percentage of the writing population that knew and cared about such distinctions had to drop them .
When HTML started being used more widely they could have added more elements for embedded foreign words , words mentioned but not used , etc. , but never quite got around to it .
It is probably just as well : this process could go on forever as technically - minded folks are liable to invent distinctions that would never be used by normal people .
Donald E. Knuth , for example , used two different forms of italic in his books ( traditional italic for emphasis , slanted for book titles ) , and I have seen people who give different meanings to ‘…’ and “ … ” quotation .
The problem is that this makes it even harder for a non-specialist to know which tags to use to mark up a given phrase , which makes it more likely that they will throw up their hands and refuse to try to learn .
And let ’s not forget that most people who write do not write their own tags , but just mash ⌘ I to make their word processor switch to italics mode .
What the HTML 4 standard did do was introduce the q tag to represent quotation .
This was , in my opinion , a serious error , and has cost web - browser implementers hours of labour that could have been better spent doing something useful .
The HTML - 5 approach is to take the opposite tack , and un -deprecate the i tag , giving it the meaning roughly ‘ something that would normally be italicized ’ .
In scripts that do not use italics this might be taken as meaning that the i tag is not useful with those scripts , or that it might be used to mark up text whose connection to italic fonts is more tenuous .
It this seems too simple consider that the Guardian newspaper goes one further , and distinguishes book and movie titles , ship names , and all that jazz with the use of capital letters alone : they do not use italics for these .
In the busy environment of a news office this probably gains them hundreds of person - hours ’ productivity a week by eliminating a whole class of argument between sub-editors .
Translation
One question Richard Ishida raises is that this may mean that a translator of a passage has less information to work with than if more detailed semantic mark - up were used .
While I can see the point I do n’t think it is likely to make a big difference practically .
For example , suppose our hypothetical translator has the following paragraph to translate to Japanese :
Captain Sulu beamed up to the Excelsior and handed Krorg ’s bat ’leth to the transporter chief to dispose of .
I almost did n’t make it this time , he thought ruefully .
Already she needs to know whether to render Sulu ’s name as Kato ( as used in the Japanese version of the TV show ) or some transliteration of Sulu , the Japanese transliteration of Krorg ’s name and the Klingon term bat ’leth , and for that matter a decision on whether Excelsior ’s name is to be transliterated or translated .
At this point I imagine that recognising that Excelsior and bat ’leth are italicized for different reasons and these correspond to different punctuation marks in Japanese is the least of her troubles .
This is what XML is for
There are still situations where the complete and accurate marking up of text is desired — generally in an academic or other technical context .
For these purposes , an application - specific XML vocabulary seems like the ticket .
Trying to add all the possible extra meanings people might need to HTML will only bloat HTML ( which is already too complex ) while probably omitting exactly the special meaning you need now .
The alternative if sticking to HTML would be to use class attributes in the obvious way to augment the information conveyed by the i tags :
< p >< span class =" nameprefix rank " > Captain </ span >
Sulu beamed up to the < i class = " ship " >
Excelsior </i > and handed < span class= " personname transliteratedfromklingon " >
Krorg </ span >’s < span class=" foreignword transliteratedfromklingon " > bat < span class= " glottalstop " > " ’</ span>leth </ span > to the transporter chief to dispose of . < i class= " internalmonologue " > I almost did n’t make it this time < /i > , he thought ruefully .

Another reason why we need active and competent regulations for Wall Street .
None of this matters for people like McCain who own 12 houses , but normal Americans are trying to rely on retirement plans when they grow old .
With McCain ’s proposed cutbacks to Social Security , our retirement programs are even more important .
It also brings us back to McCain ’s radical plan to send our Social Security money to Wall Street .
Yes , the same Wall Street who just lost $ 700 billion yesterday .
Imagine the consequences of an unchecked market controlling our Social Security money , because McCain has been against regulations for 26 years in Washington .
Twenty six years of protecting Wall Street .
That ’s the real McCain .
About $ 700 billion evaporated from retirement plans , government pension funds and other investment portfolios .
It was by far the most stomach - churning single day since a financial crisis began to bubble up from billions of dollars in rotten mortgage loans that have crippled the balance sheets of one bank after another and landed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under the control of the federal government .
“ We are in the middle of a deep , dark recession , and it wo n’t end soon .
Here it is , and it is pretty nasty , ” said Barry Ritholtz , who writes the popular financial blog The Big Picture and is chief executive officer of research firm FusionIQ .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Genetically engineered animals moved closer to the dinner table on Thursday as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration made the process it will use to review new proposals public .

The FDA published proposed detailed guidelines that producers of genetically engineered animals would have to follow to determine whether there are any risks to humans , the environment and the animals themselves .
The guidelines bring the decades - old technology of genetic engineering for animals one step closer to the market .
Genetically modified cattle , pigs , fish and goats are being produced for a variety of uses .
Some produce pharmaceuticals in their milk or blood .
Others are resistant to diseases such as mad cow or produce healthier meat or milk .
“ Many kinds of genetically engineered animals are in development , although none has yet been approved by the agency for marketing , ” FDA Deputy Commissioner Randall Lutter said .
It was important to formalize procedures the FDA uses to regulate genetically engineered animals , Lutter said , “ because the technology has evolved to a point where commercialization of these animals is no longer over the horizon . ”
The agency is inviting public comment on its proposals until November 18 and could modify them before they become final .
SEVERAL QUESTIONS
Consumer groups called the FDA ’s action a good first step , but said the guidelines fail to answer several important questions .
One concern is the approval process , which would be secretive to protect companies ’ proprietary interests .
“ It ’s unclear whether FDA has the authority and expertise to address the full range of risks , ” said Gregory Jaffe of the Center for Science in the Public Interest .
Foods produced from some bioengineered animals will not have to be labeled , the FDA said , also drawing some ire .
“ It is incomprehensible to us that FDA does not view these animals as different from their conventional counterparts , ” said Jean Halloran , director of food policy initiatives at Consumers Union .
“ Consumers have a right to know if the ham , bacon or pork chops they are buying come from pigs that have been engineered with mouse genes . ”
But the FDA said labeling would be required if there is a significant change in the food .
For example , pork from pigs engineered to produce meat with higher levels of omega - 3 fatty acids would need a label .

This is the home page for Guppy - PE , a programming environment providing object and heap memory sizing , profiling and analysis .
It includes a prototypical specification language that can be used to formally specify aspects of Python programs and generate tests and documentation from a common source .
Note that this package is for Python 2 only .
Guppy 3 , created by YiFei Zhu for Python 3 ( recommended ! ) is available here :
Guppy
Guppy is an umbrella package combining Heapy and GSL with support utilities such as the Glue module that keeps things together .
The name guppy was chosen because I found it in a backward - dictionary as a word ending with py and I thought it was cute enough and that it would not so likely conflict with some other package name .
It was to be a general name since all kinds of packages should fit under this top level name .
The name guppy - pe is because there was another project named guppy in Sourceforge when I was about to register guppy .
The other guppy was not in Python , so I added - pe which means Programming Environment .
The Python package is just guppy .
Heapy
The aim of Heapy is to support debugging and optimization regarding memory related issues in Python programs .
Such issues can make a program use too much memory , making it slow by itself as well as slowing down an entire server , or it may fail to run at all in a limited memory device such as a mobile phone .
The primary motivation for Heapy is that there has been a lack of support for the programmer to get information about the memory usage in Python programs .
Heapy is an attempt to improve this situation .
A project with a similar intent is PySizer .
The problem situation has a number of aspects , which I think can be characterised , for example , as follows .
What data about memory and objects to get from the system .
How to get that data technically .
How portable to be across platforms and versions .
How to process data to compress it and find structure in it .
How to present the resulting information to the user .
How to make a coherent , useful & usable system of it all that does n't interfer too much with the target system it is analysing .
As Heapy has evolved , with considerations like this in mind , it currently provides the following features .
Data gathering
Finds reachable and / or unreachable objects in the object heap , and collects them into special C- implemented ' nodesets ' .
Can get data about the objects such as their sizes and how they refer to each other .
Uses a C library that can get data about non-standard types from extension modules , given a function table .
Optionally uses multiple Python interpreters in the same process , so one can monitor the other transparently .
Data processing Algebraic set operations , for example the set difference can be used to extract the objects allocated after a reference point in time .
Various classifications of object sets , and different classifiers can be combined .
Shortest paths to a set of objects from other objects , which can be used to find out why the objects are retained in memory .
Calculation of the ' dominated ' set from a set of root objects which yields the set of objects that would be deallocated if the root objects were deallocated .
Presentation Tables where each row represents a classification of data .
Lists of shortest paths where the edges show the relationships found between the underlying C objects .
Reference pattern , presenting a spanning tree of the graph with sets of objects treated as a unit .
Limits the number of rows when presentation objects are shown , without depending on an external pager .
An interactive graphical browser program can show a time sequence of classified heap data sets as a graph together with a table detailing the data at a specific time or the difference between two points in time .
Portability aspects
Can be used with an unmodified C Python , back to version 2.3 AFAIK .
Does not depend on any external unix - specific or other utilities .
Requires
Tk if the graphical browser is to be used .
Can not be used with Jython or other non-C Python versions .
System aspects A general ' glue ' model provides a session context that imports modules and creates objects automatically when accessed .
The glue model is not Heapy specific but is used throughout Guppy and could be used by other packages as well .
The glue model makes it practical to have everything in Guppy being dynamically allocated in a session context , so there is no need for any global module - level variables .
The modules themself are stored as usual in sys.modules but they are not modified .
To be true there is one exception I come to think of but it is really exceptional .
Heapy has been used during development of itself and of the other parts of Guppy .
It has been used to tell how much memory the parts of compound objects use , to see what could be worthwhile to optimize .
It was used to find a memory leak in the Heapy profile browser , and to find out the cause , which as far as I can tell was due to a bug in a library routine which I have reported .
GSL
The Guppy Specification Language is an evolving specification language .
I started experimenting with this language because I felt the need to have a way to specify documentation and tests from the same source .
GSL can describe aspects of a system , especially its API , in a way that can be automatically converted to tests as well as to documents .
The documents generated have a formal structure for describing the formal aspects of the specification , complemented with descriptive text from the same source documents .
A language that is similar in intent is the Assertion Definition Language .
Specifications written in GSL can be used for :
Generating documentation Documents are generated from a combination of formally described aspects and descriptive text .
The formal aspects include specifications of attributes and methods and their parameters and return values .
The descriptive text is written together with the formal specifications .
It can include HTML tags and attributes , specified in the GSL dotted tree format .
Output modules can convert from the GSL form to formats such as HTML or Latex .
Generating tests
The tests generated can check the formal aspects of the specification against an implementation .
It can test whether objects have the promised attributes , and then if the kind of attribute is specified it is tested again and so on .
Methods are checked to see if they can be called with the forms of parameters specified .
The return value can then be checked up to some limit of recursion .
Resolving compatibility issues A specification can be compared to a previous specification , to tell according to formalized rules whether or not the new one is backwards compatible with the old one , and if not , in what way they differ .
For example , according to such rules , an attribute or parameter type can be added to a specification , but it can not be removed .
The idea is that all tests possibly generated from the old specification should still succeed with objects conforming to the new specification . --
A program could likely compare specifications for compatibility automatically , but this is not yet implemented .
GSL has been used to generate the documentation for this Guppy distribution .
Some part of the specification has been checked against the implementation using the generated tests , which did reveal some discrepancies that were subsequently corrected .
The documents generated by GSL use a formal syntax to describe parameter modes .
This document contains examples of such parameter descriptions and explains what they mean .

However , Mr Maroni dismissed Unicef 's concerns .
" This is the right path , " he said .
" There are children in these camps living with mice .
Is that the right of an infant ?
The people like Unicef who complain should visit the camps and see the conditions in which children live . "
A secret order issued by George Bush giving US special forces carte blanche to mount counter - terrorist operations inside Pakistani territory raised fears last night that escalating conflict was spreading from Afghanistan to Pakistan and could ignite a region - wide war .
The unprecedented executive order , signed by Bush in July after an intense internal administration debate , comes amid western concern that the war against the Taliban in Afghanistan and its al - Qaida backers based in " safe havens " in western Pakistan 's tribal belt is being lost .
Following Bush 's decision , US navy Seals commandos , backed by attack helicopters , launched a ground raid into Pakistan last week which the US claimed killed about two dozen insurgents .
Pakistani officials condemned the raid as illegal and said most of the dead were civilians .
US and Nato commanders are anxious to halt infiltration across the Afghanistan - Pakistan border of insurgents and weapons blamed for casualties among coalition troops .
The killing of a US soldier in eastern Afghanistan yesterday brought American losses in 2008 to 112 , the deadliest year since the 2001 intervention .
The move is regarded as unprecedented in terms of sending troops into a friendly , allied country .
But another American objective is the capture of Osama bin Laden , the al - Qaida leader held responsible for organising the 9/11 attacks .
He and his second - in - command , Ayman al - Zawahiri , are thought to be hiding in the tribal areas of north and south Waziristan .
Bush 's decision to extend the war into Pakistan , and his apparent hope of British backing , formed the background to a video conference call with Gordon Brown yesterday .
" What 's happening on the border of Pakistan and Afghanistan is something where we need to develop a new strategy , " Brown said before talking to Bush .
Brown said he would discuss the border issue with Pakistan 's new president , Asif Ali Zardari , who visits Britain next week .
Bush 's unusual move in personally calling the prime minister for an Afghan strategy discussion has led to speculation that the US president was trying to line up British support for the new policy , including the possible involvement of British special forces in future cross - border incursions .
Bush 's executive order is certain to cause strains with some Nato allies fearful that a spreading conflict could bring down Pakistan 's weak civilian government and spark a wider war .
Last night there were indications of open disagreement .
James Appathurai , a Nato spokesman , said the alliance did not support cross - border attacks or deeper incursions in to Pakistani territory .
" The Nato policy , that is our mandate , ends at the border .
There are no ground or air incursions by Nato forces into Pakistani territory , " he said .
Nato has 53,000 troops in Afghanistan , some of which are American .
But the US maintains a separate combat force dedicated to battling al - Qaida and counter - terrorism in general .
Nato defence ministers are due to discuss Afghanistan in London next week .
Last week 's raid , and a subsequent attack on Monday by a Predator drone firing Hellfire missiles , provoked protests across the board in Pakistan , with only Zardari among leading politicians refusing to publicly condemn it .
Pakistan 's armed forces chief , General Ashfaq Parvez Kayani , said the army would defend the country 's sovereignty " at all costs " .
He went on : " No external force is allowed to conduct operations inside Pakistan . "
He denied there was any agreement or understanding to the contrary .
His comments were widely interpreted as a warning to Zardari not to submit to the American importunity .
But his tough words also raised the prospect of clashes between US and Pakistani forces if American military incursions continue or escalate .
Until now , Washington has regarded Pakistan as a staunch ally in the " war on terror " that was launched in 2001 .
But the alliance has been weakened by last month 's forced resignation of the army strongman , former general Pervez Musharraf , and his replacement by Zardari , Benazir Bhutto 's widower .
Polls suggest most Pakistanis favour ending all counter - terrorism cooperation with Washington , which is blamed for a rising civilian casualty toll in Afghanistan and in the tribal areas .
Yousaf Raza Gilani , Pakistan 's prime minister , joined the chorus of condemnation yesterday .
He reportedly told state media Kayani 's warning that unilateral US actions were undermining the fight against Islamist extremism represented the government 's position .
Admiral Mike Mullen , chairman of the joint chiefs , and Robert Gates , defence secretary , told Congress this week that victory in Afghanistan was by no means certain and the US needed to take the fight to the enemy inside Pakistan .
Mullen called for a " more comprehensive strategy " embracing both sides of the border .
" Until we work more closely with the Pakistani government to eliminate the safe havens from which they operate , the enemy will only keep coming , " he said .
US and Pakistani forces have clashed by accident in the past during operations to root out militants , although sections of the Pakistani military and intelligence services are said to harbour deep resentment about perceived American interference .
A strain of noisy laboratory mice shows all the signs of autism that are used to diagnose human beings , according to new research .
The mice may help scientists study the complicated genetics of autism .
Maria Luisa Scattoni of the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland , and colleagues , separated baby mice of different laboratory strains from their mothers .
The pups , which had not yet opened their eyes , made noises aimed to bring mom back .
These ultrasonic sounds – too low for the human ear to detect – come in 10 different types , from clicking to pure tones .
Most mice in the study used all 10 categories .
But the vocabulary of one strain , called BTBR , was limited to four calls , focusing on “ harmonics ” that contain multiple , simultaneous sounds – like guitar strings plucked together .
BTBR mice also called louder and for longer periods of time .
“ This is similar to what others have found in autistic infants , ” says Scattoni .
Listen to a recording of a BTBR mouse here .

Naturalistic tool
Language problems in human babies with autism lead them to hum and grunt for extended periods , and squeal loudly and inappropriately .
These babies may also cry for extended periods .
Previous studies from the same group have shown that these mice also show the two other symptoms normally used to diagnose human autism – repetitive behavior and restricted social interaction .
“ BTBR is the first [ mouse strain ] to have all three , ” says Scattoni .
Most mice used to study autism are transgenic – their DNA contains an extra human gene thought to be involved in the condition .
But BTBR mice have been used in laboratories for years , and may provide a more naturalistic tool to study the interaction of the 10 to 15 genes thought to be involved in autism , says Mady Hornig of Columbia University in New York .
“ We can begin to understand how the genetic mechanisms may all be working together , ” she says .

Israel PM sparks fury by calling for complete withdrawal from West Bank and Golan Heights
Outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert has stunned observers by declaring that Israel must withdraw from almost all the territories occupied by Israel since 1967 – the most far - reaching concessions ever offered by an Israeli leader .
Mr Olmert said Israel had a limited window of opportunity to take ' a historic step ' in relations with the Palestinians and the Syrians .
His comments provoked outrage from the Right and amazement from the Left .
Olmert has been forced to step down over a corruption scandal and is currently heading a caretaker government while the newly - elected party leader Tzipi Livni tries to form a coalition .
Advice : Israel 's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert , right , and Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni attend the weekly cabinet meeting in Jerusalem yesterday
Olmert is more likely to be remembered for his ill - fated attack on Lebanon in 2006 than any peacemaking .
He has no chance of achieving a breakthrough before he steps down .
' One more hill , another 100 metres , it 's not something that will affect Israel 's security , ' Olmert told the Hebrew daily Yedioth Ahronoth on the eve of the Jewish New Year .
' What I am telling you now has not been said by any Israeli leader before me .
The time has come to say these things .
The time has come to put them on the table , ' he declared .
The paper said Olmert 's comments would complicate Livni 's job even before she takes over .
She has five weeks in which to form a government or call a general election .
' He places on the doorstep of his successor a foreign policy doctrine , the likes of which has never been spoken by an incumbent prime minister , ' commented his interviewers .

' At the end of the day , we will have to withdraw from the most decisive areas of the territories .
In exchange for the same territories left in our hands , we will have to give compensation in the form of territories within the State of Israel , ' Olmert said .
' We have to reach an agreement with the Palestinians , the meaning of which is that in practice we will withdraw from almost all the territories , if not all the territories , ' Olmert said .
' I think we are very close to an agreement , ' he added .
Turning to Syria , Olmert said he had initiated secret talks in February 2007 .
' It is true that an agreement with Syria comes with danger , ' he said .
' Those who want to act with zero danger should move to Switzerland . '
' I 'd like see if there is one serious person in the State of Israel who believes it is possible to make peace with the Syrians without eventually giving up the Golan Heights , ' he said , referring to the strategic plateau which is the only occupied area outside Jerusalem formally annexed by Israel .

He admitted that his views had changed since he entered politics 35 years ago .
' For many of those years , I was unwilling to look at reality in all its depth , ' he said .
His comments , signalling the most far - reaching concessions ever made in public by an Israeli leader , provoked fury among his critics .
The Right accused him of betraying his nationalist roots and tying the hands of future Israeli peace negotiators .
The Left demanded to know how his policies in office for nearly three years squared with his new - found generosity .
' The prime minister 's concession of the essential borders for defence is a gamble with our very existence , and the future of the State of Israel , ' said Yuval Steinitz , a right - wing MP and former chairman of the Knesset Defence Committee .
Steinitz said Olmert did not understand ' the fundamentals of security . '
Yossi Beilin , a leading doveish MP , said Olmert 's change of heart had come too late .
' Olmert has committed the unforgivable sin of revealing his true stance on Israel 's national interest just when he has nothing left to lose , ' said Beilin .
' You believe it is in Israel 's national interest to make peace , but for two - and - a - half years , almost three years , all you have done is wage an unnecessary war in Lebanon and … stifle any peace process , ' Beilin told Olmert via Army Radio .
US deficit zooming to half - trillion as Bush leaves
( Agencies )
Updated : 2008-07-29 08:07
Washington -
The US government 's budget deficit will surge past a half - trillion dollars next year , according to gloomy new estimates , a record flood of red ink that promises to force the winner of the presidential race to dramatically alter his economic agenda .
The deficit will hit $ 482 billion in the 2009 budget year that will be inherited by Democrat Barack Obama or Republican John McCain , the White House estimated Monday .
That figure is sure to rise after adding the tens of billions of dollars in additional Iraq war funding it does n't include , and the total could be higher yet if the economy fails to recover as the administration predicts .
The result : the biggest deficit ever in terms of dollars , though several were higher in the 1980s and early 1990s as a percentage of the overall US economy .
Neither campaign is backing off campaign promises -- McCain to cut taxes and Obama to expand health and education programs -- in light of the bleaker new figures .
" We can't afford not to invest in some major initiatives such as health and energy and more tax cuts , " said Obama economic adviser Jason Furman .
But Democrats controlling Congress suggest that may have to change once US President Bush 's successor takes office .
" Whoever becomes the next president will have a very , very sobering first week in office , " said Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad , D - N.D .
McCain promises to renew the full roster of Bush tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003 and add many more for businesses and upper income people who pay the alternative minimum tax .
The Bush tax cuts expire at the end of 2010 and renewing them would soon cost well over $ 200 billion a year .
Eliminating the alternative minimum at the same time would cost almost as much .
Obama would repeal tax cuts on wealthier taxpayers and investors but would leave most of the Bush tax cuts in place while seeking additional cuts for senior citizens , the middle class and the working poor .
And he also wants lots of new spending for health care , education and many other federal programs .
" There 's a total disconnect between today 's report and what we 're hearing on the campaign trail , " said Robert Bixby of the Concord Coalition budget watchdog group .
The deficit situation confronting the next US president is reminiscent of that which Bill Clinton faced in 1993 .
Under Wall Street pressure , Clinton abandoned promises of tax cuts and pushed a tax - heavy deficit reduction plan through a Democratic Congress .
The administration said the deficit was being driven to an all - time high by the sagging economy and the stimulus payments being made to 130 million households in an effort to keep the country from falling into a deep recession .
But the numbers could go even higher if the economy performs worse than the White House predicts .
The budget office predicts the US economy will grow at a rate of 1.6 percent this year and will rebound to a 2.2 percent growth rate next year .
That 's a half point higher than predicted by the widely cited " blue chip " consensus of business economists .
The administration also sees inflation averaging 3.8 percent this year , but easing to 2.3 percent next year -- better than the 3 percent seen by the blue chip panel .
While visiting the Philips research lab here in Amsterdam I came across a company that is getting the Star Trek replicator closer to everyday life .
Imagine being able to create any 3D object you want -a World of Warcraft avatar , a chess set , a lamp , a Lego piece you are missing , a house for a train model , or a fully articulated astromech droid - print it remotely , and have it delivered to your house in just 10 days , even without knowing any 3D software .
This is exactly what Shapeways does .
Not next century , but right now , today .
Shapeways is a spin - off from Philips ' Lifestyle Incubator .
On one side , it 's a website where you can upload your 3D models - which can even have joins - or use an online 3D creator with access to everyday models .
The online 3D creator is extremely easy to use , so anyone can modify them without any technical or product design knowledge .
With this , anyone can make a candle holder or a fruit bowl out of song lyrics or a personal message by just typing it .
Advanced users to access to 3D packages can upload any model they can imagine in a 3D standard format , like STL , Collada or X3D .
On the other side , there are different types of rapid prototyping machines that can create that model using a variety of materials , from nylon to plastic composites , each with different properties .
For example , the nylon one results in a semi- flexible object , while a plastic called " Cream Robust " gives you an extremely hard finish .
Once you select the material and submit your model to 3D printer , you will get it in your hands in 10 days , with an average cost of $ 50 to $ 150 , including shipping .
While the system is not perfect yet , there 's no color yet and you can get different textures for the surfaces , the start is very promising and the possibilities are endless .
As a consumer , the customization of objects is attractive enough , but the ability to upload any object and receive it in 10 days is even more exciting ( and I do n't mean printing dildos , which - apparently / sadly / fortunately for Benny - is not allowed ) .
Model makers , Lego aficionados , product designers , and toy lovers of any kind , will absolutely love this one .

Really sick .
Stranger calls you a faggot , then punches you in the head , for no reason .
Cop arrives , let ’s the attacker go , refuses to file a report .
The city then refuses the settlement request that the cop in question undergo sensitivity training .

You know you must be doing something right when both the Discovery Institute and the Institute for Creation Research get on your case !
These two outlets of religious - centered non-thinking vehemently attacked my recent post on the inanity of choosing Sarah Palin as a Vice Presidential candidate -- which focused on her positions on teaching ( she supports “ equal time ” for Creationism ) and censorship ( she has attempted to remove “ offensive ” books from a public library , going so far as threatening a librarian with being fired ) .
The Discovery Institute blog , Uncommon Descent ( how cute ! ) called me “ a worrisome character ” because I dared to suggest that education is not about having kids debate “ the two sides ” of every issue ( to begin with , because there often are more than two sides , and straightjacketing the discussion in that way commits the logical fallacy of contrived dualism ) .
Dave Scot , at Uncommon Descent picked up on an analogy I gave about the silliness of the “ two views ” doctrine and commented : “ Massimo doubts that the science establishment can present the evidence for a round earth , like live satellite images , well enough to let children use critical thinking skills to decide if the scientists have made a compelling case . ”
Ah , so indirect observation now is enough to convince children ( or anyone ) of a scientific notion , is it ?
Well , we can observe evolution and natural selection happening under ( indeed , inside , in the case of the influenza virus ) our very noses , but still 50 % of Americans refuse to accept it .
Fossils are readily observable by anyone who cares doing so , but of course they are dismissed as the handiwork of the devil .
Surely Mr. Scot is aware that some ( “ adult ” )
Americans reject images “ allegedly ” generated by space missions ( like the ones to the Moon ) as fabrications by a conspiracy - prone government , so why on earth would one trust satellite photos of the round earth ?
That ’s the beauty of faith - based worldviews : they are impervious to mere facts .
Even more amusing is Christine Dao ’s commentary on the ICR ’s web site , whose title is “ Palin slammed for supporting open debate ” ( if there is anything we have learned recently about Sarah Palin is that she is a vindictive politician who cannot bear dissent , let alone encourage open debate ) .
Ms. Dao deserves to be quoted extensively to be appreciated : “ Logic and evaluating evidence are tools used to analyze the world around us , and so far that same logic and evaluation has led many scientists and others to believe that the evidence speaks of a Creator God rather than random chance and natural selection . ”
Oh really ?
Which scientists would those be ?
The faculty of the ICR , who has to swear allegiance to a literalist interpretation of the Bible to be kept in employment ?
I do n’t recall being forced to sign a document committing me to Darwinism when I was hired at Stony Brook University .
Maybe it was in the small print .
Again , Dao : “ Limiting how the evidence can be interpreted puts educators in the interesting position of not teaching students , but instead conditioning them to recite the ‘ correct ’ answers without a second thought to other possible explanations . ”
Except that I advocate the teaching of critical thinking skills , so that students can in fact inoculate themselves -- of their own accord -- against the nonsense propagandized by the Discovery Institute and the ICR .
But critical thinking takes time to learn , you do n’t just serve up two options without tools for assessment and say “ here , you decide . ” More from Dao : “ Individuals such as Pigiliucci [ sic ] have taken their cue from Richard Dawkins , P.Z. Meyers , and other evolutionary supporters in their active condemnation and ridicule of anyone who does n’t agree with their own platforms . ”
First of all , if anyone thinks I have much agreement with Richard Dawkins they have not been paying attention ( as for P.Z. , I have discovered him many years after I started writing about these things , back in 1997 ) .
Now , the charge of ridicule is one that needs to be carefully assessed , however .
I take the position that most people who believe in creationism are victims of blind religious propaganda and of the failure of our education system ( though the roots of creationism are of course much more complex than just that ) .
They , therefore , deserve consideration and help ( in the form of good science education ) .
Demagogues like Scot and Dao , on the other hand , are willfully engaging in a concerted effort to undermine the use of reason in our society , an attitude that among many other things has given us eight disastrous years under a “ commander in chief ” who belittles expert advice while thinking with his gut ( which apparently advised him to support “ equal teaching ” ) .
This same anti-intellectualism may well give us several more years of an even worse version of the same in Sarah Palin .
It is people like Scot and Dao , and a fortiori their sponsoring organizations , that deserve to have all the ridicule that thinking people can amass heaped on them .

BAGHDAD — Iraq ’s Cabinet approved an initial gas agreement Sunday between the Oil Ministry and Royal Dutch Shell PLC to invest in a joint venture to tap natural gas in southern Iraq , a government statement said .
The agreement calls for establishing a joint venture between the state - run South Oil Co. and Shell to exploit the fields , the statement added without any other details .
In June , Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani told parliament that Iraq was expected to finalize a deal this summer that would enable it to exploit flared associated gas for domestic use and exports .
Shell had approached the Oil Ministry in December with its plans and since then meetings have been held outside Iraq , mainly in Damascus , Syria .
Shell is expected to invest $ 3 billion to $ 4 billion over five years to gather at least 500 - 600 million cubic feet of flared gas per day from the southern fields .
The state - run South Oil Co. is expected to control 51 percent of the venture , while Shell would hold the remaining 49 percent .
The agreement provides for construction of a number of liquefied natural gas facilities , the statement said .
According to Iraqi oil officials , Iraq loses approximately $ 40 million worth of natural gas each day because it is either re-injected into wells or burned due to a lack of sufficient infrastructure to exploit it for consumption or export .
The agreement would be Iraq ’s second major hydrocarbon deal since the U.S. - led invasion of 2003 that toppled Saddam Hussein .
Last week , the Cabinet approved a $ 3 billion deal with China to develop the Ahdab oil field in southern Iraq .

LAWRENCE AUSTER : JANUARY 26 , 1949 - MARCH 29 , 2013 Lawrence Auster died today at 3:56 a.m. , Eastern Daylight Time , at a hospice in West Chester , Pennsylvania .
His death came after more than a week of rapidly worsening distress and physical collapse caused by the pancreatic cancer he endured for almost three years .
On Monday evening , after arriving at the hospice in the late afternoon , Mr. Auster read and responded to a few emails .
He then closed his battered and medicine - stained Lenovo laptop for the last time .
“ That ’s enough for now , ” he said , holding his hands over the computer as if sated by an unfinished meal .
He did not expect that to be the last .
But the blogging career that stands out on the Internet and in the history of American letters as a tour de force of philosophical and cultural insight is over .
Mr. Auster entered a state of sedated and sometimes pained sleep the next day , after a night of agony .
He spoke no more than a few words during the next two days and died peacefully this morning after about ten hours of unusually quiet and mostly undisturbed rest .

I am still here Today I have received many emails that were sent to me starting Monday and I have replied to those few that were reply - worthy .
It ’s too hard to explain why I had not received them until today .
In any case , please know that I am still alive , that my life as a Christian ( though hardly a good one ) continues , and that I am not in imminent danger of death .
I am leaving the hospital probably tomorrow and within a week will probably be back at my friend ’s home .
Why am I not saying more about myself and my circumstances ?
It ’s simply too complicated , given the objective situation , and too difficult , given my physical situation , to say more .

An important entry posted last night has disappeared from the main page
This is a major symptom — the worst symptom so far — of the florid schizophrenic HAL - like destructive insanity of my Lenovo laptop with Windows XP .
Yet the event does not seem a total disaster resulting in the total loss of several hours of intense work .
The public entry page itself has not seemed to disappear .
When last I checked , a couple of minutes ago , it was here .
If the preceding hyperlink to the public entry works and still displays , the public page still exists .
The public entry can still be reconstituted .
It is about my progress in the hospital .
The entry address itself is ( or rather it was ; who knows how long will continue to exist ? ) :
http://www.amnation.com/vfr/archives/024377.html.
I am copying everything to different applications for security .
But because I cannot send an e-mail from the hospital and I do n’t have a USB backup drive with me in the hospital I cannot instantly create a secure backup if the laptop proceeds to total breakdown .
The laptop is in worse shape than my body , and seemingly far less responsive to treatment .
But fear not : Alan M. , who hosts VFR on his own backup site , does an automatic nightly backup of VFR .

When in the course of human diseases it becomes necessary for one person to set forth before the world the recent history his own disease … Yesterday morning —
Wednesday morning — beset by innumerable physical problems , I went to the same emergency room at the same excellent suburban Pennsylvania hospital near my friend ’s house to which I had gone February 11th , and , in the same manner as last month , was admitted to the hospital on the same day .
It was not until today that I had with me my laptop computer ( though not entirely : I can get on the Web , but for some reason I cannot receive e-mail ; hence my being out of touch ) .
There is so much to tell about the many developments in my case over the last several days , or over the last three days , or over the last two days , that I would hardly know where to start .
The only way to simplify the story to an account which would not be too complicated to tell clearly and non-confusingly given my present circumstances and present capacity — and without a larger effort than I am willing or able to make given my present desire and capacity — would be to write : “ My condition has improved amazingly over the last two days .
Since I was checked into the hospital yesterday morning , the simultaneous , multileveled , and overwhelming pains and discomforts that I had yesterday are all gone . ”
At the same time other problems , caused by the treatment itself , have appeared : I am feeling somewhat disoriented and I have occasionally experienced excess sleepiness .
My medical team told me in advance of these possibilities .
We are working together on fine - tuning the level of intravenous treatment so that it will adequately keep down the pain without in any way incapacitating me .

But here ’s one exception to the abstract generality of this post .
Friday afternoon I was brought down from my third floor room to the lowest floor of the hospital , where a non-surgical team in the interventional radiation department punctured and drained with needles the ascites , which is fluid in the abdominal cavity .
The doctors believe that my difficulties in swallowing and keeping down food and liquids have not been caused solely by the esophagitus , which is a delayed side effect of the radiation treatment to the brain and the neck , but has been caused by the following chain of cause and effect :
What you ’ve read so far is what I originally posted just before midnight Friday .
But here ’s one exception to the abstract generality of this post .
Friday afternoon I was brought down from my third floor room to the lowest floor of the hospital , where a non-surgical team in the interventional radiation department punctured and drained with needles the ascites , which is fluid in the abdominal cavity .
The doctors believe that my difficulties in swallowing and keeping down food and liquids have not been caused solely by the esophagitus , which is a delayed side effect of the radiation treatment to the brain and the neck , but has been caused by the following chain of cause and effect : Metastatic growths in the abdominal cavity , which , by the way , have probably caused the recent return of the distension or stretching of the abdomen , has put external pressure on the gastrointestinal organs including the small intestine and the stomach , which in turn has caused upward pressure on the acidic digestive fluids and forced those fluids upward .
Thus it is the famous condition of acid reflux , and not the fairly obscure condition of esophagitus , brought on by radiation treatment , that has caused the recent pain and dysfunction in the esophagus , or it ’s a combination of both .
So , in order to reduce the dysfunction in the esophagus , as well as for other reasons , my doctors ordered the draining of the ascites in the abdomen , a procedure called paracitesus .
The team was chatting amiably with me as they were preparing me for the procedure .
In fact what I thought was their preparation , which involved some cold and painful contact with my midsection , was actually the draining process itself .
I realized this myself when one of the team dramatically brought out four huge bottles each filled with clearish brown or amber fluid , and the team told me that the fluid was the ascites that had just been drained from my abdominal cavity while I was having an animated conversation with them .
The sight of that mind - blowing amount of amber fluid which had all just been brought out of my abdomen ( I had been told long ago by my doctors that there was very little free space in the abdominal cavity ) astonished me as much as any astonishing sight I had ever seen .
Also , in addition to the four full bottles , there was a half - full bottle .
The total was 4.5 liters , which surprised and impressed even the medicos .
( However , in the cheerfulness of my awe , I initially missed the bad signs which I only picked up on Saturday : if the ascites was so huge , that probably meant that the tumors that had generated all that fluid where also very big .
In conclusion , folks , this was a one - hour or two - hour episode from the last two days .
Do you still wonder why I said at the outset of this post that the full story of the last two days , let alone of the last five days , was beyond my desire or capacity to tell it fully and clearly ?
The original version of this post , telling the story without any specifics , was a little over 271 words in length .
The tale of the draining of the abdominal fluid which I then added to the post was more than 530 words long .
The total time it took to write and post and correct the entire thing was around four hours .
Blogging takes me a very long time now because my personal functioning is still slow , and , much worse , because my laptop gives me sometime insane , HAL - like , seemingly malicious problems ( movingthe insertion point without notice to a different part of the entry ’s editing window , failing to save a saved change , saving some changes in a save , and not saving other changes , moving without notice a block of text from one part of the entry to another part .
This blog entry is now — as I am executing what I think and hope will be the final save in the entry — is [ I had given a number of words which is now gone ] and the time is now 4:00 a.m .
Yes I know I , must immediately get a new laptop .
But this laptop is not always as insanely bad as I have describe .
The unbearable badness has only occurred recently and intermittantly , and it happens only in blogging , not in Word where I do most of my present work , and in Outllook Express . br >

I ’ve contradicted myself on the question of prayer
It ’s funny , but I just realized that when I recently said that I do not relate to praying to God for material benefits for myself , I was contradicting what I was saying — and doing — just a few months ago .
Sometime in the late fall , I had decided on certain prayers I needed to make , and I was making them .
The first was that I straighten myself out with God before I die .
The second was that I be able to complete my must - do projects , mainly writing projects , but also personal projects , before I die .
( I think there was a third prayer , but I do n’t remember what it was ; maybe there were only two prayers . )
I feel I have , through God ’s grace , made amazing progress on the spiritual goal that I was praying for .
In amazed gratitude I ’ve written several times about my sense of greater closeness to Jesus .
In any case I was wrong in saying I did not like to pray for material benefits for myself .

Calling Joel LeFevre , again
As I noted , Joel LeFevre wrote to me last week in response to my request for someone to give me his contact information .
He told me that he had n’t written back to me when a couple of years ago I wrote to him repeatedly on an urgent matter ( the “ Unofficial Lawrence Auster webpage , ” which Mr. LeFevre had created and maintained , had disappeared from the Web ) because his server had a problem for a while .
Well , I assumed based on his answer that the problem was fixed now .
But today I wrote to him on another important matter , and once again the e-mail bounced back with the message that “ The following addresses have delivery problems . ”
To paraphrase the bard of our time , how many times can a man ’s server stop people from communicating with him ?
UPDATE : Joel LeFevre has responded , giving me his alternative e-mail addresses .

The extreme weakness may be a side effect of the radiation treatment , as told in my most recent response to a reader in “ Letters from Readers . ”
A further account of recent developments in my case Alan Levine writes : I have not written to you , perhaps wrongly feeling that you were being smothered by expressions of sympathy .

A basic rule of e-mail etiquette Someone sent me a group e-mail today , and I sent her this reply .
I have sent many e-mails similar to this one over the years , but this time I decided to post it :
If you are sending an email to multiple recipients , you should not put their names and e-mail addresses in the cc line .
That way everyone on the list is included by force in a group he does n’t know ( including you — I do n’t know you ) ; and , worse , if people reply to the e-mail , everyone on the list starts getting e-mails from people he does n’t know , which is very annoying .
The addresses of the recipients should go in the bcc line , not the cc line .
This is basic email etiquette .
Thank you .

My computer problems Posting entries , adding comments to entries , and revising entries has become incredibly difficult .
It takes at least twice the time it ought to , because my three - and - a - half - year - old Lenovo laptop with Windows XP keeps doing unwanted and bizarre things .
If I were to catalogue those things in detail , you would be astounded .
I think the laptop is slowly breaking down and going maliciously berserk , like the computer HAL in 2001 : A Space Odyssey .
At the same time I am extremely reluctant to move my work to my new Asus laptop with Windows 7 or get some other computer , because the time and effort needed to learn and get adjusted to the peculiarities of a new computer would be greater than that involved in continuing to work with my present laptop , as bothersome as that is .

Travelers in Russia have always had a lot to thank Czech beer companies for , since the makers of some of the world ’s best beers have long been able to send their foamy wares to the Russian market , giving beer lovers a better alternative to the country ’s less - than - stellar national brews .
Exports to Russia have always been a large revenue source for the companies that brew the likes of Staropramen and Pilsner Urquell .
But the Russian market could soon dry up for Czech beers .
Russia political analysts say the country should consider banning all Czech beers .
The reason ?
Objections over Czech plans to host a United States radar station , which would be part of a missile defense shield in eastern Europe that Russia thinks is aimed at it , despite U.S. assurances to the contrary .
Russia is considering other , seemingly stronger moves .
Days after U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice was in Prague to ink the radar deal a few weeks ago , the Czech Republic experienced a mysterious decrease in natural gas supplies from Russian pipelines .
Analysts say Russia should also consider re-opening a radar station in Cuba .
But do n’t underestimate what effect a Czech beer ban could have .
It would be a “ serious response ” to the U.S. / Czech radar base , an analyst tells the Russian newspaper Ria Novosti .
No word yet on whether Czechs would consider responding with a ban on Russian vodka .

Another ' ex - gay ' , another easily verifiable misrepresentation
by Jeremy Hooper
We really wish the " ex- gay " community would stop twisting the words of certain scientists .
But just as our hopes for world peace or a consistently funny " Saturday Night Live " premiere never seem to pan out ( seriously -- that first quiz show sketch was the best you could come up with over summer break ? ! ) , those who define themselves by what they " were " rather than what they currently " are " seem to have few to no qualms about taking a researcher 's words and work out of context in order to embolden their claims .
Consider this latest example .
Speaking to One News Now about Ray Boltz , a Christian singer who has revealed that he 's gay , " former homosexual " Greg Quinlan says the following :
" I ’m absolutely shocked .
I 've got some of his CDs and cassette tapes –- tells you how long it 's been around .
When he says he 's born that way , we know now for a fact that that 's false .
In fact , just last year in March , the director of the Human Genome Project , Dr. Francis Collins , said this : homosexuality is not hardwired .
There is no gay gene .
We mapped the human genome .
We now know there is no genetic cause for homosexuality . "
Hmm , it sounds like this Dr. Collins is totally against us , right ?
Sounds like some lock - solid proof our our " changeability " has been discovered , yes ?
Well not so fast !
Here is what Francis Collins himself told Ex - Gay Watch back in May of '07 after it was discovered that NARTH ( National Association for Research & Therapy of Homosexuality ) was twisting his work to more readily fit their cause :
It troubles me greatly to learn that anything I have written would cause anguish for you or others who are seeking answers to the basis of homosexuality .
The words quoted by NARTH all come from the Appendix to my book “ The Language of God ” ( pp. 260-263 ) , but have been juxtaposed in a way that suggests a somewhat different conclusion that I intended .
I would urge anyone who is concerned about the meaning to refer back to the original text .
The evidence we have at present strongly supports the proposition that there are hereditary factors in male homosexuality — the observation that an identical twin of a male homosexual has approximately a 20 % likelihood of also being gay points to this conclusion , since that is 10 times the population incidence .
But the fact that the answer is not 100 % also suggests that other factors besides DNA must be involved .
That certainly does n’t imply , however , that those other undefined factors are inherently alterable .
Your note indicated that your real interest is in the truth .
And this is about all that we really know .
No one has yet identified an actual gene that contributes to the hereditary component ( the reports about a gene on the X chromosome from the 1990s have not held up ) , but it is likely that such genes will be found in the next few years .
And it should be noted that Dr. Collins is an evangelical Christian man who does , in fact , work from a place of both science and religious belief .
He does write books that unapologetically marry his faith with his work .
But this God-genetics marriage , which very well could color his views to some degree , still does n't lead him to a place of " ex - gay " support !
In fact , he seems eager to disconnect himself from the oversimplified movement !
But hey , why should Mr. Quinlan care about representing Dr. Collins accurately ?
After all , it 's only the core of millions of human existences that he 's trivializing .
* The One News Now piece : Boltz shocks Christian community with homosexuality admission [ ONN ]
* The Ex - Gay Watch piece : Major Geneticist Francis Collins Responds to NARTH Article [ XGW ]
*** See Mr. Quinlan expound on his lies in this ONN video : BLOG : Reaction to Ray Boltz Gay Lifestyle Choice [ ONN ]
Your thoughts
Ex -gay ministries and other far - right anti-gay groups are willing to adopt and twist whatever science they can appropriate if it appears to support their conclusions , in spite of their usual hostility towards rational thought and procedure .
Unfortunately , if this " gay gene " is definitively identified , then they 're likely to just change their argument rather than finally shut up .
And , of course , that argument will be the need to " isolate " said gene from the breeding pool .
In the meantime , we need to make sure that we legally establish every person 's right to same - sex lovin ' , regardless of the cause .

Posted by : Katie | Sep 15 , 2008 12:25:41 PM
Hopefully BTB and EGW see this and get the word out as well .
All these fabrications and twisted research lead me to two conclusions .
( 1 ) Certain Christians are obsessed with homosexuality as some sort of last sin campaign .
They are willing to lie , cheat , and steal to stop us .
They 've taken a very extreme , machiavellian ( ends justify the means ) , disturbing , and decidedly un-christ - like stance .
( 2 ) We 're on the right side of history , morality , and justice .
If it 's more important that homosexuality be stopped by any means necessary ( even breaking every rule in the bible ) , then you know that these people are on the wrong path .
Antipathy toward gays outshines worthier pursuits ( helping the homeless and hungry , reducing the divorce rate , safety and security of all persons ) and thus shows it for what it is : fervently held BIGOTRY - based beliefs .
If there was something truly wrong with being gay , then they would not need to resort to lies , minsinformation , and twisting of legit research .
They know they wo n't succeed on vague bible - verses alone , so they 've fabricated " secular " reasoning .
Only problem is , they 're so foreign to the nature of science , with only the basic of understanding that it 's quite easy and quite obvious to point out their lies and distortions .
The challenge is that when people want to hear sweet sweet lies that reinforce their bigotry , it is very hard to get them to hear the truth .
It also does n't help that the religious right , and conservative politics have been denigrating and unfairly attacking the credability of the media , science , and academia for several decades now .
It 's at a point now where people can be told the truth , but since it comes from the news and not the pastor : they do n't believe it .

The most definitive study to date was published June 30 , 2008 .
THE TWIN STUDY from Sweden .
Pertinent findings , which are VERY VERY statistically strong due to simplicity of test ... and ALL twins in Sweden between the ages of 20 and 47 participated .
www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2008/06/080628205430.htm
ScienceDaily ( June 30 , 2008 ) — Homosexual behaviour is largely SHAPED BY GENETICS and random environmental factors , according to findings from the world 's largest study of twins .
Writing in the scientific journal Archives of Sexual Behavior , researchers from Queen Mary 's School of Biological and Chemical Sciences , and Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm report that genetics and environmental factors ( which are specific to an individual , and may include biological processes such as different hormone exposure in the womb ) , are important determinants of homosexual behaviour .
Dr Qazi Rahman , study co-author and a leading scientist on human sexual orientation , explains : " This study puts cold water on any concerns that we are looking for a single ' gay gene ' or a single environmental variable which could be used to ' select out ' homosexuality - the factors which influence sexual orientation are complex .
And we are not simply talking about homosexuality here - heterosexual behaviour is also influenced by a mixture of genetic and environmental factors .
Rahman explains : " Overall , genetics accounted for around 35 per cent of the differences between men in homosexual behaviour and other individual - specific environmental factors ( that is , NOT SOCIETAL ATTITUDES , FAMILY , OR PARENTING ) which are shared by twins ) accounted for around 64 per cent .
In other words , men become gay or straight because of different developmental pathways , not just one pathway . "

Actually a very good last point you make there , Jason .
We 're seeing the same thing in this election , I am afraid .
Most of our sources of objective information have been debased , both by liars who do n't want to hear the truth and , unfortunately , by those sources themselves ... witness the rampant tabloidism of the news .
I used to get riled up at the thought of all this willful ignorance , but now we 're seeing these debauched people in the anti-gay industry disseminating bald - faced lies .
They 've gotten away with it for generations but truth wins out , so they say .

Greg Quinlan has been reported to screech about homosex so loudly at " ex - gay " events , that he made himself hoarse .
And then they have the nerve to say " I 've left the gay lifestyle " , when strictly obsessing over homosex is their bread and butter .
When you take the " men boinking men " conversation away from them , they 're reduced to sub - human , because they know nothing else .

I held off and held off but finally installed the new version of iTunes ( v7.7.1 ) - the invasiveness of this application ( for those readers living in the southern US , I liken it to kudzu ) is starting to make me think twice about another iPod …and I love my iPod ... our family loves their iPods ( we have four in a family of six ) , but I ’m growing weary of iTunes .
It started a version or two ago , but reared its head this update .
I run WinPatrol to alert me to any new services or auto -runs in Windows .
It took me nearly 20 minutes ( and a reboot ) to rid myself of unwanted Apple stuff ... here are the reasons I 'm ignoring the next Apple iTunes update :
the iTunes and QuickTime installer is nearly 80 mb - for something to sync my podcasts / music ?
Please .
Why do I need to do a full re-install ?
Why exactly do I need QuickTime ?
Apple , here 's a spot you should follow Microsoft – just send patches , not full re-installs .
I 'd be more accepting of updates .
MobileMe - do n’t use it , do n’t want it , do n’t have an iPhone so this is completely useless .
I said no to the installation of this service .
Trust me , I want all the uninterrupted startup power I can get so this got tossed out as quick as it took to alert me this was trying to be installed .
Got the pleasure of having to remove this through Add / Remove programs which took over 5 minutes to completely un-install .
__Bonjour __- this one is tricky .
The service description reads : “ Enables hardware devices and software services to automatically configure themselves on the network and advertise their presence , so that users can discover and use those services without any unnecessary manual setup or administration . ”
Thanks Apple for not letting it be obvious this is your service .
I disabled the service AND had to uninstall from Add / Remove Programs …. but now of course , I get a nag - screen when I start up iTunes …. saying that it can't find Bonjour and that I need to re-install iTunes .
( Trust me , I 've been running iTunes just fine without Bonjour ) Safari - this one really , REALLY set me off .
Why ?
Because during the install I explicitly * UN * selected the box next to Safari .
But there it is , happily sitting with an entry in Add / Remove programs and a desktop icon .
Apple , Firefox remains my browser of choice even if you force your browser on me .
Outlook Add-in – Wha ???
Yes , there is an Outlook add - in for iTunes that installs by default and is activated by default ( so that , I guess ,
I can sync my contacts with the iPhone I do n't have ) .
The best part is that it prevents OUTLOOK .EXE from properly shutting down .
Outlook works perfectly now that the add - in has been disabled .
Even with these 5 gripes , I 'm still a fan if my iPod .
Right now , however ; I 'm not willing to upgrade iTunes in the near future ; the same goes for my wife 's computer and my kids ' computer .
Apple , please change your iTunes update strategy .
Maybe you ca n’t survive without your Thursday evening yoga class .
It calms you down , it gets your heart rate going , it stretches out tight muscles , and it makes you feel like you just gained about 3 inches in height and in self - esteem .
So if yoga does this for you , think about what it might do for your child who has to deal with his or her own set of stresses ?
In typical yoga for kids classes , the same postures that you breathe and sweat through , are taught to your little ones , but in a more creative , playful and fun manner .
Here are three reasons why having your child learn how to down - dog is so important to their health and yours .
Enhanced flexibility : Keeping kids flexible is so important , especially since their day - to - day lives seem to become more stressful and sedentary as they clock hours at school and in front of the computer .
Stiff muscles can lead to injuries later on , particularly in the lower back since hips and hamstrings tug on the lower back to compensate for their immobility .
Kids tend to be a lot more limber and daring than most of adults .
So balancing on one foot and being able to twist their bodies into some pretzel - like positions comes much easier to them than to us .
But we used to be that limber !
Years of walking , sitting on chairs , engaging in Western exercise like running and cycling or years of not exercising at all , has stiffened us up .
Take a quick jaunt back down on memory lane and remember how you could swing from limb to limb on a tree , legs and arms outstretched .
Or remember how you could sit in a cross - legged position for hours as you colored for hour in your coloring book ?
For adults , even though that kind of flexibility may no longer seem like it ’s available to you , it is .
But just as it took your hips and hamstrings decades to get to the stiff - place they are in now , it will similarly take you some time to soften those taut muscles and joints and get them moving again like when you were a kid .
Greater focus and attention : I ’ve often wondered what would happen if we took a group of rambunctious kids and had them go through a 20 - minute yoga class filled with closed - eye breathing and gentle postures .
Could continuous and thorough yoga classes be a replacement or a therapeutic compliment to many of the pharmaceuticals being dispensed to children all in an effort to quiet them down ?
I do n’t know but a test experiment might me worth trying .
It ca n’t hurt .
Fosters self - esteem and body awareness in a non-competitive way :
By drawing awareness on how their young bodies feel and the power and strength in their muscles , kids yoga improves self - esteem and helps children connect how what they do to their body affects how they feel .
This same kind of awareness can spill over from the yoga mat into the kitchen : Kids can learn to make better food choices by realizing how what they put into their mouths affects how they feel .
With childhood obesity and diabetes rates at record levels , having children become aware of what they are eating , why they are eating and how much they are eating is indispensable knowledge that can keep them feeling and staying healthy for years to come .
Creates a connection to Mother Nature : Today , so many children are so removed from nature and its surroundings .
Whether they live in an urban area or whether their activity schedule leaves them little time to play outdoors , many of the children today do n’t feel a connection to nature .
When yoga postures were devised thousands of years ago , the Indian sages developed postures by mimicking the animals and plants that they lived in tandem with .
Postures like tree pose , lion ’s pose , cobra pose and turtle pose all get their names and appearance from the creatures in nature .
This provides a powerful connection to nature for children who do n’t enjoy such access to the natural world .
If you ’re curious about yoga for kids classes , inquire with your local yoga centers and look for a teacher who either has a certification from a yoga for kids training program like YogaKids .
There are also tons of DVDs for kids yoga .
To make it more fun , do the DVD with them or invite some of your childrens ’ friends over for a yoga party .
Have fun !

My Favorite Graphs ... and the future
This blog has always been about optimism , creating better user experiences , helping users spend more time in flow , and learning .
There are 405 posts here .
More importantly , there are nearly 10,000 comments from y'all that add so much more to the topics , and from which myself and others have learned a great deal .
I do n't want the last thing people remember about this blog to be The Bad Things .
So , I 've moved my original " threats " post -- something many people find very difficult to look at -- to a different web page -- rather than keeping it as a post here .
If you want to read the original content of the post ( it lost some formatting ) , it 's here .
But I want the thing people see when they come here now to reflect what this blog has always been about , so I 'm including a few of my favorite pictures from the last two years here .
As for the future of this blog , I know I cannot just return to business as usual -- whatever absurd reasons have led to this much hatred for me ( and for what I write here ) will continue , so there is no reason to think the same things would n't happen again ... and probably soon .
That includes anything that raises ( or maintains ) my visibility , so I will not be doing speaking engagements -- especially at public events .
( And of course it 's not just me , it 's anyone with a lot of visibility .
Think : Scoble .
He can take it , I can 't . )
I made no money from this blog -- it was always a labor of love .
Contrary to what the critics have been saying , I was never on the " paid " speaking circuit , never used it to gain " lucrative consulting contracts " ( or even a single contract ) .
I do n't have Amazon affiliate links ... this blog was because I love helping and teaching and learning from readers .
That leaves me with ... what to do next ?
I have a few ideas , but I 'm now asking for any suggestions OTHER than simply returning to this blog and doing what I was doing before .
These are just some wild possibilities that many of you have come up with and sent me emails about .
Some are more reasonable or appealing to me than others .
I 'd love to hear more ideas , plus thoughts on the ones listed below .
1 ) Get a real job doing this , so that I can continue with the same kind of work , but without raising my own visibility .
In other words , it would be for a company and the focus would be off of me .
2 ) " Ghost write " for someone or something else .
I got myself into the Technorati Top 50 , I could help someone else ( if it 's for the right reasons ) raise their readership .
3 ) Create a fake persona and write as that fake person .
Unfortunately , almost everything I do has a look and style , and I do n't think the quality of my writing is suddenly going to improve , so it would be pretty obvious that it was me .
Still ... a rape fantasy about a fake person who lives thousands of miles from where I do would not effect me as deeply or as personally as when the dream / imagery is about the real me I do n't like this idea as much because anonymity -- NOT Owning Your Own Words -- is one of the biggest contributors to the problems that have driven me and thousands of others off their blogs or other online communities .
4 ) Turn THIS blog into a real group blog ... with a LOT of authors , and I would take more of an editorial role .
That way , I represent only a small percentage and the hatred / anger / threats would be more distributed .
Kind of a share - the - attacks approach ; )
More like 37 Signals , less like Scoble , where all personal attacks are directed at him instead of The Blog .
5 ) Right now , I could n't pay anyone else so the blog would have to be sponsored to pay other authors .
I would agree to sponsorship only if it was by someone / something I already love ( Apple ? Adobe ?
Google ?
Anyone interested ? )
( And of course I 'd also need authors , so if it looks like a group blog is the way to go , there will be a call for participants )
6 ) Make the blog private -- where only registered members can see it .
That way , it would be much more difficult ( and probably less fun ) for others to attack it and / or me .
It would simply be a private community .
My visibility would drop dramatically , yet I 'd still be able to write about the same topics .
This idea is one of my favorites -- but at the same time it is much less user - friendly ( you 'd have to log - in , no public RSS feed , etc. ) and that would be a really bad idea .
7 ) Do something else on the blog -- podcasts , video , e-books -- something other than the posts .
This might not make any difference , though .
But perhaps without the words and pictures ... it could just make it worse since it would still be my voice ( podcast ) or worse , my FACE ( video ) , although I 've considered cutting videos that would n't have to show me at all .
8 ) ? ? ?
Please help .
This will be the last post here quite some time , until I figure out what to do next .
Please enjoy the pictures ... most of them have been inspired by y'all .
( I will leave comments open , of course , but moderate with abandon .
There will be nothing nasty or personal in this thread .
Like I said , I want the last thing people see on this blog to reflect the spirit of this blog and its readers . ]

1 . If I had money and ran a company , I 'd hire you to come in and give me suggestions .
Alas .
2 . In doing this blog and thinking about this stuff , have you ever had any ideas for what kinds of tools ( software , that is ) that people could use to do things like share creative ideas in groups , create customer community , etc. etc . ?
2.5 . What about a tool that makes it easy to quickly set up cool visual communication graphics like you often do ?
3 . Write another book ?
4. Create an email newsletter ?

Way to go , Kathy !
Good to see you back , glad the bullies did n't win ( because they usually want to silence people ) .
You wrote the following idea : " Turn THIS blog into a real group blog ... with a LOT of authors , and I would take more of an editorial role . "
Actually , I 'm doing exactly that with Contentious right now , which I 'm relaunching this weekend .
We should talk about that .
Maybe we could help each other .

Use your passion and geek expertise to liberate the latent creativity that resides in readers , something that works better than the linear , sequential and fast fading stream of comments ( yeah , this is recursive ) .
Comments are writing , but lets have something not as we know it .
Writing in this box just feel a little klunky , there must be a better way , make a better blog :)
Something that talks not just to the brain ( I luv that , tks ! ) , but connects with the deeper feelings ( gut- feelings and heart - felt courage ) .
PS . we LOVE to hear from you too !

Is there a way use some sort of third party forum moderation to cut through this problem ?
Then you could go on in whatever way you are comfortable , your forums could coninue to buzz and anyone that 's up to no good would hit a brick wall ( or get a call from their local authorities , as appropriate ) .
It 's just a thought .
Posted by : Tim Costello | Apr 6 , 2007 1:36:49 PM
I hate to see us lose your input but I wonder if simply publishing articles with no comments enabled and having a members - only forum would n't be a good compromise .
There 's something about the immediacy of the response form and the lack of accountability available from anonymity ( oh , hypocritical me ) that seems to encourage people 's awfulness .
That aside , I think that a multiple - contributor blog would give you support and provide some other perspectives .
You could combine this with your ideas on coaching / ghostwriting and work with ' intern ' contributors to hone their skills , see their work supplying your site , and give them the tools they need to take your philosophies and understanding out on their own tangents .
It might give you a regular supply of fresh , new writers and keep things going while allowing you to step back a little .
( If you did go with the intern idea , drop me a line , will you ? *g*)
Whatever you do , I wish you luck and peace .
I 'm so sorry this has all been so hard on you .
Posted by : Ande | Apr 6 , 2007 1:44:21 PM
Honestly said , I do n't think you can do anything to fend off the attacks .
I do n't think you got attacked because of something you did , but because lots of people admire you and your work .
That 's apparently enough for some people to hate you .
Only by unpassionating your readers , can you hope to actually stop the haters .
I hope you will reject that option .
I do think that by working in a team , it will make it easier for you .
The passion moves away from you and to the team of writers , the hate will move with it .
Being a part of a groupblog would be a good solution .
One condition would be that the groupblog would adopt your style .
Similar to how the headfirst books have the same style but different writers .
If you join the 37signals blog where you put up highly visual articles , in a see of more textual posts , you will still stand out .
Posted by : Jan | Apr 6 , 2007 1:48:32 PM
I hate the fact that they have stopped you from blogging as you have been ...
This has been one of the few blogs where I read every post .
Ok .. with that said ...
1 ) Make this a private blog ... kinda .
What I mean is that you could insist on registration for comments and disallow email addresses from Yahoo , Hotmail , etc that can't be tied to a person .
If that does n't provide enough comfort to you I 'd vote for one of the next 2 .
2 ) Make this a private blog ...
I 'd signup in a heartbeat .
Of your options above , this is my fave ( aside from simply seeing you continue to blog of course )
3 ) same content , in an email newsletter .
I do n't like this as much since a ) it 's email and b ) I think it will be more work for you to make the email look like your posts do , and the visual aspect is important , at least to me .

I suggest having a wiki / blog .
That can be community enforced and can be controled from a single pc .
I suggest you buy a crappy pc that costs £ 150 because it sucks , and install a programme called moin moin on it .
That allows you to run a wiki from a pc .
Then just get a DNS address for your IP address ( at first it will be an ip address ) .
Voila , total community policing .
Oh and to those bullies who abused you , i am a staunch believer in karma , therfore , well ... you get the picture .
Keep up the good work , Love the blog .

Could also do your ( wonderful ) thing around the blogosphere for a while ( just not always here ) .
Keep the juices flowing , continue to help people , foster even greater community growth , and not be an ( ugh ) static single target .
I think greater interaction among groups would result ( mix up the tech bloggers and the marketers and the VCs and the usability people and , hell , even the sex bloggers ) ;) and really spark some awesome conversations .
It would also make it a lot harder for bullying to take place , since anyone stupid enough to try it would be taking on a potentially even bigger community , as well as whoever happened to be hosting you .
( Anyone who did host would have your back 100 % and be able to manage comment moderation and such so you 'd never even have to see the garbage . )
It 'd be kinda like the group blog idea , but with more of a " Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego ? " vibe .
And who did n't love playing that ? :)
Oodles of bloggers great and small would give a # 1 Technorati rank ( or insert personal thing of inestimable value here ) to be able to host Kathy Sierra as a guest blogger .
( Myself included . )
In any case , whichever path you choose , you have our full collective support .
Posted by : Melle | Apr 6 , 2007 1:55:05 PM
Nice to see you back , Kathy .
It makes sense about not continuing with " business as usual " — I could n't do it , either .
But I can't see ghost writing as being satisfiying for someone with as strong a voice as yours .
Being an evangelist for the likes of Apple or Adobe might be cool , but would that let you continue with the stream of consciousness riffs that have obviously been satifsying for you — and been so energizing for us , your readers ?
Do n't know .
Maybe the private blog is the way to go , though I suspect you 'd need some time to get revved up for that .
The pod / video angle sounds great , but that raises a lot of other questions .
And it loses the immediacy that you enjoyed so long , which is one of the most unfortunate losses in all this .
Meanwhile , did you ever finish that video project , or did all this erupt while you were mid-stream ?
Regards ,
J .

I like the idea of a private blog if getting the RSS and reading posts was as simple as public .
If there are too many hoops just to get notice of and read a single post it will get frustrating .
I also really enjoy the idea of a group blog mostly because I 've always been a fan of group blogs a la 37 signals .
It 's a different take on things that I tend to enjoy , getting to see different opinions , group dynamics , etc .
Having said all of that , I wonder if Ande 's idea is n't the best ( regardless of what format you choose to go with for the blog ) .
If it was still public with no comments , but you cross-posted entries in a private forum , you could allow people to respond and discuss in a controlled / private environment , but still keep the blog itself public .
I 'm not sure how much extra work that would be for you , but if it was negligible I would say that 's the best option for running your site the way you have and seem to love , but keeping the riffraff at bay .
Posted by : Rachel | Apr 6 , 2007 2:04:06 PM
Kathy ,
It sucks that you 're really not going to be continuing this blog , but I understand that you 've gotta do what you 've gotta do .
I personally would never , ever stop anything I do out of fear from threats or comments , but that 's just me and I respect your decision and wish you the best of luck in whatever comes next for you .
Anyway , enough of the past ... here are my suggestions for the future .
Your blog has been a favorite of mine since the first day I came across it .
I think two ways you could continue to offer such great articles would be to either publish an email newsletter or publish your blog with comments turned off .
I know that comments can still be made about you elsewhere , but you just have to avoid the negative places like that .
No matter what you choose to do from this point on , I 'm thankful for what you 've given me and the rest of your readers on this blog .
You rock !!
Best of luck !!

Kathy ,
I suggest you go back to the CPU book project while you think about next steps .
And when that 's done I 'd be happy to put up with the hassle of a private blog .
Mike
Posted by : Mike | Apr 6 , 2007 2:09:47 PM
Kathy , the content you have graciously shared with us every once in a while is both inspiring and entertaining .
And a blog is the perfect medium for this .
A lot of the content is about your style and creative personality .
Thus , I would rule out the community - based ideas .
I would probably only read your stuff anyway .
I see two basic options for you : Reduce visibility and do something completely different , or stay visible and continue publishing your own stuff under your own name .
All the options you cite can be assigned to one of these two categories .
I dearly hope you go with the second option , even though I would totally understand if you decide otherwise .
Posted by : Armin | Apr 6 , 2007 2:10:04 PM
Something about this reminds me of a great post I once read called " Be brave or go home " ...
" Creating passionate users is NOT about finding ways to make everyone like you .
It 's about finding ways to use your own passion to inspire passion in others , and anything with that much power is bound to piss off plenty of status - quo / who - moved - my - cheese people .
Bring it on . "
I would hate to see this blog disappear because of the people who stoop to the level of personal attacks .
However , I think if something has to change , then I would prefer that you make this blog private .
As Rick Gregory said , I would also sign up in a heartbeat .
You have a lot of passionate users ( readers ) here and I hope that somehow we can all help you beat the bad guys .
Posted by : Natasha | Apr 6 , 2007 2:10:39 PM
Kathy , thanks for keeping all of us updated .
I do n't have any additional suggestions -- though I think several of those you listed sound like wonderful options .
Please keep us posted on your decision ; I would like to continue learning from your wise and excellent insight .
( By the way , I 'm a big , 6 ' 5 " , 300 - pound stock of bulk and intimidation , and would gladly stand by your side to ward off the nasties of the opportunity arose .
Just FYI . )

In the private blog idea , it is possible to have private RSS feeds .
A popular idea is to have the authentication in the URL .
Instead of one single RSS URL used by everyone , each member has their own RSS URL , that contains a unique alphanumeric string used for authentication .
For example , instead of the RSS being / atom.xml , it would be /atom.xml?reallylonguniquestringthatisimpossibletoguess , and the server would return the feed only if the string matches a member .
37 signals and others do this .
So , it is not such a bad idea .
It just may require some custom code ( but some blog platforms may already have private feeds ) .

I view several blogs a day , but the first ones I always read were Seth Godin's , David Armano's , Techcrunch and yours .
I would look at a blog without comments .
I understand people want to interact , but it 's worked for Seth and it should for you too .
If you go private , I 'm willing to even pay a small subscription fee for it .
Thanks for the inspiration .
I 'm sorry for the turmoil this ordeal has caused to you and your family .

I needed a little refresher at " You are a marketer .
Deal with it . " and read the news , your statement , and a bunch of related articles / posts .
I was deeply disturbed , but I also realized that you know who you are and you will rediscover your flow .
Whatever those choices are , we will understand , support , and love you for it .

Hello Kathy ;
I think that you 'd probably do well in a consulting role where you are helping companies who want to improve in the area of creating passionate users ( products and websites ) .
Your knowledge of the field is shown well by your blogging , and maybe getting out in front of people will give you more of a reason to stay passionate about this subject area ( if not the blog itself ) .
I do hesitate to run with the other commenters that say you should monetize this , but you should make it at least a part - time passion where you are getting to stretch out on the things you write about , and then allow experiences to craft other posts .
Thanks for what you have given thus far .
I 'll be continuing to keep you in my prayers .
Posted by : Antoine of MMM | Apr 6 , 2007 2:27:33 PM
A book would be great that explains all this " learning theory stuff " and how to make it work in real life -- in a non-scientific Passionate User kind of fun way .
I 'd buy that in a second .
Anything that keeps you blogging on this topic would be great of course , whether that means joining another blog like 37signals or going semi-private .
Anonymous wo n't work , because if it 's your writing people will know .
It would be sad to see you and with that your knowledge disappear .
I hope that in time you 'll be back better than ever .
Thanks for all your fantastic work so far .

I say take a small break , come back and see if things have improved at all .
I 'll leave your feed in my reader where it will wait patiently for an update .

Thanks for coming back to update us all on this .
I 've been following your blog for some time now through RSS and have found your posts insightful - and the graphics interesting and fun .
Your death threat incident and everything that has happened following has both my wife and I closely watching and waiting for your reactions .
My wife has been blogging for some time now as well and has started receiving extremely negative troll - type comments and has decided to moderate with a heavier hand .
She does this reluctantly as she is afraid it will quash some desire to comment openly .
Whichever road you choose to go down next , I hope we can continue to read what you have to say .
Thanks again Kathy !

BC 's illegal marijuana trade industry has evolved into a business giant , dubbed by some involved as ' The Union ' .
Commanding upwards of $ 7 billion Canadian annually , The Union ?s roots stretch far and wide .
With up to 85 % of ' BC Bud ' being exported to the United States , the trade has become an international issue .
Who are the players , and when do their motives become questionable ?

Through growers , police officers , criminologists , economists , doctors , politicians and pop culture icons , Scorgie examines the cause and effect nature of the business behind getting high .
Nobody 's innocent in this exploration of an industry that may be profiting more by being illegal
This is a long and detailed report , with many graphs and data supportive of a ) the tightness in global supply and demand for oil and b) the lack of correlation between speculative positioning and price increase .
It is worth a complete read for those interested in this issue ( which has seemed front and center in many CNBC debates on oil speculation ) .
Below are some excerpts of the main findings of the report ( italics / bold added ) .
From the Executive Summary :
The Task Force ’s preliminary assessment is that current oil prices and the increase in oil prices between January 2003 and June 2008 are largely due to fundamental supply and demand factors .
During this same period , activity on the crude oil futures market – as measured by the number of contracts outstanding , trading activity , and the number of traders – has increased significantly .
While these increases broadly coincided with the run-up in crude oil prices , the Task Force ’s preliminary analysis to date does not support the proposition that speculative activity has systematically driven changes in oil prices .
Figure 2 - Oil Intensity and Use by Country Click to Enlarge
The world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades , and that strong growth has translated into substantial increases in the demand for oil , particularly from emerging market countries .
On the supply side , the production of oil has responded sluggishly , compounded by production shortfalls associated with geopolitical unrest in countries with large oil reserves .
As it is very difficult to rely on substitutes for oil in the short term , very large price increases have occurred as the market balances supply and demand .
If a group of market participants has systematically driven prices , detailed daily position data should show that that group ’s position changes preceded price changes .
The Task Force ’s preliminary analysis , based on the evidence available to date , suggests that changes in futures market participation by speculators have not systematically preceded price changes .
On the contrary , most speculative traders typically alter their positions following price changes , suggesting that they are responding to new information – just as one would expect in an efficiently operating market .
This conclusion was discussed here in a post on Peak Oil and Reflexivity following George Soros and Michael Masters testimonies before Congress .
In effect , at the end of trending cycles the tail eventually wags the dog .
This can be seen in real time in energy stocks ( down already 30 % from their highs in the last month with oil still ' only ' at $ 126 ) .
More from the CFTC report :
On the demand side , world economic activity has expanded at close to 5 percent per year since 2004 , marking the strongest performance in two decades .
Between 2004 and 2007 , global oil consumption grew by 3.9 percent , driven largely by rising demand in emerging markets that are both growing rapidly and shifting toward oil - intensive activities .
Moreover , some of the fastest growing nations also rely on price subsidies that hold down the prices of oil and refined products such as gasoline , which further boosts oil consumption .

While global demand has proven strong , oil production growth has not kept pace .
In the past three years , non-OPEC production growth has slowed to levels well below historical averages , and world surplus capacity has fallen below historical norms .
Preliminary inventory data also shows that Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) stocks have fallen below 1996 - 2002 levels .
Moreover , supply disruptions have adversely affected both world oil production and exports .
Figure 5 - Non-OPEC
Oil Supply Growth
The imbalance between scarce supply and growing demand , and expectations that this imbalance will persist in the future , have led to upward pressure on oil prices and greater market reactions to any actual or perceived disruptions in available supply .
Under such tight market conditions , it is often the case that only large price increases can re-establish equilibrium between supply and demand .
Consequently , large or rapid movements in oil prices are not inconsistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand ; such price movements , by themselves , do not indicate that prices have become divorced from fundamentals .
Moreover , if speculative positions , rather than fundamentals , were pushing prices upward , then inventories would be expected to rise .
To date , there is no evidence of such an accumulation ; in fact , known inventory levels actually have declined .
Figure 6 - Increasing Reliance on OPEC Production
Activity in crude oil futures and options contracts has been increasing since 2004 .
During that period , the number of contracts outstanding ( known as “ open interest ” ) has more than tripled , and the number of traders has almost doubled .
The fastest growth in open interest has been recorded among non-commercial traders – often called “ speculators ” – holding spread positions combining long positions in one month with short positions in another month .
Thus , while the long positions of non-commercial traders have increased , the short positions of non-commercial traders also have increased .
Additionally , although the net long positions of non-commercial traders have increased somewhat since 2004 – which some market observers have hypothesized has pushed prices up – the proportion of those positions has been relatively constant as a share of open interest over the last few years , undercutting that hypothesis .
Much of the attention related to participants in futures markets has focused on the role of commodity index investment funds and the commodity swap dealers that often act as their intermediaries .
During the period studied , January 2003 through June 2008 , pension funds and other investors have increasingly used index funds as vehicles to participate in commodity markets .
Some observers have suggested that this rapid inflow of investments through index funds has been a cause of oil price increases .
The CFTC has issued Special Calls for data about this activity , but only partial responses have been received as of the date of publication of this interim report .
An analysis of the data from these Special Calls will be made available in September .
The data currently at hand – which incorporates non-public surveillance information – includes positions held by commodity swap dealers .
Commodity swap dealers offer institutional investors contracts whose returns are linked to a variety of commodity indices .
Broadly speaking , after netting their index fund clients ’ positions against the positions of their other clients , these dealers use futures contracts to hedge the risk remaining from this business .
Thus , the activity of commodity index participants should become evident in the position changes of commodity swap dealers .
Non-public CFTC trading data shows that commodity swap dealers have held roughly balanced long and short positions in the crude oil markets over the last year and actually held a net short position over the first five months of 2008 – that is , swap dealers ’ futures positions would have benefited more from price decreases than from price increases like the ones experienced in the last few months .
Moreover , any pressure exerted by the long positions of swap dealers ’ commodity index clients has largely been offset by the short positions of the dealers ’ other clients .
The Task Force ’s preliminary analysis also suggests that changes in the positions of swap dealers and non-commercial traders most often followed price changes .
This result does not support the hypothesis that the activity of these groups is driving prices higher .
The Task Force has found that the activity of market participants often described as “ speculators ” has not resulted in systematic changes in price over the last five and a half years .
On the contrary , most speculative traders typically alter their positions following price changes , suggesting that they are responding to new information – just as one would expect in an efficiently operating market .
In particular , the positions of hedge funds appear to have moved inversely with the preceding price changes , suggesting instead that their positions might have provided a buffer against volatility - inducing shocks .
From the reports concluding remarks :
Observed increases in the speculative activity and the number of traders in the crude oil futures market do not appear to have systematically affected prices .
Moreover , if speculative activity has pushed oil prices above the levels consistent with physical supply and demand , increases in inventories should emerge as higher prices reduce consumption and investment in productive capacity is encouraged .
Although this process may take time to unfold , inventories of crude oil and petroleum products , according to available data , have declined significantly over the past year .
The view that financial investors have pushed prices above fundamental values is also difficult to square with the fact that prices for other commodities that do not trade on established futures markets ( such as coal , steel , and onions ) have risen sharply as well .
OK , at least based on this preliminary report , speculators are not the primary culprit behind high oil prices .
Clearly SOME % of oils rise is due to speculators , in the same vein that some rise in corn , live hogs and SP500 is due to speculation - in the intermediate term fundamentals will always win .
The year of production peak is largely irrelevant - what matters is cheap and abundant liquid fuels to power the economic system the world has become dependent upon - for all practical purposes we are already past this point .
We are likely going to continue to witness denial of this obvious but threatening theme from the Wall Street - government - OPEC trifecta .
Investment analysts will claim demand destruction , governments will blame speculators and OPEC will posit that the markets remain well supplied .
There will be no end to how long these parties continue to use these arguments .
Every year there will be a normal 20 + % correction in oil prices and confident authority figures will say that peak oil is a myth .

THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING BORING …. Barack Obama has another 2 - minute ad running .
Jonathan Stein says it ’s pretty dull ( “ I tuned out at 0:42 ” ) , but that being dull is the whole point :
Obama is presenting himself as the boring choice in this financial crisis .
To the extent that boring correlates with responsible , adult , and steady , Obama wins .
And with Obama ’s poll numbers looking the way they are , that appears to be a correlation worth betting on .
I think I ’d take this even further , addressing Ross Douthat ’s surprise that Obama won last week ’s debate at the same time .
The key insight is this : lots of ordinary viewers enjoy a bit of policy wonkishness .
We political junkies , even those of us who enjoy policy discussions , do n’t .
We ’ve heard it a million times before .
But most viewers have n’t , and they find it kind of interesting , the same way they mostly liked Bill Clinton ’s endless laundry list State of the Union addresses .
They do n’t hear this kind of thing very often , and when they do it ’s a nice change of pace from the daily soundbites on the evening news , which are hard to put together into a coherent understanding of what each candidate stands for .
Hearing it all in one piece is a bit of a revelation .
Needless to say , this can be overdone .
And a financial crisis is an unusually good time for a sober , wonky address to the voters .
But we should n’t be too surprised that it works well both in ads and in debates .
Voters like being treated like adults more than most of us give them credit for .
The honeycomb like structure ( photo : Manfred Buck )
( PhysOrg.com ) --
A crucial step in developing minuscule structures with application potential in sophisticated sensors , catalysis , and nanoelectronics has been developed by Scottish researchers .
Dr Manfred Buck and his team at the University of St Andrews have accomplished one of the big quests in nanotechnology , opening up an exciting new development in tiny technology .
The St Andrews researchers have developed a way of forming an easily modified network of molecules over a large area - the chemical technique provides an advantageous alternative to traditional methods which become increasingly cumbersome at the ultrasmall length scale .
The key to the development lies in the creation of robust and versatile surface - self - assembling structures just one molecule thick which can be exploited for further control and manipulation of nanostructures .
Dr Manfred Buck , of the University¿s School of Chemistry , explained , " One of the central issues in nanotechnology is the development of simple and reliable methods to precisely arrange molecules and other nanoscopic objects .
One promising route intensively investigated by scientists around the world involves the ability of molecules to spontaneously assemble onto a surface .
What we have done is successfully combined two strategies which are complementary but , so far , have been explored independently , and it is this combination which opens up unprecedented opportunities for accessing the ultrasmall length scale . "
" The potential of this approach lies in its flexibility on a scale , about 1/10000 of the diameter of a human hair .
Using molecules as building units , the features of our structures are less than 5 nanometres in size , which enables us to control structures and materials at dimensions where new properties emerge . "
One of the advantages of the technique is that it works under ambient conditions .
Since no sophisticated equipment or special environment - such as a high vacuum - is required , it is easily accessible and adaptable for a wide range of applications .
The chemical method provides an alternative route to nanostructures created by conventional lithography , which inscribes patterns into surfaces but struggles to be precise on a scale of a few nanometres .
Dr Buck 's solution - based chemistry works by assembling molecules into tiny dimples , themselves created when molecules self - assemble into a honeycomb - shaped network on a gold surface .
Such a so - called supramolecular network is held together by hydrogen bonds - a type of bonding also essential for DNA - and acts as a template to control the arrangement of other molecules .
He continued , " We are just at the beginning of the exploration of a very exciting new area .
Ongoing and future work will investigate changes in the dimensions and geometry of the network , where the aim is to get exact control over the arrangement of molecules , ultimately at the level of single molecules . "
" In the short term , this development provides us with an easily accessible platform for fundamental studies of phenomena on the ultrasmall scale , " Dr Buck explained .
" In the future , we might be able to use this technology for the assembly of ' nanomachines ' , molecular devices used to transport and manipulate molecules and nanometer sized objects , " he concluded .
The research is published by the journal Nature .

Monash University scientists have revolutionised the design of fuel cells used in the latest generation of hybrid cars which could make the vehicles more reliable and cheaper to build .
The breakthrough , published today in the journal Science , revolves around the design of a fuel cell in which a specially - coated form of popular hi tech outdoor and sporting clothing material Goretex® is the key component .
The team of Monash scientists have designed and tested an air - electrode , where a fine layer - just 0.4 of a micron thick , or about 100 times thinner than a human hair – of highly conductive plastic is deposited on the breathable fabric .
The conductive plastic acts as both the fuel cell electrode and catalyst .
Monash University 's Dr Bjorn Winther - Jensen said just as Goretex® had revolutionised the outdoor clothing industry , it could hold similar promise for motorists .
" The same way as waste vapour is drawn out of this material to make hikers more comfortable to less prone to hypothermia , so it is able to ' breathe ' oxygen into our fuel cell and into contact with the conductive plastic , " Dr Winter - Jensen said .
Monash University 's Professor Doug MacFarlane from the Australian Centre for Electromaterials Science ( ACES ) said the discovery was probably the most important development in fuel cell technology in the last 20 years .
" The benefits for the motoring industry and for motorists are that the new design removes the need for platinum , which acts as the catalyst and is currently central to the manufacturing process , " Professor MacFarlane said .
" Our reliance on platinum is making the likelihood of using fuel cells in everyday passenger cars , increasingly improbable .
" The cost of the platinum component alone of current fuel cells for a small car with a 100 kW electric engine is more than the total cost of an 100 kW gasoline engine .
Also current annual world production of platinum is only sufficient for about 3 million 100 kW vehicles , less than one - twentieth of the current annual global production of vehicles . "
The new design fuel cell has been tested for periods of up to 1500 hours continuously using hydrogen as the fuel source .
Professor Maria Forsyth , Director of ACES at Monash said testing has shown no sign of material degradation or deterioration in performance .
The tests also confirmed that oxygen conversion rates are comparable with platinum–catalysed electrodes of the same geometry and found electrodes are not poisoned by carbon monoxide the way platinum is .
" The small amounts of carbon monoxide that are always present in exhausts from petrol engines are a real problem for fuel cells because the platinum catalyst is slowly poisoned , eventually destroying the cell , " Professor Forsyth said .
" The important point to stress is that the team has come up with an alternative fuel cell design that is more economical , more easily sourced , outlasts platinum cells and is just as effective . "

DENVER , Colorado ( CNN ) -- Former President Bill Clinton declared Barack Obama " ready to be president of the United States " at the Democratic National Convention Wednesday , after months of attacks from Hillary Clinton supporters on the Democratic nominee 's lack of experience .
Bill Clinton himself was among the most outspoken proponents of that line of criticism of Obama .
But Wednesday , Clinton reversed himself , pointing out that Republicans had used the same line of attack against him when he first ran for president .
" It did n't work in 1992 , because we were on the right side of history , " Clinton said .
" And it wo n't work in 2008 , because Barack Obama is on the right side of history . "
Obama made history a few hours before Clinton 's speech , becoming the first African - American to be nominated for president by a major party .
Hillary Clinton interrupted a roll call vote to ask that he be nominated by acclamation , a carefully choreographed maneuver designed to unite the party after the bitter primary battle between Obama and Clinton .
Watch Clinton say why he thinks Obama is ready to lead »
Bill Clinton continued that theme in his speech .
" Last night , Hillary told us in no uncertain terms that she is going to do everything in her power to elect Barack Obama , " Clinton said of his wife , who ran against Obama for the Democratic nomination and urged her backers Tuesday night to support him .
Watch the entire speech »
" That makes two of us -- actually that makes 18 million of us , " he said , a reference to the number of Democratic primary voters who backed Hillary Clinton .
Bill Clinton received a rapturous welcome when he appeared on stage to the tune of " Do n't Stop Thinking About Tomorrow , " his 1992 campaign theme song .
He soaked up the applause for several minutes , repeatedly thanking the crowd and finally saying firmly , but with a laugh , " Sit down ! "
He attacked John McCain , the Republican candidate , as someone who would continue the failed policies of the Bush administration : " More tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans that will swell the deficit , increase inequality , and weaken the economy .
More Band - Aids for health care that will enrich insurance companies , impoverish families and increase the number of uninsured .
More going it alone in the world , instead of building the shared responsibilities and shared opportunities necessary to advance our security and restore our influence . "
iReport.com : React to convention speeches
But Obama , he said , " will lead us away from the division and fear of the last eight years and back to hope . "
He closed with an echo of his 1992 portrayal of himself as the Man from Hope , his hometown in Arkansas .
" And so if you , like me , believe that America must always be a place called Hope , then join Hillary and Chelsea and me in making Barack Obama the next president of the United States . "

Aggressive prostate cancer has a poor prognosis Scientists are hailing a new drug to treat aggressive prostate cancer as potentially the most significant advance in the field for 70 years .
Abiraterone could potentially treat up to 80 % of patients with a deadly form of the disease resistant to currently available chemotherapy , they say .
The drug works by blocking the hormones which fuel the cancer .
The Institute of Cancer Research hopes a simple pill form will be available in two to three years .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
An advanced clinical trial involving 1,200 patients around the world is currently under way , with more trials likely later this year .
Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men .
It is estimated that up to 10,000 men a year in the UK are diagnosed with the most aggressive - and almost always lethal - form of prostate cancer .
Typical life expectancy following chemotherapy is no more than 18 months .
It had been assumed that the cancer was driven by sex hormones such as testosterone produced in the testicles .
Current treatments work by stopping the testicles from producing testosterone .
New action
However , experts have now discovered that the cancer can feed on sex hormones from all sources , including supplies of the hormone produced by the tumour itself .
The changes in my life have been dramatic
Simon Bush
Cancer trial patient
Read Simon 's story Abiraterone works by blocking production of the hormones throughout the body .
The latest study , published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology , is based on just 21 patients with advanced , aggressive prostate cancer treated with the drug - but data has been collected on a total of 250 worldwide .
It found significant tumour shrinkage , and a drop in tell - tale levels of a key protein produced by the cancer called prostate specific antigen in the majority of patients .
Many of the patients have reported a significant improvement in the quality of their lives .
Some were able to stop taking morphine for the relief of pain caused by the spread of the disease to their bones .
Real hope Lead researcher Dr Johann de Bono said the findings needed to be confirmed in larger trials .
We believe we have made a major step forward in the treatment of end - stage prostate cancer patients
Dr Johann de Bono
Institute of Cancer Research
At this stage , no patient has taken the drug for longer than two - and - a - half years , and so it has not been possible to determine exactly what the effect of the drug on life expectancy will be .
But he said : " We believe we have made a major step forward in the treatment of end - stage prostate cancer patients .
" These men have very aggressive prostate cancer which is exceptionally difficult to treat and almost always proves to be fatal .
" We hope that abiraterone will eventually offer them real hope of an effective way of managing their condition and prolonging their lives . "
It is hoped the drug will also aid other cancer patients , including those with breast cancer .
Professor David Webb , an expert in clinical pharmacology at the University of Edinburgh , said : " This agent clearly looks promising , but it is still at the early stages of clinical development .

" It will be crucial to look carefully at the balance between its benefits and harms , before drawing firm conclusions about the usefulness of this new drug .
" Important side effects often only emerge with the larger clinical studies that now need to be done . "
John Neate , of The Prostate Cancer Charity , said : " This is an exciting development which has been eagerly anticipated . "

What are these ?
Bikinis and other sexy stimuli can make men more prone to seek immediate gratification — leading to blown diets , budgets and bank accounts , new research suggests .
In the study , detailed in the Journal of Consumer Research , men alternately fondled t- shirts and bras ( which were not being worn during the test ) .
After touching the bras , men valued the future less and the present more , said lead researcher Bram Van Den Bergh of Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Belgium .
Viewing ads with women in bikinis had the same effect .
It was n't that the men were simply distracted by their sexual arousal , which caused them to choose more impulsively .
On the contrary , they exhibited improved cognition and creativity after exposure to sexy stimuli .
The researchers conclude that there is one common appetite system in the brain monitoring our desire for a host of pleasures from sweets to pretty faces , alcohol to lotto winnings .
When it is stimulated by , say , a sexy picture or the smell of baked goods , we experience a general craving for anything pleasant .
" Basically , you just want to be rewarded , " explained Barbara Briers , a researcher at HEC Paris School of Management .
Briers , who has conducted related research , was not involved with this study .
Immediate gratification
Van Den Bergh and colleagues rendered the bikini - effect powerless by satiating the stirred appetite with a different type of reward — financial security .
A sense of personal wealth depends largely on what we perceive to be the society standard .
The researchers manipulated this perception to make male subjects feel relatively rich or relatively poor .
When a questionnaire suggested the average income in society was very small — smaller than most of the subjects ' incomes — the men felt rich in comparison .
Conversely , when the average income was implied to be very large — dwarfing that of the male subjects — most of the men began looking at their own earnings as piddling .
When the men felt well - off , the bikinis lost their influence .
But if they considered themselves among the have - nots , they were likely to seek immediate gratification after seeing women running in bikinis .
( Among other sexy stimuli , the study used a commercial for Lynx body spray , which features thousands of women running in bikinis . )
The study was funded by a research division of Aegis Group , a marketing company .
Evolution at work
Evolutionarily speaking , Briers hypothesized , unfulfilled sexual arousal could trigger a subconscious belief that one 's reproductive status is at stake .
Rendered fearful , men reach out for other " resources " — a quick payoff , fast food — to better their chances for survival .
In modern , more splurge - friendly times , this may be a maladaptive tendency .
The bikini effect does vary in strength from person to person , Van Den Bergh said .
While most men are vulnerable to subtle types of stimuli — like sexy ads and touching lingerie — others may need to see a woman nude before feeling impulsive .
No matter , Van Den Bergh warned , " being exposed to a sexy girl may influence what stock you invest in or what candy bar you buy . "
While her own research also indicates a common reward pathway , Briers cautioned that some studies suggest more specific reward responses ( for example , new mothers respond differently to a baby 's smell than childless women ) .
Taken together , all this research , she said " is the beginning of something fascinating . "
WAR Correspondent : Tier One Scenarios Overview
MMORPG.com Warhammer Online Correspondent writes this article giving an overview of the three different Tier 1 scenarios available in Mythic Entertainment 's Warhammer Online .
If it ’s not obvious , the focus in Warhammer Online is Realm versus Realm combat , or RvR .
Players can jump into the fray immediately upon entering the game at rank 1 , partaking in scenarios and capturing world objectives to name just two possibilities .
Many players have come off their first foray into WAR with the recent preview weekend so it ’s a good time to review Tier 1 RvR scenarios .
SCENARIO OVERVIEW
For those who might be unaware , here is the low down on scenarios .
Scenarios are timed RvR matches between Order and Destruction .
If your side reaches 500 points ( which are received from capturing objectives or killing enemies ) before the enemy does , or if you have the most points after the timer expires , you win .
Scenarios have a cap on the number of players that can take part and this cap is usually 12 - on - 12 or 24 - on - 24 .
You can join a scenario queue by clicking on the war symbol near the top left of the minimap .
GATES OF EKRUND
Gates of Ekrund is the Tier 1 Dwarfs vs Greenskins scenario .
12 players on each side may take part in this battle .
This is your typical hold an objective and get points scenario .
Simply stand near the objective and you ’ll notice a bar below your minimap moving to indicate your progress in capturing it .
Up to six players can capture a single objective , the more players nearby , the faster you capture it .
Personally , I feel Gates of Ekrund is the best of the Tier 1 scenarios .
Taking place inside the walls of , and on top of , the gate , this scenario provides for a fast paced , close quarters battle .
The combat is so close in fact that my allies were rarely outside of my shaman ’s 100 ft heal range .
There are three capture points within the gate .
One point is on the left and another on the right of the gate and they ’re both in small cubbyholes for rooms .
The third , and most valuable , point is right in the middle of both of the other points and is rather exposed .
There are ledges upon which casters and other ranged combats can rain down destruction while their melee counterparts are in the thick of things on the ground fighting for the objective .
This scenario seems to heavily favor Destruction .
Over the dozen or so times I played this encounter with my Gobbo Shaman , Destruction only lost once .
While it ’s possible that this could be attributed to the server I was on that seems rather unlikely given the incredible win loss ratio I experienced .
KHAINE’S EMBRACE
The High Elves versus Dark Elves Tier 1 scenario is Khaine ’s Embrace , which is a 12 on 12 matchup .
This battle is also an objective holding scenario , however , rather than simply getting points for holding an objective , you must hold both objectives on this map for 10 seconds to be awarded points .
Also , you must right click on the objective rather than just stand near it .
If you see someone kneeling near the objective , attack that person right away .
Once both points have been controlled for 10 seconds by the same side , Khaine ’s wrath will be unleashed .
If you ’re around the capture points or Khaine ’s altar , it ’s best to vacate the area because a fireball will erupt from each of those areas , killing everyone nearby .
Khaine ’s Embrace is a fun scenario .
When the match begins , players must race up from their starting point toward the nearest capture point and then over to their enemy ’s point .
It provides wide - open areas for both ranged and melee combatants to maneuver and a small tunnel between objectives that can be used as a shortcut to the opposite objective or to break line of sight if the need arises .
In my experience , Destruction won an inordinate number of times just as with the Gates of Ekrund scenario .
Each time I played this scenario ( approximately 8 times ) , Destruction won by a very wide margin .
NORDENWATCH
Nordenwatch is the Empire versus Chaos Tier 1 matchup .
The battle has a player cap of 12 on 12 .
Like Gates of Ekrund , this scenario simply requires you to stand near objectives to capture them .
There are three points to capture which are arranged in a wedge formation .
The two end points of the wedge are objectives , which are near to the player start points .
The third objective is near a keep atop a hill and is the most valuable of the three .
This is a great battle .
There are a couple choke points ripe for tossing out an area of effect spell , plenty of objects to use for cover , and even access to the top of the keep .
Aside from those choke points the map is wide open to allow for maneuvering in combat or to bypass the obvious routes of advancement , sneak around , and ninja an undefended or weakly guarded point from your enemy .
Unlike Gates of Ekrund and Khaine ’s Embrace , Nordenwatch appears to heavily favor Order .
On Destruction , we never got close to a victory in any of the matches I played in .
Order beat us to the keep , captured it , and would then beat us back to our start point .
FINAL THOUGHTS
The three tier 1 battles are varied enough that they do n’t feel similar despite the fact that they ’re all based on capturing objectives .
While it would have been nice if a different mechanic was used on at least one of the three , you have to wait until tier 2 for something other than just , “ Go here and capture & defend . ”
At first glance it may seem that the Tier 1 scenarios favor one side or the other , however , I ’m willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and save a final judgment on that until the game has launched and matured a little .
Overall , scenarios are great for partaking in some fast paced RvR combat .
You can jump in right away at level 1 and aid your side in the WAAAGH !
while simultaneously gaining XP , renown , and even a little cash here and there .

What I find ironic is that while the images in The New Yorker cover were completely false ( Obama as a Muslim terrorist ? ) , there is video of McCain singing “ Bomb Iran ” , and Cindy McCain admitted to being addicted to pain killers ( after she lied about it ) .
So , the real cover contains falsehoods , while the fake cover contains the truth .
What would be a more equivalent rebuttal would be depicting McCain collaborating with his Viet Cong captors to become a Manchurian candidate .
In fact , I dare The New Yorker ( or anyone ) to publish such a cover .
Then we ’ll see what kind of response that gets .
UPDATE : Another rebuttal , this time a bit more on the mark :
UPDATE 2 : Another rebuttal , but on a different tack .

While the selection of Sarah Palin has helped John McCain expand his lead in Florida , and narrow the gap in Pennsylvania , Obama has actually increased his lead in Ohio according to a new Quinnipiac University swing state poll .
Overall , Obama still leads in two of the three swing states .
Voters in all three states agree that Palin was a good choice for McCain and she has helped the Republican with white female voters in each state .
Among white women , McCain has gained four points in Ohio and five points in Pennsylvania .
The problem is in her favorability ratings , in the states where they are lower , Obama leads .
In Florida , both men and women support McCain .
He leads with men , 54% - 41 % , and women 47 % - 45 % .
The economy was selected as the top issue in the state ( 49 % ) by a large margin over the Iraq war ( 12 % ) .
By demographics , McCain leads with white voters , 59 % - 35 % .
Obama leads with voters age 18 - 34 , 55%- 37 % , but McCain leads with both middle aged and older voters .

In the state of Ohio , Obama still leads with female voters by 10 points , 52 % - 42 % .
Men are tied at 47 % between the two candidates , and Obama once again dominates with young voters , 64%- 33 % .
In a reversal of Florida the other two voting demographics are a virtual tie in Ohio .
McCain and Obama have identical 53 % favorable ratings in the state , but the Palin effect is much less her .
Her favorability rating is only 41 % in Ohio .
A great sign for Obama in the state is that the economy and healthcare were listed as the top two voter concerns .
In Pennsylvania , Obama leads 51% - 41 % with women , and McCain maintained a small lead with men , 51 % - 45 % .
Obama leads 58% - 38 % with young voters and 49 % - 47 % with middle aged voters .
The economy was listed as the most important issue by 51 % of those surveyed followed by the war in Iraq ( 12 % ) and healthcare ( 10 % ) .
The Palin selection has cost McCain support with Clinton voters in the state .
He lost three points with this group , and now has the support of 22 % of Clinton supporters .
Another omen of the strong loyalty to Hillary Clinton in the state is that Palin only got a 39 % favorability rating in PA .
What this poll reveals is that in places where the economy dominates the issues , Palin is having little impact .
She was a shrewd selection to motivate the GOP base , but in blue collar states that tilt Democratic due to the economy , she is having little impact .
The fact that McCain has lost ground in Ohio is a very bad omen for him .
Obama currently leads in Pennsylvania , Ohio , Michigan , New Hampshire , New Mexico and Nevada .
The math is very simple .
If Obama holds the blue state base and takes Ohio , he wins the election .
It looks like the Republicans have a lot more work to do before Sarah Palin can be anointed as the savior of the GOP .

Vital unresolved anthrax questions and ABC News
( Updated below – Update II – Update III – Update IV – Update V – Update VI )
The FBI ’s lead suspect in the September , 2001 anthrax attacks — Bruce E. Ivin — died Tuesday night , apparently by suicide , just as the Justice Department was about to charge him with responsibility for the attacks .
For the last 18 years , Ivins was a top anthrax researcher at the U.S. Government ’s biological weapons research laboratories at Ft. Detrick , Maryland , where he was one of the most elite government anthrax scientists on the research team at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Disease ( USAMRIID ) .
The 2001 anthrax attacks remain one of the great mysteries of the post - 9/11 era .
After 9/11 itself , the anthrax attacks were probably the most consequential event of the Bush presidency .
One could make a persuasive case that they were actually more consequential .
The 9/11 attacks were obviously traumatic for the country , but in the absence of the anthrax attacks , 9/11 could easily have been perceived as a single , isolated event .
It was really the anthrax letters — with the first one sent on September 18 , just one week after 9/11 — that severely ratcheted up the fear levels and created the climate that would dominate in this country for the next several years after .
It was anthrax — sent directly into the heart of the country ’s elite political and media institutions , to then - Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ( D - SD ) , Sen .
Pat Leahy ( D - Vt ) , NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw , and other leading media outlets — that created the impression that social order itself was genuinely threatened by Islamic radicalism .
If the now - deceased Ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks , then that means that the anthrax came from a U.S. Government lab , sent by a top U.S. Army scientist at Ft. Detrick .
Without resort to any speculation or inferences at all , it is hard to overstate the significance of that fact .
From the beginning , there was a clear intent on the part of the anthrax attacker to create a link between the anthrax attacks and both Islamic radicals and the 9/11 attacks .
This was the letter sent to Brokaw :
The letter sent to Leahy contained this message :
We have anthrax .
You die now .
Are you afraid ?
Death to America .
Death to Israel .
Allah is great .
By design , those attacks put the American population into a state of intense fear of Islamic terrorism , far more than the 9/11 attacks alone could have accomplished .
Much more important than the general attempt to link the anthrax to Islamic terrorists , there was a specific intent — indispensably aided by ABC News — to link the anthrax attacks to Iraq and Saddam Hussein .
In my view , and I ’ve written about this several times and in great detail to no avail , the role played by ABC News in this episode is the single greatest , unresolved media scandal of this decade .
News of Ivins ’ suicide , which means ( presumably ) that the anthrax attacks originated from Ft. Detrick , adds critical new facts and heightens how scandalous ABC News ’ conduct continues to be in this matter .
During the last week of October , 2001 , ABC News , led by Brian Ross , continuously trumpeted the claim as their top news story that government tests conducted on the anthrax — tests conducted at Ft. Detrick — revealed that the anthrax sent to Daschele contained the chemical additive known as bentonite .
ABC News , including Peter Jennings , repeatedly claimed that the presence of bentonite in the anthrax was compelling evidence that Iraq was responsible for the attacks , since — as ABC variously claimed — bentonite “ is a trademark of Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein ’s biological weapons program ” and “ only one country , Iraq , has used bentonite to produce biological weapons . ”
ABC News ’ claim — which they said came at first from “ three well - placed but separate sources , ” followed by “ four well - placed and separate sources ” — was completely false from the beginning .
There never was any bentonite detected in the anthrax ( a fact ABC News acknowledged for the first time in 2007 only as a result of my badgering them about this issue ) .
It ’s critical to note that it is n’t the case that preliminary tests really did detect bentonite and then subsequent tests found there was none .
No tests ever found or even suggested the presence of bentonite .
The claim was just concocted from the start .
It just never happened .
That means that ABC News ’ “ four well - placed and separate sources ” fed them information that was completely false — false information that created a very significant link in the public mind between the anthrax attacks and Saddam Hussein .
And look where — according to Brian Ross ’ report on October 28 , 2001 — these tests were conducted :
And despite continued White House denials , four well - placed and separate sources have told ABC News that initial tests on the anthrax by the US Army at Fort Detrick , Maryland , have detected trace amounts of the chemical additives bentonite and silica .
Two days earlier , Ross went on ABC News ’ World News Tonight with Peter Jennings and , as the lead story , breathlessly reported :
The discovery of bentonite came in an urgent series of tests conducted at Fort Detrick , Maryland , and elsewhere .
Clearly , Ross ’ allegedly four separate sources had to have some specific knowledge of the tests conducted and , if they were really “ well - placed , ” one would presume that meant they had some connection to the laboratory where the tests were conducted — Ft. Detrick .
That means that the same Government lab where the anthrax attacks themselves came from was the same place where the false reports originated that blamed those attacks on Iraq .
It ’s extremely possible — one could say highly likely — that the same people responsible for perpetrating the attacks were the ones who fed the false reports to the public , through ABC News , that Saddam was behind them .
What we know for certain — as a result of the letters accompanying the anthrax — is that whoever perpetrated the attacks wanted the public to believe they were sent by foreign Muslims .
Feeding claims to ABC
News designed to link Saddam to those attacks would , for obvious reasons , promote the goal of the anthrax attacker (s ) .
Seven years later , it ’s difficult for many people to recall , but , as I ’ve amply documented , those ABC News reports linking Saddam and anthrax penetrated very deeply — by design — into our public discourse and into the public consciousness .
Those reports were absolutely vital in creating the impression during that very volatile time that Islamic terrorists generally , and Iraq and Saddam Hussein specifically , were grave , existential threats to this country .
As but one example : after Ross ’ lead report on the October 26 , 2001 edition of World News Tonight with Peter Jennings claiming that the Government had found bentonite , this is what Jennings said into the camera :
This news about bentonite as the additive being a trademark of the Iraqi biological weapons program is very significant .
Partly because there ’s been a lot of pressure on the Bush administration inside and out to go after Saddam Hussein .
And some are going to be quick to pick up on this as a smoking gun .
That ’s exactly what happened .
The Weekly Standard published two lengthy articles attacking the FBI for focusing on a domestic culprit and — relying almost exclusively on the ABC / Ross report — insisted that Saddam was one of the most likely sources for those attacks .
In November , 2001 , they published an article ( via Lexis ) which began :
On the critical issue of who sent the anthrax , it ’s time to give credit to the ABC website , ABCNews.com , for reporting rings around most other news organizations .
Here ’s a bit from a comprehensive story filed late last week by Gary Matsumoto , lending further credence to the commonsensical theory ( resisted by the White House ) that al Qaeda or Iraq — and not some domestic Ted Kaczynski type — is behind the germ warfare .
The Weekly Standard published a much lengthier and more dogmatic article in April , 2002 again pushing the ABC “ bentonite ” claims and arguing : “ There is purely circumstantial though highly suggestive evidence that might seem to link Iraq with last fall ’s anthrax terrorism . ”
The American Enterprise Institute ’s Laurie Mylroie ( who had an AEI article linking Saddam to 9/11 ready for publication at the AEI on September 13 ) expressly claimed in November , 2001 that “ there is also tremendous evidence that subsequent anthrax attacks are connected to Iraq ” and based that accusation almost exclusively on the report from ABC and Ross ( “ Mylroie : Evidence Shows Saddam Is Behind Anthrax Attacks ” ) .
And then , when President Bush named Iraq as a member of the “ Axis of Evil ” in his January , 2002 State of the Union speech — just two months after ABC ’s report , when the anthrax attacks were still very vividly on the minds of Americans — he specifically touted this claim :
The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax , and nerve gas , and nuclear weapons for over a decade .
Bush ’s invocation of Iraq was the only reference in the State of the Union address to the unsolved anthrax attacks .
And the Iraq - anthrax connection was explicitly made by the President at a time when , as we now know , he was already eagerly planning an attack on Iraq .
There ca n’t be any question that this extremely flamboyant though totally false linkage between Iraq and the anthrax attacks — accomplished primarily by the false bentonite reports from ABC News and Brian Ross — played a very significant role in how Americans perceived of the Islamic threat generally and Iraq specifically .
As but one very illustrative example , The Washington Post ’s columnist , Richard Cohen , supported the invasion of Iraq , came to regret that support , and then explained what led him to do so , in a 2004 Post column entitled “ Our Forgotten Panic ” :
I ’m not sure if panic is quite the right word , but it is close enough .
Anthrax played a role in my decision to support the Bush administration ’s desire to take out Saddam Hussein .
I linked him to anthrax , which I linked to Sept. 11 .
I was not going to stand by and simply wait for another attack — more attacks .
I was going to go to the source , Hussein , and get him before he could get us .
As time went on , I became more and more questioning , but I had a hard time backing down from my initial whoop and holler for war .
Cohen — in a March 18 , 2008 Slate article in which he explains why he wrongfully supported the attack on Iraq — disclosed this :
Anthrax .
Remember anthrax ?
It seems no one does anymore — at least it ’s never mentioned .
But right after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , letters laced with anthrax were received at the New York Post and Tom Brokaw ’s office at NBC .
. . .
There was ample reason to be afraid .
The attacks were not entirely unexpected .
I had been told soon after Sept. 11 to secure Cipro , the antidote to anthrax .
The tip had come in a roundabout way from a high government official , and I immediately acted on it .
I was carrying Cipro way before most people had ever heard of it .
For this and other reasons , the anthrax letters appeared linked to the awful events of Sept. 11 .
It all seemed one and the same .
Already , my impulse had been to strike back , an overwhelming urge that had , in fact , taken me by surprise on Sept. 11 itself when the first of the Twin Towers had collapsed .
. . .
In the following days , as the horror started to be airbrushed — no more bodies plummeting to the sidewalk — the anthrax letters started to come , some to people I knew .
And I thought , No , I ’m not going to sit here passively and wait for it to happen .
I wanted to go to “ them , ” whoever “ they ” were , grab them by the neck , and get them before they could get us .
One of “ them ” was Saddam Hussein .
He had messed around with anthrax . . .
He was a nasty little fascist , and he needed to be dealt with .
That , more or less , is how I made my decision to support the war in Iraq .
Cohen ’s mental process that led him to link anthrax to Iraq and then to support an attack on Iraq , warped as it is , was extremely common .
Having heard ABC
News in the immediate aftermath of the 9/11 attack flamboyantly and repeatedly link Saddam to the anthrax attacks , followed by George Bush ’s making the same linkage ( albeit more subtly ) in his January , 2002 State of the Union speech , much of the public had implanted into their minds that Saddam Hussein was not just evil , but a severe threat to the U.S. , likely the primary culprit behind the anthrax attacks .
All along , though , the anthrax came from a U.S. Government / Army research lab .
Critically , ABC
News never retracted its story ( they merely noted , as they had done from the start , that the White House denied the reports ) .
And thus , the linkage between Saddam and the anthrax attacks — every bit as false as the linkage between Saddam and the 9/11 attacks — persisted .
We now know — we knew even before news of Ivins ’ suicide last night , and know especially in light of it — that the anthrax attacks did n’t come from Iraq or any foreign government at all .
It came from our own Government ’s scientist , from the top Army bioweapons research laboratory .
More significantly , the false reports linking anthrax to Iraq also came from the U.S. Government — from people with some type of significant links to the same facility responsible for the attacks themselves .
Surely the question of who generated those false Iraq - anthrax reports is one of the most significant and explosive stories of the last decade .
The motive to fabricate reports of bentonite and a link to Saddam is glaring .
Those fabrications played some significant role —
I ’d argue a very major role — in propagandizing the American public to perceive of Saddam as a threat , and further , propagandized the public to believe that our country was sufficiently threatened by foreign elements that a whole series of radical policies that the neoconservatives both within and outside of the Bush administration wanted to pursue — including an attack an Iraq and a whole array of assaults on our basic constitutional framework — were justified and even necessary in order to survive .
ABC News already knows the answers to these questions .
They know who concocted the false bentonite story and who passed it on to them with the specific intent of having them broadcast those false claims to the world , in order to link Saddam to the anthrax attacks and — as importantly — to conceal the real culprit(s ) ( apparently within the U.S. government ) who were behind the attacks .
And yet , unbelievably , they are keeping the story to themselves , refusing to disclose who did all of this .
They ’re allegedly a news organization , in possession of one of the most significant news stories of the last decade , and they are concealing it from the public , even years later .
They ’re not protecting “ sources . ”
The people who fed them the bentonite story are n’t “ sources . ”
They ’re fabricators and liars who purposely used ABC News to disseminate to the American public an extremely consequential and damaging falsehood .
But by protecting the wrongdoers , ABC News has made itself complicit in this fraud perpetrated on the public , rather than a news organization uncovering such frauds .
That is why this is one of the most extreme journalistic scandals that exists , and it deserves a lot more debate and attention than it has received thus far .
UPDATE : One other fact to note here is how bizarrely inept the effort by the Bush DOJ to find the real attacker has been .
Extremely suspicious behavior from Ivins — including his having found and completely cleaned anthrax traces on a co-worker ’s desk at the Ft. Detrick lab without telling anyone that he did so and then offering extremely strange explanations for why — was publicly reported as early as 2004 by The LA Times ( Ivins “ detected an apparent anthrax leak in December 2001 , at the height of the anthrax mailings investigation , but did not report it .
Ivins considered the problem solved when he cleaned the affected office with bleach ” ) .
In October 2004 , USA Today reported that Ivins was involved in another similar incident , in April of 2002 , when Ivins performed unauthorized tests to detect the origins of more anthrax residue found at Ft. Detrick .
Yet rather than having that repeated , strange behavior lead the FBI to discover that he was involved in the attacks , there was a very public effort — as Atrios notes here — to blame the attacks on Iraq and then , ultimately , to blame Stephen Hatfill .
Amazingly , as Atrios notes here , very few people other than “ a few crazy bloggers are even interested ” in finding out what happened here and why — at least to demand that ABC News report the vital information that it already has that will shed very significant light on much of this .
UPDATE II : Ivins ’ local paper , Frederick News in Maryland , has printed several Letters to the Editor written by Ivins over the years .
Though the underlying ideology is a bit difficult to discern , he seems clearly driven by a belief in the need for Christian doctrine to govern our laws and political institutions , with a particular interest in Catholic dogma .
He wrote things like this :
Today we frequently admonish people who oppose abortion , euthanasia , assisted suicide or capital punishment to keep their religious , moral , and philosophical beliefs to themselves .
Before dispensing such admonishments in the future , perhaps we should gratefully consider some of our country ’s most courageous , historical figures who refused to do so .
And then there ’s this rather cryptic message , published in 2006 :
Rabbi Morris Kosman is entirely correct in summarily rejecting the demands of the Frederick Imam for a “ dialogue . ”
By blood and faith , Jews are God ’s chosen , and have no need for “ dialogue ” with any gentile .
End of “ dialogue . ”
It should be noted that the lawyer who had been representing Ivins in connection with the anthrax investigation categorically maintains Ivins ’ innocence and attributes his suicide to “ the relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo . ”
On a note related to the main topic of the post , macgupta in comments notes the numerous prominent people in addition to those mentioned here — including The Wall St. Jorunal Editors and former CIA Director James Woolsey — who insisted rather emphatically from the beginning of the anthrax attacks that Saddam was likely to blame .
Indeed , the WSJ Editorial Page — along with others on the Right such as Michael Barone of U.S. News & World Report and Fox News — continued even into 2007 to insist that the FBI was erring by focusing on domestic suspects rather than Middle Easterners .
The Nation ’s Michael Massing noted at the time ( in November , 2001 ) that as a direct result of the anthrax attacks , and the numerous claims insinuating that Iraq was behind them , “ the political and journalistic establishment suddenly seems united in wanting to attack Iraq . ”
There has long been an intense desire on the neoconservative Right to falsely link anthrax to Saddam specifically and Muslims generally .
ABC
News was , and ( as a result of its inexcusable silence ) continues to be , their best friend .
UPDATE III : See this important point from Atrios about Richard Cohen ’s admission that he was told before the anthrax attacks happened by a “ high government official ” to take cipro .
Atrios writes : “ now that we know that the US gov’t believes that anthrax came from the inside , should n’t Cohen be a wee bit curious about what this warning was based on ? ”
That applies to much of the Beltway class , including many well - connected journalists , who were quietly popping cipro back then because , like Cohen , they heard from Government sources that they should .
Leave aside the ethical questions about the fact that these journalists kept those warnings to themselves .
Would n’t the most basic journalistic instincts lead them now — in light of the claims by our Government that the attacks came from a Government scientist — to wonder why and how their Government sources were warning about an anthrax attack ?
Then again , the most basic journalistic instincts would have led ABC News to reveal who concocted and fed them the false “ Saddam / anthrax ” reports in the first place , and yet we still are forced to guess at those questions because ABC News continues to cover up the identity of the perpetrators .
UPDATE IV : John McCain , on the David Letterman Show , October 18 , 2001 ( days before ABC News first broadcast their bentonite report ) :
LETTERMAN : How are things going in Afghanistan now ?
MCCAIN : I think we ’re doing fine . . .
I think we ’ll do fine .
The second phase — if I could just make one , very quickly — the second phase is Iraq .
There is some indication , and I do n’t have the conclusions , but some of this anthrax may — and I emphasize may — have come from Iraq .
LETTERMAN : Oh is that right ?
MCCAIN : If that should be the case , that ’s when some tough decisions are gonna have to be made .
ThinkProgress has the video .
Someone ought to ask McCain what “ indication ” he was referencing that the anthrax “ may have come from Iraq . ”
After all , three days later , McCain and Joe Lieberman went on Meet the Press ( on October 21 , 2001 ) and both strongly suggested that we would have to attack Iraq .
Lieberman said that the anthrax was so complex and potent that “ there ’s either a significant amount of money behind this , or this is state - sponsored , or this is stuff that was stolen from the former Soviet program . ”
As I said , it is not possible to overstate the importance of anthrax in putting the country into the state of fear that led to the attack on Iraq and so many of the other abuses of the Bush era .
There are few news stories more significant , if there are any , than unveiling who the culprits were behind this deliberate propaganda .
The fact that the current GOP presidential nominee claimed back then on national television to have some “ indication ” linking Saddam to the anthrax attacks makes it a bigger story still .
UPDATE V : I tried to be careful here to avoid accepting as True the matter of Ivins ’ guilt .
Very early on in the article , I framed the analysis this way : “ If the now - deceased Ivins really was the culprit behind the attacks , then that means that the anthrax came from a U.S. Government lab , ” and I then noted in Update II that Ivins ’ lawyer vehemently maintains his innocence .
My whole point here is that the U.S. Government now claims the anthrax attacks came from a Government scientist at a U.S. Army lab , and my conclusions follow from that premise , accepted as true only for purposes of this analysis .
It ’s worth underscoring that it is far from clear that Ivins had anything to do with the anthrax attacks , and someone in comments claiming ( anonymously though credibly ) that he knew Ivins personally asserts that Ivins was innocent and makes the case as to why the Government ’s accusations are suspect .
As I see it , the more doubt there is about who was responsible for the anthrax attacks , the greater is the need for ABC News to reveal who fabricated their reports linking the attacks to Iraq .
UPDATE VI : I ’ll be on Rachel Maddow ’s radio show tonight at 8:30 p.m. EST to discuss this story .
Local listings and live audio feed are here .
Numerous people have advised me in comments and via email that ABC News is deleting any mention of my piece today in the comment section to their article on the Ivins suicide ( though many such comments now seem to be posted there ) .
Last year , ABC was in full denial mode when responding to the stories I wrote about this issue .
The key here , I think , will be to try to devise the right strategy to induce the right Congressional Committee to hold hearings on the false ABC News stories and the anthrax issue generally .
I hope to have more details on that effort shortly .

The US Appeals Court for the Federal Circuit handed down its ruling in the ongoing MP3 patent lawsuit between Alcatel - Lucent and Microsoft late last week , and the court 's decision does n't favor Alcatel .
The good news , for those of you who do n't particularly enjoy watching lawyers get rich while patent infringement lawsuits drag on for years , is that the court 's decision last Friday may finally write finis to the entire affair .
The lawsuits between Microsoft and Alcatel - Lucent date back to 2003 , when Lucent ( not yet acquired by Alcatel ) filed suit against Dell and Gateway , alleging that the two companies had violated music compression patents first held by Bell Labs .
Microsoft later willingly joined the lawsuit as a co-defendant , and Alcatel joined the ongoing court proceedings when it purchased Lucent in 2006 .
In the interim period between 2003 and the present day , Alcatel - Lucent and Microsoft have lobbied a volley of additional lawsuits at each other , and the entire case history bears a certain unsettling resemblance to World War I , though with fewer cases of " trench foot . "
In February 2007 , a jury trial ruled in favor of Alcatel and rewarded the company a stunning $ 1.52 billion , by far the largest amount ever awarded to a company in a patent infringement lawsuit .
Microsoft predictably appealed , claiming that it had already licensed the necessary MP3 encoding technology from Fraunhofer IIS .
Judge Rudi Brewster agreed with Redmond on appeal and threw out the $ 1.52 billion judgment .
Adding insult to injury , the judge further indicated that Alcatel - Lucent 's second major claim against Microsoft was possibly invalid .
Judge Brewster 's decision merited another trip through the appeals process — an appeal Alcatel - Lucent lost once again last week .
Alcatel may never take its jury - mandated $ 1.5 billion to the bank , but one of the company 's other patent infringement lawsuits against Microsoft has earned it a cool $ 512 million ( which has already survived an appeal ) .
Alcatel - Lucent 's dreams of suing the entire computer industry for infringing its MP3 patents may have gone up in a puff of smoke last Friday , but suing Microsoft appears to be a viable business plan if you can make the allegations stick .
Further reading :
A federal judge on Monday will consider reversing the nation 's first and only federal jury verdict against a Kazaa user for distributing copyrighted music on a peer - to - peer network without the labels ' authorization .
The outcome is likely to have wide - ranging implications in the Recording Industry Association of America 's file - sharing litigation campaign –- 20,000 lawsuits and counting .
Most cases have settled out of court for a few thousand dollars and had never broached the topic of whether the RIAA must prove copyright violations .
Jammie Thomas testifying in her civil trial last October , while U.S. District Judge Michael Davis watches from the bench .
Courtroom sketch : Wired News / Cate Whittemore
The RIAA claims that infringement on peer - to - peer networks is implied , and that it should n't have to provide proof – because it 's impossible .
" Requiring proof of actual transfers would cripple efforts to enforce copyright owners ' rights online – and would solely benefit those who seek to freeload off plaintiff 's investment , " said RIAA attorney Timothy Reynolds in a court filing ( .pdf ) .
Whether actual proof is necessary will be debated in a Duluth , Minnesota federal courtroom Monday morning .
( Threat Level will be there ) .
The arguments will focus on the trial of Jammie Thomas , a Minnesota woman dinged $ 222,000 by a Duluth jury in October for having an open share folder on the Kazaa network .
Thomas had more than 1,000 songs in the folder , but the RIAA sued her over 24 tracks .
The jury spent five minutes concluding her liability after a four - day trial .
U.S. District Judge Michael Davis , who presided over the case , now thinks he may have erred when he instructed the jury that actual proof of downloading was not necessary .
Davis had instructed ( . pdf ) the jury that the recording industry did not have to prove anybody else downloaded the songs from Thomas ' open share folder .
Davis told jurors they could find unauthorized distribution – copyright infringement – if Thomas was " making copyrighted sound recordings available " over a peer - to - peer network " regardless of whether actual distribution has been shown . "
The judge , seven months after the jury returned its verdict , wrote in a brief order that he may have committed " manifest error of the law " and ordered Monday 's hearing .
Since the RIAA 's litigation campaign began five years ago , at least three judges have ruled against the RIAA on this point .
Those rulings were in pretrial stages , and did n't necessarily kill the cases .
The RIAA is exploring other legal theories .
Still , neither a federal appeals court nor the U.S. Supreme Court has decided the " making available " issue .
( It should be noted that having an open share folder of child pornography counts as criminally distributing child porn , regardless if others download it . )
Digital rights groups and law professors have sided with Thomas .
They point out that the Copyright Act says a rights holder has the exclusive right " to distribute copies or phonorecords of the copyrighted work to the public by sale or other transfer of ownership , or by rental , lease , or lending . "
The Electronic Frontier Foundation , for example , wrote that the Copyright Act does n't allow damages for " attempted " copyright infringement , and has urged the Thomas judge to demand the showing of an actual " transfer " of a copyrighted work .
The Motion Picture Association of America , the movie studios ' lobbying arm , has urged the judge to side with the RIAA .
The group , like the RIAA , says that it is impossible to detect actual infringement in the peer - to - peer context .
In the Thomas case and in the thousands of others , the RIAA sues after online detectives log onto Kazaa , Limewire and other file sharing services .
They peer into open share folders , take screen shots of the music listed and download some of the songs .
They also obtain IP addresses , which are easily determined on open networks .
With those addresses , the RIAA subpoenas internet service providers to cough up the identity of the account holder .
The RIAA then sues the account holder , who usually settles out of court .
Still , it 's technologically impossible for the RIAA to prove that others on the Kazaa network are downloading music directly from somebody else 's share folder .
An interesting footnote to the discussion is whether Judge Davis would allow the 24 downloads the RIAA 's detectives made from Thomas ' share folder as evidence of unauthorized distribution .
One federal judge who has ruled that the RIAA must prove downloads also said in the same opinion that the downloads made by RIAA investigators count as evidence of unauthorized distribution .
Digital rights groups say those downloads should not count against a defendant because the detectives were authorized by the music industry to make the downloads .
The Copyright Act allows damages of up to $ 150,000 per violation .
Thomas and others are challenging the constitutionality of the measure , arguing that the damages are unconstitutionally excessive .

My main worry with John McCain is foreign policy .
What do I worry about ?
That everything that has been awry with this administration would be made worse by his .
Seeing the world as a series of enemies to be attacked rather than as a series of relationships to be managed and a series of foes to be undermined has proven of limited use .
Even the successful removal of the Taliban has led , six years later , to a long and grueling counter - insurgency with no end in sight and a reconstituted al Qaeda in a nuclear - armed , unstable state .
The invasion of Iraq - in the abstract , a noble cause against an evil enemy - has caused the deaths of hundreds of thousands , the displacement of millions , the price of $ 3 trillion ... all for a less despotic Shiite government in league with Iran , making contracts with China .
And that 's if it turns out as a success .
Along the way , the US has lost a vast amount of its moral standing and its legitimacy as a global power - broker .
Insofar as neoconservatives do not understand this , and cannot understand this , they are a clear and present danger to the security of the West .
Their unwillingness to understand how the US might be perceived in the world , how a hegemon needs to exhibit more humility and dexterity to maintain its power , makes them - and McCain - extremely dangerous stewards of American foreign policy in an era of global terror .
They are diplomatically and strategically autistic .
McCain 's response to the calamities of the past eight years has been to compound them all .
It has been to propose a " surge " in Afghanistan , to aggressively embrace open - ended commitment to Iraq ( if the Iraqis can be pressured hard enough ) , and to launch one new hot war against Iran and another cold one - and hot , by proxies - against Russia .
And the way in which the question is debated - around asinine concepts of " toughness " or " sissiness " - leads to facile decisions .
It also leads to ads like this one : fear - mongering as an argument .
It should be noted that Obama 's statement that Iran is " not a serious threat " is so out of context as to be a lie .
He said it was " not a serious threat compared to the Soviet Union . "
That is a critical , historical point - a way of actually looking at foreign policy outside a box crafted by morons .
I do n't know how smart McCain is .
But this ad takes the smear and the fear to a new level :
We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
" We sat on it for a year , " Dr. Hack said in an interview .
" We thought that this thing is so large , it had to have been seen and recorded by someone .
But we found that nobody had described this muscle originating in this particular area . "
The muscle exists in identical form on each side of the face .
It extends from a bony outgrowth behind the eye socket down to the lower jaw , the researchers said .
The tissue , which varies in size among individuals , is about one and a half inches long , three - quarters of an inch wide , and half an inch deep , they said .
A paper detailing the anatomical description of the muscle has been accepted for publication in a peer - reviewed specialty dental journal , Cranio : The Journal of Craniomandibular Practice , he said .
The researchers are also scheduled to present their findings on Tuesday in Baltimore at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
Dr. Daniel O. Graney , who heads the anatomy program at the University of Washington Medical School at Seattle , said he was skeptical of the claim of finding a new facial muscle , but would reserve final judgment until he saw data on the find .
" Gross anatomy has been around for a long time and we are pretty familiar with most of the body , " said Dr. Graney , an associate professor of biological structure .
" In terms of finding something spectacularly different , it 's hard to believe . "
Weird , weird second quarter on Wall Street .
It was devastating for almost everyone holding financial - company stocks , of course .
And on the flip side , almost anything tied to the energy sector was golden -- in fact , better than gold .
The average energy - related stock on the New York Stock Exchange surged 18.3 % in the quarter , as the price of crude rocketed 37.8 % , to $ 140 a barrel .
The price of gold was up 1.1 % in the quarter , to $ 926.20 an ounce .
The weirdness was in a lot of what was between the extremes of financials on one end ( Bank of America Corp. , down 37 % in the quarter ) and well - known oil and gas plays on the other ( ConocoPhillips , up 24 % ) .
Here ’s a look at some of the highlights and lowlights :
-- Utilities power up : The Dow Jones utility index gained 8.7 % in the quarter .
Historically , electric utilities have been a classic " defensive " stock sector , meaning a place to hide in times of market turmoil .
That may have helped them last quarter .
The diversification moves of some of the companies over the last decade into energy trading , telecom services , infrastructure and other areas also may be a draw for some investors .
But a traditional element of utilities ’ defensive appeal -- their dividend yield -- is n’t much of a lure these days .
The average annualized yield of the Dow utility stocks is 3 % , not much above the 2.85 % yield of the Dow industrials .
And for the utility industry as a whole one big question looms :
Will the companies ’ regulators allow them to fully pass through to customers the surging cost of fuel , as they have in the past ?
-- Transports on a roll : The Dow transportation stock index gained 3.4 % in the three months and was the only one of the better - known indexes that was positive in the first half ( up 8.3 % ) and that managed to reach a new all - time high ( on June 5 ) .
While airlines were hammered by soaring jet - fuel costs , their declines in the Dow transports index were offset by gains in railroad shares , including Union Pacific Corp . and CSX Corp .
Soaring demand for coal and for farm commodities has been a boon for the rails , which do a big business hauling that stuff ( it ca n’t go FedEx , after all ) .
Even so , some of the rail giants have warned that the recent Midwest floods could hamper their business in the near term .
-- Mid-cap surprise : The Standard & Poor 's index of 400 mid-capitalization stocks rose 5.1 % in the quarter , a tremendous showing when you consider that the big-cap S&P 500 sank 3.2 % in the period .
Although energy stocks helped both the mid-cap and big-cap indexes , the mid-cap index also benefited from particular strength in non-energy sectors including biotech ( companies such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals ) , fertilizer and chemical firms ( CF Industries Holdings and FMC Corp. ) and infrastructure construction companies ( Quanta Services Inc . ) .
It also got a boost from a rebound in beaten - down shares of higher - education companies ( including Strayer Education and ITT Educational Services ) .
-- Black - and - blue chips : Could Dow Jones & Co. ’s decision to add Bank of America to the Dow industrials index in February been more poorly timed ?
That addition gave the 30 - stock Dow five financial issues ( the others : American Express , American International Group , Citigroup Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. ) .
In the midst of a horrendous credit crunch , that was just asking for trouble .
Not surprisingly , the renewed plunge in financial issues was a major reason for the Dow ’s 7.4 % decline in the second quarter .
It also was a lousy three months for General Electric , General Motors and Coca - Cola Co. , among other Dow issues .
What happened to the concept of blue - chips as havens in tough markets ?
As Wall Street ’s sell - off worsened dramatically in June , big - name stocks may have suffered from a case of " sell what you can , " as I explain in this recent post .

The cascade of money pouring into companies producing thin film solar panels — which promise to lower the cost of solar power — is radically changing analyst predictions for the industry .
Most recently , we ’ve seen whopping investments into the sector , including $ 300 million for Nanosolar and $ 104 million for Ava Solar .
Analysts now say thin film will account for a big portion of the solar market in just a few years : up to 40 percent by 2012 , according to the latest report .
The Prometheus Institute did the research with Greentech Media .
It disavowed previous “ overly conservative methodology ” and took into account new manufacturing investments in the sector .
That 40 percent figure contrasts with the levels being predicted just two months ago .
In July , for example , I reported that Lux Research said that thin film solar panels would make up 28 percent of the total solar power market in 2012 , reaching sales of $ 19.7 billion .
And way back in January , BCC Research had even more muted expectations , forecasting 45 percent year - over - year growth for thin film — strong , but significantly less than standard silicon photovoltaics .
True , those are all numbers from different research groups , but my feeling is that the overall prediction trend is swinging toward the expectation that thin film solar will become a dominant force .
In the race for grid parity , it ’s the cheapest technology that wins .
And aside from just funding , projects like Optisolar ’s 550 MW solar farm show that thin film might actually have the edge its backers have been swearing it has .
DIGG THIS
This past week , the government announced that it would take Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae , the mortgage giants , under conservatorship , which is a nice way of saying that they will be nationalized .
We do n’t use the word nationalize any more .
We can try an experiment and read the new term “ conservatorship ” back into history .
In fact , we might say that Stalin and Lenin put Russia ’s industries under a kind of conservatorship .
Or we might say that Mao pushed a kind of land conservatorship , or that Hitler ’s policy was one of national conservatorship .
Marx ’s little book could be re-titled : The Conservatorship Manifesto .
You see , the government keeps having to make up new names for these things because the old policies , which were not that different in content , failed so miserably .
The old terms become discredited and new terms become necessary , in an effort to fool the public .
It ’s as if a restaurant served a shrimp dish that gave all the customers food poisoning , and so each night it decides to serve the same shrimp but name the dish something new : crangon cocktail , prawn pasta , scampi salad , or what have you .
But no matter what they call it , it is still poison .
Such a restaurant would be out of business in a matter of days .
People would not be fooled .
But the government gets away with it mainly because we have no real choice about the matter , and because people are predisposed to believe the government far more than they should .
It does n’t help that the media are willing to echo the government line on this , adopting every new phrase as if it were the gospel .
Hence the same is true of the word bailout , which you might consider unexceptionally descriptive of this move by the government to protect Freddie and Fannie from further losses .
No , that word is not allowed either .
President Bush told
Fox the other day , ” I would n’t call it a bailout .
I ’d call it a stabilization . ”
We will soon put out a new edition of Mises ’s 1922 book Socialism .
Maybe to keep up with the time we should call it Stabilizing Conservatorship .
What I also find striking is the way in which this move was announced .
Let me read to you from the New York Times : “ The Bush administration seized control of the nation ’s two largest mortgage finance companies on Sunday … .
It could become one of the most expensive financial bailouts in American history . ”
Even the most sophisticated observers of our present scene had to blink their eyes in reading such words .
Without debate , without votes , without anything other than an executive fiat , the White House just decided , on its own , to seize the mortgage market .
Harry Truman , who seized the steel industry , would be proud .
Actually , this is an action to excuse dictators the world over , past , present , and future .
This sort of thing makes a mockery of the Constitution and the very idea of freedom and the free market , to say nothing of the idea that we have a limited government .
What ’s more , if we can believe press reports , President Bush had very little to do with the decision .
It was the work of Henry Paulson , the secretary of the Treasury and former head of Goldman Sachs , working on behalf of the nation ’s most well - connected financial elites .
Nobody elected this guy .
Most Americans do n’t even know his name .
And look at how he throws around trillions of our money .
The New York Times says that this is expensive .
That ’s one way to put it .
It makes the S&L bailout look like the warm -up .
Freddie and Fannie carry about $ 5.3 trillion in mortgage commitments and another $ 2.4 trillion in financial exposure .
The total cost of this operation is unknown ; it could reach to $ 2 trillion , with untold amounts of future exposure .
These two New Deal institutions were founded to speed up the home ownership process for people that banks would otherwise consider unqualified .
In time , under LBJ and Nixon , they were given legal permission to expand without limit , in the name of privatization , of all things .
The motive was a classic bipartisan effort : universal home ownership .
The left favored the redistribution .
The right favored the supposed moral virtue associated with the nuclear family and its suburban abode .
Thus was born the greatest wealth transfer in American history outside Social Security and the warfare state .
In a free market with sound money , borrowing is connected with the ability to pay .
At first , this is only available to the rich .
As prosperity spreads , so does credit worthiness .
Any government intervention designed to inject steroids in this process is going to end in what Rothbard called a cluster of errors .
It is completely disingenuous that so many people are today decrying the banking system ’s failure to discriminate between those who should and should not be carrying a mortgage .
The banking system in a free market handles this just fine .
Ferreting out the difference between those who can handle loans and those who cannot is a main job of the competitive system .
The market precisely calibrates this .
If one lender fails in its assessments of borrowers , another is there to correct the problem .
If you rush the process of prosperity , and insist that everyone who wants a loan should get one , you set up a situation in which there will be problems down the line .
That is precisely what the regime has done .
It created Freddie and Fannie to subsidize loans .
It engaged in a phony privatization that secretly socialized losses .
The legal status of these privately owned , publicly traded , and government - protected agencies was always unclear , but the markets had long assumed that they would be bailed out .
There was a moral hazard at the heart of this policy .
But the real point is that the free market judgment about who should get what was being over - ridden .
Surely , that is not a problem when it comes to promoting the alleged American dream !
In fact , we are paying for this mistake a half century after the policy became a national priority .
As the evangelical ministers like to say , the wheels of justice grind slowly , but they grind mighty fine .
There is only one problem with applying the principle to this case .
There will be no justice .
If justice prevailed , the losses would be borne directly by those responsible .
If we pursued a free - market policy from here on , the answer would not be complicated .
The assets and liabilities of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae would be auctioned today in the free market .
It ’s true that many loans would be defaulted on .
What level of crisis would be precipitated by such a genuine privatization policy ?
It ’s true that the press would be screaming bloody murder , and the big players in finance would suffer .
But in time , the markets would revalue the resources and an important lesson would be learned .
Sound loans would be picked up by financially responsible firms and carried to term .
Home values would fall and many people would have to move to cheaper homes .
We would then be back on sound footing again .
From an administration that purports to favor free markets , this possible solution was not even considered .
Instead , they proclaimed their regrets that they would have to spread the costs of this error over the entire population .
Instead of fixing the problem , however , they only worsen it , underscoring the principle that America will not tolerate failure in business , and the bigger the failure , the more likely it is to be bailed out .
Note that this socialistic bailout and nationalization — to use two forbidden words — were enacted by a Republican administration .
Is n’t it ironic that when you look back at the big upticks in government intervention over the economy , you often find Republicans at the helm .
As for McCain and Palin , they wrote in the Wall Street Journal that this bailout is “ sadly necessarily ” even as they promise reforms that will “ require the highest standards of accounting , reporting and transparency ever demanded in government . ”
Well , here ’s the thing : no one demands higher standards than the market itself , but you have to turn these institutions over to the market in order to elicit such standards .
Congress ’s role has been and will be to yammer .
Only Ron Paul of Texas will have anything sensible to say about this fiasco .
In fact , it was more than five years ago that Ron said the following : “ If Fannie and Freddie were not underwritten by the federal government , investors would demand Fannie and Freddie provide assurance that they follow accepted management and accounting practices … .
By transferring the risk of a widespread mortgage default , the government increases the likelihood of a painful crash in the housing market .
This is because the special privileges granted to Fannie and Freddie have distorted the housing market by allowing them to attract capital they could not attract under pure market conditions .
As a result , capital is diverted from its most productive use into housing .
This reduces the efficacy of the entire market and thus reduces the standard of living of all Americans . ”
It ’s remarkable to observe that hardly anyone dares be against this policy .
On the day following the nationalization , a day that will live in infamy , the Wall Street Journal editorialized against the Democrats and their reform efforts , but did n’t actually oppose the bailout .
The New York Times called it “ a reasonable and reassuring move . ”
The Los Angeles Times wrote that the bailout was “ inevitable . ”
Steve Forbes in his magazine wrote that “ drastic action ” had to be taken because a default would “ have trigged the worst financial meltdown since the Great Depression . ”
It ’s interesting , is n’t it , that all these people believe that waving the magic money wand can make reality just go away .
That incredible superstition seems to be the official position of the entire US establishment .
And we like to flatter ourselves into believing that we live in an age without illusions !
As for those who should know better , Greg Mankiw , author of the leading economics textbook , writes that because “ it was likely to happen eventually ” it is “ better to get on with it . ”
The supposedly free - market economics blog Marginal Revolution warns that without the bailout , “ most of the U.S. banking system would be insolvent , ” failing to point out that a system that needs a bailout with fiat money is already insolvent .
Econlog had lots of good thoughts , but did n’t actually oppose the bailout .
The Cato Institute agrees that the Treasury had to bail out the mortgage industry because it " was forced to do so , " and that Fannie and Freddie are indeed " too big to fail . "
The Heritage Foundation agrees that it was a " necessary step " and a " vital move toward reform . "
Sure , these people have plenty of recommendations about what should have been done in the past , and lots of ideas about what should be done in the future .
As for the present , they are ready to propagandize for the largest socialist operation in American history .
In all of these latter cases , we are looking not at a problem of economic education but rather the courage to stand up to the state when it is needed most .
They did n’t do so after 9/11 .
And now they have caved again .
Part of the problem is the belief in the great myth propagated by Milton Friedman .
As good as he was on many issues , he was not correct on his specialty of American monetary history .
His view was that the Depression was caused by a Fed that failed to fully bail out the banking system .
Ben Bernanke and many others are pleased to accept this view of history , and they are determined not to let it happen again .
In fact , the Fed did attempt to bail out the banks , and was far too successful .
This is the basis of the problem .
In the end , we are talking about a price system that has rendered a verdict on the housing market .
Prices do n’t lie and there is nothing we can do to reverse them .
Even the most powerful government in the world cannot do so .
The attempt causes calamity .
The Austrians understand this , whereas it seems as if hardly anyone else does .
Pretty much alone in both predicting the calamity and actually opposing the bailout are those who have learned from the Misesian tradition , who have said plainly and clearly that this is a dreadful error , one that makes the US more socialistic than China .
Let us address this claim that not bailing out the system , and not nationalizing the mortgage market , would lead to a financial meltdown on the level of the Great Depression .
People talk as if the Depression were some sort of natural disaster that the government had to fight .
In fact , it was the very fighting of the Depression that deepened it and caused it to last all the way through World War II .
We have to understand that if we are to understand the real lesson of the Depression .
Instead of letting prices fall and letting the bad investments wash out of the system , the government tried for years and years to keep prices high , employ people in make - work programs , and generally centrally plan the economy .
In 1920 through 1922 , we had a financial meltdown just as bracing and systematic as the one in 1929 .
The difference was that the government did n’t do anything to try to fix it .
As a result , it solved itself and it is a forgotten event .
Hoover and FDR , in contrast , attempted to use their power over the economy and monetary system to try to keep prices floating high and to keep liquidity in the banking system — precisely as everyone is attempting now .
The result was to forestall the inevitable readjustment process .
They believed that the low prices were the cause and not the effect of the recession .
Does that error sound familiar ?
In other words , the Great Depression only became the Great Depression because the government followed exactly the same policies that the Bush administration is following now with regard to the mortgage market .
It makes no sense to warn that we will repeat the past if we do the same things that actually made the past as bad as it was .
To avoid another Depression - sized downturn , we need to avoid the mistakes of the past , among which were the policies that attempted to keep failing firms and industries afloat in difficult economic times .
What should have happened in 1929 is precisely what should happen now .
The government should completely remove itself and let the market reevaluate resource values .
That means bankruptcies , yes .
That means bank closures , yes .
But these are part of the capitalistic system .
They are part of the free - market economy .
What is regrettable is not the readjustment process , but that the process was ever made necessary by the preceding central bank and other interventions .
Let me state this very plainly : I do not believe for one second that if the government fails to nationalize Freddie and Fannie that the world as we know it will come to an end .
Those who are saying that are trying to scare the population , the same as with every other major demand by the regime .
It was the same with Nafta , the WTO , the war on terror , the war on bird flu , the nationalization of airport security , and everything else .
If the government did nothing but sell off the assets of the mortgage giants , we do not know for sure what would happen , but the market has a way of finding value and readjusting .
I would expect about 18 months of difficulties .
Banks would fail just as many businesses in the free market fail every day .
Housing prices would fall more , just as all market prices are subject to change .
But the process of readjustment would be smooth and rational .
And we would all stop living a lie and believing an illusion .
Contrary to what the blogging heads say , there is nothing that makes this nationalization inevitable .
If we had leaders who had courage , who understood economics , who could think about the long run , we would let the market handle the entire process , come what may .
I guarantee that this solution is a better one than creating another trillion or so to bail out failing enterprises .
And yet this is not just another longing for courageous leaders .
We ca n’t hope for that .
We need a guarantee .
We need a system that would make it impossible for government to do these things even if it wants to .
That system is called sound money .
Think about the preconditions that made it possible for the Bush administration to decide one evening to dump a trillion plus to guarantee three - quarters of the home mortgages in this country .
It is a system that is premised on the government ’s capacity to print unlimited amounts of money .
If it could not do that , no one would be talking about conservatorship .
No one would be talking about guaranteeing the liabilities of the automotive industry either .
War on Afghanistan , on Iraq , on Russia , and troops in another 100 plus countries , would be out of the question .
These would n’t be issues .
If government had to tax people directly for all its spending priorities , we would see Washington ’s ambitions in every area scaled back dramatically .
Every suggestion of a new program would be met with the demand as to how it would be funded .
Fiat money with central banking , on the other hand , tempts corrupt politicians and bureaucrats , and it also further corrupts them .
It is the great occasion of sin of our public life .
The tragedy is that their use of the printing press not only corrupts them ; it imposes dreadful and intolerable costs on the rest of society , in the form of price inflation and business cycles .
We ’ve seen the corruption grow worse over time .
We are living now in the 37th year of fully fiat money with central banking .
The politicians of the past were a bit reticent to use all the power they had .
They are becoming ever more brazen .
The sense of shame seems to be gone forever , their consciousness completely papered over by the ominous power they possess .
The pundit class is following them , believing that there are no limits .
In truth , all these bills must be paid .
To realize that is to realize the necessity of radical reform .
It can be overwhelming to contemplate the glorious results of a full gold standard reform .
Inflation would stop eating away our purchasing power .
The business cycle would be tamed .
International trade would not be disrupted by wild swings in currency values .
But of all the benefits , this one is the greatest : it would stop arbitrary rule , dead in its tracks .
It would force the government to curb its ways .
It would shore up our freedoms .
For this reason , the policy of sound money is very much linked with morality .
The Hebrew scriptures , in the nineteenth chapter of the book of Leviticus , warns “ you shall have just balances , just weights … ”
The twenty - fifth chapter of Deuteronomy issues a similar warning : “ You shall not have in your bag differing weights , a large and a small . ”
Proverbs says the same : “ A false balance is abomination to the LORD : but a just weight is his delight . ”
Another passage says : “ Diverse weights , and diverse measures , both of them are alike abomination to the LORD . ”
All of these relate in some degree to the need for sound money and condemn the act of fraud and monetary debasement .
The consequences of monetary sin cannot be contained to the sinners only .
They are spread out all over the whole of society , destroying its economic basis and corrupting the morals of society .
They foster crazed illusions that we can magically generate wealth through the act of printing money , and the attempt to do so has catastrophic consequences .
As Mises wrote : “ Inflation is the fiscal complement of statism and arbitrary government .
It is a cog in the complex of policies and institutions which gradually lead toward totalitarianism . ”
I find it sickening that there are so few voices outside the Austrian School that will stand up to this policy .
And I fear that the consequences of this policy will be felt for many decades into the future .
There is still time to reverse course .
There is nothing inevitable about despotism .
We are not being forced down this road .
We can embrace freedom .
If we understand that freedom is inseparable from sound money , we can embrace that too .
Until then , we will continue to place our trust in the political establishment to do what is right .
Call me a gold bug if you will , but I trust hard money far more than our rulers .
And that , ultimately , is the choice we must make .

BAILOUTS : THE WOUND THAT WILL KEEP ON HEMORRHAGING
PART 1 of 2

" No one knows what to do .
We are in new territory here .
This is a different game .
We 're not here playing soccer , basketball or football , this is a new game and we 're going to have to figure out how to do it . "
Sen. Harry Reid [ D - NV ] , September 17 , 2008
It is exactly that level of ignorance in the U.S. Congress for decades that has brought America to the brink of financial ruin .
William Greider , author of Secrets of the Temple , said the same thing during his testimony , House Banking Committee , October 7 , 1993 :
" Otherwise confident and intelligent people including members of Congress - defer to the Fed 's wisdom mainly because they do not understand it .... The only players who are left out of this conversation are the American people and , to a large extent their elected representatives .
Instead , they are provided a frustrating stream of evasive euphemisms and opaque jargon and platitudinous generalities and , sometimes , even downright deception .
As more than one Federal Reserve governor confided to me , it would be very difficult - perhaps impossible - for the Fed to have an honest discussion of monetary policy with Congress or the public because the level of ignorance is so profound . "
Clearly , we have made huge strides in educating our fellow Americans about fiat currency and sound monetary policy , but without real newspapers in this country , most Americans do n't know the truth .
It 's also crystal clear that members of Congress , with few exceptions , are clue less .
I think it 's safe to say that many of those who do know , do n't have the courage to go up against the most powerful money cartels in the world ; the rest are simply crooks who profit from a corrupted monetary system .
Over the decades , Congress has been perfectly willing to forfeit their authority , violate their oath of office and the supreme law of the land as Robert Reich , former Secretary of Labor under Bill Clinton , pointed out in USA TODAY , January 7 , 1999 :
" The dirty little secret is that both houses of Congress have become irrevelant ...
In case you had n't noticed , America 's domestic policy is being run by Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board ... Congress is out of the loop .
Every so often , some senators or House members politely ask Greenspan to visit and talk about the economy .
He obliges by riding up to the Hill and muttering convoluted sentences that no two people interpret in quite the same way .
Then he goes back down to the Fed and runs the country . "
Not long after the unconstitutional Federal Reserve
Act was passed and our country was turned over to a cabal of the rich and privileged , there were congressmen who railed against this massive fraud and swindle .
Louis McFadden was one of the champions of exposing what happened by the passage of that act .
On May 23 , 1933 , McFadden launched an indictment against the robbers called banker barons :
" Mr. Chairman , we have in this Country one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known .
I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks , hereinafter called the Fed .
The Fed has cheated the Government of these United States and the people of the United States out of enough money to pay the Nation 's debt .
The depredations and iniquities of the Fed has cost enough money to pay the National debt several times over .
" This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people of these United States , has bankrupted itself , and has practically bankrupted our Government .
It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates , through the maladministration of that law by the Fed and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it ....
" The Federal Reserve Bank destroyed our old and characteristic way of doing business .
It discriminated against our 1 - name commercial paper , the finest in the world , and it set up the antiquated 2 - name paper , which is the present curse of this Country and which wrecked every country which has ever given it scope ; it fastened down upon the Country the very tyranny from which the framers of the Constitution sough to save us ....
" As Agents of the foreign central banks the Fed try by every means in their power to reduce our favorable balance of trade .
They act for their foreign principal and they accept fees from foreigners for acting against the best interests of these United States . "
In my last column , I warned we the people would be forced to sacrifice the fruits of our labors to foreign banks -- just as Congressman McFadden said in his indictment .
I told you so :
September 24 , 2008 : Fed plows $ 30 BILLION into money markets overseas .
" WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve , in coordinated action with foreign central banks , plowed $ 30 billion into money markets overseas Wednesday , part of an ongoing effort to fight a global credit crisis ... The Group of Seven countries said they welcomed the extraordinary steps by the United States to stem the crisis , including a plan for the Treasury Department to buy $ 700 billion in bad mortgages and other toxic assets held by banks and other financial institutions .
Those dodgy debts are at the heart of the crisis .
Besides the United States , the Group of Seven is made up of Japan , Germany , France , Britain , Italy and Canada . "
Of course , this " news " item never mentions the core issue of the problem , only more Band Aids and rape of the people 's pocket books .
As masters of word smith and propaganda , the privately owned FED cartel of bankers publishes numerous booklets to legitimize their existence .
This nifty , full color publication was put out by the Federal Reserve of Boston in August , 1990 .
This marvelous example of clever wording actually gives the reader some glimpse into the plan which turned into the greatest swindle in the history of the world , pg 30 : " They made it clear they wanted the Aldrich plan , with one central bank generally controlled by bankers and generally independent of government regulation . "
However , unless someone has read one of the most authoritative and fully documented works , Creature from Jekyll Island , and The Coming Battle , they wo n't understand the dry words on these pages and how they conceal a monstrous plan to loot and plunder the people 's treasury .
This is one of my favorites from the Graduate School of Business , Indiana University for the St. Louis Fed .
What this sterling little work does n't tell the reader is the real truth behind the Aldrich Plan " covered " on pages 4 - 6 .
While many believe Wilson later regretted his signature on the bottom line of the legislation creating this monster , according to John Milton Cooper , professor of history at the University of Wisconsin , author of several books on Woodrow Wilson , in an email to columnist , Andrew Leonard , " I can tell you categorically that this is not a statement of regret for having created the Federal Reserve .
Wilson never had any regrets for having done that .
It was an accomplishment in which he took great pride . "
Why would Wilson regret it ?
He was n't stupid .
Wilson knew what he was doing .
He was a player .
In an effort to inculcate the propaganda of the Fed and the wonder of fiat currency into the minds of all Americans , the Federal Reserve also distributes comic books for kids ; see selection here .
Of course , like today , the passage of the Federal Reserve Act was one of greed .
Some things never change :
" Mr. President , I deeply feel my recent affiliation with the big business interests of the country , and I appreciate the complete reform of the Republican Senators , who have had for years the opportunity of giving this country relief against big business and have never done it , and who have not only been affiliated with big business , but have been receiving campaign funds ad libitum from those very interests . "
Sen. Robert L. Owen , Congressional Record - Senate , December 23 , 1913 , page 1472
Owen 's mea culpa was short lived as we see on page 1473 : " Senator Robert L. Owen , chairman of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency , last night confirmed a report that he is to be a large stockholder in a national bank now being organized in St. Louis . "
The senator from Mississippi , Bristow continues , " In closing I desire to say that this bill contains a concentration of power that has never been lodged in any Federal officer since the Government was established .
It puts in the hands of the Secretary of Treasury and his subordinate officer , the Comptroller of the Currency , a power over the banking and currency affairs of this Nation greater than has ever been held by any man in the history of any civilized nation over the banking and currency of that nation . "
This latest bail out will take the treachery to the final end with 32 words :
" Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency .
" In short , the so - called " mother of all bailouts , " which will transfer $ 700 billion taxpayer dollars to purchase the distressed assets of several failed financial institutions , will be conducted in a manner unchallengeable by courts and ungovernable by the People 's duly sworn representatives .
All decision - making power will be consolidated into the Executive Branch - who , we remind you , will have the incentive to act upon this privilege as quickly as possible , before they leave office .
The measure will run up the budget deficit by a significant amount , with no guarantee of recouping the outlay , and no fundamental means of holding those who fail to do so accountable . " [ 1 ]
Many years ago , another brave member of Congress had this to say :
" Now , take the Panama Canal bonds .
They amounted to a little less than $ 50,000,000 - $ 49,500,000 .
By the time they are paid the government will have paid $ 75,000,000 in interest in bonds of less than $ 50,000,000 .
So the government is paying out $ 125,000,000 to obtain the use of $ 49,500,000 .
That is the way it has worked all along ...
" Now , I believe the system should be changed .
The Constitution of the United States does not give the banks the power to create money .
The Constitution says that Congress shall have the power to create money , but now under our system we will sell bonds to commercial banks and obtain credit from those banks .
We do not receive money for the bonds ...
" I believe the time will come when people will demand that this be changed .
I believe the time will come in this country when they will actually blame you and me and everyone else connected with this Congress to sit idly by and permit such an idiotic system to continue .
I have talked to the Secretary of the Treasury and members of the Federal Reserve Board and other people who are supposed to know about the money system of our country .
They know this can be done easily and conveniently , and it will save money ; but their one reply is , " It will have a bad psychological effect . "
Well , I do not think it would have a bad psychological effect to save the people 50 per cent of their national debt .
I do not think it would have a bad psychological effect to save the people over a billion dollars a year in interest .
I do not think it would .
It certainly would have a bad effect on the people who are collecting interest on the Government 's money . "
Congressman Wright Patman , Congressional Record , September 29 , 1941 , pgs 7582 , 7583
The fools in Congress handed over the Panama Canal to a banana republic with the communist Chinese running the show .
While the labor and sweat of the American people was simply thrown aside , we the people were left with more debt . [ 2 ]

Footnotes :
The conventional wisdom about Microsoft Windows Vista is that it's a mixed bag , and generally inferior to Windows XP .
Problems with Vista fall broadly into categories of compatibility , performance and usability :
 Compatibility .
The company launched Vista before the industry was ready , and during the first six months driver issues were pandemic .
This is where the reputation primarily came from .
Over time , compatibility has improved .
 Performance .
Vista is a little slower than XP .
This has been verified repeatedly in variety of lab tests .
 Usability .
Many users -- including Yours Truly -- just do n't like Vista .
Like many people , I installed it , gave it a fair hearing , then went back to XP .
Reasons why people do n't like it are well documented all over the Internet .
Microsoft officially responded to all this yesterday .
Its response ?
You 're wrong !
People really do like Vista !
To prove its point , Microsoft held a series of videotaped focus groups and told attendees -- all non-Vista users -- they would be shown a future version of Windows called " Mojave . "
First , they were asked what they thought of Windows Vista , and many comments were negative .
A Microsoft representative showed them a variety of specific features of " Mojave , " and comments were positive .
Then , Microsoft told them " Mojave " was in fact Vista , and some attendees said the Experiment had changed their thinking about Vista .
Microsoft gathered the most favorable comments and placed them on a site called The Mohave Experiment .
Problem solved !
Vista 's bad reputation has all been a big misunderstanding .
The Mojave Experiment has been compared to MTV's Ashton Kutcher show , " Punk'd , " which is a " Candid Camera " show but with celebrities .
It 's also been compared to the " Pepsi Challenge . "
Neither of these correlates well to the Mojave Experiment .
The " Punk 'd " show is about tricking people , but its aim is humor , and the enjoyment of watching celebrities squirm under stress .
The " Pepsi Challenge " is a straightforward taste test comparing one sugary drink to an even more sugary one .
Because the Mojave Experiment was designed to show that people actually like something they thought they did n't like , the perfect analogy is the Folgers Crystals commercials from the early 1980s .
In those commercials , Folgers people went to fancy restaurants and replaced coffee normally served with Folgers Crystals instant coffee .
Then a camera crew confronted the diners and asked them how they liked the coffee .
Of course , the coffee was delicious , and people were surprised to learn that they were drinking instant decaf .
( Watch the commercials here , here and here . )
The Folgers ads proved exactly the same things that the Mohave Experiment proved .
They proved that people say nice things to strangers on camera .
And they proved that you can make people say they like something if you control the conditions in which they 're exposed to it .
Folger 's " switch " commercials were apparently effective , because parent company Procter & Gamble made several of them and spent a lot of money running them on TV .
But you know what ?
Decaf instant coffee is still crap .
Nobody at Microsoft drinks Folgers Crystals instant coffee , for example .
Folgers ' " Mojave Experiment " did n't work on Microsoft , so why does Microsoft think theirs will work on us ?
Since Microsoft cast this marketing push as an " Experiment " -- i.e. , science -- I would like to hereby publicly challenge Microsoft to answer the following questions :
 The Mojave Experiment involved 120 people .
But the Web site shows 55 people saying nice things about Vista .
What did the other 65 people think ?
 Most or all Mojave Experiment videos posted to date feature an expert or marketing person showing neato features to someone .
If Vista is so great , why did n't you let people touch the computers ?
 When people were initially asked their opinion of Vista , was it clear yet that Microsoft was doing the focus groups ?
How about when asked the second time ?
( I 've personally developed and conducted many focus groups , and once you tell who is sponsoring it , everybody gets very complimentary about that company 's products . )
 Did the Mac , Linux , Windows XP and Windows 2000 users run out and buy Vista ?
If so , what do they think now ?
How about some follow - up ?
 Will you make all video footage available ( not just the favorable bits ) , at least to the press ?
How about just me ?
 How is getting people to respond to controlled demos superior to surveys of people who actually use Vista ?
The problem with Vista is not that it does n't demo well .
Vista looks great when an expert cherry picks features for you and shows them to you with a Microsoft - configured and optimized machine .
The problem with Vista is the experience of using it every day in the real world with real third - party hardware and software .
Also :
The problem with Vista is n't that its good qualities are n't good ; it 's just that its bad qualities are bad and , more important , overall it 's not as usable as XP .
Cherry - picking a tiny number of Vista 's best features and showing them to people does n't have anything at all to do with the bad features people struggle with .
Microsoft , here 's my advice to you :
Stop trying to convince us that we like something we do n't like .
Instead , just be glad millions of people do like one of your operating systems .
Bring back XP , and sell it openly as an alternative to Vista .
Meanwhile , make Windows 7 better than either Vista or XP .
If you can't create an appealing operating system , do n't think you can fix that with tricky marketing .
It 's insulting .
It 's discouraging .
And it erodes trust in Microsoft .

From buzz to reality
In 2003 , Intel announced that it was working on a technology called " Vanderpool " that was aimed at providing hardware - level support for something called " virtualization . "
With that announcement , the decades - old concept of virtualization had officially arrived on the technology press radar .
In spite of its long history in computing , however , as a new buzzword , " virtualization " at first smelled ominously similar to terms like " trusted computing " and " convergence . "
In other words , many folks had a vague notion of what virtualization was , and from what they could tell it sounded like a decent enough idea , but you got the impression that nobody outside of a few vendors and CIO types was really too excited .
Fast - forward to 2008 , and virtualization has gone from a solution in search of a problem , to an explosive market with an array of real implementations on offer , to a word that 's often mentioned in the same sentence with terms like " shakeout " and " consolidation . "
But whatever the state of " virtualization " as a buzzword , virtualization as a technology is definitely here to stay .
Virtualization implementations are so widespread that some are even popular in the consumer market , and some ( the really popular ones ) even involve gaming .
Anyone who uses an emulator like MAME uses virtualization , as does anyone who uses either the Xbox 360 or the Playstation 3 .
From the server closet to the living room , virtualization is subtly , but radically , changing the relationship between software applications and hardware .
In the present article I 'll take a close look at virtualization — what it is , what it does , and how it does what it does .
Abstraction , and the big shifts in computing
Most of the biggest tectonic shifts in computing have been fundamentally about remixing the relationship between hardware and software by inserting a new abstraction layer in between programmers and the processor .
The first of these shifts was the instruction set architecture ( ISA ) revolution , which was kicked off by IBM 's invention of the microcode engine .
By putting a stable interface — the programming model and the instruction set — in between the programmer and the hardware , IBM and its imitators were able to cut down on software development costs by letting programmers reuse binary code from previous generations of a product , an idea that was novel at the time .
Another major shift in computing came with the introduction of the reduced instruction set computing ( RISC ) concept , a concept that put compilers and high - level languages in between programmers and the ISA , leading to better performance .
Virtualization is the latest in this progression of moving software further away from hardware , and this time , the benefits have less to do with reducing development costs and increasing raw performance than they do with reducing infrastructure costs by allowing software to take better advantage of existing hardware .
Right now , there are two different technologies being pushed by vendors under the name of " virtualization " : OS virtualization , and application virtualization .
This article will cover only OS virtualization , but application virtualization is definitely important and deserves its own article .
The hardware / software stack
Figure 1 below shows a typical hardware / software stack .
In a typical stack , the operating system runs directly on top of the hardware , while application software runs on top of the operating system .
The operating system , then , is accustomed to having exclusive , privileged control of the underlying hardware , hardware that it exposes selectively to applications .
To use client / server terminology , the operating system is a server that provides its client applications with access to a multitude of hardware and software services , while hiding from those clients the complexity of the underlying hardware / software stack .
Figure 1 : Hardware / OS stack
Because of its special , intermediary position in the hardware / software stack , two of the operating system 's most important jobs are isolating the various running applications from one another so that they do n't overwrite each other 's data , and arbitrating among the applications for the use of shared resources ( memory , storage , networking , etc. ) .
In order to carry out these isolation and arbitration duties , the OS must have free and uninterrupted rein to manage every corner of the machine as it sees fit ... or , rather , it must think that it has such exclusive latitude .
There are a number of situations ( described below ) where it 's helpful to limit the OS 's access to the underlying hardware , and that 's where virtualization comes in .
Yet more commentary on the economics and politics of the financial crisis .
Noah Millman :
The temptation for Congress is going to be to horse - trade , to try to get homeowner relief tacked on to Wall Street relief  basically , to give the Treasury what it wants and ask for some other goodies in exchange .
This temptation has to be resisted .
The urgent thing is to get the bailout itself right , and not to agree to something foolish and dangerous because of panic .
The Economist :
This is a black week .
Those of us who have supported financial capitalism are open to the charge that the system we championed has merely enabled a few spivs to get rich .
But it helped produce healthy economic growth and low inflation for a generation .
It would take a very big recession indeed to wipe out those gains .
Do not forget that in the debate ahead .
Bill Kristol :
Critics would charge that in opposing the bailout , in standing against an apparent bipartisan consensus , McCain was being irresponsible .
Or would this be an act of responsibility and courage ?
Paul Krugman :
Mr. Paulson insists that he wants a “ clean ” plan .
“ Clean , ” in this context , means a taxpayer - financed bailout with no strings attached no quid pro quo on the part of those being bailed out .
Why is that a good thing ?
Add to this the fact that Mr. Paulson is also demanding dictatorial authority , plus immunity from review “ by any court of law or any administrative agency , ” and this adds up to an unacceptable proposal .
Clive Crook :
I 'm a little reluctant to second - guess the proposal put together by Bernanke and Paulson because I do n't know everything the Fed knows about the fragility of the credit markets and the urgency of the case ...
It will be interesting to see whether Congress insists on a debate of these and other alternative strategies , or concentrates merely on larding the Paulson - Bernanke approach with additional subsidies for distressed home - buyers .
Yuval Levin :
Even if Hank Paulson were the all knowing god of economics , would it make sense to give this kind of power to the treasury secretary for the next two years just forty days before an election ?
Shall we go through our mental list of who an Obama administration ( or a McCain administration for that matter ) is likely to put in that post ?
And does n’t it make sense to establish some kind of process for deciding how specifically to use the money ?
To put in place some criteria of prioritization ?
Some real - time oversight ?
Is n’t transparency crucial to the proper functioning of our modern financial system ?
And how is everyone in both parties suddenly satisfied that this approach is the only one that could work ?

ACLU , Other Advocacy Groups Express Concern After Meeting With Department of Justice
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 202 ) 675-2312 ; media@dcaclu.org
( 212 ) 519-7829 or 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
Washington , DC - Following a briefing today at the Department of Justice ( DOJ ) , the American Civil Liberties Union reiterated its deep concern over new guidelines that would govern FBI investigations .
The new guidelines would lower standards for beginning " assessments " ( precursors to investigations ) , conducting surveillance and gathering evidence , and would replace existing guidelines for five types of existing guidelines : general criminal , national security , foreign intelligence , civil disorders and demonstrations .
The rewritten guidelines have been drafted in a way to give the FBI the ability to begin surveillance without factual evidence , stating that a generalized " threat " is enough to use certain techniques .
Also under the new guidelines , a person 's race or ethnic background could be used as a factor in opening an investigation , a move the ACLU believes will institute racial profiling as a matter of policy .
The guidelines would also give the FBI the ability to use intrusive investigative techniques in advance of public demonstrations .
These techniques would allow agents to conduct pre-textual ( undercover ) interviews , use informants and conduct physical surveillance in connection with First Amendment protected activities .
" Issuing guidelines that permit racial profiling the day after the 9/11 anniversary and in the midst of an historic presidential campaign is typical Bush administration stagecraft designed to exploit legitimate security concerns for partisan political purposes .
Racial profiling by any other name is still unconstitutional , " said Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU .
" The new guidelines offer no specifics on how the FBI will ensure that race and religion are not used improperly as proxies for suspicion , nor do they sufficiently limit the extent to which government agents can infiltrate groups exercising their First Amendment rights .
The Bush administration 's message once again is ' trust us . '
After eight years of historic civil liberties abuses , the American people know better .
From the U.S. attorney purges to the abuse of national security letters , the Department of Justice and the FBI have repeatedly shown that they are incapable of policing themselves . "
Both the FBI and DOJ have documented records of internal abuse .
Recent DOJ Office of the Inspector General ( OIG ) reports confirmed long - held suspicions of widespread and systemic abuses of the national security letter statute , and the FBI 's involvement in interrogations at Guantánamo Bay .
With no outside oversight and with FBI agents acting autonomously , these new guidelines will likely lead to more unchecked abuse .
" Handing this kind of latitude to an organization already rife with internal oversight problems is a huge mistake , " said Caroline Fredrickson , Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office .
" Agents will be given unparalleled leeway to investigate Americans without proper suspicion , and that will inevitably result in constitutional violations .
Lowering the threshold for unwarranted surveillance and scrutiny allows the FBI to come perilously close to infringing on the First and Fourth Amendments .
Our right to protest the government and its policies is not suspicious behavior ; it is constitutionally protected speech .
Let 's not forget that the reason the FBI adopted internal guidelines was to combat abuse and political spying .
They are a direct result of the surveillance of Reverend Martin Luther King , Jr. and others .
To forget that legacy and adopt these ill - conceived guidelines would be a travesty . "

( CNN ) -- Sens. John McCain and Barack Obama left a White House meeting , described as at times " contentious , " with no apparent financial bailout deal worked out .
Obama , appearing on CNN's " The Situation Room " after the meeting , said there " has to be a sense of urgency on the part of everybody .
... We 've got to move rapidly . "
Obama said that there will be a deal eventually but that there is still work to do , including reaching a consensus among Bush , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and House Republicans .
McCain told ABC News on Thursday night that Republicans " have legit concerns .
Some of those have already been satisfied , such as accountability and oversight board and CEO executive pay .
Members are aware of the crisis situation that we are in . "
But , McCain said , " They do have concerns , which I think when you 're talking about 700 billion to a trillion dollars , that need to be addressed . "
Obama , who will spend Thursday night in Washington , once again railed against infusing presidential politics into the negotiations over the $ 700 billion economic bailout .
McCain 's campaign said he will also stay in the Washington area for the night .
" One of the concerns I 've had over the last several days is that when you start injecting presidential politics into delicate negotiations , " Obama said , " then you can actually create more problems rather than less . "
Watch more of Obama 's comments »
Democratic sources said that House Minority Leader John Boehner threw a wrench into the meeting when he brought up issues from conservative Republicans that negotiators thought had been settled .
But a House leadership aide said that there had been no bipartisan negotiations with House Republicans .
The aide said Rep. Spencer Bachus , who had been meeting with Sen. Chris Dodd and Rep. Barney Frank , heads of the Senate and House banking committees , had no authority to speak for them .
In a statement before the meeting , Bachus said that he had made it clear in the meeting that " I was not authorized by my colleagues to make any agreement on behalf of House Republicans . "
Boehner said that he needed more time to get agreement from House Republicans , a senior administration official said .
Obama asked whether the House Republicans ' proposals fit in with the four principles that the leadership had agreed on , but Boehner could n't answer that , a Democratic source said .
Multiple sources said McCain did n't say much .
Two Democratic leadership aides said he did n't speak until 43 minutes into the meeting .
When asked whether Friday 's debate will go on if McCain does n't show up , Obama said : " I hope he does . "
McCain also told ABC
News that he was " very hopeful that we can [ attend the debate . ]
I believe that it 's very possible that we 'll get an agreement so that I have time to fly to Mississippi . "
CNN has learned that the University of Mississippi -- site of the first presidential debate -- has been told by the Presidential Debate Commission to continue preparing for the event .
Both McCain and Obama advance teams were seen on stage going through sound and video checks from their candidates ' respective podiums .
In Washington , White House press secretary Dana Perino released a statement saying , " The president appreciates the bipartisan members of the congressional leadership and the two presidential candidates coming to the White House today to discuss how to finalize the financial rescue package .
There is a clear sense of urgency and agreement on the need to stabilize the financial markets , and prevent a massive financial crisis from affecting everybody in America . "
The statement went on to say that the group will continue to work on a deal .
But according to Sen. Richard Shelby , R - Alabama , who attended the meeting , " we will not have a deal . "
Watch iReporters react to the bailout negotiations »
The meeting included many key players : Bush flanked at the table by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Obama and McCain on opposite ends of the table , Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell also between the two presidential candidates and Vice President Dick Cheney across from Bush .
According to several Republican aides , there is still major opposition to the " agreement on fundamental principles . "
The fact that House Republicans are still not coming on board poses a major obstacle for any kind of deal .
Pelosi and other House Democratic leaders have repeatedly said that this is Bush 's bill and that he and other GOP leaders need to get Republicans to support it .
McCain , who announced Wednesday that he was suspending his presidential campaign until a bailout plan was worked out , met with some Republican House members to try to bring more of them on board to back the agreement , according to a source in the room and one who was briefed on the meeting .
The gist of the meeting , according to sources , was that these members " are n't there yet " on the plan the Senate Banking Committee worked out and say there needs to be greater protection for taxpayers .
One Republican aide said that " not much has changed in the last 24 to 48 hours .
I think it has to be pretty radically altered for House Republicans to support it . "
This aide stressed , " at the end of the day , these members represent the people who sent them here , and the people who sent them here are so overwhelmingly opposed to this . "
This aide said the calls coming into GOP offices are 90 to 1 against the plan .
Boehner , R - Ohio , has tapped a group of House Republicans to develop alternative ideas .
Earlier , Boehner released a statement that said , " I am encouraged by the bipartisan progress being made toward an economic package that protects the interests of families , seniors , small businesses , and all taxpayers . "
It 's unclear whether McCain agreed with this approach , but one aide said he put the principles " in his satchel to take over to the White House . "
Republicans recognize that there is pressure building to get something done before the end of the week .
" There sort of a tacit understanding among everyone that it has to happen before Monday , " a third GOP aide said .
Obama turned down McCain 's suggestion that they both suspend their campaigns to focus on securing a deal on a bailout plan .
He also passed on McCain 's suggestion that they postpone Friday night 's first presidential debate in Oxford , Mississippi .
Democrats fear that McCain will take credit for bringing reluctant Republicans around to agreeing with a bailout plan in order to bolster his argument that he would be a better leader in crises than Obama .
" The Democrats , of course , are very afraid that McCain is going to swoop into these delicate negotiations on Capitol Hill at the last minute and when they reach an agreement , he 's going to claim credit for having brought those negotiations to a successful conclusion , " CNN senior political researcher Alan Silverleib said .
A McCain source insists that the Arizona senator is aware of the politics involved and recognizes that Democrats -- and even some Republicans -- are wary of having it appear that McCain is brokering a deal .
CNN 's Dana Bash , Peter Hamby , Ed Hornick , Suzanne Malveaux and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report .
All About John McCain • Barack Obama • National Economy
NEW YORK - The New York Police Department is working on a plan to track every car , truck or other vehicle entering Manhattan and screen them for radioactive materials and other terrorism threats .
The ambitious proposal , called Operation Sentinel , is being developed alongside a separate $ 90 million security initiative to tighten security at the World Trade Center site and elsewhere in lower Manhattan in response to the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Police officials say Operation Sentinel would rely on license - plate readers , radiation detectors and closed - circuit cameras installed at the 16 bridges and four tunnels serving Manhattan .
About a million vehicles drive onto the island every day .
The vehicle data - license plate numbers , radiological readings and photos - would be automatically analyzed by computers programmed with information about suspicious vehicles .
Police say the system could help them intercept would - be attackers before they can do harm .
There is no estimate yet of the cost , since Operation Sentinel is in just the planning phase .
The proposal already has raised red flags among civil rights advocates .
" We think that Operation Sentinel and a lot of the surveillance initiatives that the police are planning are an attack on our right to privacy here in New York , " said Matt Faiella , a staff attorney for the New York Civil Liberties Union .
Faiella fears innocent motorists could end up in " a database of all of their movements and faces . "
Police say that law - abiding people have nothing to fear : Vehicle data deemed innocent would be purged from police records after 30 days .
Investigators need " time to maintain this information to enable us to check and see if any information has surfaced concerning a vehicle coming into the city , " Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly said .
" We do n't think people should have cause for concern . "
The proposal was contained in a security plan prepared by the NYPD 's counterterrorism division that also outlined measures already being implemented to secure lower Manhattan in the post - Sept. 11 world .
That plan calls for 116 stationary and mobile license - plate readers and 3,000 closed - circuit cameras that would be monitored by officers at a command center .
It was modeled in part after the " ring of steel " surveillance measures in London 's financial district .
" We have worked closely with London authorities , " the commissioner said .
" But I would submit this will be a much more advanced system than they have in place . "
The NYPD 's auto theft division already uses unmarked police vehicles with two roof - mounted cameras to read license plates of passing and parked cars .
Computers in the police vehicles compare the scanned plate numbers with a database of stolen and suspicious cars .
That system has assisted in the recovery of hundreds of stolen cars and scores of arrests , police said .

Jindal Signs Chemical Castration Bill
James Joyner · · 22 comments
Lousiana Governor Bobby Jindal yesterday signed the “ Sex Offender Chemical Castration Bill ” hours after the Supreme Court overturned that state ’s law allowing capital punishment for child rapists .
It “ provides that on a first conviction of aggravated rape , forcible rape , second degree sexual battery , aggravated incest , molestation of a juvenile when the victim is under the age of 13 , or an aggravated crime against nature , the court may sentence the offender to undergo chemical castration .
On a second conviction of the above listed crimes , the court is required to sentence the offender to undergo chemical castration . ”
Ben Domenech thinks Jindal is sending a suggestive message to the Supreme Court .
But , of course , the law had passed through the legislative process before the Court ’s 5 - 4 ruling , so it ’s merely a politically happy coincidence .
Of course , the Supremes court easily strike down this law on the same grounds as they did capital punishment , given that they have arrogated to themselves the sole power to decide what constitutes “ cruel and unusual punishment . ”
One could certainly argue that robbing a man of his sexuality is at least as barbaric , and certainly more unusual , than killing him .
On a side note , one imagines this will enhance Jindal ’s image with the Republican base and not a few moderates as well , thus making him a more attractive candidate for vice president .
LONDON–Call it the great global grimace : even as a new trove of international surveys show the outside world leaning more than ever toward Barack Obama , U.S. polls show Americans drifting in the opposite direction .
Into the gap between diverging opinions , Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland yesterday ignited an online firestorm of nearly 1,000 comments , with a screed titled , " The world 's verdict will be harsh if the U.S. rejects the man it yearns for . "
Writing in the left - wing British daily , Freedland described " a sinking feeling in the stomach " that the Democrats are " about to lose an election they should win .
" But what of the rest of the world ?
This is the reaction I fear most , " Freedland wrote .
" Until now , anti-Americanism has been exaggerated and much misunderstood : outside a leftist hardcore , it has mostly been anti-Bushism , opposition to this specific administration .
" But if McCain wins in November , that might well change , for it will have been the American people , not the politicians , who will have passed up a once - in - a - generation chance for a fresh start – a fresh start the world is yearning for . "
The commentary came on the heels of a new 22 - country international survey showing respondents prefer Obama to Republican rival John McCain by a margin of four to one .
Kenyan respondents favoured their ancestral son by a market of 82 per cent , according to the survey of 22,000 people conducted for the BBC World Service .
One in five of those polled said a McCain presidency would improve on the Bush administrations relations with the world .
The unprecedented fascination with Obama 's candidacy is especially acute in Britain , where it is served daily on the front pages , in sometimes befuddling ways .
Several British reports on McCain 's running mate , Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , struggled comically to define the phrase " hockey mom " to an audience that has rarely been on skates , let alone held a stick .
Other British commentators appear more mindful that rather than advancing Obama 's fortunes , outside opinion may in fact be doing him damage .
A case in point is the pushback against Russell Brand , the here - today - gone - later - today face of contemporary British comedy , who outraged many as emcee at the MTV Awards when he labelled George W. Bush a " retard and cowboy " who " would n't be trusted with a pair of scissors " in Britain .
Though virtually unknown in the U.S. , Brand 's outburst was seized upon as red meat by the American right - wing cable outlets as yet more evidence of unsavoury international meddling .
But Brand was attacked at home as well .
Writing yesterday in the Evening Standard , columnist Nick Cohen turned the tables and asked Britons how they would feel if an American comic served up similar insults in kind .

" It 's one thing to hear a fellow citizen denigrate your country , quite another for a foreigner to do the same , " wrote Cohen .
The transatlantic sensitivities extended yesterday as far as 10 Downing St. where officials close to Gordon Brown were forced to explain a pro-Obama article appearing under the prime minister 's byline in a parliamentary magazine .
Embarrassed British government sources said the article was penned not by Brown , but by a junior Labour official , and that the text had not been cleared by the prime minister 's staff prior to publication .

The first issue in bicycle security against theft is what kind of bicycle you are locking up .
A bicycle that looks like a junker can ride like a dream .
An older frame with scratched and chipped paint and nice but undistinguished - looking components is a good choice .
Let it get dirty .
Sheldon 's Mead Ranger is a good example .
That 's the original paint , or what 's left of it .
This bicycle is really old .
( 1916 ! -- maybe too old , it 's collectible , but most thieves would n't understand such subtleties .
In any case , this is n't a daily ride - to - work bike . )
If you do n't have secure parking at your workplace , or will be locking your bicycle in unsecured areas , you should have a serious lock , such as a Kryptonite .
You need not carry it home every night unless you also are locking the bicycle in high - crime areas on the way home .
The weight of a typical U - lock represents the difference between a $ 400 bike and a $ 1000 bike .
People tend to buy big , clunky U - locks because they do n't know how to use them properly .
A U - lock can go around the rear rim and tire , somewhere inside the rear triangle of the frame without looping it around the seat tube : the wheel cannot be pulled through the rear triangle .
A lock which passes around a rim makes the bicycle unrideable even if the object it is locked to can be broken or disassembled .
The best U - locks , if you must carry one on the bike , are the smallest .
The Kryptonite Mini is much smaller and lighter than the more popular models , but just as secure .
It may be even more secure , because of the limited room to put an automotive jack inside it .
It also gives less purchase for leverage - based attacks .
Some will object that felons might cut the rear rim and tire to remove a lock .
This just does n't happen in the real world .
It is possible to cut the rim with a hacksaw , working from the outside to the inside , but first , the tire must be removed or cut through .
It would be a lot of work to steal a frame without a usable rear wheel , the most expensive part of a bike after the frame .
On the other hand , a slightly longer lock would fit around the rim , and the chainstays or seatstays ... or locking from the left side might allow a smaller lock because the chain does n't get in the way ... you might need a longer lock too , for when you can't get the bike as close to a pole .
Lock the bicycle in one way or another , or at the very least disable it , whenever it is out of your sight .
Theft can occur at unexpected times and places .
John had his bicycle parked in the fenced - in back yard of a friend 's house when it a guest who left a Thanksgiving dinner early rode away on it .
A general invitation had been issued to people who attended the same church .
This person evidently did not subscribe to the teachings of the church .
A simple cable lock would have prevented this theft , and there was one in the bicycle 's touring bag ...
Some workplaces have secure bicycle parking .
You may be able to take the bicycle inside your workplace , or there may be a secured parking area .
The bike cage shown in the photos below is next to the parking - garage entrance at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston .
The entrance is under video surveillance and the door has an electrically - operated lock .
Employees enter by swiping a smart card ; others must press a button to speak over an intercom with a guard who releases the door .
Still , lock the bicycle and remove valuable items .
Lacking this level of security , you can leave a heavy lock at work , locked to whatever you normally lock your bike to .
Carry a light cable lock with you for quick errands or emergencies .
It is easily cut , but you are making a trade - off between security and convenience .
If you must lock your bike in an unsecured area , choose an area exposed to public view if possible .
You may be able to lock your bike in a praking garage in view of the attendant .
If you use both the U - lock and the cable lock , you are more than twice as safe as you would be with either of them alone .
Either type of lock can be defeated , but each requires a different large , bulky tool which is useless against the other .
The cable lock will secure your front wheel to the frame and any convenient object , and the U - lock will secure the rear wheel and frame .
If you have a quick - release seatpost bolt , replace it with an Allen - head bolt , put a cheap saddle on your commute bike , and then you wo n't worry .
The best cable locks have the lock built - in , rather than relying on a padlock .
The padlock is the weak link , easily cut with bolt cutters , the tool of choice for most bike thieves .
A new , sharp bolt cutter will cut a cable too , but an old , worn - out one will only crush a cable .
Lock to an object which would be difficult to cut or disassemble , and where the bicycle can't be lifted over the top .
Good , secure bicycle racks are becoming common these days : " dishdrainer " , wheel - bending racks are seen less often .
A thick signpost , cast - iron fencepost , parking meter post etc. is good , as long as locking there is legal : bicycles also may be removed by police and maintenance crews .
Check before locking : some posts can be lifted out of the ground , and thieves have been known to cut bicycle racks , taping over the cuts to hide them .
If you are stuck with a dishdrainer rack , lock to the end of it if you can .
If one is in a secure area , back the bicycle in : : the rear wheel , unlike the front , will hold the bicycle steady .
Lock the rear wheel to the rack and the frame to the wheel for additional security .
Face the keyhole of your lock down , so water does n't run into it .
Some locks have sliding covers for the combination dials or keyhole .
The criteria for inclusion in the leaders ’ debate is completely arbitrary .
The system to decide who gets equal treatment has never been clear , transparent , accountable , or democratic .
And yet , the Green Party played along and met all of the criteria as ever defined by a member of the broadcast consortium .
Today we were excluded from the debate regardless .
This is a shameful and irrational decision .
It is an insult to democracy .
And it is without precedent .
For the Reform party , having one seat was good enough to earn Preston Manning an invitation .
For the Bloc , creating a party mid-Parliament was enough to earn Lucien Bouchard an invitation , even though no one had ever cast a single vote for his party and his candidates were only running in one province ( on a promise of breaking up the country , no less ) .
The Greens have an MP ( who came to his new party in the same way that Bloc MPs came to theirs ) , have national support and are running candidates in every region of the country ( more than the Reform party could say ) .
So what ’s the difference between us and those other new parties that came before us ?
Was this decision made because our leader is a woman ?
Or because unlike the other parties , we have n’t traditionally spent money to advertise on the same networks that made the decision ?
I ’d hate to think those were motivating factors , and I do n’t really believe they were , but I ’m hard pressed to come up with any other key distinctions .
The only thing I ’m left with is that we ’re more of a threat than those other parties were , or perhaps that our opponents are more cowardly than theirs .
On day one of this election campaign , Elizabeth May began by saying that democracy itself was more important than any one party .
On day two , 5 unelected and unaccountable people met in secret and decided to spit in the face of the nearly 700,000 people who voted Green in the last election , the over 1 million people who say they intend to do so in the next election , the 80,000 people who have signed a petition demanding our inclusion , and the 80 % of Canadians who — regardless of whether or not they support the Green party — understand that we have earned our right to be heard .
We will fight this decision .
Not just for ourselves , but for all voters who deserve to know all of their options before they make up their minds .
Finally , I ca n’t help but feel a special amount of shame for Jack Layton .
He claims to support fair voting .
He has repeatedly run on a platform that argues the Greens deserve at least 12 seats .
And yet , today he ’s happy to hide behind a voting system that he otherwise decries as unjust .
He supports fair voting when it suits him , and ignores it when it does n’t .
That is the definition of a hypocrite and an opportunist .
When each party kicked - off their election campaigns on Sunday , Elizabeth May led supporters in a chant of “ vote , vote , vote . ”
Meanwhile , NDP supporters across the river from Parliament Hill were chanting “ Jack , Jack , Jack . ” I guess we know where their priorities are .
This section describes the changes between 0.96 and 1.0 that most users will need to make .
Change string literals ( ' foo ' ) into Unicode literals ( u'foo ' ) .
Django now uses Unicode strings throughout .
In most places , raw strings will continue to work , but updating to use Unicode literals will prevent some obscure problems .
Below is an example models .
py file with all the changes you ’ll need to make :
Remove all your inner class Admin declarations from your models .
They wo n’t break anything if you leave them , but they also wo n’t do anything .
To register apps with the admin you ’ll move those declarations to an admin.py file ; see the admin below for more details .
Remove the core argument from your model fields .
It is no longer necessary , since the equivalent functionality ( part of inline editing ) is handled differently by the admin interface now .
You do n’t have to worry about inline editing until you get to the admin section , below .
For now , remove all references to core .
Remove the prepopulated _from argument on model fields .
It ’s no longer valid and has been moved to the ModelAdmin class in admin.py .
See the admin , below , for more details about changes to the admin .
Replace your model ’s __str__ function with a __unicode__ method , and make sure you use Unicode ( u'foo ' ) in that method .
Rename your maxlength argument to max_length ( this was changed to be consistent with form fields ) :
The Admin¶
One of the biggest changes in 1.0 is the new admin .
The Django administrative interface ( django.contrib.admin ) has been completely refactored ; admin definitions are now completely decoupled from model definitions , the framework has been rewritten to use Django ’s new form - handling library and redesigned with extensibility and customization in mind .
Practically , this means you ’ll need to rewrite all of your class Admin declarations .
You ’ve already seen in models above how to replace your class Admin with an admin.site.
register ( ) call in an admin.py file .
Below are some more details on how to rewrite that Admin declaration into the new syntax .
Use new inline syntax ¶
The new edit_inline options have all been moved to admin.py .
Here ’s an example : Old ( 0.96 ) : class Parent ( models .
Model ) : ... class Child ( models .
Model ) : parent = models .
ForeignKey ( Parent , edit_inline = models .
STACKED , num_in_admin = 3 ) New ( 1.0 ) : class ChildInline ( admin .
StackedInline ) : model = Child extra = 3 class ParentAdmin ( admin .
ModelAdmin ) : model = Parent inlines = [ ChildInline ] admin .
site .
register ( Parent , ParentAdmin )
See InlineModelAdmin objects for more details .
This has long been a discussion among my peers and the industry in general .
$ 0.99 ?
$ 0.00 ? $ 9.99 / album ? $ 1.99 / album ?
All of these prices are being tried now in various guises ( OK Computer was $ 1.99 this week at Amazon.com ’s MP3 store ) .
There are very smart people conjecturing on the various benefits of each price point .
Terry McBride in a recent must - read paper for UK Media studies group MusicTank posited that $ 0.25 was a “ sweet spot ” – a position he described as a price that would draw just enough of current P2P users to legal , paid - for services to increase the volume of paid - for downloads enough to significantly increase incoming revenue for artists and labels .
Then came this piece in the LA Times – it comes on the back of Universal pulling the album of their artist Estelle off of iTunes in an attempt to create scarcity .
Estelle is one of those artists who ’s single is more important than the album – and just like the old days – Universal wants customers to buy the whole album , not just the single .
As an alternative to pulling the album , The Times piece suggests that labels should raise the price of the single to $ 1.99 .
So which is it ?
What I have to agree with is that the inflexibility that iTunes holds on price ( i.e. ONLY $ 0.99 / track ) is damaging to all parties here – customers , artists and labels .
The closest thing to real price elasticity is AmazonMP3 allowing this kind of radical price experimentation ( see the Radiohead classic album for $ 1.99 above ) , and so might be the closest thing to a real test of Terry McBride ’s pricing suggestions .
Personally , I have to lean toward Terry ’s idea of the $ 0.25 track – unless you ’re a major label act like Estelle , you ’ve no need to try and play the artificial scarcity game , even with the particular challenges that offering cheap , or even free , music presents .
So what do you think ?
What ’s a reasonable per-track price in your world ?

Shigeo Tokuda : 74 - Year - Old Porn Star
" I retired and did n't have anything to do , " says Tokuda , a former 9 to 5 travel agent .
" This is my second life .
I do n't know how long I can keep living , but I want to enjoy the rest of it . "
, a former travel agent , is enjoying his " second life " after retirement .
74 - year - old Tokuda is a porn star Gaichi Kono , an adult video director who has worked with Tokuda , says the actor is a superstar in his generation .
" He encourages older people to think , I can do this because that old man can do this .
" Ruby Productions , the Japanese company that produces Tokuda 's movies , says it is targeting the elderly audience and is considering selling videos in retirement homes
The adult film star , who lives with his wife of 44 - years and their daughter , uses the screen name Shigeo Tokuda and prefers not to disclose his real name because his wife and daughter have no clue he has starred in over 350 porn movies over the past 14 years .
Given that his films have become so popular that his name is now a brand , and his story has been featured on CNN and Time , the days of his double life may quickly be coming to an end .
Tokuda says he hopes to work until he 's 80 or older , giving it his all , he says , until the end - which may come sooner than he'd like once his wife finds out .

John McCain has again said something to cause his fellow western - state Republicans to wince at his political inexpedience and apparent naivete for the issue at hand .
And even though the Senator has now recanted and begun damage control , Democrats are hoping that this one will cost him .
Some even argue that the gaff was so severe , he may have just lost Colorado .
[ social_buttons ]
McCain told The Pueblo Chieftan last week that he wants to renegotiate the 1922 Colorado River compact to re-appropriate water from the upper basin states , like Colorado , New Mexico and Wyoming , where the river originates and give it to lower basin states like California , and his home state of Arizona .
McCain said :
“ I do n’t think there ’s any doubt the major , major issue is water and can be as important as oil .
So the compact that is in effect , obviously , needs to be renegotiated over time amongst the interested parties .
I think that there ’s a movement amongst the governors to try , if not , quote , renegotiate , certainly adjust to the new realities of high growth , of greater demands on a scarcer resource . ”
“ Over my cold , dead , political carcass , ” said Bob Schaffer , a Republican candidate for U.S. Senate .
“ The compact is the only protection Colorado has from several more politically powerful downstream states .
Opening it for renegotiation would be the equivalent of a lamb discussing with a pack of wolves what should be on the dinner menu . ”
John Redifer , political science professor at Mesa State College , said McCain ’s position makes sense in light of Arizona ’s needs , but not as a national policy .
“ I wonder if he is running for president of the United States or for something in Arizona when he makes those statements , ” Redifer was quoted as saying in the Grand Junction Sentinel .
“ I ’m really kind of surprised that someone running for president … that needs to carry the state of Colorado would make a statement like that . ”
The McCain campaign has said it will release Sarah Palin ’s tax returns and when it does , tax attorneys will have their pencils sharp and ready to go over the numbers .
Several tax accounting blogs have raised the question : should Sarah Palin pay federal income taxes on the per-diem payments that she received from the state of Alaska for nights spent in her Wasilla , Alaska , home ?
Anthony C. Infanti , a professor of tax law at the University of Pittsburg law school , raised the issue in a blog called “ Feminist Law Professors . ”
Mr. Infanti writes that if Governor Palin was not engaging in business while in Wasilla , but simply preferring to spend the nights there , then the per diem payments would be taxable income .
“ If these are really just personal expenses paid by her employer , that sounds like taxable income to me , ” Mr. Infanti wrote in his posting .
Ms. Palin received around $ 17,000 in per diem payments from the state for 312 nights she spent in her Wasilla home rather than the Governor ’s mansion in her first 19 months in office .
Per diem payments are a daily allowance to cover meals and lodging while on the state ’s business .
Kim Garnero , the Alaska director of finance , has said that the state does not consider the payments to Ms. Palin to be taxable income at the federal level .
But others , besides Mr. Infanti , differ .
One of them is Robert S. McIntyre , director of the Citizens for Tax Justice , a labor - backed group whose calculations are widely respected by tax experts .
“ It ’s obvious that the per diems are taxable income .
There ’s no question it is taxable , ’’ Mr. McIntyre said .
“ If it were not taxable , no one would pay taxes .
People would convert their salary into a per diem and no one would pay taxes .
You can deduct travel expenses when away from home .
But you cannot deduct travel when you are at home . ”
Mr. Infanti also raises another question , over the airfare reimbursements from the state for Ms. Palin ’s family members .
This gets into the issue of whether such fringe benefits are taxable income .
In his blog posting , Mr. Infanti notes that the Joint Committee on Taxation , after examining the tax returns for President Richard Nixon , concluded that Mr. Nixon should have included the value of air travel on government jets for his family members as part of his gross income .

We 'd like to see games as art .
Even those of us who'd personally rather just shoot stuff , thank you very much , realize in general that " games as art " might be a simple way to vault them into the sphere of mainstream relevance , earn them appreciation and understanding from an audience that currently , unjustly , looks down on them .
We love , of course , when games have themes and messages , when they offer the player a choice - this equates to more complexity , we feel , this places a game on level with other media that aim to make us feel .
There 's an entire segment of the audience that devotes itself to finding the emotional moments in games ; we write essays , post blogs and have forum discussions about Little Sisters , about holding hands with Yorda or getting rid of GLaDOS .
And many of us have even accepted , to some extent , that games are currently a little bit self - referential and insular .
They often tread dangerously in the direction of comic books , which by giving comic book fans only and exactly what they wanted , ended up being of interest only to comic book fans and no one else .
We see that games , as an interactive medium , have much greater potential than this .
But what happens when a game does n't create the message from inside its fictional world , but uses a message that already exists ?
What if " games as art " in the real world actually looks like something we really , really do n't like ?
Let 's talk about Invaders !.

Celebrity Offspring : Lourdes Leon ( Photos )
is the 11 year old daughter ofand her former personal trainer and actor boyfriend .
She has been photographed frequently in Manhattan while out and about with either parent .
The usual photo op these days seems to be while Lourdes is accompanying her mother to the Kabbalah Center .
She also seems to be having more outings with her father , who usually arrives on a bicycle - though the two then head out in a cab .
Lourdes seems to be a ' black and white ' fan by the looks of her wardrobe .
She is also sporting some great looking shoes and sandals - looking far more put together than her famous mother who urgently needs a celebrity stylist .
Lola , as she is called by her parents , has two younger brothers .
Rocco Ritchie , 7 , is the biological son of Madonna and her current husband Guy Ritchie .
David Banda , 2 , is their adopted son from Malawi .

Howdy !
Welcome to our vaping tribe .
We are a group of American Indians who take a keek interest in vaping .
For many years , our people have suffered under the harmful health effects of tobacco cigarettes .
We are now pushing for everyone to start vaping , as some studies have shown that it is slightly less dangerous than tobacco itself .
Our tribe recognizes that not all vaping manufacturers are created equal .
Those products from China can malfunction or cause otherwise safe eliquid to become dangerous .
We only buy our products from V2 cigs .
V2 is the # 1 vaping company in America .
All of their products are manufactured in Ohio and sold both online and in many brick - and - mortar vaping shops across America .
We like V2 because they offer coupons and promo codes , which if used intelligently , can result in tremendous savings for the end user .
Such discounts as free shipping , the VAPE4FREE program as well as money off discounts can drastically increase your savings if used regularly throughout the year .
Here are the latest Zip2save coupons for V2 cigs :
Free Credits

Save 15 %

The multiple products that V2 ecigarettes carries range in diversity from starter kits , to eliquids to vaping pens .
When purchased using the available promotional codes offered , the savings average out to anywhere from $ 10 to $ 50 , depending on the size of your order .
The key to saving money with V2 is to always pay attention to the current promos they are running .
These offers change from week to week .
On average we have noticed that they come out with new offers once every 2 - 3 weeks .
For example , a few days ago I received an email letting me know of an unadvertised deal they were running :
Spend $ 60 and save $ 10
at V2 , V2 Pro and Vapo Couture
Expires
02/28/16
There was no coupon to enter .
All you needed to do was place $ 60 worth of products into your shopping cart and $ 10 would be taken off your order instantly .
It was not advertised on their home page .
Another email that was sent a few days later showed the following discount :
Pay for 3 day shipping and get a free upgrade to 2 day .
Valid February 8th-9th
The shipping deals are usually run around holidays and weekends .
The free upgrade to 2 day shipping is an ok deal as far as we ’re concerned .
It is definitely not the best we have seen over the past few months .

Hysteria and Cyberspace Ulrich Gutmair and Chris Flor
Interview with Slavoj Zizek
Slavoj Zizek is engaged in the psychoanalytical theory of film and pop culture , covering a broad area from Hitchcock and Lynch to horror stories and science fiction .
The philosopher from Ljubljana , Slovenia became popular with his book ENJOY YOUR SYMPTOM !: JACQUES LACAN IN HOLLYWOOD AND OUT .
Recently his study on the efficiency of the phantasmatic in the new media was published , currently he is writing a text dealing with cyberspace .
After checking the abundance of titles dealing with the strange phenomena connected to the ' virtual worlds '
Zizek comes to the conclusion , that - in contrast to the popular , exoticising readings of the net - the predominant psychic economy of electronic networks is a hysterical one .
Mr. Zizek , in several essays you developed a critique of the so - called " virtualization of reality " which supposedly accompanies the development of information technologies .
Recently you talked about several notions of cyberspace at the Humboldt University in Berlin .
There is a ' collective ' notion of cyberspace that was popularized for example via the idea of The Borg in Star Trek .
The Borg seems to be something like a cybernetic insect state , combining the old image of the parasitic alien with a man-machine relationship which fuses the individual into ' One Being ' via communication devices .
This idea seems to correspond with the general trend towards a more or less predominant use of conspiracy theories to interpret the modern world ...
Slavoj Zizek :
If I understand this point of a one - mind - entity correctly , then it's a version of cyberspace I did n't mention .
I first of all mentioned the deconstructionist version of cyberspace which is this post - Cartesian one : Each of us can play with his / her identities and so forth .
This is the feminist , deconstructionist , Foucaultian version .
But as you probably know there is another , let 's call it the New Age school of cyberspace - ideology .
It is this neo -Jungian idea that we live in an age of mechanistic , false individualism and that we are now on the threshold of a new mutation ...
... the Noosphere ...
Slavoj Zizek :
Yes , that 's precisely the idea .
We all share one collective mind .
What I find so interesting about it , is the ambiguity of this fantasy :
It can be presented as the ultimate horror .
Already in the fifties the big threat of communism was the notion of brainwashing , the ability to establish " one mind " .
The best cold war paranoia movie which employs this already in an ironic way is " The Manchurian Candidate " with Frank Sinatra .
An American officer is captured by North Koreans in the Korean War and brainwashed to become a killer who kills on order , without being aware of it .
Today you still have on the one hand this negative utopian image of the collective mind , while on the other hand you have this positive New Age image .
There are two opposite versions , but what I 'm tempted to disagree with is their common presupposition , which is that cyberspace means , to put it very simply , the end of individuality , the end of Cartesian subjectivity .
All positive properties are externalized in the sense that everything you are in a positive sense , all your features can be manipulated .
When one plays in virtual space I can for example be a homosexual man who pretends to be a heterosexual woman , or whatever : either I can build a new identity for myself or in a more paranoiac way , I am somehow already controlled , manipulated by the digital space .
What you are deprived of are only your positive properties , your personality in the sense of your personal features , your psychological properties .
But only when you are deprived of all your positive content , can one truly see what remains , namely the Cartesian subject .
Only in Cyberspace do we approach what Cartesian subjectivity is all about .
You remember when Descartes elaborates the process of universal doubt .
One doubts that anything really exists in order to arrive at one 's " ego cogito " .
Descartes develops this idea saying : Let 's imagine an evil god , an evil spirit who just tricks us into believing ....
But is n't cyberspace , virtual space , the materialisation of this evil spirit ?
And it 's crucial to go through this universal doubt :
What if everything is just digitally constructed , what if there is no reality to begin with ?
It 's only when you go through this moment of universal doubt that you arrive at what Descartes means by " cogito ergo sum " .
For this reason I absolutely do not think that Cartesian subjectivity is threatened .
Instead I think , it 's only today that we are arriving at it .
The Borg story seems to develop a metaphor for cyberspace , the idea of a collective consciousness via communication tools .
On the other hand , there is your idea of the computer as an asexual complement of man , something that constitutes the Big Other .
Could n't these metaphors be applied to all electronic media or even to media in general ?
A lot of properties which are attributed to Cyberspace today could equally be attributed to television for example .
One has millions of people sitting in front of tv screens , being simultaneously fed the same intellectual or emotional ' content ' through the Big Apparatus .
Slavoj Zizek : I definetely agree with this , but I 'm tempted to say that we maybe can go even further !
This is my big thesis a propos sexuality .
What was so shocking about virtual space was not that before there was a ' real ' reality and now there is only a virtual reality , but through the experience of VR we have somehow retroactively become aware of how there never was ' real reality ' .
Reality always was virtual , we just were n't aware of it .
I think what is so horrible about virtual sex is not :
My god before we had a real partner whom we touched , embraced , squeezed , and now you just masturbate in front of the screen or you do n't even masturbate , you just enjoy knowing that maybe the other enjoys it through the screen or whatever .
The point is we become aware of how there never was real sex .
It 's not only that masturbation is having sex whith an imagined partner .
What if real sex is only masturbation whith a real partner ?
That is to say , you think you 're doing it with a real partner but you use the real partner as a masturbatory device , the real partner just gives you a minimum of material so you can act out your fantasies .
In other words there are always at least three in sex , its never you and the partner , you must have a fantasy to sustain it .
When the fantasy disintegrates , the partner gets disgusting .
It 's horror .
In Shakespeare 's " Hamlet " for example ; in the middle of the play Hamlet looks at Ophelia and has this moment of ' Realitaetsverlust ' :
What a disgusting person she is .
Because precisely what gets lost is this phantasmatic support .
I think a certain dimension of virtuality is co-substantial with the symbolic order or the order of language as such .
There is another point , which is maybe connected to the phenomenon of collective mind you evoked .
I claim one should approach the dimension of being ' undead ' .
In this precise sense that undead does n't simply mean ' alive ' , it means dead but nonetheless alive .
Think about Stephen King , zombies and vampires .
Here I connect cyberspace with what Lacan calls tissue of libido , ' lamella ' , a substance of life which cannot ever be destroyed .
The problem here is no longer mortality but the opposite :
It 's this kind of horrible life form , like that of vampires , which you can never get rid of .
The ultimate horror becomes the very ' Unsterblichkeit ' , this very immortality .
In the new text which I 'm writing now , I 'm trying to establish this impossible connection , a link between Kleist , Wagner and cyberspace .
If you read Wagner 's operas closely , the fundamental complaint , I think , the " Klage " of all the big Wagnerian arias , is the following :
Their heroes - except in Lohengrin and Tannhäuser , Wagners big failures - are not allowed to die .
This I think is the true horror of Cyberspace , that one has this spectral dimension of life beyond death , an undead life , which is even true at the most banal , everyday level .
Do you know the function ' undelete ' in computers ?
The problem with computers is not that something can be erased : you worked all afternoon and then have a power failure and it 's gone .
Okay , these things can happen .
But you know that it 's sometimes even more horrible that you cannot really erase it .
Once it 's in , it 's in .
Here I see also the problem with clonin= g .
It 's not the problem of : " Will I lose my individuality , will I be in the position of precise doubles etc . "
The problem of cloning is that you cannot ever die .
You kill yourself and they find ( ideally speaking , of course it is not yet scientifically possible ) just a little bit of you and they can reconstitute you .
You are endlessly reproductable .
Nobody knows how this will effect individuality .
You interpret the situation one encounters in front of the computer screen - for example when communicating via e-mail - as a situation of Hysteria .
There is actually a great deal of uncertainty in these forms of communication :
You can never be sure who is reading your input or in what way .
Vou are aware of this situation all the time and try to anticipate the other 's reactions .
Also , important additional features of face - to - face communication like gestures or tone of voice are missing ...
Slavoj Zizek : The Freudian unconscious is very much like what one does in front of the computer screen .
The Freudian unconscious is not all this body language or tonality , no .
The Freudian unconscious is precisely this helplessness , where you are talking to someone , but at the same time you do not even know at whom it is addressed exactly .
You are radically not sure , because basically this is a symptom .
When you have some hysterical symptom it has precisely such a structure .
So my point here would be along the lines you drew , that cyberspace often functions in the hysterical way , which is exactly this radical uncertainty : I do n't know whom my letter will reach .
=
I do n't know what the other wants from me and thus I try in advance to reflect this uncertainty .
Cyberspace is open in the sense that we cannot decide from its technological properties whether it functions in a perverse or in a hysterical way .
There is not a certain psychic economy inscribed in the functioning of cyberspace as such .
But much more often then we think cyberspace is still caught in a hysterical economy .
That 's why I distrust not only the paranoiac versions of cyberspace , I also deeply distrust the liberating version , " we play with multiple identities " and so forth .
I think , if I may simplify , that there are three or four predominant versions of cyberspace .
There is the common sense version , where we are still real people who talk to each other , cyberspace is just another medium .
This is too simple , because cyberspace of course does affect what it means to be a subject .
Then we have the paranoiac version : cyberspace , the maternal thing , we lose autonomy .
Then we have this perverse liberating notion , we get rid of patriarchal authority .
And the other one is the New Age version of the Noosphere .
People are so fascinated by phenomena which are really very exceptional .
I do n't know anyone who , when sitting in front of the computer really regresses to some kind of psychotic immersion , who becomes a member of the Noosphere , it 's not like that .
The hysterical experience is the fundamental experience .
One can read your emphasis on hysteria in this discussion as an answer to a certain kind of current left - wing politics which has been inspired by gender theory , which proposes the transgressive and therefore subversive potential of ' perversion ' ...
Slavoj Zizek : Something which makes hysteria interesting is how these modern leftist ideas share the disqualification of hysteria with radical Leninist and Stalinist politics .
It would be very interesting to find out when the signifier of the hysterical subject emerges as a swearword in Stalinist politics .
Even earlier , already with Lenin , the internal enemies , the revisionists were disqualified as hysterics :
They do n't know what they want , they doubt .
When I speak of perversion I do not mean perversion as a certain practice , for example anal intercourse .
For Lacan , perversion designates a very precise subjective attitude that is an attitude of self - objectivization or self - instrumentalization .
Whereas the typical hysterical fear is to become a tool of the other .
So the basic constituent of subjectivity is hysterical : I do n't know what I am for the other .
Hysteria , or neurosis in general is always a position of questioning .
That 's the crucial message of Freud :
The hysterical subject does n't materialize his dreams in a perverse scenario , not because he or she is afraid of repression or the law , but because he always has this doubt : I can do this , but what if even that wo n't satisfy me .
What if even this perverse scenario is a fake , a false mask .
Of course there is also a political axis to this :
My answer to some popularised version of Foucault or Deleuze which praises this multiple perverse post - modern subject with its no longer fixed paternal authority , which shifts between different self - images and reshapes itself all the time , is :
Why is this supposed to be subversive ?
I claim , and this got me into a lot of trouble with some feminists , I claim that , to put it into old fashioned Marxist terms , the predominant structure of today 's subjectivity in " Spaetkapitalismus " ( Advanced Capitalism ) or whatever we want to call it , is perverse :
The typical form of psychic economy of subjectivity which is more and more predominant today , the so called narcissist personality , is a perverse structure .
The paternal authority is no longer the enemy today .
So this idea of an explosion of multiple perversions just describes what fits perfectly today 's late - capitalist order ...
... the flexible economy .
Slavoj Zizek : Yes , you can put it that way .
No firm identity , shifting and multiple identities .
This is how subjectivity functions today .
To cut a long story short , in this sense perversion is not subversive , and the first step towards subversion is precisely to reintroduce this hysterical doubt .
I think the present social relations can fully acknowledge multiple identities .
I think that today the ideal subject is bisexual : I play with men , I play with women , anything goes and it's not subversive .
And the strategy of imagining the nastiest perversion will not create a situation which the system will not be able to sustain .
I think it 's politically wrong and I think it does n't work .
When you have a look at the art system for example : Perverse transgressions are directly organized by the establishment to keep the market functioning and alive .

Oil , sex & money : Federal agency accused of sleazy antics Memo : Federal oil lease employees had sex with industry reps
Top watchdog at Interior says one agency rife with corruption
WASHINGTON — A program director allegedly snorts crystal meth off a toaster oven .
A marketing supervisor sells sex toys to her employees , while senior executives allegedly rig contract bids for a pal .
Such is the culture the Interior Department 's Inspector General says he found at the Minerals Management Service , the federal agency responsible for handling $ 8 billion a year in revenue from offshore oil and gas leases .
As lawmakers on Capitol Hill Wednesday were taking up bills that could throw open new areas offshore to oil and gas drilling , Inspector General Earl Devaney released a series of blistering , even lurid , reports on the alleged behavior of the federal employees who deal with those offshore operators .
Agency employees , a number of whom still work for the federal government , received frequent gifts from industry players , had sexual encounters with oil and gas company employees , consulted for energy firms on the side and threw contracts to friends , Devaney found .
Devaney , who had once famously declared that " short of a crime , anything goes at the highest levels of the Department of the Interior , " spent two years and $ 5.3 million on the probe , with his investigators interviewing 253 witnesses and combing through 470,000 pages of documents .
Devaney took direct aim at the agency 's much - vaunted Royalty In Kind program — and its former program director , Gregory Smith .
The Minerals Management Service 's Royalty
In Kind program allows oil companies to pay royalties owed to the federal government in actual oil and gas rather than cash .
The agency then sells that oil and gas to other industry players .
Just last week , the agency was boasting it had received $ 63 million more in revenue for the federal government by taking royalties in kind than it would have by demanding cash .
But in a memorandum to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne released Wednesday , Devaney said his investigators had " discovered a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity in the RIK program . "
Kempthorne issued a statement reacting to the scandal today .
“ I am outraged by the immoral behavior , illegal activities , and appalling misconduct of several former and current long - serving career employees in the Minerals Management Service ’s Royalty in Kind program , " he said . "
These individuals have eroded the trust the American citizens deserve to have in their public servants . "
Minerals Management Service Director Randall Luthi promised to try to root out the problems at the agency before he leaves in January .
" We take the report very seriously , " he said , " I do n't see where the American people have been hurt , dollarwise . "
But Devaney insists a former senior executive , Lucy Querques Denett , manipulated the contracting process to ensure her special assistant , Jimmy Mayberry , received a lucrative contract from the agency when he retired .
Mayberry has pleaded guilty to a criminal charge , but the Justice Department has declined to prosecute Denett , Devaney said .
Neither Denett nor Mayberry could be reached for immediate comment .
Between 2002 and 2006 , Devaney said , nearly a third of the employees in the Royalty In Kind program received an array of gifts from Chevron Corp. , Shell , Gary Williams Energy Corp. and Hess Corp .
Devaney blasted Chevron for refusing to cooperate with the investigation .
Five Chevron employees declined to be interviewed by the federal investigators , while a former Shell employee also refused to speak with agents , one of Devaney 's reports noted .
Chevron spokesman Don Campbell said company officials " have cooperated with the government investigation and produced all of the documents that the government requested months ago , " while Shell spokeswoman Marnie Funk said the company has " cooperated fully " with the probe .
Hess spokeswoman Maripat Sexton said her company had " cooperated fully " with the investigation but found no wrongdoing by a Hess employee .
Gary Williams officials could not be reached .
Part of marketing culture
While many of the gifts were lunches and drinks , they also included golf outings , snowboarding rentals and lodging .
When asked about the gift taking , " none of the employees involved displayed remorse , " Devaney said .
Gift - giving is part of the oil and gas marketing culture , Deborah Gibbs Tschudy , deputy associate director of the agency 's Minerals Revenue Management office , told investigators .
And while Tschudy argued federal employees do n't need to accept gifts , employees in the agency 's Royalty In Kind office clearly viewed themselves as part of that world .
Indeed , one marketer described it as " the RIK way of doing business . "
Two agency employees — who Shell employees had dubbed the " MMS chicks " — conceded they had romantic encounters with men from the industry .
One had liaisons with a Shell Pipeline Co. employee and an oil scheduler for Chevron , one report noted .
But she did not " think there was a reason to recuse herself from dealing with Shell or Chevron , " the report said .
Devaney disagreed : " Sexual relationships with prohibited sources cannot , by definition , be arms - length . "
The two marketers also allegedly stayed overnight at Shell 's Dutchman Haus lodge in a Colorado resort because they had had too much to drink to get home safely .
Cocaine , crystal meth
One of the two women also owned a sex toy business on the side known as Passion Parties .
Some of her fellow employees had purchased her products , but she denied passing out business cards at work .
Some of Devaney 's harshest criticism was directed at one - time RIK program director Smith .
A former subordinate , Devaney relates , accused Smith of using cocaine , even directing her to buy these " office supplies " while at work , snorting crystal methamphetamine and engaging in sex with the employee .
The report also alleged that an environmental and engineering firm paid Smith more than $ 30,000 to market the firm to various oil and gas companies , even though those companies had business dealings with the Royalty In Kind program .
The Justice Department has declined to prosecute , Devaney noted .
Smith attorney Steve Peters said his client " was a loyal , dedicated employee of the federal government for more than 28 years prior to his retirement .
" Under Greg 's watch , profits from the RIK program totaled more than $ 150 million over a four - year period , " Peters said .
" Greg 's efforts in running the Royalty In Kind program resulted in one of the most profitable government programs in American history . "
The Devaney reports were made public as the House and Senate are considering legislation that would open portions of the eastern Gulf of Mexico , as well as the waters off the Atlantic coast from Virginia to Georgia , to oil and gas drilling .
" Little did we know how cozy the relationship between Big Oil and the administration 's regulators have been , " said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif .

[ The Americans ] have expressed displeasure over this
Defence Minister Ahmed Mukhtar
PM meets a sceptical US Pakistan says its intelligence agents have been accused by the US of alerting al - Qaeda linked militants before the US launches missile attacks against them .
Defence Minister Ahmed Mukhtar said members of Inter - Services Intelligence were accused of " tipping off " militants before strikes in the tribal areas .
Mr Mukhtar said that the Americans " mistrusted " the ISI .
His unusual public admission of the rebuke seems to mark a new low in ties between the US and Pakistan 's spies .
' Who 's in charge ? '
Mr Mukhtar was speaking in Washington , where he is accompanying Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani on his first visit to the US .
Speaking on Pakistan 's Geo TV , he said the Americans had alleged that information about targets was being " leaked " .
" The burning issue of course is as to who controls the ISI , " he said .
The ISI is accused of supporting Taleban fighters in Afghanistan " In their [ the Americans ' ] view there are some people at some level in the ISI who tip off the Taleban at some level about impending missile attacks when these are shared with the Pakistanis .
" They [ the Americans ] have expressed displeasure over this . "
Mr Mukhtar also openly admitted that President Bush had asked who was really in charge of the ISI during the visit to Washington .
The BBC 's security correspondent Rob Watson says that relations between the American Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the ISI appear decidedly strained .
Our correspondent says that the stern message apparently being delivered to Islamabad was that Pakistan has to do more to tackle ties between the ISI and Islamic extremists based in the country 's tribal areas .
American unhappiness with Pakistan 's recently - elected civilian government could also embarrass President Musharraf and the Pakistani army , in addition to raising new concerns about the stability of the nuclear - armed state .
' Great institution '
The US no longer gives Pakistan advance notice when it targets militants in tribal areas , correspondents say .
The ISI is the main intelligence wing of the army , which directs its operations , although under the law it reports to the prime minister .
Elements within the ISI have long been accused by politicians and foreign governments alike of supporting the Taleban .
On Saturday , the government said the ISI would be brought under the control of the Interior Ministry .
But the decision was revoked within hours , apparently following intervention from the army .
Alleged US missile strikes have sparked anger in Pakistan Prime Minister Gilani - whose Pakistan People 's Party has a history of run-ins with the ISI - recently called it a " great institution " .
He said that he did not believe reports that some members of the ISI were sympathetic to the militants .
On Wednesday , the New York Times reported that a senior CIA official had confronted Pakistani officials with evidence of ISI links to militants , in addition to its involvement in a recent suicide car bomb attack outside the Indian embassy in Kabul that killed 58 people .
Pakistan strenuously denied any links to the attack .
Our correspondent says that while the latest American complaints in relation to the ISI look like something of a low point , it would be wrong to write off the relationship between the ISI and the CIA .
Western security officials often say you cannot deal with violent Islamic extremists without dealing with Pakistan and you cannot deal with Pakistan without the ISI .

I have written a couple of posts about 7 - 8 months back ( here and here ) on how to call stored procedures from a rails application .
After using stored procedures in my app for a while I started to think about whether we really need them .
So over a couple of months I discussed it ( mainly short discussions about stored procedures not whether to use them or not ) with my colleagues , friends , other people and gave some thought to it .
If you are new to stored procedures then here is a sort of textbookish definition .
Stored procedures are available to applications accessing an RDBMS , they are similar to constructs seen in other programming languages and stored in database data dictionary .
Stored procedures remove the compilation overhead required for inline queries as they can be pre-compiled , hence they run faster in some cases .
However , now most RDBMS , as they evolved , implement statement caches to avoid repetitive compilation of SQL statements .
Why people think we need them ?
People , especially with database background or DBAs , are of the view that we should use stored procedures for most of the tasks involving database because they offer following advantages :
Stored procedures separate server side function from the client side , i.e , put all your business logic in stored procedures .
Stored procedures are modular and offer advantages compared to embedded queries buried within the GUI code .
They are faster , secure and maintainable Reduced network usage between clients and servers
Why people or I think we do n’t need them ?
If the application in question even has a remote chance of running on more than one RDBMS then I would just kick stored procedures out of the door because the exact implementation of stored procedure varies from one database system to another and I certainly wo n’t like to tie my app to a particular database .
Having business logic in stored procedures is not only breaking every rule of good programming but also not following the tried and trusted way of architecting n- Tier applications , i.e. separating presentation , business logic and storage / data access .
Do not mix storage / data access with logic because stored procedures are just an extension of data access tier .
As they say , use database as a very efficient file cabinet .
The only concern of a database should be to store data or persistent objects and the business logic should reside in the application code .
Database in itself is not an application you are developing , it ’s part of the layer / tier that stores data .
We use SQL in RDBMS and SQL is simply a data manipulation language hence very limited in its scope .
A programmer can do everything in the application code that can be done in a stored procedure but the opposite of this is definitely not possible .
Hence , databases are not programmable enough to include all the business logic .
If you somehow manage doing that using temp tables , inserting redundant rows into the tables , by spending ‘ n ’ number of extra hours or other hacks then you are gonna face performance / scalability issues and surely maintenance problems later in the development life cycle , i.e. a nightmarish , incomprehensible & complex POS ( piece of shit ) .
These issues will come back persistently to haunt you and your team .
Hence , the advantage 1 and part of advantage 3 mentioned above is not valid anymore .
Storing business logic in the stored procedures also leads to more work for testing compared to having them in ( Object Relational Mapping ) OR / domain model class and stored procedures / triggers make test driven development less productive .
Also , if I am using ORM then I do not need to use any SQL in my application code because the ORM will generate optimised queries for me on the fly and will also bring simplification and consistency in the coding of whole team .
Hence , advantage 2 and part of advantage 3 mentioned above is not valid any more .
Stored procedures can very easily get out of synch with the application code .
For instance , if I have different versions of my app in the source code repository and in case something goes wrong with my latest version then I can very easily switch back to an older version by simply checking out / exporting stuff from the repository .
But these facilities do not exist for stored procedures / triggers .
It ’s troublesome to have business logic residing in stored procedures because they are in the database and once you alter an existing procedure the old one is gone , hence no going back .
Now some of you may argue to keep each stored procedure / trigger in some text file and commit it to the repository with the app but that ’s again creating additional work for your team which means you are also adding chances of error / mistakes .
However , if you do this then you still have to run your stored procedures / triggers with every update that ’s again prone to mistake / errors .
When something goes wrong then stored procedures do n’t provide meaningful feedback unless you code all the exception handling within the procedure itself .
You ca n’t pass objects to stored procedures .
If you are using an ORM , and you have a class that is mapping to a table then you can simply pass the object of that class and you are good but with stored procedures you have to pass each field or object attribute as parameters and you may end up passing lots of them , may be 20 , 30,40 or even more .
Hence , you end up writing more code which essentially is more error prone and if you get a ‘ bad call ’ error then go figure what just happened .
That ’s just creating one object what if you need to add a record to 4 tables simultaneously using transaction and let ’s say each of them have 10 fields then you need to pass 40 parameters .
Change is the only constant in life , especially in the business environment .
Lets say , due to some business requirement your database schema changes and you have to add / remove columns to / from those tables .
If you are using stored procedures then you atleast need to take these steps to make sure that your application is still working fine :
Add new data vaildation rules for CRUD operation .
Change the way data presented to users and your form fields where you allow users to create / update records .
Add or remove new parameters to the stored procedure calls from your front end
Add or remove new parameters to your stored procedure definition
Add or remove new parameters to all other stored procedures or triggers from where you are calling your affected stored procedure (s ) .
If you are using ORM instead of stored procedures then you need to take these steps to make sure that your application is OK :
Add new data vaildation rules for CRUD operation .
Change the way data presented to users and your form fields where you allow users to create / update records .
That ’s it and you will also have your whole app properly version controlled so that you can switch back and forth seamlessly .
So why do you want to do something that involves more work leading to delays , increased complexity , less productivity and has more chances of error ?
Hence , stored procedures / triggers are actually a constraint in your system and according to Theory of Constraints ; generally , in any system or process there is one constraint at a time .
To improve overall system or process performance first find the constraint then improve it or eliminate the constraint entirely .
Do I need to say more ?
If you think you can use stored procedures to hide business logic , then you are definitely using stored procedure what it is not good or designed for .
I neither like putting SQL queries in my code nor have any problem using stored procedures only if they can offer me / my team / employer some measurable benefits but in my opinion an OR model is much better in terms of developer time , code , productivity and maintenance .
Using stored procedures indicates adding another layer , another language , complexity and losing database portability .
If I have an application running on ‘ n ’ number of different clients then it will be much easier for me to keep my application code synchronized and maintainable rather than the stored procedures and triggers .
Triggers pose another problem area because application does not know whether they exist hence do not even have a clue whether they have run or not .
What if you have some logic in one of your trigger and that itself may be calling another stored procedure (s ) ( again some logic on important data ) and due to one or the other problem trigger did n’t fire , you are screwed because neither you nor your application will know whether the trigger was fired or not unless your application users see some discrepancy in their data or reports , report them back to you and then you run multiple sql queries and check everything manually .
How kewl is that ?
Not for me atleast .
Having said all that , I do n’t mean the stored procedures were never useful or the advantages of stored procedures cited by DBAs were never true , yes they were true until 6/7 years ago .
But with time , new technologies come into existence , some lose their advantages and some become obsolete .
There is no point in sticking to something for which you have other better options available .

Apparently it could - at least according to research by Richard Clayton , a security expert from Cambridge University 's computer lab .
Most of us tend to assume that spammers focus on the right - hand side of our email addresses - the part after the @ .
That 's why big companies and webmail services have to filter out so much junk email : a spammer can try it on with zillions of potential victims in one swoop , simply by throwing everything they 've got at any @hotmail.com address .
However , it turns out that spammers could be more subtle creatures than we give them credit for .
A paper presented by Clayton at CEAS 2008 , the Conference on Email and Anti-Spam held last week at a Microsoft research facility in California , suggests that the text to the left of the @ also makes a serious difference to how much spam you 're likely to receive .
Analysing email traffic logs from Demon Internet , one of Britain 's biggest ISPs , Clayton saw a marked difference between people 's spam load depending on their names : specifically , those with names higher up the alphabet were more likely to get spammed than those closer to the bottom .
According to his statistics , someone called Alison may expect around 35 % of the email she receives to be spam , while Zadie may only get around 20 % - even if both use the same email provider .
The reason ?
As Clayton explains on his team 's blog , he believes it is the result of so - called " Rumplestiltskin " attacks , where spammers run through entire dictionaries , guessing at names and sending millions of emails to try and find accounts belonging to real people .
It seems that most spammers start their journeys at the beginning of the alphabet but peter out before they reach the end .
There is , he says , a genuine statistical divide between what he calls " aardvarks " - those high up the alphabetical food chain - and " zebras " - who graze at the bottom of the dictionary .
For those weary of it , he even suggests changing species - or at least picking your username more carefully .
So are Anna and Andrew doomed to a life of spam - filled inboxes and email bankruptcy , while their friends Zach and Zoe live it up free of spam ?
Not quite .
The internet 's scammers , phishers and other guttersnipes are still more likely to hit people who broadcast their email address on the web ; and , of course , there are still a few special cases .
After all , Bill Gates - who famously revealed a few years ago that he received up to 4 m junk emails every single day - may have a name that comes near the top of the Aardvark ratings - but given his prominence , it 's unlikely that the Microsoft mogul could empty his spam folder simply by switching from Bill to William .
( CNN ) --
Investigators are pursuing a variety of theories in their quest to unravel the mystery of six human feet that have washed up on the shores of British Columbia in the last 11 months .
An investigator places the shoe and the severed foot inside a container Wednesday .
The sixth foot turned up Wednesday -- a right foot in a man 's size 10 black Adidas athletic shoe , police said .
As in the previous cases , however , immediate answers as to the foot 's origin eluded detectives .
" We are exploring the possibility that it could be people who may have drowned , " said Annie Linteau , a spokeswoman for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
" It could be missing fishermen .
It could be the remains of people who may have died in a plane crash . "
When asked about the suspicion of foul play , Linteau noted that the first four feet contained no tool marks and were therefore deemed not to have been severed .
It is too early to say how the foot found Wednesday was separated from a body , and Linteau did not address the question of how the fifth foot came to be detached .
" It is certainly a very unusual situation , " she said .
" We have to explore all avenues and investigate all theories . "
The coroner 's office plans to examine DNA from the foot found Wednesday to try to identify the person to whom it belonged , she said .
The authorities also are combing through missing persons reports and trying to determine when and where the shoe was manufactured and sold .
The sixth foot was found by a woman walking on the beach , said Sgt. Mike Tresoor of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in the town of Campbell River on Vancouver Island , British Columbia .
" A local citizen walking on a beach in Tyee Spit located what appears to be human remains of a right foot in an approximate size 10 black Adidas running shoe , " police said in a written statement .
The foot will be examined by a forensic pathologist , and DNA testing will be requested , said the statement posted on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Web site .
Sandra Malone , manager of the Thunderbird RV Park and Campground on the spit , said a woman came in about 10:30 a.m. and asked her to call police , saying she had found the shoe with the foot inside it .
While waiting for police , Malone said , she walked to the beach with the woman and saw it for herself .
" You could see the foot that 's inside the running shoe , " she said .
" The leg bones were coming out of the running shoe about 3 to 4 inches .
There were no tissues or anything attached . "
Do n't Miss Fifth severed foot found on Canadian coast
She said seaweed was wrapped around the top of the running shoe , making it hard to tell whether any tissue was inside the shoe .
" I got close enough , " she said .
But she said the foot appeared to have been deliberately severed , as the bones " had been cut clean across . "
The foot was the sixth discovered on shorelines in the area since August , according to local police and media reports .
Another foot -- a left foot still in a shoe -- was found Monday on the shore of Westham Island , south of Vancouver .
Police said it was taken to a coroner for DNA testing .
" Our first step is to establish identity , " said Constable Sharlene Brooks of the Delta Police Department in British Columbia .
" It is a little mysterious , but we do n't know if it is linked to others . "
The Vancouver Sun newspaper said the first four feet found in the area were all right feet , making the foot found Monday the only left foot .
Although the gruesome finds have drawn international attention , police said it may take some time to unravel the mystery .
" We suffer from the ' CSI ' effect : People think this can happen very quickly , " Brooks said .
" It could take weeks or months .
And even if we get a DNA sample , we need a sample to match it with . "
The mystery has caused a stir and led to many rumors , locals say .
One newspaper has began investigating a rash of young men who have gone missing in the area .
Some have wondered whether the feet could belong to five men who were in a plane that crashed three years ago in the waterway where the feet were found .
Some of those men's relatives were at the Campbell River site on Wednesday .
" It 's a constant reminder every time , from the time the first foot washed up , " said Kirsten Stevens , whose husband , Dave , died in the crash .
Although her husband 's body was located , Stevens said , the other men's relatives still are awaiting answers .
They never recovered their loved ones ' remains .
" It reopens the wound every single time , " she said .
" If it 's not us , it 's somebody else 's loved one , that they do n't know .
...
We 'd like to know , " said Sally Feast , sister of pilot Arnold Feast .
" We 'd like to put something to rest . "
Diane Selkirk , a freelance writer who lives near where one foot was found , said the discoveries have been a hot topic of conversation .
" At first , the talk about it was really humorous , but as more feet turned up , the talk became sinister , " she added .
" These are pristine islands , not the place where you would expect to find a bunch of severed feet . "

Both of these letters which are being sent will be dutifully filed in the trash basket .
The " suitable outrage " hearing will be merely a posturing exercise and will have no teeth just like the recent " Bush impeachment " hearing authorized by Pelosi .
The Democrats and Conyers have known about this for quite a while now and have chosen to take no action .
Talking and whining seem to be the only actions that they can muster .
We have little to no representation from our money - driven and bankrupt Congress .
We now have a bankrupt country in a depression and that only bothers them when their own portfolios are affected as we are now seeing .

It is pathetic that Democrats can only make toothless and hollow too - little - too - late gestures with weak symbolic value at best , as if they are a marginal minority party .
Even funnier , as elections are rigged with Democrats ' de facto permission , McCain et al are actually grabbing the anti-corruption , anti-corporate welfare stance ( with a dash of new - born " feminism " ) and owning it .
President John McCain , and if he croaks ( not far - fetched considering his age and cancer battlers ) President Sarah Palin .

I hope the word gets out that this is really the last chance this nation has to end this corruption .
Words are powerful , but when they have no bite , they are powerless .
Another four years of this , and nobody will recognize the USA anymore .
Nothing is as it should be .

There have been bills in both the Senate and the House that clearly expose and oppose the " voter caging " tactics the GOP has stolen the last two Presidential elections with .
They are both mothballed .
If Conyers actually had teeth ( or cajones ) , he would have openly called for all members of both Houses to demand those bills be sent immediately to the floor for a vote .
This is more posturing from this formerly great Congressman whose time has past and he is as guilty as Pelosi and the rest of the pathetic Democratic Party non-leadership for allowing the Bushies to take us down this disastrous path without oversight and without accountability .
Impeachment could have happened , should have happened and it is n't too late for it to happen .
All that is missing is spine from the Democrats .
I wo n't hold my breath .

Stopping vote caging is very important to make sure that every citizen can cast a vote .
However , rigging the secret vote " count " is the way to take away our power to elect our leaders .
Conyers as well as the members of the House Committee on Administration , some of whom signed the letter to Mukasey , know this , yet they do n't raise that serious issue ?!?!?
For a little reminder about those on the House Committee who voted to ignore the law , the evidence , and the will of the voters , see the Brad Blog 's coverage of this travesty .
If you review the comments , you will see a copy of the motion which I filed to try to get some justice for the voters .
If these leaders wo n't follow the law and wo n't even mention the invisible elephant crushing our democracy , secret vote counting which by the way is unconstitutional as well as dangerously unreliable , then it is up to us to keep the Neo-cons from rigging the election again this year .
The best way to do that is by conducting a citizen exit poll at a few precincts in each county .
That only takes a handful of people .
We did it in Florida in January , and it helped cut back on the cheating .

Regarding foreclosures and voting , many foreclosed houses are multi-family or single - family homes that were bought and leased out to tenants by inexperienced people trying to turn a small profit .
Depending on both their lease and local / State tenant protection laws , these tenants may have the right to remain in a bank - owned foreclosed property as renters for 30 , 60 or 90 days , sometimes longer - sometimes the full six months of their lease .
Some remain in the house right through the sale to the next buyer .
( While the first owner may have foreclosed on the highly priced property , the next owner , buying at a heavy discount , yet having the tenant paying the same rent , may fare much better than the original property owner . )
So turning away people that live at the street address of a foreclosed property , even if the bank is currently the legal owner , may very well be turning away renters that live at the property and have a right to vote .

I am a 43 yr Democrat and I have a solution .
John Conyer and other spinless incumbent House Democrats are taking a huge chance that the voters will just ignore their cowardly , lazy performance .
Most voters are now more angry at the House Democrats that at Bush .
Pelosi and Conyers are risking their filibuster proof Senate and veto proof House if they continue to ignore the voters wish for action not words .
There is however so little time left in this session of the House that no one should waste time debating or writing John Conyers .
It is time for action .
We in Colorado are actively doing Negative Campaigning , Protesting and especially Negative Commenting on Newpaper Articles against incumbent House Democrats who are in tight races .
The idea is to push our incumbent House Dems to announce impeachment hearings .
We do not care if they actually get them started before the election but we want a start date announced prior to Nov 4 .
We have been pressuring Colorado Rep .
Udall for months , showing up at his public events carrying signs with messages stating : " Is Udall a traitor to his oath ? " , " Udall 's Ethics Problem : being a traitor to his oath " , " If Udall wo n't protect Your Constitution , He wo n't get you single - payer " ... you get the idea .
Colorado is a battleground state and the Senate race is so close that Al Gore has begged MOVEON to help raise money for Udall .
In our comments here in the Denver Post we challenged Udall to honor his oath and support impeachment .

This article and our comments show we are making a difference .
Al Gore joins fundraising efforts for Udall 's Senate race - Denver Post http://www.denverpost.com/election/ci_10502933
Michigan is one of the battleground states .
Voters in Michigan should target all incumbent House Democrats there but especially any in tight races .
Be ruthless in your statements .
Do n't pull your verbal punches .
Attack , but stay on only one topic , their failure to honor their oath and protect the Constitution .
If they do announce support for impeachment you can then move to support them again , since you opposed them on only one issue .
Voters in Michigan and from all other states should do Negative Commenting on political articles in all Michigan newspapers .
No matter what the topic just find a way to change the topic to Conyers and the incumbent House Democrat 's refusal to honor their oath and call for impeachment .
hound them .
All of us all across America can do this in Michigan .
Voters in the other two battleground states should do the same .
Attack all incumbent House Democrats but ruthlessly attack those in tight races for re-election or for promotion to the Senate .
ATTACK CONYERS REPUTATION .
You have one chance before the election to get his attention .
Have some guts .
Do it !
We believe that the Democrats will win the Presidency and majorities in the House and Senate .
We also believe that we voters can afford to lose one or two seats in order to teach the Democrats to do their job .

JOHN H KENNEDY , DENVER CO :
These are very good tactics .
Negative commenting can , at the very least , stir the pot and , at best , trigger some action .
Hopefully , some of this negative commenting includes a call for the candidate ( should the Democrats retain control of the House ) to reject Nancy Pelosi 's bid for re-election to House Speaker or anyone of her ilk such as Steny Hoyer .
We need someone who cares about doing what is necessary to serve the public interest and not their selfish interests .

Mukasey is an Alberto Gonzo clone , he does what addington , cheney , and bu$ $ hCo minions tell him to do and nothing more .
The bu$ $ hCo US Justice Department is a tool to help the Rethug Party escape justice - and a weapon to decimate the Demos with malicious prosecutorial harassments - justice has been transformed into just - us and fuck the De-moc - RATS and the fair enforcement of the rule of law .

in their early ballots to addresses out of State .
Have you heard about this , and if so , what can we do to stop this practice ?

Microsoft gets more crap than any other company in tech .
That 's partly because it 's given us garbage like Clippy , Microsoft BOB and Windows Vista .
And it 's partly because it 's arguably the most important company in personal computing .
Sure , Apple gets all the fawning press for designing pretty , easy - to - use gadgets .
But Microsoft is rarely credited for being why mainstream tech has come this far - a computer on every desk , the explosion of the internet , even the idea of a common UI across applications .
Even smarmy Mac and Linux snobs have a lot to thank Microsoft for , even if they do n't want to .
Advertisement
1. Windows is on the vast majority of the world 's computers , creating a virtually ubiquitous platform that anyone can develop for .
That actually breeds innovation and development .
Yes , Microsoft fosters innovation .
While it 's much easier for griefers to be mean if everyone 's on the same platform , that ubiquity gives us a common ground to drive forward on .
Advertisement
Stan Seiler , senior docent at the Computer History Museum , credits Microsoft for creating the common UI concept - " a common look and feel across multiple applications , " something that " could n't be pioneered until somebody had a whole suite of applications , " which Microsoft was among the first to do .
They dragged third - party developers into following it as well , and voila , now most stuff works and looks the same across an OS .
2. Microsoft is basically responsible for the two - button mouse .
Will Smith from Maximum PC ( but not quite Hancock ) gives the Gates machine props for really bringing the mouse to business computing with " the one - two punch of Windows 3.0 and Office . "
More than that , it created a simple standard for two - button mousing : left - click equals action , right - click equals choices .
Love your scroll wheel ?
( I do . )
Microsoft , baby .
Apple 's mouse philosophy is just silly .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
3. Microsoft popularized the concept that software has value and is worth paying for it .
Seiler says " it might sound obvious ... but it was an important change in the mindset of people . "
No one had done it on the scale Microsoft did .
Today this leads to some weirdness :
There 's a different price for each version of Windows .
But this theoretically based on how much value Microsoft think is packed into each version of Windows ( you can debate this , of course ) .
But unless you 're a freetard , you probably do n't think the idea itself of paying for software is insane .
4. Microsoft 's intimidation leads to innovation .
The flipside of Microsoft 's scale and success is that everyone hates them .
( Duh . )
While this sometimes results in unproductive pissing and moaning , it often drives companies to try to outdo the behemoth , after which Microsoft strives to catch up before getting leapfrogged again .
This process benefits everyone .

The most famous example is the Browser Wars .
Netscape Navigator pushed Internet Exploder forward ( not only feature - wise , but leading Microsoft to bundle it with the OS , a big step in and of itself ) before IE killed it and achieved a virtual browser monopoly .
Years later , Firefox rose from Navigator 's ashes to strike back at IE , which resulted in Browser War II and drove us to the point of internet awesomeness ( and Web standardization ) we 're at today .
( Not to mention , as Smith points out , mainstreaming TCP / IP in Windows 95 made it much easer and cheaper to get on the internet in the first place . )
So , while Microsoft is now a super - bureaucratic organization that may well be in need of soul , innovation and originality , the truth is , its very unsexiness is why tech and computing are as exciting as they are today .
Microsoft 's early years provided the foundation and tools , and today it provides technology 's version of The Man to outsmart and outdo , which will make tomorrow as good as it's gonna be .

Obama camp : McCain's ' stunt '
Obama 's camp , after sniping at McCain 's " suspension , " dismisses it this evening as a stunt in a memo to the press :
So make no mistake : John McCain did not “ suspend ” his campaign .
He just turned a national crisis into an occasion to promote his campaign .
It ’s become just another political stunt , aimed more at shoring up the Senator ’s political fortunes than the nation ’s economy .
And it does nothing to help advance this critical legislation to protect the American people during this time of economic crisis .
Full text after the jump .

John McCain sought to change the subject from his out - of - touch response to the economic crisis with a big announcement that he was “ suspending ” his campaign .
But the only thing McCain really wants suspended is the American people ’s disbelief .
In fact , he ’s been in full campaign mode the entire time .
Instead of heading to Washington right away , Senator McCain stuck around in New York to do TV interviews , spend the night , and give a scheduled speech .
Though the McCain campaign announced yesterday that they were also “ suspending ” their attack ads , they continued to run Thursday .
When McCain finally arrived in Washington , almost twenty - four hours after his announcement – and after Congressional leadership announced a deal in principle – he huddled with his lobbyist campaign advisors while his running mate held a political rally and his political spokesmen and surrogates were out in full force , continuing to attack Barack Obama .
So make no mistake : John McCain did not “ suspend ” his campaign .
He just turned a national crisis into an occasion to promote his campaign .
It ’s become just another political stunt , aimed more at shoring up the Senator ’s aimed more at shoring up the Senator ’s political fortunes than the nation ’s economy .
And it does nothing to help advance this critical legislation to protect the American people during this time of economic crisis .
THE FOLLOWING CLIPS TELL THE STORY :
McCain Arrives After Deal Announced by Leadership , Continues to Huddle with Campaign Advisors .
* McCain's " Straight Talk Air " landed at National Airport just after noon , and McCain 's motorcade sped toward the Senate .
But by then , senior Democrats and Republicans colleagues were already announcing that a deal in principle had been reached .
[ WaPo , 9/25/08 ]
* “ McCain met with congressional leaders earlier today and has now returned to his Senate office .
But it 's increasingly implausible to think that what he 's doing is anything different than he'd be doing on the campaign trail , except he 's in person now instead of on his cell phone .
Take this latest pool report below from the Trib's Jill Zuckman , which basically confirms that he 's conferring with his closest political and policy advisers : Sen.
McCain left his lunch in the Capitol at 1:50 pm and returned to his Russell Senate office with Sen. Lieberman and Rick Davis .
Your pooler asked him if he was making any progress and he said something I could n't hear too well , but seemed friendly and basically nonresponsive .
So your pooler said that I would be around all day and if there 's anything he'd like to tell me I 'd be happy to hear .
That got a laugh from Lieberman and a " thanks , Jilly " from McCain .
As I type , Sen. Graham and Doug Holtz - Eakin have entered the Senate office . ”

McCain Campaign Surrogates Continue to Attack Obama On Television .

[ TPM , 9/25/08 ]
* “ McCain 's campaign cease - fire apparently does n't extend to some surrogates and the Republican National Committee … Adviser Nancy Pfotenhauer , responding to the Obama camp taking credit for the bailout deal adopting some of his suggestions , said on Fox News Channel , ‘ This is maybe perhaps part of the pattern that we 've seen before where Senator Obama would claim that the housing bill came out of his committee -- and he did n't even sit on the committee .
or that the stimulus package was his package and even his Democratic leader said that it was n't . ’

[ Politico , 9/25/08 ]

McCain Campaign Offices Continue Normal Campaign Activity .
* “ The Huffington Post called up 15 McCain - Palin and McCain Victory Committee headquarters in various battleground states .
Not one said that it was temporarily halting operations because of the supposed " suspension " in the campaign .
Several , in fact , enthusiastically declared the continuation of their work .
Others had n't even heard that the candidate for whom they were devoting their time had officially stopped campaigning . ”
[ Huffington Post , 9/25/08 ]
* “ So , I called as well , and was told specifically that " volunteer activities are still ongoing " and that people are welcome / encouraged to come in and do so . ”
[ Raising Kaine , 9/25/08 ]
Governor Palin Held a Press Avail and Campaign Rally .
* “ A local Philadelphia NBC News affiliate was reporting Thursday morning that Mr. McCain ’s running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , was to hold a rally at the airport in Philadelphia upon her arrival there this afternoon .
The most recent official schedule for Ms. Palin , which the campaign distributed late Tuesday night , did not include an airport event . ”
[ NYT , 9/25/08 ]
* “ Although the McCain campaign said Palin was suspending her activities - McCain on Wednesday called a halt to his campaign to deal with the financial markets rescue plan being negotiated by Congress and the Bush administration - Palin was heading to Philadelphia for a rally at the airport . ”
[ AP , 9/25/08 ]
* “ On Thursday , despite the McCain - Palin campaign saying they would suspend campaigning until Congress had dealt with the financial crisis , Ms. Palin made a campaign stop at ground zero in Lower Manhattan , and finally “ fielded ” four questions , according to a reporter in the small pool of journalists assigned to accompany her . ”
[ NYT , 9/25/08 ]
* “ The decision to have Palin hold her first avail ever today of all days is either brilliantly cynical or ( in my opinion more likely ) a sign of how little coordination there is this completely candidate - led campaign .
As one senior aide put it recently : " It would n't be a McCain campaign if knew what we were doing . "

' There Are Too Many Problems , and They Keep Happening , ' Notes County Supervisor After Voting to Approve the Hand - Audit Canvass , Even Following Discovery of Missing Ballot Bag Seals ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/15/2008 , 9:50 am PT
Following up on the arrest last week of Pima County ( Tuscon ) , Arizona , election integrity advocate John Brakey ...
You 'll recall , he was arrested after noticing that some 7 out of 10 bags of ballots being counted during a post- election audit last week were missing their proper security seals .
As an election observer representing both the Libertarian and Democratic parties during the hand - count audit of a Sept. 2nd state Primary , Brakey began to ask questions about the bags --- which had supposedly been chosen at random the day before --- prompting Pima 's Brad " Election Director Gone Wild " Nelson to call the sheriff on him .
Despite the missing seals ( which even Nelson admitted to himself , as seen in the Channel 9 - KGUN video report we posted with our original coverage of the incident ) , the Pima County Board of Supervisors went ahead and certified the election canvass anyway , " over the objections of activists who wanted the county to wait until an additional hand audit could be conducted over the weekend , " according to the Arizona Daily Star .
" The supervisors said they were very concerned about persistent problems in the Division of Elections , but they could not legally postpone the canvass , " the paper reported over the weekend .
That , despite a news conference that Brakey and the other activists held late in the week to call for a new audit , using properly sealed ballots , " and focusing on contested supervisor races , of which there were three . "
They have also called for the removal of the beleaguered , hot - headed and perhaps even criminal Nelson , after years of problems and obstructions from the Pima Election Director .
According to the Daily Star , at least one of the Supervisors agrees it 's time for Nelson to to be removed ...
Supervisor Ann Day said after the meeting that she thought Nelson needed to go .
" We 've taken a lot of security precautions , but there are too many problems , and they keep happening , " she said .
" I think we 've reached a point where we need a change in leadership .
There needs to be trust between the public and the Division of Elections . "
Finally , in the video at the right , John Brakey ( whom we regard as a hero for his tireless , non-partisan work as a citizen patriot and election integrity advocate ) makes an impassioned --- if ultimately unsuccessful --- plea to the County Supervisors on Friday , asking for a new audit , and detailing some of what happened during the audit that led to his arrest .
Brakey and the other trans - partisan Pima advocates have had a number of successes of late , including a recent court victory which resulted in the release of previously - proprietary Diebold databases , documenting how voters voted in a number of recent ( and questionable ) local elections .
The release of those databases came over the objection of both Nelson and Diebold , who had claimed they needed to stay under wraps for " security " reasons .
The activists believe there was fraud in at least one of those elections .
The judge ultimately ordered what is said to have been the largest release of such material in the history of the nation .
The big threat to growth in the next decade is not oil or food prices , but the rising cost of health care .
The doubling of health insurance premiums since 2000 makes employers choose between cutting benefits and hiring fewer workers .
Rising health costs push total employment costs up and wages and benefits down .
The result is lost profits and lost wages , in addition to pointless risk , insecurity and a flood of personal bankruptcies .
Sustained growth thus requires successful health - care reform .
Barack Obama and John McCain propose to lead us in opposite directions -- and the Obama direction is far superior .
Sen .
Obama 's proposal will modernize our current system of employer - and government - provided health care , keeping what works well , and making the investments now that will lead to a more efficient medical system .
He does this in five ways :
- Learning .
One - third of medical costs go for services at best ineffective and at worst harmful .
Fifty billion dollars will jump - start the long - overdue information revolution in health care to identify the best providers , treatments and patient management strategies .
Hi all ,
It 's been quite a while since I wrote my last article here on flipcode .
It almost looks like everything has been documented or something ; I rarely see anything new these days .
Maybe that 's because of the rather fast development of hardware 3D accelerators and CPU speeds : I think this caused a rather important switch from ' technical knowledge ' to more ' theoretical knowledge ' , a switch that many coders find hard to make .
A decade ago , you were the king if you knew how to do a specific effect with a VGA card .
Five years ago , you where da man if you understood BSP trees .
Nowadays , it 's hard to be above average .
A game is good if its art looks ( and sounds ) good ; the code behind it is important , but expected to be OK .
Expectations are the key problem here .
If someone posts an IOTD with some nice graphics , no - one is going to encourage the poor guy to actually write a game with it .
The reason is simple ; encouraging someone to design a space game based on a space 3D engine is the same as saying 'hey , get a large team , write a product design , lead the team and then you 'll have a game that kicks ass ' .
You 're not going to get away with a simple game anymore .
People expect more .
Too much , actually .
Even the breeding grounds of the game industry , the demo scene , suffers from this .
No longer do technological masterpieces automatically win contests , like they used to .
I know , ' spot ' is a technological masterpiece , and I 've seen more , especially 64Kb intros .
Nevertheless , demos , just like games , require relatively little technical knowledge , and lots of good art .
The hard part of winning a demo compo is no longer writing this amazing optimized inner loop ; instead it has become a management and networking contest .
The true hardcore coder is introverted , weird , primarily technologically interested and thus has major problems keeping up with the pace of nowadays game and demo coding .
He thus tries to find interesting areas that still require his skills , and his skills alone , and he finds his destiny in obscure challenges like emulators , 64Kb ( or even 4Kb ) intros and other platforms like the GameBoy or the Playstation .
Coding like that is still rewarding , but there 's a problem :
The latest consoles are as powerful as yesterday 's PC's , and the latest handheld consoles are as powerful as yesterdays consoles .
That means that tomorrow , a calculator or a watch will be the only area that 's still worth some good old hand optimized assembler .
Poor coder .
After the watch and the calculator , he will be finally extinct .
So what do we do ?
There are two solutions :
One , we adapt and start writing code that works on everything , focused on features rather than speed of one specific core feature .
Or two , we slowly adapt because we have to earn a living , and we identify interesting territory so we can have some fun in our spare time .
I go for the second option .
Here are some areas that are still interesting , and require extreme coding and optimization skills .
They also require no artistic skills , so that you can do it all by yourself , locked away in your computer room with some pizza and coke .
1. 64Kb intros .
They can be fun , but for this to work , we need to make some agreements .
First : Software rendering is cool .
Hardware rendering too , but only if it's more than just polygon stacking .
Second : Using public domain textures is OK .
Third : Generated textures are the best .
Just like generated meshes .
Third : Lowres is cool .
2. Emulation .
Can be very easy , but only when the emulated device is at least 8 times slower than the ' host device ' .
Try to emulate an SNES , and you start to have problems .
No artistic talents are required , and you get to play lots of games for ' testing purposes ' .
3. ' Lower devices ' .
PDA 's are cool .
So are some programmable calculators and the GameBoy .
Especially if you use them to emulate even older devices , or if you write 4Kb intros for them .
4. AI .
Did you know that AI is really in it 's infancy ?
And I do n't mean that deterministic kind of AI that is used in games ; I 'm talking about natural behavior , natural language , real logic , that sort of stuff .
5. Puzzles .
There are some challenges out there that could use some brain and cpu power .
A good example was the recently solved ' Eternity ' puzzle ; the man who solved it won 1 million pounds ...
There must be more .
Let me know if you have good ideas .
In the meantime , I 'll elaborate on the above fields in more detail in a series of articles that I intend to write in the next couple of months .
I hope that you will find something that is interesting enough for you to spend some quality time on .
The emphasis will be on low - level technological knowledge ( not neccessarily provided in the documents ) and optimization ; the goal is to find good reasons for writing good code .
By the way , if you know anything about the following subjects , I would like to invite you to write a doc about it .
I know nothing about these subjects , but I would really like to read a decent doc about them :
1. GameBoy programming
2. Real - time raytracing
Let 's have some fun . :)

MI6 spy-turned - author John Le Carre reveals : ' I was tempted to defect to the Soviet Union during the Cold War '
Soviet spy ? : John Le Carre was ' tempted ' by the Iron Curtain
Author and former spy John Le Carr was tempted to defect to the Soviet Union during the Cold War , he revealed yesterday .
The 76 - year - old , who wrote his first three books while working as an MI6 agent , admitted he was curious to know what it would be like working for the Russians .
When Le Carre whose real name is David Cornwell , was asked if he was genuinely tempted to switch sides , he said : ' Yes , there was a time when I was , yes .
' I was n't tempted ideologically .
But when you spy intensively and get closer and closer to the border . . . it seems such a small step to jump . . . and find out the rest .'
Le Carre has written 21 books , seven of which have been made into films , including The Spy Who Came in from the Cold and The Constant Gardener .
His novel Tinker , Tailor , Soldier , Spy was a BBC television hit nearly 30 years ago , with Alec Guinness playing the lead role of George Smiley .
The author also revealed that he turned down the chance to meet Kim Philby in 1987 , the double agent who betrayed him by giving his name and those of other British spies to the Russians .
' I just could n't do it , ' Le Carre told The Sunday Times .
' There was always an instinct towards corruption in him .
' And remember , he was responsible for sending countless British agents to their deaths , to be killed - 40 or more in Albania . '
Le Carre who lives with his wife in Cornwall and has 12 grandchildren , rarely gives interviews but is famously candid when he does .
He had a public spat with writer Salman Rushdie after dismissing the Booker Prize winner 's novel The Satanic Verses as an affront to Muslim sensibilities .
He suggested it was entirely predictable that it would endanger those connected to its publication .
In another interview Le Carre said it will take Britain more than a century to become a multicultural society .
Discussing his recent novel , The Mission Song , in which he writes that racial and social inequality is still rife , he said : ' I wanted to show how hypocritical it is that we call ourselves a rainbow society and say that everyone is equal , or that we do n't notice what colour others are , which I think is absolute bull ****.
' With our racial biases , it 's going to take us at least a century of education before we integrate people . '
He also writes openly on his official website , where he scorns those who call him a ' spy turned writer '
' I was nothing of the kind ' , he says .
' I am a writer who , when I was very young , spent a few ineffectual but extremely formative years in British Intelligence . '
He adds : ' I never knew my mother till I was 21 .
I act like a gent but I am wonderfully badly born .
My father was a confidence trickster and a jail bird .
I hate the telephone .
' I can't type .
I ply my trade by hand .
I live on a Cornish cliff and hate cities .
Three days and nights in a city are about my maximum .
' I do n't see many people .
I write and walk and swim and drink . '
Le Carre 's latest novel , A Most Wanted Man , is released later this month .
By now , everyone gets that subprime loans are a disaster .
What people are beginning to wake up to is that an ostensibly " safer " form of mortgage , Alt - A , could be just as bad .
Calculated Risk analyzes the difference between the two and argues that Alt - A , sometimes perceived as less risky , actually can be even more so :
Residential mortgage lending never , of course , limited itself to considering creditworthiness ; we always had " Three C's " : creditworthiness , capacity , and collateral .
" Capacity " meant establishing that the borrower had sufficient current income or other assets to carry the debt payments .
" Collateral " meant establishing that the house was worth at least the loan amount -- that it fully secured the debt .
It was universally considered that these three things , the C's , were analytically and practically separable .
The principal difference between subprime and Alt - A lenders was that each lender would go after a borrower with a different emphasis on the " C's " :
Subprime lenders would target people with poor creditworthiness , but high capacity and collateral .
Alt - A lenders would target borrowers with high creditworthiness , but low capacity and collateral .
In other words , the m.o. of a subprime lender was to find borrowers with relatively high income who had missed payments in the past and gradually re-establish their creditworthiness .
They would then use that reestablished creditworthiness to continually refinance the loan .
The m.o. of Alt - A lenders , meanwhile , was to take people with low incomes and low levels of debt , but a good history of paying said debt , and saddle them with more debt :
The utter fraudulence of the whole idea of Alt - A involves the suggestion that people who have managed debt in the past that was offered to them in the past on conservative " prime " terms must therefore be capable of managing debt in the future that is offered to them on lax terms ...
Think of it this way : subprime borrowers had proven that they could n't carry 50 pounds , so the subprime lenders found a way to restructure their debts so that they were only carrying 40 .
Alt - A lenders took a lot of people who had proven they could carry 50 pounds and used that fact to justify adding another 50 pounds to the burden .
As long as house prices kept rising , and borrowers could keep refinancing on agreeable terms , everything was peachy .
But then house prices stopped rising .
The most pressing question for mortgage lenders and investors , therefore , is whether financial services firms will eventually have to take the same kind of losses on their Alt - A books as they have on their subprime books .
If they do , get ready for another Bear Stearns .

Barack Obama 's tax advisers recently posted a piece in the Wall Street Journal about their candidate 's tax plans .
Their article was designed to triangulate , painting their candidate as a tax cutter and the Republican opposition as a secret tax raiser .
It was well written and well argued — not that you can really trust anything you read about what candidates will or will not do once in office .
In any case , I was discussing the piece with a person whose politics are certainly left of center .
She said to me something along the following lines :
I 'm really not sure I understand all this tax talk .
The government taxes us to get money to do what it wants to do .
But it seems like what they do — whether going to war or funding new projects — is never discussed in terms of money they have or do n't have .
I mean , Bush cut taxes , right ?
And the reduced revenue should have restrained him .
But he spends on whatever he wants .
The tax cuts did n't seem to reduce his power at all .
Why is this ?
It 's a good question .
Why is it that talk of tax policy does n't seem to have a relationship to policy generally ?
Whether it's a bailout of subprime mortgage holders , large investment banks , or going to war , whether or not the resources exist to do these wonders rarely enters into the equation .
Why is it that tax cuts do n't curb the government ?
And why do politicians not feel the need to tax us more when they spend more ?
You might at first say that the answer is simple : they just go into debt by running an annual deficit .
And the debt today stands at some figure that has no real meaning , because it is too high for us to even contemplate .
What does it really mean that the debt is $ 5 trillion or $ 10 trillion ?
It might as well be an infinite amount for all we know .
At least that 's how the political class acts .
Reference to the debt only begs the question .
You and I have to pay our debts .
We can not run up an infinite amount of it without getting into trouble and losing our creditworthiness .
In the private sector , debt instruments are valued according to the prospect that the debts will be paid .
The likelihood that it will be covered is reflected in the default premium .
But the debt of the US government does n't work that way .
The bonds of the US Treasury are the most secure investment there is .
It is valued as if it will be paid no matter what .
If not through taxes , and if not through infinite debt , how is it that the US government gets the money it wants regardless of other constraints ?
The answer here comes down to the monetary regime , a topic that causes eyes to glaze over but which is central to why the government seems completely out of control .
It is not difficult to understand if we think of how a criminal with a counterfeiting machine might behave .
Would we see fiscal restraint ?
Of course not .
If a person could create all the money he needs or wants with a printing press , we would expect unlimited profligacy .
This is precisely what the Federal Reserve does .
It not only acts as the guarantor of the liquidity of the banking system but also functions as the guarantor of the entire government financial system .
Given this , it is hardly surprising that there seems to be a strange disconnect between tax policy and spending policy .
The politician is n't concerned about it any more than the counterfeiter worries about the bills coming and going .
They know that the money is going to be there if they need it .
This is not only bad policy in general , but it introduces an occasion of sin for the political class .
It is too much to ask of anyone to be financially disciplined if he has the capacity to create out of thin air all the money he wants .
What is the downside of this type of regime ?
The bills are ultimately paid by you and me in the form of price increases for goods and services .
To make the connection here , imagine the value of money is like lemonade : the more water you add to the fixed amount of lemon juice , the weaker it becomes .
We tend to think of inflation as the price of things going up , but in fact inflation is nothing more than a decline of the purchasing power of money itself .
There are other consequences , too .
The way the Fed creates money involves manipulation of the interest rate .
But the market rate of interest serves a purpose .
When it goes up , it rewards saving and discourages borrowing .
When it goes down , consumption and investment spending receive a subsidy .
When the Fed feeds the popular desire for low interest rates , it is injecting newly created money into the system in a way that creates investment bubbles .
These bubbles can be a symptom of a larger problem , namely , the business cycle itself .
Those of a historical bent will note that today 's monetary system has features that are essentially unprecedented in American history .
The dollar is not backed by anything other than the promise of the state .
There is no gold or silver or anything else that the paper represents .
Nor is the paper in your wallet convertible into any other monetary unit but more paper .
The system we have now is about 35 years old , and it began after Richard Nixon declined to pay foreign dollar holders in gold .
That was the final end of the gold standard .
With that action , he inaugurated the new age of paper money — and ever since , the rate of inflation , the wild swings of business activity , and the growth of government have been completely out of control .
It was a disastrous decision , but the unsurprising culmination of a long process of monetary destruction that began just before World War I when the Federal Reserve was created .
How might money work in a perfect world ?
We have to look back at earlier times and see that central banks are not necessary .
Banking , like any business , can be a market institution and manage itself just like the shoe or coffee industry .
Money need not be paper , which can be infinitely reproduced .
It can be gold and silver , which have a fixed supply .
When the government wants to spend money , it has no choice but to persuade people to fork over the money .
The citizenry , under these conditions , tends to pay closer attention to what its masters are planning .
With sound money and no central bank , the debate over our country 's future would take on new meaning .
Politicians would feel the constraint — the same as all individuals .
It would be a more peaceful world , surely , with far less political meddling at home and abroad .
And we might actually start taking public affairs seriously again .
I suppose that when most of us who are fortunate not to have been the victim of sexual assault hear the word " rape kit " , we tend to think of it specifically in terms of forensic analysis and examination -- DNA collection , trauma , that whole sort of thing .
But rape kits also contain ... emergency contraception .
To quote from an Alaska blogger who has provided a firsthand account of the aftermath of a sexual assault in Wasilla :
I sat with a rape victim during the " harvesting of evidence " .
Mascara smeared eyes stared blankly out from a cave of shame .
" We 've got swimmers , " announced the forensic tech in the lab next door .
My friend did n't look surprised .
In her 60's , she was still asked if she felt the need for emergency contraception .
Surviving the process would have only been compounded and made worse with an itemized bill ; victimized twice courtesy of Sarah Palin and the city of Wasilla .
The rape kits that Sarah Palin had a direct role in forcing women to pay for contained emergency contraception .
Back in 2000 , Governor Knowles of Alaska signed a bill that required cities in Alaska to pay for rape kits for victims -- primarily owing to outrage over Wasilla 's practices .
As the article indicates , this bill was opposed by the Police Chief of Wasilla :
Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon does not agree with the new legislation , saying the law will require the city and communities to come up with more funds to cover the costs of the forensic exams .
" In the past weve charged the cost of exams to the victims insurance company when possible .
I just dont want to see any more burden put on the taxpayer , " Fannon said .
Now , if you 're really a law - and - order conservative and you 're willing to spend a couple of million on legal fees to get a sports complex for your town of 9,000 , there 's no real reason not to have taxpayers foot the bill for the $ 14,000 maximum annual cost for rape kits , right ?
Turns out there is .
From the same frontiersman article :
The new bill would also make law enforcement agencies that are investigating a sexual assault responsible for the costs of testing victims for sexually transmitted diseases and emergency contraception .
( emphasis mine )
But it gets even better .
As our own DemocraticLuntz has reported , the McCain campaign 's answer to troopergate is that Palin fired Monegan not because of personal reasons relating to state trooper and former Palin brother - in - law Mike Wooten , but because Monegan lobbied Congress for an earmark that Palin did n't request or approve of .
And what was that earmark ?
The McCain campaign says it can prove Monegan was fired in July because of insubordination on budget issues
...
The " last straw , " the campaign said , was a trip Monegan planned to Washington in July to seek federal money for investigating and prosecuting sexual assault cases .
In a July 7 e-mail , John Katz , the governor 's special counsel , noted two problems with the trip : the governor had n't agreed the money should be sought , and the request " is out of sequence with our other appropriations requests and could put a strain on the evolving relationship between the Governor and Sen. Stevens . "
Now , as you can read in DL 's diary linked above , Sarah Palin claimed that she was opposed to forcing rape victims to pay for an evidence - gathering test .
DL says that Palin 's consistent opposition to getting public funding for rape kits puts the lie to that .
Unfortunately , it does n't .
It 's just that Palin 's words are very carefully chosen :
Palin spokeswoman Maria Comella said in an e-mail that the governor " does not believe , nor has she ever believed , that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence - gathering test . "
" Gov. Palin 's position could not be more clear , " she said .
" To suggest otherwise is a deliberate misrepresentation of her commitment to supporting victims and bringing violent criminals to justice . "
Sarah Palin has absolutely no problem with the state paying for evidence gathering .
But the problem is that a rape kit is far more than evidence - gathering .
A rape kit also tests for STD's and provides emergency contraception at state expense .
The line that Sarah Palin toed was basically this : no way , no how , no public funding at the municipal , state , or federal level for rape kits that contain emergency contraception .
But investigation costs , she says ?
No problem .
And what 's so bad about emergency contraception ?
Well , a lot of radical pro-life groups view emergency contraception as tantamount to abortion on the grounds that it runs the risk of preventing the implantation of a fertilized ovum , which religious nutballs apparently view as the equivalent of murder .
As a matter of fact , the right - wing nutcase online rag WorldNet Daily specifically mentions the " emergency contraception = abortion " line in its article defending Palin about the rape kit controversy .
Here 's the article byline :
MATTERS OF LIFE AND DEATH
Palin attacked over rape - kit controversy
Alaska law forces taxpayers to fund ' emergency contraception '
as if to question the validity of the term " contraception " in referring to Plan B .
One of the organizations promoting this view is none other than Feminists for Life , which proudly lists the fact right on its frontpage that one of its members , Sarah Palin , is a Vice - Presidential nominee .
The Feminists for Life organization has long maintained ( warning : PDF ) that emergency contraception is no better than an abortion .
And , of course , how often have you heard the term " taxpayer - funded abortion " as a right - wing talking point ?
The fact is , one of the main goals of the right wing fundamentalist has been to oppose any government assistance for any program that might provide funding for abortions .
This forms the basis of George Bush 's so - called Mexico City Policy -- rescinded by Clinton and re-enacted by George Bush - - forbidding any taxpayer money going to any program that funds pregancy termination , no matter what adverse consequences may result .
In sum : the only possible reason behind Sarah Palin 's consistent refusal to fund rape investigation kits with taxpayer money is that they contain emergency contraception , which her religious fundamentalism views as tantamount to an abortion , and she , like George Bush , is a firm believer in the Mexico City policy .
Is there proof ?
Not in so many words .
But Occam's Razor demands that we look for the simplest possible explanation .
And it seems like this is it .

Data from Japan 's widely condemned scientific whaling programme suggests a loss of fat over the past 20 years may be due to climate change , but some claim the research is unethical
Over two decades , Japanese ships have butchered thousands of whales taken from the icy waters around the Antarctic in the name of research .
Campaigners and politicians condemn the practice as unethical and unnecessary , and say Japan 's " scientific " whaling programme is commercial whaling by another name .
Now , Japan 's scientists claim their controversial whaling programme has produced a key finding .
Measurements taken from more than 4,500 minke whales slaughtered since the late 1980s reveal the animals have lost significant amounts of blubber , and are getting thinner at a worrying speed .
The team says its study offers the first evidence that global warming could be harming whales , because it restricts their food supplies .
And they say the discovery could only have been made by killing the animals .
Crucially for the Japanese , the results have been published in a mainstream western scientific journal – a move that has dismayed campaigners , who say it could offer scientific whaling a veneer of respectability , and bolster Japan 's efforts to hunt more whales .
They fear Japan could use the results to support efforts to hunt endangered humpback whales for the first time in 50 years .
The study claims the recovering humpback population in the Southern Ocean could also be hurting the minkes because of " interference " between the two species as they compete for food .
Lars Walloe , a Norwegian whale expert at the University of Oslo , who helped the Japanese team analyse the data , and is listed as an author on the new study , said : " This is a big change in blubber and if it continues it could make it more difficult for the whales to survive .
It indicates there have been some big changes in their ecosystem . "
Whales rely on their thick layer of blubber for energy and as insulation against the cold water .
The shift could already being making it more difficult for them to reproduce , Walloe said .
" I do n't think you could measure this by other [ non lethal ] means . "
Alternative methods to sample blubber , such as ultrasound and biopsy darts , have been developed .
But Walloe said it was not practical to use them on the required scale with minke whales , which are also difficult to approach .
He said the Japanese findings , and their publication , had been unpopular among scientists from nations opposed to whaling , including Britain .
Two journals refused to print the findings before they were accepted by Polar Biology , which published them online last month .
Walloe , who says he does not support the current ban on commercial whaling , claimed that the journals that turned down the study did so for political , not scientific , reasons .
This is not the first time that the Japanese scientific whaling programme has published results , but these are the most high - profile findings so far .
In 2005 , Australian scientists analysed the 55 scientific papers produced by the programme and said only a handful were relevant and required the whales to have been killed .
The others included descriptions of bizarre experiments to cross-fertilise whales with sheep and cows .
The new study analysed measurements taken from 4,689 adult whales killed by the Japanese whaling fleet between 1988 and 2005 .
It found that blubber thickness and overall fat weight had decreased by 9 % over the period , which it called a ' substantial decline " .
Girth of the animals was down 4 % .
The study says : " This is the first time a long - term decline in energy storage in minke whales has been demonstrated . "
It also demonstrates the brutality of whaling , which the paper describes as carried out using " explosive harpoons and a large calibre rifle in the event that death was not instantaneous " .
Several of the dead whales had to be excluded from the new analysis because their blubber was too badly damaged to be measured accurately .
Mark Simmonds , director of science at the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society , said : " Lots of dead bodies will provide robust data , so if you kill lots of whales then you will be able to get some information .
The question is whether the benefits outweigh the number of whales killed and how they were killed .
Scientific whaling is not about science , and there is no pressing conservation need that requires it to be done . "
He said the results should not have been published on ethical grounds .
" Journals need to think very carefully about information that comes from this source .
Different journals have different ethical standards . "
The editors of Polar Biology could not be reached for comment .
British whale scientists were reluctant to discuss the research , which one described as " very worrying if true " .
Walloe said the decline in blubber was down to shrinking numbers of Antarctic krill , a shrimp - like crustacean at the heart of the food chain .
The amount of blubber lost is roughly equivalent to 36 fewer days of intensive summer feeding .
Krill numbers in the water around the rapidly - warming Antarctic peninsula have collapsed by about 80 % since the 1970s .
This is blamed on the loss of sea ice , which provide shelter and food for krill .
The study says the impact of global warming on the minke whales is unclear because no similar krill measurements have been made in that region of the Southern Ocean .
But it claims that competition for krill from other predators such as the humpback must also be " considered as a likely explanation " .
Science and slaughter
Japan 's scientific whaling programme , known as JARPA , began in 1987 following the moratorium on commercial whaling .
Japan says its research is aimed at overturning the ban , by providing evidence that stocks could be hunted in a sustainable way .
Critics say it is limited commercial whaling in disguise because the meat is sold for food , and that whales do not need to die to provide the required information on population numbers and structure .
Until 2005 , Japan killed up to 440 minke whales in the Southern Ocean each summer .
Recently it has doubled that quota , and last year said it would hunt dozens of endangered fin and humpback whales for the first time in decades , until it backed down " temporarily " under intense political pressure .
Until now , the most high - profile claim from the programme was that whales should be killed to conserve fish stocks – an idea ridiculed by fisheries experts .
The two men who claim they 've bagged Bigfoot would not reveal the location of the hairy corpse , adding further fuel to skeptics who claim the report is a hoax .
Georgia residents Matt Whitton and Rick Dyer said at a news conference Friday in Palo Alto , Calif. , that they no longer know the location of the body , having put it in the care of sasquatch seeker Tom Biscardi , who runs the Searching for Bigfoot , Inc. website .
The two men tried to make their case in front of a skeptical audience as they told a story of stumbling across the corpse in the woods of northern Georgia .
Whitton revealed they had not only found a body , but had also seen several other creatures running in the woods .
When asked what the creatures sounded like , Whitten , an officer on medical leave from the Clayton County Police Department , said they did not make a noise .
" They were silent , " he said .
Whitton and Dyer have so far offered three different tales about how they came to find the creature :
In one , the animal was shot by a former felon , and the men followed it into the woods .
In a second version , they found a " family of Bigfoot " in North Georgia mountains .
In the third , the two were hiking and stumbled upon the corpse with open wounds .
Biscardi vowed that DNA evidence would vindicate the men .
But he later said that one of the three samples sent for examination came back as human DNA , another was inconclusive , and a third came back as the DNA of a possum , which he said could have been from something the Bigfoot ate .
Even before the three men took the stage , skeptics who had seen the photographs of what looks like a furry creature in a freezer were not impressed .
" What I 've seen so far is not compelling in the least , and I think the pictures cast grave doubts on their claim , " Jeffrey Meldrum , a Bigfoot researcher and Idaho State University professor , told Scientific American magazine .
" It just looks like a costume with some fake guts thrown on top for effect . "

Coding at its most fun is exploratory .
It 's exciting to try your hand at something new and see how it develops , choosing a route as you go along .
Some poeple like to call this " expanding your ignorance " , to convey that you cannot decide on things you do n't know about , so first you have to become aware - and ignorant - of them .
Then you can tackle them .
If you want a buzzword for this I suppose you could call this " impulse driven development " .
spiderfetch was driven completely by impulse .
The original idea was to get rid of awkward , one - time grep / sed / awk parsing to extract urls from web pages .
Then came the impulse " hey , it took so much work to get this working well , why not make it recursive at little added effort " .
And from there on countless more impulses happened , to the point that it would be a challenge to recreate the thought process from there to here .
Eventually it landed on a 400 line ruby script that worked quite nicely , supported recipes to drive the spider and various other gimmicks .
Because the process was completely driven by impulse , the code became increasingly dense and monolithic as more impulses were realized .
And it got to the point where the code worked , but was pretty much a dead end from a development point of view .
Generally speaking , the deeper you go into a project , gradually the lesser the ideas have to be to be realized without major changes .
Introducing the web
The most disruptive new impulse was that since we 're spidering anyway , it might be fun to collect these urls in a graph and be able to do little queries on them .
At the very least things like " what page did I find this url on " and " how did I get here from the root url " could be useful .
spiderfetch introduces the web , a local representation of the urls the spider has seen , either visited ( spidered ) or matched by any of the rules .
Webs are stored , quite simply , in .web files .
Technically speaking , the web is a graph of url nodes , with a hash table frontend for quick lookup and duplicate detection .
Every node carries information about incoming urls ( locations where this url was found ) and outgoing urls ( links to other documents ) , so the path from the root to any given url can be traced .
Detecting file types
Aside from the web impulse , the single biggest flaw in spiderfetch was the lack of logic to deal with filetypes .
Filetypes on the web work pretty much as well as they do on your local computer , which means if you rename a .jpg to a .gif , suddenly it 's not a .jpg anymore .
File extensions are a very weak form of metadata and largely useless .
Just the same with spidering , if you find a url on a page you have no idea what it is .
If it ends in .html then it 's probably that , but it can also not have an extension at all .
Or it can be misleading , which when taken to perverse lengths ( eg. scripts like gallery ) , does away with .jpgs altogether and encodes everything as .php .
In other words , file extensions tell you nothing that you can actually trust .
And that 's a crucial distinction : what information do I have vs what can I trust .
In Linux we deal with this using magic .
The file command opens the file , reads a portion of it , and scans for well known content that would identify the file as a known type .
For a spider this is a big roadblock , because if you do n't know what urls are actual html files that you want to spider , you have to pretty much download everything .
Including potentially large files like videos that are a complete waste of time ( and bandwidth ) .
So spiderfetch brings the " magic " principle to spidering .
We start a download and wait until we have enough of the file to check the type .
If it 's the wrong type , we abort .
Right now we only detect html , but there is a potential for extending this with all the information the file command has ( this would involve writing a parser for " magic " files , though ) .
A brand new fetcher
To make filetype detection work , we have to be able to do more than just start a download and wait until it 's done .
spiderfetch has a completely new fetcher in pure python ( no more calling wget ) .
The fetcher is actually the whole reason why the switch to python happened in the first place .
I was looking through the ruby documentation in terms of what I needed from the library and I soon realized it was n't cutting it .
The http stuff was just too puny .
I looked up the same topic in the python docs and immediately realized that it will support what I want to do .
In retrospect , the python urllib / httplib library has covered me very well .
The fetcher has to do a lot of error handling on all the various conditions that can occur , which means it also has a much deeper awareness of the possible errors .
It 's very useful to know whether a fetch failed on 404 or a dns error .
The python library also makes it easy to customize what happens on the various http status codes .
A modular approach
The present python code is a far cry from the abandoned ruby codebase .
For starters , it 's three times larger .
Python may be a little more verbose than ruby , but the increase is due to a new modularity and most of all , new features .
While the ruby code had eventually evolved into one big chunk of code , the python codebase is a number of modules , each of which can be extended quite easily .
The spider and fetcher can both be used on their own , there is the new web module to deal with webs , and there is spiderfetch itself .
dumpstream has also been rewritten from shellscript to python and has become more reliable .

Quick :
When 's the last time you checked your e-mail ?
If you 're like most Americans , the answer is likely within the last 15 minutes -- even if you 're not at work .
And if you carry a PDA in your pocket , your problem is probably far worse .
Some doctors estimate more than 11 million people have e-mail habits that interfere with their lives .
Are you one of them ?
Forming a deep relationship with your inbox can eat away at your real - life relationships -- you know , the ones with your friends , kids , or significant other ... those people you used to converse with face - to - face .
The good news , though , is spotting an e-addiction and correcting it is n't too tough .
First , recognize the signs :
You check your e-mail more than once an hour , even when you are n't on the clock .
You look at every message that comes in , as it comes in , either at or away from the office .
You feel the need to respond to messages instantly or within minutes of when they arrive .
You interrupt real , in - person activities on a regular basis to deal with e-mail .
E-mail has , in some way , interfered with your regular life -- be it in the form of sleep loss , relationship troubles , stress , or any other noticeable effect .
If you 're still here and have n't toggled windows to check your inbox , here are some tips to help curb your electronic enslavement :
1. Remember , there 's no such thing as an e-mail emergency .
Remind yourself that no e-mail is going to self - destruct if you do n't read it right away .
If something is incredibly urgent , the sender will call , text , or otherwise reach you .
2. Give yourself a curfew .
Treat yourself like a teenager .
Decide on a specific cut - off time for sending and reading messages , and stick to it .
If you get home at 6 , commit to shutting down the computer at 7 .
You 'll thank yourself in a year when your real life has returned .
3. Schedule e-mail times .
Set specific times during which you 'll deal with e-mail , and do n't do it outside of those windows .
Maybe it 's 10 minutes in the morning , 10 minutes at lunch , and 10 mid-afternoon .
Stick to it and watch your day suddenly open up with extra time .
4 . Set aside a " NO E - MAIL " day .
A bigger break from the ol ' send - and - receive might just be the best thing to cure your compulsion .
A once a week change in routine can help you keep things in perspective , both psychologically and biologically .
" Response prevention is the thing that 's most helpful , " Dr. Robert Gore , a Beverly Hills psychologist specializing in addiction , explains .
" You do n't do the thing that you find compulsively appealing .
Once people learn that , their brains actually change on a biological level . "
If you can't cope with taking a full day off , try only checking your e-mail for five minutes Saturday morning -- then leaving the rest of the day e-free .
5 . Take a vacation .
Once you 're ready to really kick things up a notch , schedule yourself a full week away from electronics .
It 's just what the doctor ordered .
" I think most people in the world could really benefit by having a day that 's completely free of any electronic mediation -- to sort of get back to things that are more natural , more deeply fulfilling than all these electronic gadgets , " Gore says .
The final step may be the toughest of all , but it could make a world of difference :
Put the damned Blackberry down .
Turn your PDA off when you get home , or at least disable the instant e-mail checking function .
Your messages will wait .
Your life will not .
Thoughts ?
Questions ?
Shoot me an e-mail .
Odds are , I 'll respond within two minutes ... regardless of the time or day .
Palin disinvited from Iran rally
The organizers of an anti-Iran rally Monday rescinded their invitation to Alaska Governor Sarah Palin after Democrats protested that her presence would turn the event into a political rally , McCain campaign and Jewish community sources said .
The Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations created a political tempest by inviting Palin to speak without clearing her invitation with another speaker , Senator Hillary Clinton .
Clinton promptly dropped out of the event , saying it would be seen as unduly political .
The McCain campaign then pressed Senator Barack Obama to join Palin on the stage in a show of unity against Iran .
The Obama campaign in turn offered to send Congressman Robert Wexler of Florida -- who had harshly attacked Palin for slender ties to Pat Buchanan -- to the event .
But the appearance that the non-partisan group was aligning with the Republican ticket put the group and its president , Malcolm Hoenlein , under heavy pressure from Jewish Democrats , including members of the conference , members of Congress , and the liberal group J Street , not to give Palin a platform , sources said .
Hoenlein told the McCain campaign that he would have to rescind Palin 's invitation or cancel the rally .
The organizers , I 'm told , have formally disinvited all elected and political officials , but the move was about Palin .
" In order to keep the focus on Iranian threats and to ensure that this critical message not be obscured , the organizers of the rally have decided not to have any American political personalities appear , " the Stop Iran Now coalition said in a statement .
" This issue , opposition to a nuclear - armed Iran , is one which enjoys bipartisan support and the backing of the American people across the political spectrum .
On this , all Americans stand together .
We acknowledge and deeply appreciate those American political leaders who have been and remain prepared to stand with us as we collectively address the dangers of Iran 's nuclear program and its support for terrorism globally . "

STATEMENT FROM THE ORGANIZERS OF THE RALLY TO STOP IRAN NOW
From The National Coalition to Stop Iran Now
( New York , Sept. 18 , 2008 ) ---
The purpose of “ THE RALLY TO STOP IRAN NOW ” on Monday , Sept. 22 , 2008 , is to protest the presence of Iran ’s President Ahmadinejad at the United Nations , and to oppose his nuclear weapons program .
We take most seriously his threat to wipe the United States and Israel “ off the map ” and believe the world leaders gathered at the United Nations must act with resolve to prevent a nuclear armed Iran that would be a threat to this country , Israel and the world .
For this reason , tens of thousands of people of every faith and ethnicity are expected to hear messages from prominent religious and civic leaders , including Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel and Israeli Knesset Speaker Dalia Itzik .
In order to keep the focus on Iranian threats and to ensure that this critical message not be obscured , the organizers of the rally have decided not to have any American political personalities appear .
This issue , opposition to a nuclear - armed Iran , is one which enjoys bipartisan support and the backing of the American people across the political spectrum .
On this , all Americans stand together .
We acknowledge and deeply appreciate those American political leaders who have been and remain prepared to stand with us as we collectively address the dangers of Iran 's nuclear program and its support for terrorism globally .
We hope that the world leaders gathered at the UN will hear this message and resolve to act decisively against the Iranian nuclear program by implementing UN and Security Council resolutions and sanctions .
We again call on all concerned Americans of every background to join us at the " RALLY TO STOP IRAN NOW " on Monday , Sept. 22 , at 11:45 A.M .
Signed :
The National Coalition to Stop Iran Now

Just how close is the United States to becoming a police state ?
The events at the Republican National Convention , where 800 arrests took place , can answer part of that question .
Those arrests dwarfed the 152 arrests at the Democratic National Convention .
The history of the U.S. since its emergence as a superpower in the 20th century addresses the rest .
St. Paul , Minnesota served as a testing ground for “ riot ” control during the Republican National Convention .
Both protesters and members of the media were beaten and jailed without discrimination or consideration of their First Amendment rights to assemble and for the press to report the news .
The great majority of protests were peaceful .
Police used sticks , percussion grenades , tear gas , pepper spray and preemptive raids to create the aura of total control of the area around the convention site .
Merely by their appearance in the heavy , daunting gear of S.W.A.T. ( Special Weapons And Tactics ) teams , that made them seem as figures out of a science fiction movie , could they create fear among those gathered to protest the convention .
( Historically , the origin of S.W.A.T. units came from Los Angeles as a response to the black militant organization , the Black Panthers , in the late 1960s . )
One member of the local police described the preemptive raids on the headquarters of one protest group as “ awesome . ”
Some members of the police in St. Paul used restraint .
One encouraged protesters to “ speak your minds . ”
None of this rose from the ashes , as the mythological Phoenix , but was developed from policies that have grown up with the emergence of the U.S. as a superpower and now the only remaining superpower .
( Article continues below )
When anarchists “ threatened ” the status quo in the early part of the 20th century there were the Palmer Raids .
The activists Sacco and Vanzetti are the most notable symbols of that era , with striking similarities to the anti-immigrant movement of today .
Many unwanted immigrants who were political were deported .
During World War II Japanese - Americans were rounded up and placed in internment camps in the West .
The next historical epoch produced Senator Joseph McCarthy and the witch - hunts aimed at those with Leftist beliefs and politics or affiliations .
Suspected Leftists in the government and their associates were hounded relentlessly .
Again there had to be sacrificial lambs , and the federal government found them in Julius and Ethel Rosenberg , both executed as spies condemned for passing the so - called secret of the atomic bomb to an ally , Soviet Russia .
The evidence from the trials of both Sacco and Vanzetti and the Rosenbergs show gross prosectorial misconduct , and in the case of Ethel Rosenberg , no evidence of any wrongdoing !
The era of the 60s and early 70s saw the F.B.I. ’s program of counterintelligence named COINTELPRO ( Counterintelligence Program ) , but its precursor was the unbridled hostility of the F.B.I. and local law enforcement agencies in the Deep South toward activists in the civil rights movement .
Anyone who sided with civil rights activists in communities was subject to the most violent vigilante acts .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Both Nixon and Agnew were understudies to Ronald Reagan in using the government ’s police power against protesters .
Reagan had honed his anti-activist credentials as a snitch while president of the Screen Actors Guild .
When assuming the office of governor in California , he immediately went to work against the Free Speech Movement at the University of California ’s Berkley campus , vowing to “ clean up the mess in Berkley . ”
Reagan ’s hostility to protesters and the right of free speech were refined when he assumed the presidency .
He gave one of his advisers , Colonel Oliver North of the infamous Iran - Contra affair , the role of using the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( F.E.M.A. ) in developing guidelines for imposing martial law , suspending the constitution , establishing internment camps and giving the president and F.E.M.A. the sole responsibility of running the government in “ emergencies . ”
The Miami Herald reported on July 5 , 1987 that the director of F.E.M.A. , Louis Guiffrida , appointed his deputy , John Brinkerhoff , to deal with the martial law portion of F.E.M.A. ’s new policy by initiating a plan to use interment camps to hold militants during the imposition of martial law .
The planned camps were primarily aimed at jailing black militants .
Not a great deal changed in policy , or was enforced , until the terror attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The Patriot Act and several presidential orders allowed the government to spy on “ dissidents ” within the U.S and collect information on ordinary citizens , all in the name of detecting foreign terror suspects .
All that was needed was suspicion in order to be added to the terrorist watch list .
Phone companies were given authority to eavesdrop on ordinary Americans in addition to suspected terrorist groups and individuals .
These telecommunication giants were given retroactive immunity in pursuit of these policies of the federal government .
The wedding of the Department of Homeland Security and F.E.M.A , following the September 2001 terror attacks raises serious questions as to the extent a future president could impose extrajudicial policies against protesters .
Watch lists , so prominent historically in societies where official political extremism is in control of the government , came as no surprise and have nefarious possibilities in a government that feels threatened by its opponents .
Anyone taking part in legal demonstrations could see the effects of these new police powers at street level .
Protesters were harassed at peaceful demonstrations , arrested , and demonstrations themselves were subjected to intense scrutiny and official harassment .
At one demonstration I attended just prior to the beginning of the Iraq War protesters were forced to march in the streets of New York City behind closely guarded police barricades .
When an inevitable bottleneck formed stalling thousands of protesters , the police moved in and arrested anyone attempting to get around the bottlenecks and barricades .
The routes of protest marches were carefully controlled by government officials , resulting in one march being forced to stop several blocks away from its intended objective at the United Nations .
In a 1995 interview in Z Magazine , Israel Shahak , an Israeli professor of chemistry and a writer said : “ The conclusion is that human society is composed of a mass of ordinary people who can become exterminators , but who in their ordinary lives are completely usual people , of a minority which protests , and a minority which plans murders and enjoys murder . ”
His conclusions are not much different from those Hannah Arendt reached in The Origins of Totalitarianism ( 1951 ) .
Arendt focused on the gross political abuses of Stalinism and Nazism .
Which direction the U.S. will travel on the road to the further erosion of both the First and Fourth Amendments is perhaps already etched into both official and unofficial policies of the government .

I am bored .
Bored of the word " innovation " , and the way it is bandied about by every tech vendor .
I do n't know how they keep straight faces , maybe they actually believe their own bushwah .
There are very few that demonstrate any actual innovation .
I would say that Apple leads the industry ; Intel , AMD , and Google are also on my " actually push the boundaries and do neat new things " list .
Our favorite software monopolist innovates new extremes of bullying , thuggery , and extracting top dollar for overlapping licenses and pooware , so I do n't think that rates inclusion .
I have another list , and this is a much more fun list .
It is a large list that is always growing .
We could also include the free BSDs - FreeBSD , NetBSD , and OpenBSD , whose contributions to Linux and FOSS are well - deserving of more recognition .
This is " What Linux Can Do That Those Big Ole Proprietary Innovators Can't " .
Improve with age .
Any well - maintained Linux release improves with age - no need to do the silly periodic wipe - reformat - reinstall dance
Debian ( and perhaps some other distributions ) has a reliable upgrade path , so you can upgrade to new releases indefinitely without ever having to do a clean new installation
Supports more hardware than other operating system , except perhaps NetBSD , from tiny embedded devices to specialized kiosks to routers , network gateways , notebooks , desktops , workstations , servers of all sizes , mainframes and clusters
Sane , reliable , secure , flexible networking .
Dozens of different tools for remote administration , filesharing , helpdesk , and mobile working
Can boot from anything : 3.5 " diskette , CD , DVD , USB flash drives , USB hard drives , netboots
Bootable live media for portable Linux-ing , troubleshooting and repair , and new release previews .
( I get a special kick out of repairing Windows with a SystemRescueCD - Windows ' own repair tools are very inferior )
CLI and GUI live harmoniously side - by - side
Includes advanced block - device management such as software RAID and Linux Volume Manager
Variety of high - quality high - end filesystems
Variety of virtualizers that are n't crippleware
Good system and network administration utilities
One - click system updates and upgrades without fear
Customizable automated network installations
Secure - able all by itself - no guaranteed membership in the WorldWide Botnet , no need to lard down a perfectly good Linux system with anti-malware crud that 's expensive , marginally effective and a drag on performance

UCSD Star Cave
That 's just off the top of my head .
I 've been administering mixed networks since I was a wee baby geek , and the longer I 'm in this business the more I appreciate Linux , FOSS , the BSDs , and GNU .
I think this demonstrates one of my favorite sayings ( one of the perks of being a old coot is you get to go around spouting aphorisms ) :
You do n't get good results from bad values .
There is a famous Charles Babbage quotation that expresses a similar idea , but more elegantly :
" On two occasions I have been asked , ' Pray , Mr. Babbage , if you put into the machine wrong figures , will the right answers come out ? '
I am not able rightly to apprehend the kind of confusion of ideas that could provoke such a question . "

Republican vice - presidential candidate Sarah Palin has insisted she is ready to step in as US president if necessary .
In her first interview since becoming the vice presidential nominee for the Republicans , Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin has expressed confidence in her ability to fulfil the role of vice president and president if called upon , despite her lack of foreign affairs experience .
She told Charlie Gibson of ABC news she did n't hesitate to accept the offer of running mate from John McCain .
Senator McCain yesterday defended his running mate , Governor Palin , even as she contradicted his policy against talking publicly about attacking terrorist targets in Pakistan .
Mr. McCain chided Senator Obama during Friday 's presidential debate for saying publicly he supports striking terrorist targets inside Pakistan if the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to do so .
But on Saturday , Ms. Palin said much the same thing to a customer at a Philadelphia restaurant , with the press nearby .
" If that 's what we have to do stop the terrorists from coming any further in , absolutely , we should , " Ms. Palin said in the exchange , which was captured on video and reported by CBS News .
" She was in a conversation with some young man , " Mr. McCain said during his own interview yesterday on ABC's " This Week . "
" She understands and has stated repeatedly that we 're not going to do anything except in America 's national security interest and we are not going to , quote , announce it ahead of time . "
DEMOCRATS ACCUSE McCAIN OF SKIMPING ON CAPITOL HILL
Democrats yesterday noted that Senator McCain spent very little time on Capitol Hill over the weekend talking directly with lawmakers , instead preferring to work the phones from his Crystal City , Va. , headquarters .
And an Obama spokesman sent out e-mails to reporters reminding them that while lawmakers and congressional staff members worked into Saturday night to hammer out the deal , Mr. McCain was at one of Washington 's priciest restaurants .
Campaigning in Detroit , Senator Obama continued to attack Mr. McCain , saying the Republican 's backing of deregulation laws helped cause the economic crisis .
" You can't make up for 26 years in 26 days , " Mr. Obama told a crowd of more than 15,000 at a rally in downtown Detroit .
" For most of the 26 years , he 's been against the common - sense rules and regulations that could have stopped this problem . "
OBAMA'S BRACELET GETS A CODA
The mother of a Wisconsin soldier who died in Iraq says she was " ecstatic " when Senator Obama mentioned during Friday 's debate the bracelet she gave him in honor of her son .
Tracy Jopek of Merrill , Wis. , told the Associated Press yesterday she was honored that Mr. Obama remembered Sergeant Ryan David Jopek , who was killed in 2006 by a roadside bomb .
Ms. Jopek criticized Internet reports suggesting Mr. Obama exploited her son for political purposes .
" I do n't understand how people can take that and turn it into some garbage on the Internet , " she said .
Ms. Jopek acknowledged e-mailing the Obama campaign in February asking that the presidential candidate not mention her son in speeches or debates .
But she said Mr. Obama 's mention on Friday was appropriate because he was responding after Senator McCain said a soldier 's mother gave him a bracelet .
FEY SPOOFS PALIN , AGAIN , ON 'SNL '
Tina
Fey reprised her role as Governor Palin on " Saturday Night Live , " again appearing as the Republican vice presidential candidate in an opening sketch .
Amy Poehler played CBS 's Katie Couric , parodying the interview with Ms. Palin last week .
When Ms. Poehler 's Couric pushed Ms. Fey's Palin to specifically discuss how she would help facilitate democracy abroad , Ms. Fey gave in : " Katie , I 'd like to use one of my lifelines .
... I want to phone a friend . "
When a confused Ms. Poehler informed her that was n't how the interview worked , Ms. Fey 's Palin responded  alluding to one of the governor 's most quoted lines from the interview 
" Well , in that case , I 'm just gonna have to get back to ya . "
PASTORS PROTEST TAX LAW
Defying a federal law that prohibits American clergy from endorsing political candidates from the pulpit , an evangelical Christian minister told his congregation yesterday that voting for Senator Obama would be evidence of " severe moral schizophrenia . "
The Reverend Ron Johnson told worshipers that the Democratic presidential nominee 's positions on abortion and gay partnerships exist " in direct opposition to God 's truth as He has revealed it in the scriptures . "
Rev. Johnson showed slides contrasting the candidates ' views but stopped short of endorsing Senator McCain .
Rev. Johnson and 32 other pastors around the country set out yesterday to break the rules , seeking to generate a legal battle that will prompt federal courts to throw out a 54 - year - old ban on political endorsements by tax - exempt houses of worship .
GAINESVILLE , Fla . -- Heisman Trophy winner Tim Tebow may never play Miami again , and that 's just fine with him .
He got his victory against the Hurricanes and earned a spot in the annals of this storied and once - bitter instate rivalry .
Tebow was good early and even better late , throwing two touchdown passes and helping the fifth - ranked Gators snap a six - game losing streak against Miami with a 26 - 3 victory Saturday night at The Swamp .
It was Florida 's first win since 1985 in the on - again , off - again series .
The rebuilding Hurricanes ( 1 - 1 ) , three - touchdown underdogs , hung close for three quarters .
But Tebow and speedster Percy Harvin took over late and erased three quarters of frustration against Miami 's improved defense .
Florida 's defense was stout all night , holding the Hurricanes to 140 total yards .
" Our defense played outstanding , " Gators coach Urban Meyer said .
" I thought they played great . "
So did Tebow .
The Hurricanes pressured the junior with every snap , forcing him to scramble and make early , sometimes off - balance throws .
Still , he finished 21 - of - 35 passing for 256 yards and two TD passes .
He also ran 13 times for 55 yards .
Harvin , who missed last week 's opener while recovering from offseason heel surgery , ran five times for 27 yards .
" We can do much more with him and we will , " Meyer said .
Robert Marve , making his first career start for Miami , was 10 - of - 18 passing for 69 yards and was sacked three times .
" We can build a lot of things off this game , " Miami coach Randy Shannon said .
" That 's the one thing that we 're excited about .
They see where we can get better , and they also know we were able to play with a top - five team in this country and we had a shot .
" That 's all you want is a shot , a chance on the road , hostile environment and we had that opportunity .
But we have to capitalize on it next time . "
Florida , whose two scores in the first half came off Miami miscues on special teams , led 9 - 3 to start the fourth quarter .
But Tebow , Harvin & Co. finally found their rhythm , putting together consecutive drives of 86 and 95 yards to put the game away .
The Gators , who finished with 345 total yards , took advantage of two favorable calls to score the first of the two late touchdowns .
Tebow hooked up with Carl Moore for a 28 - yard gain on third - and - 9 , putting the Gators at the 5 - yard line .
Moore was initially ruled out of bounds , but officials reviewed the play and said Moore 's elbow touched down before his feet landed out of bounds .
" That was the play of the day , " said Meyer , adding that Moore sustained a hip - pointer on the catch .
" That kind of changed momentum . "
Three plays later , on another third down , Miami's Randy Phillips was flagged for pass interference against Harvin .
It gave the Gators a first - and - goal at the 2 .
Harvin took a pitch from Tebow on third down and outran several defenders for the score .
Phillips insisted the pass to Harvin was not catchable and should not have been flagged .
" No way , " he said .
" But the ref made the call , so that 's what we 've got to live with .
Chalk it up , play some more , bounce back . "
Florida 's next drive was the most impressive of the night , a five - play , 95 - yarder that sealed the victory .
Tebow found Louis Murphy -- yes , the guy who spouted off about Florida being better suited than Miami to be referred to as " The U " -- in the corner of the end zone for a 19 - yard strike .
Jonathan Phillips added a 29 - yard field goal with 25 seconds to play for the final score .
The teams likely wo n't play again until 2013 in Miami .
They used to play every year , but the Gators dropped Miami in 1988 because they wanted to play a " more national schedule . "
They promptly replaced the Hurricanes with Montana State .
Miami fans accused the Gators of pulling out because the Hurricanes were dominating them -- on field and on the national scene .
Former Florida coach Steve Spurrier wanted to add Miami back to the schedule in 1990 , hoping to bolster recruiting efforts in talent - rich Dade County .
But with the Southeastern Conference expanding , there was no room .
After a 13 - year hiatus , Florida and Miami renewed the rivalry in the 2001 Sugar Bowl and have played a few times since .
But the Gators kept ending up on the losing end .
Until now .
" I'm glad I do n't have to hear about it [ anymore ] , that 's for sure , " Tebow said .
Florida might not have even scored in the first half had Miami not made two errors on special teams .
Matt Bosher shanked a punt on the team 's opening drive , a 14 - yard kick that gave the Gators great field possession .
Tebow made easy work of the short field , directing a 35 - yard drive on five plays and giving Florida a 7 - 0 lead with a 14 - yard touchdown pass to Hernandez .
Miami then sucked the energy out of Florida Field -- most of the record 90,833 in attendance were clad in orange and blue -- with a 16 - play drive that took 8:42 off the clock and kept Tebow on the sideline .
It ended with a field goal , but gave the Hurricanes plenty of confidence they could play with the Mighty Gators .
Nonetheless , the Gators added to their lead with another special teams blunder .
Miami left Jeff Demps , one of the fastest players on the field , to rush unblocked at Bosher .
Demps blocked the punt , and Murphy nearly recovered for a touchdown , but could n't hang and the ball trickled out of bounds for a safety and a 9 - 3 advantage .
" The ball did n't fall our way , " Marve said .
" We had some plays we left out there on the field .
The offense , the numbers might not look great , but we did move the ball .
Then we'd get stuck . "

Palin ’s Private Tanning Bed in the Alaska Governor ’s Mansion One of Vice Presidential Candidate Sarah Palin ’s First Actions as Alaska Governor Was to Equip the State Building with a Tanning Bed
By Al Giordano and Bill Conroy
Special to The Narco News Bulletin
The story is familiar : a politician emerges , we are told , from humble roots and pledges to restore America ’s small town family values and represent the common man and woman .
Late last month , the Republican Party offered the United States just such a leader in Alaska Governor Sarah Palin , or so they said .
“ Mother .
Moose hunter .
Maverick , ” announced the video with which the GOP introduced this candidate so far unknown to the rest of the nation .
Governor and vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin has a darkening secret in the Alaska Governor ’s Mansion .
It ’s the same Cinderella story line that Democrat John Edwards had hoped to ride to the top : the son - of - a - mill - worker from the Carolinas , embodiment of and friend to the just - plain - folks , with all - American good looks and a postcard perfect family in tow .
He was going to be a contender … until the smallest little fact began to claw at his authenticity : that It ’s the same Cinderella story line that Democrat John Edwards had hoped to ride to the top : the son - of - a - mill - worker from the Carolinas , embodiment of and friend to the just - plain - folks , with all - American good looks and a postcard perfect family in tow .
He was going to be a contender … until the smallest little fact began to claw at his authenticity : that he paid $ 400 + per haircut to his Hollywood stylist to maintain the shine in his bouncy mop .
The $ 400 haircut became emblematic of Edwards ’ inauthenticity problem .
It fueled suspicion and critique that he was n’t quite the sincere man of the people that his campaign had projected , and added a “ vanity vs. substance ” narrative to everything he did and said .
Sometimes it ’s the small things that unravel the thread on big truths .
But can you imagine the surprise had the public learned that Edwards had also installed an expensive tanning bed in his mansion ?
Former Senator John Edwards ’ $ 400 haircut began to raise issues of his authenticity as a populist .
Actually , he did n’t .
Actually , he did n’t .
But guess who did ?
The Republican nominee for vice president , Governor Sarah Palin , it turns out , is a pioneer of the Great Indoors : “ The governor did have a tanning bed put in the Governor ’s Mansion , ” Roger Wetherell , chief communications officer of Alaska ’s Department of Transportation and Public Facilities , confirmed to this newspaper .
“ It was done shortly after she took office [ in early 2007 ] and moved into the mansion . ”
The home tanning bed in the Governor ’s Mansion in Juneau adds a trivial fact among the many , big and small , coming to light about the right - wing ’s latest celebrity , McCain ’s gamble to try and wrestle the election away from Democrat Barack Obama , but one that – tug the thread – leads to other questions about elitism , ethics , public health and the insufferable phoniness that plagues politics and politicians .
The Alaska Governor ’s Mansion in Juneau .
After receiving a tip from a reader who reported some interesting claims about the governor , including that her mansion counted with its own private tanning bed , Narco News dialed those Alaska officials that should be in - the - know and received nervous replies that would not confirm nor deny , at first , that the Alaska Governor ’s Mansion now includes a private tanning bed .

Erica Fagerstrom , manager of the 96 - year - old state mansion , for example , was not in a talking mood .
Fagerstrom eagerly told us about all the contracting work being done to keep the mansion up to code , the plumbing and “ water issues ” for the family now living on the third floor .
But asked repeatedly whether a tanning bed was also part of her charge , she responded only that , “ a tanning bed is not part of the ongoing projects , ” and pleaded that she had to hang up immediately as her workday had come to an end .
Artificial Light as Metaphor
An expensive , specialized machine , unaffordable and out of reach to most American homes , utilized to artificially enhance one ’s appearance , provides an apt metaphor for political image - making in campaigns .
In fact , such an energy - hungry appliance , in most cases , requires a dedicated circuit , a voltage regulator and 220 volt wiring ( and for some deluxe models , a hardwire connection to the power source ) — a set - up not found in 96 - year - old homes .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain recently said , of Palin , “ she knows more about energy than probably anybody in the United States of America . ”
That kind of hyperbole can be expected from the guy who picked her out of relative obscurity , but so far both McCain and Palin have claimed that Alaska supplies “ 20 percent ” of the United States ’ energy , when , according to factcheck.org , that figure is “ not even close …
Alaska ’s share of domestic energy production was 3.5 percent , ” and just 2.4 percent of total domestic energy consumption .
Okay , so Palin may not know more about energy than other national leaders , but the revelation that her newly re-wired Governor ’s Mansion includes a tanning bed may indicate that in this time of high oil prices forcing most Americans to conserve energy , Palin consumes more energy than the others .
Tanning beds of the kind used by tanning salons can cost upwards of $ 35,000 each .
Asked whether taxpayer funds were used to equip the Alaska Governor ’s Mansion for Palin ’s tanning bed , Public Facilities spokesman Wetherell confirmed that the mansion ’s electrical system had been upgraded early in Palin ’s term .
He insisted that the electrical work was not prompted by the extra needs of a tanning bed , but , rather was part of a project undertaken to bring the historic mansion ’s wiring up to current building standards .

Since governors ( and vice presidents ) are generally expected to be healthy role models for the nation ’s youth , Governor Palin ’s darkening secret raises Edwardsian questions about her habit , which medical professionals and organizations have identified as a threat to public health , a cause of skin cancer , and a problem of abuse and addiction among teenagers and others through a condition that they call “ tanorexia . ”
A Cancerous Habit Tanning salons are an absolute fad , especially popular among high school and college students , most of whom ca n’t afford to own such a machine – which can cost upwards of $ 35,000 – at home .
But that ’s what the spas and salons provide :
An average indoor tanning session will set you back about $ 7 in Alaska — though special packages can run up past $ 20 , according to Alaskan tanning salon operators interviewed by this newspaper .
A 2004 survey sponsored by Wolff System Technology , a major manufacturer of tanning bed parts , found that the average age of those clients is 32 and that it ’s increasingly a passion of men , who now account for about 30 percent of all indoor tanners .
The industry trade publication , “ Looking Fit , ” says there are some 20,000 “ professional indoor - tanning salons ” nationwide , dozens of them in Alaska .
“ The U.S. indoor tanning industry is generating $ 5 billion annually through the provision of controlled tanning sessions to more than 30 million Americans , ” the publication states in 2008 report about the “ state of the industry . ”
“ It gives you a lift , makes you look and feel good , and it relaxes you , ” says Erin Wiese , manager of Color Me Tan , which operates two salons in Anchorage .
But medical authorities , including the American Academy of Dermatology , the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) and the federal Centers for Disease Control ( CDC ) actively warn that tanning beds increase the risk of skin cancer .
Some individuals do turn to tanning beds to treat chronic skin diseases , such as psoriasis , but even in those cases , most dermatologists only recommend that course of action as a treatment of last resort — since tanning beds emit far more damaging than healing energy in the UV light spectrum .
The American Cancer Society is quite clear on the matter , and warns that skin cancer is a bigger public health threat than lung or breast cancer , and that it regards tanning machines as in the same category as cigarettes :
Skin cancer is the most common of all cancer types .
There are more than 1 million skin cancers ( melanoma and non-melanoma ) diagnosed each year in the United States .
That ’s more than prostate , breast , lung , colon , uterus , ovary and pancreas cancers combined .
Unfortunately , the number of skin cancers has been on the rise steadily for the past 30 years …
Avoid tanning beds and sunlamps
Many people believe that the UV rays of tanning beds are harmless .
This is not true .
Tanning lamps give out UV rays .
Health experts advise people to avoid sunlamps and tanning beds .
The cancer risk is deemed especially acute for teenagers who use tanning beds , according to this 2006 New York Times story : “ In the last two years , the World Health Organization , the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Dermatology have labeled tanning beds as the health - peril equivalent of cigarettes .
All have urged prohibiting their use by minors . ”
Gov. Palin ’s use of a mansion - based tanning system even goes against the judgment of her state ’s own public health agency , which issued a report , called the Alaska Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan 2005 - 2010 , that describes cancer as “ the leading cause of death in Alaska , ” and specifically calls for encouraging “ regulations warning consumers about tanning beds and the risk of skin cancer . ”
“ Tanorexia ” and Youth Missouri University recently became the latest school to attempt to ban tanning beds on campus , due to the health risks for students .
Other health organizations warn of young people becoming addicted to tanning bed sessions , and label the condition as “ tanorexia ” : Researchers at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia examined the tanning habits of 400 college students aged 18 to 24 , using the same framework that defines substance addictions .
They found that 27 per cent showed signs of “ tanorexia , ” based on answers to questions like “ Do you think you need to spend more and more time in the sun to maintain your perfect tan ? ” and “ Does this ( your belief that tanning can cause skin cancer ) keep you from spending time in the sun or going to tanning beds ? ”
Then , of course , is the fact that Palin ’s running mate , presidential candidate John McCain , is himself a survivor of skin cancer and has been active legislating and advocating for its prevention .
In 2001 , he wrote a cover essay for Newsweek : “ My Battle With Skin Cancer . ”
So while McCain is out there campaigning for cancer prevention as a public health issue , appearing at joint forums with cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and such , his own vice president ’s tanning bed habit could undercut that message , particularly to the nation ’s youth .
So while McCain is out there campaigning for cancer prevention as a public health issue , appearing at joint forums with cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and such , his own vice president ’s tanning bed habit could undercut that message , particularly to the nation ’s youth .
It should be noted that not all tanning bed users are in it to bronze their skin :
There are also those that utilize tanning beds as a kind of self - medication for Seasonal Affective Disorder ( SAD ) , a form of mental depression thought to be related to the relative lack of daylight in the winter months , and more prevalent the farther from the Equator one lives : “ According to the American Psychiatric Association , for a diagnosis to qualify as SAD , it must meet four criteria : depressive episodes at a particular time of the year ; remissions or mania / hypomania also at a characteristic time of year ; these patterns must have lasted two years with no nonseasonal major depressive episodes during that same period ; and these seasonal depressive episodes outnumber other depressive episodes throughout the patient ’s lifetime . ”
However , that , too , is a matter of controversy in the medical community .
The American Academy of Family Physicians , for example , warns : “ Tanning beds should n’t be used to treat SAD .
The light sources in tanning beds are high in ultraviolet ( UV ) rays , which harm your eyes and your skin .
( Governor Palin has not released her medical records for public view . )
For the Elite : Home Tanning Beds Color Me Tan manager Erin Wiese and Ashley Mensik , owner of the 11 - year - old A Touch of Sun tanning salon in Fairbanks , both say it is not at all typical or ordinary in Alaska for individuals to install tanning beds in their homes .
“ I do n’t think it ’s normal for people to have a tanning bed in their house , ” Wiese says .
“ It ’s expensive , ” adding that it can cost up to $ 35,000 for one bed — and that does n’t include the cost of spare parts , like bulbs , and the expense of special electrical wiring for the beds .
Mensik agrees with Wiese ’s assessment , but adds that it is possible to get an “ entry - level ” tanning bed for a salon for about $ 10,000 .
Mensik also says the cost of tanning equipment in Alaska is enhanced because of the shipping hurdles .
“ It ’s hard to get large equipment up here , ” she explains .
“ There ’s a lot of shipping issues in general . …
And then there ’s the maintenance on top of it .
There are no [ tanning - bed repair ] experts here [ in Fairbanks ] . ”
Still , Mensik says it ’s a good business that generally attracts two types of clientele based on her experience in the business .
In the first group , she says , are individuals who use indoor tanning as a type of “ light therapy ” during the dead of winter to ward off the arctic blues .
The other group , she explains , are those individuals planning vacations south of Alaska .
Mensik concedes the obvious : that there is a “ vanity factor ” involved as well , since no one likes to look like a ghost on the beach .
She stresses , though , that the typical indoor tanning customer base in Alaska includes both males and females .
“ I ’ve had clients who are Alaskan construction workers with beards who know they will be working long shifts and then going home to sleep , ” she says .
“ So they will find a way to cram in a tanning session in between because they know they wo n’t be seeing much sun . ”
Who Paid for the Governor ’s Tanning Bed ?
Alaska has a very strict ethics law governing public officials .
In the case of the governor , the Alaska attorney general , who oversees the state ’s Department of Law , enforces the ethics laws .
Judy Bockman , an Alaskan assistant attorney general who administers the states ethics act , says the governor is mandated to disclose any gift exceeding $ 150 in value if that gift is in anyway connected to her official position or if it is intended to influence the performance of her public duties .
And a gift is defined , she says , “ as the transfer of property to a public official at less than full value . ”
Bockman says she was not aware of Palin ’s tanning bed .
That fact would seem to indicate that the governor did not list it as a gift , since such disclosures are to be filed with “ a designated supervisor , ” which in the case of the governor is the state ’s attorney general .
Wetherell of the Department of Transportation and Public Facilities confirms that fact as well , indicating that he was informed by the Governor ’s Office that Palin purchased the tanning bed “ with her own money , so there was no need for an ethics disclosure . ”
Wetherell says that Palin bought the tanning bed from a health club , adding that it was not a brand new machine .
The fact that the tanning bed was acquired from a business also seems to indicate that it was a commercial model — which can command a hefty price tag as Wiese and Mensik point out .
Wetherell was not able to provide the name of the health club , the model of the tanning bed , nor the price Palin paid for the machine , which means there is no way of verifying , at this point , if Palin did , in fact , purchase it with her own money , and if so , whether she received a discount off market value exceeding $ 150 in deference to her position as governor .
If , in fact , the tanning bed was donated to Palin or her family , or provided at discount exceeding $ 150 as a favor due to her position , based on Bockman ’s explanation of the state ’s ethics law , it would have legally had to appear on her state ethics disclosure filings .
Bockman also explained that it is incumbent on a public official to disclose a gift in any case where that official suspects he or she received special treatment .
“ There is an absolute bar against taking any gift that is inappropriate , ” she says .
In any event , the examination of a potential ethics violation is handled on a case - by - case basis based on the particular circumstances of the event , Bockman adds .
“ We do n’t judge the appearance of impropriety , ” Bockman says .
“ We look at the facts . ”
The name of the health club that allegedly sold the tanning bed to Palin , its model and cost , form of payment , and that of the state contractor who did the electrical upgrade work at the Governor ’s Mansion , are subject of continuing reporting by this newspaper .

Stipulated : that the Alaska Governor installed a personal tanning bed is hardly on the level of importance of her policy stances and record in public office .
But like a previous national office aspirant ’s $ 400 haircut , it ’s the sort of fact that can become emblematic of a larger narrative about inauthenticity , insincerity and overblown claims of “ everyday people ” street cred that have been floated by the McCain - Palin campaign about its newest member .
On the bright side , the long overlooked “ tanorexic lobby ” – the industries that make the machines , their representatives and lobbyists in Washington – may finally be able to step outdoors and into the non-artificial sunlight , having one of their own through which to promote their product to a new generation of youth , a celebrity endorsement that could end up a heartbeat away from the presidency of the United States of America .

In what may be the least astonishing news of the day , some major US companies who say they are environmentally recycling electronic waste - are n't .
Rather more startling -- they are dumping everything from cell phones and old computers to televisions in countries such as China and India where disposal practices are unsafe to people and dangerous to the environment .
Controlling the exportation of all of the e-waste plops on the doorstep of the US Environmental Protection Agency which is doing a woeful job , according to a scathing 67 - page report issued by the Government Accountability Office today .
US hazardous waste regulations have not deterred exports of potentially hazardous used electronics , primarily for the following reasons , the GAO stated :
Short - sightedness : Existing EPA regulations focus only on cathode - ray tubes ( CRTs ) .
Other exported used electronics flow virtually unrestricted - even to countries where they can be mismanaged - in large part because relevant US hazardous waste regulations assess only how products will react in unlined US landfills .
Since July 2006 the EPA has required any exporter of CRTs for recycling must notify EPA at least 60 days prior to the intended shipment , and that the shipment be accompanied by and conform with an acknowledgment of consent , provided by EPA , that documents the importing country 's consent .
Under this CRT Rule , if these conditions are not met , CRTs , which would likely fail EPA tests for toxicity , would be considered hazardous waste , the GAO stated .

Under this CRT Rule , if these conditions are not met , CRTs , which would likely fail EPA tests for toxicity , would be considered hazardous waste , the GAO stated .
The old end - around : Companies easily circumvent the CRT rule .
GAO workers posed as foreign buyers of broken CRTs in Hong Kong , India , Pakistan , and other countries , and 43 US companies expressed willingness to export these items .
Some of the companies , including ones that publicly tout their exemplary environmental practices , were willing to export CRTs in apparent violation of the CRT rule .
GAO provided EPA with the names of these companies at EPA 's request .
Items with CRT are particularly harmful because they can contain 4 pounds of lead , a known toxin .

GAO provided EPA with the names of these companies at EPA 's request .
Items with CRT are particularly harmful because they can contain 4 pounds of lead , a known toxin .
No guts , no glory : EPA 's enforcement is lacking .
Since the CRT rule took effect in January 2007 , Hong Kong officials intercepted and returned to US ports 26 containers of illegally exported CRTs .
EPA has since penalized one violator , and then only long after the shipment had been identified by GAO .
EPA officials acknowledged compliance problems with its CRT rule but said that given the rule 's relative newness , their focus was on educating the regulated community .
This reasoning appears misplaced , however , given the GAO 's observation of exporters willing to engage in apparent violations of the CRT rule , including some who are aware of the rule .
Finally , EPA has done little to ascertain the extent of noncompliance , and EPA officials said they have neither plans nor a timetable to develop an enforcement program , the GAO said .
The GAO went on to say recent surveys made on behalf of the United Nations found that used electronics exported from the United States to many Asian countries are dismantled under unsafe conditions , using methods like open - air incineration and acid baths to extract metals such as copper and gold .
GAO observed thousands of requests for these items on e-commerce Web sites during a 3 - month period -- mostly from Asian countries such as China and India but also from some in Africa , the GAO stated .
Some US recyclers mix broken units with working units in shipments to Africa , and the nonworking units are often dumped and left for scavengers , the GAO said .
Accepting such " junk " equipment is often part of the " arrangement " US recyclers make with African importers , according to a used computer importer in Senegal , the GAO said .
Negotiating the amount of working versus broken equipment is routinely part of the agreement , and this importer told the GAO that even if he receives a shipment of up to 40 % " junk , " he can still make a profit .
Often , the " junk " computers are dumped in the countryside and burned , he explained .
In addition , in 2007 , an official with the Basel Convention Regional Centre for Africa for Training and Technology Transfer noted , on the basis of his experience that a high proportion of the units that arrive in Nigeria are unusable , that used electronics are rarely tested for functionality before export to developing countries like those in Africa .
So what can be done ?
Perhaps little in the near term .
The GAO said beyond actually enforcing the CRT rule , EPA should take steps to ensure that the larger universe of potentially harmful electronic devices -- such as computers , printers , and cell phones -- are exported in a manner that does not harm health or the environment .
Among the options raised by GAO are :
Expand hazardous waste regulations to cover other exported used electronics .
Submit a legislative package to Congress for ratifying the Basel Convention , an international regime governing the import and export of hazardous wastes .
Work with Customs and Border Protection and other agencies to improve identification and tracking of exported used electronics .
Options such as these could help make US export controls more consistent with those of other industrialized countries .
For its part the EPA said in a six - page response the GAO report may not offer a " complete and balanced picture of the agency 's electronic waste program . "
The agency said it does in fact enforce the CRT rule for example , and has 10 cases currently pending against offenders .
The trains will switch off an engine on certain sections to save fuel A train company running services over the Pennines has told its drivers to shut off engines on downhill sections to save money .
The spiralling cost of fuel and need to cut carbon emissions prompted First Transpennine Express to pilot the idea - which it said had been a success .
The company said it was saving about 7 % of its fuel consumption without compromising passenger comfort .
The multi-engined trains can shut any number of their units while running .
Nick Donovan , from First Transpennine Express , said : " The trains operate on one , two or three engines - but there 's an electrical supply between the coaches which allows all the control and passenger comfort systems to be maintained even if an engine is shut down . "
Satellite systems
The company 's fleet manager Paul Staples added : " The train detects where it is using an on - board GPS system .
" It can also tell how a driver is actually driving and , if everything is OK , one engine will be switched off and the train , which normally runs on three engines , can run on two . "
He said there was an override facility that enabled crews to re-engage the idle engine if either more power was needed or to catch up after a specific delay .
Drivers , however , are also being encouraged to be fuel conscious during the journeys .
" We 're also training drivers to drive economically , something like using the equivalent of a light right foot rather than thrashing it , " he added .

What are these ?
A story is told in images .
You can do it with words , you can do it with pictures , or you can do it with both .
For those interested in doing it just with pictures , there are two books in print right now on woodcut novels and wordless books that are absolute must - reads .
First , for an overall sampler and history of the form , get David Beronä ‘s Wordless Books : The Original Graphic Novels .
Beronä is the Library Director of the Lamson Library at Plymouth State University , and he ’s been researching woodcut novels and wordless books for twenty years .
Beronä begins with the granddaddy of it all and my personal favorite , woodcut artist Frans Masereel , and points out three major elements that were in the air when Masereel started to create his works :
1 ) the revival of the woodcut , mostly thanks to the German Expressionists
2 ) silent cinema , and a “ public already familiar with black - and - white pictures that told a story ”
3 ) newspaper cartoons
Beronä goes on to trace the development of the form , including some of my other favorites : the woodcut novels of Lynd Ward ( whose name spelled backwards is “ draw ” ) and Otto Nuckel , Milt Gross ’s cartoon novel He Done Her Wrong , and Istvan Szegedi Szuts ’ ink + brush piece My War .
In the book ’s introduction , the the fantastic cartoonist and scratchboard genius Peter Kuper mentions the biblical story of the Tower of Babel and locates wordless woodcut stories as part of humanity ’s ongoing quest to use images and symbols to “ sidestep our language barriers and create … stories that can be universally understood . ”
“ Looking for similarities among these artists you find that many share a contrasting use of black and white , dark and light , with a dash of yin and yang .
Most also share a connection through choice of materials .
From wood engraving to leadcut to linoleum printing , these artists have chosen a medium with a process beyond the immediacy achieved of putting pen to paper .
There is a unique quality to these print images that is arresting and iconic .
It ’s as thought the art were announcing a rally and needed to be read as easily on a lamp post as seen in a book . ”
It ’s no coincidence that Otto Neurath turned to woodcut artist Gerd Arntz to create the symbols for his celebrated Isotype system of pictorial communication .
There ’s something in the stark black and white of woodcut and ink and brush that leads to that iconic quality …
… which brings us to the second book and perfect companion to Wordless Books , Graphic Witness : Four Wordless Graphic Novels , which collects in their entirety Frans Masereel ’s The Passion of a Man , Lynd Ward ’s Wild Pilgrimage , Giacomo Patri ’s White Collar , and Laurence Hyde ’s Southern Cross .
The book was edited by woodcut artist and printmaker George A. Walker .
From Walker ’s introduction :
As a woodcut artist , I ’ve always been attracted to black - and - white art .
I think it has something to do with the rich contrasts .
I love a deep rich black that you can stare into , forever .
The effect is like our colorful world torn down to its base so that we can read the unerlying message .
The truth is always easier to take in black and white .
Typography is always more legible in black and white , so why would we be surprised to find the readability of artworks enhanced by those contrasts ?
Remove the grays and hues , reduce the image to lines and solid blacks , and open up the whites .
You have a thing of beauty and simplicity .
Another way to understand our attraction to black and white is through the science of how we see .
The human eye consists of rods and cones that process the reflected light of our world .
These signals are then translated into color and form for processing by our brain .
The rods , which are sensitive only to black and white , are the first components activated in a baby ’s eyes .
That ’s why infants readily respond to high - contrast black - and - white images .
We are hardwired to appreciate black - and - white artwork .
In addition to the great service of publishing these complete works together , the introduction to the book gives a history and overview of relief printmaking techniques ( see this MOMA infographic , “ What Is A Print ? “ ) , focusing on the tools used to create the images :
As anyone who ’s familiar with my comics and illustration work should know , I owe a great debt to this form and these artists , and I ca n’t wait to finish this book of words , so I can get back to making stories out of pictures again !
( For those who have n’t seen my previous feeble attempts , see : “ Birdseed , ” “ After the War , ” and my abandoned graphic novel , “ A Terrible Calamity At Sea ! “ ) .

Just a few weeks ago , predictions of Arctic ice collapse were buzzing all over the internet .
Some scientists were predicting that the " North Pole may be ice - free for first time this summer " .
Others predicted that the entire " polar ice cap would disappear this summer " .
The Arctic melt season is nearly done for this year .
The sun is now very low above the horizon and will set for the winter at the North Pole in five weeks .
And none of these dire predictions have come to pass .
Yet there is , however , something odd going on with the ice data .
The National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) in Boulder , Colorado released an alarming graph on August 11 , showing that Arctic ice was rapidly disappearing , back towards last year 's record minimum .
Their data shows Arctic sea ice extent only 10 per cent greater than this date in 2007 , and the second lowest on record .
Here 's a smaller version of the graph :
The National Snow and Ice Data Center ( NSIDC ) 's troublesome ice graph
The problem is that this graph does not appear to be correct . *
[ See Editor 's note , below ]
Other data sources show Arctic ice having made a nice recovery this summer .
NASA Marshall Space Flight Center data shows 2008 ice nearly identical to 2002 , 2005 and 2006 .
Maps of Arctic ice extent are readily available from several sources , including the University of Illinois , which keeps a daily archive for the last 30 years .
A comparison of these maps ( derived from NSIDC data ) below shows that Arctic ice extent was 30 per cent greater on August 11 , 2008 than it was on the August 12 , 2007 .
( 2008 is a leap year , so the dates are offset by one . )
Ice at the Arctic : 2007 and 2008 snapshots
The video below highlights the differences between those two dates .
As you can see , ice has grown in nearly every direction since last summer - with a large increase in the area north of Siberia .
Also note that the area around the Northwest Passage ( west of Greenland ) has seen a significant increase in ice .
Some of the islands in the Canadian Archipelago are surrounded by more ice than they were during the summer of 1980 .
The 30 per cent increase was calculated by counting pixels which contain colors representing ice .
This is a conservative calculation , because of the map projection used .
As the ice expands away from the pole , each new pixel represents a larger area - so the net effect is that the calculated 30 per cent increase is actually on the low side .
So how did NSIDC calculate a 10 per cent increase over 2007 ?
Their graph appears to disagree with the maps by a factor of three ( 10 per cent vs. 30 per cent ) - hardly a trivial discrepancy .
What melts the Arctic ?
The Arctic did not experience the meltdowns forecast by NSIDC and the Norwegian Polar Year Secretariat .
It did n't even come close .
Additionally , some current graphs and press releases from NSIDC seem less than conservative .
There appears to be a consistent pattern of overstatement related to Arctic ice loss .
We know that Arctic summer ice extent is largely determined by variable oceanic and atmospheric currents such as the Arctic Oscillation .
NASA claimed last summer that " not all the large changes seen in Arctic climate in recent years are a result of long - term trends associated with global warming " .
The media tendency to knee - jerkingly blame everything on " global warming " makes for an easy story - but it is not based on solid science . ®
Bootnote
And what of the Antarctic ?
Down south , ice extent is well ahead of the recent average .
Why is n't NSIDC making similarly high - profile press releases about the increase in Antarctic ice over the last 30 years ?
The author , Steven Goddard , is not affiliated directly or indirectly with any energy industry , nor does he have any current affiliation with any university .
* Editor 's note :
Walt Meier , research scientist at the NSIDC , has contacted us disputing the validity of Steven Goddard 's methodology , and of his use of University of Illinois data to question the NSIDC 's charts .
We accept that these two data sets are not directly comparable , and that the University of Illinois data does not provide support for Goddard 's charge that the NSIDC data is incorrect .
We reproduce Walt Meier 's response below .
Walt Meier as provided further detail on the calculation of sea ice area and extent in the comments to this article :
The author asserts that NSIDC 's estimate of a 10 % increase in sea ice compared to the same time as last year is wrong .
Mr. Goddard does his own analysis , based on images from the University of Illinois ' Cryosphere Today web site , and comes up with a number of ~ 30 % , three times larger than NSIDC 's estimate .
He appears to derive his estimate by simply counting pixels in an image .
He recognizes that this results in an error due to the distortion by the map projection , but does so anyway .
Such an approach is simply not valid .
The proper way to calculate a comparison of ice coverage is by actually weighting the pixels by their based on the map projection , which is exactly what NSIDC does .
UI also does the same thing , in a plot right on the same page as where Mr Goddard obtained the images he uses for his own analysis : http://arctic.atmos.uiuc.edu/cryosphere/IMAGES/current.365.jpg
The absolute numbers differ between the UI and NSIDC plots because UI is calculating ice area , while NSIDC is calculating ice extent , two different but related indicators of the state of the ice cover .
However , both yield a consistent change between Aug. 12 , 2007 and Aug. 11 , 2008 – about a 10 % increase .
Besides this significant error , the rest of the article consists almost entirely of misleading , irrelevant , or erroneous information about Arctic sea ice that add nothing to the understanding of the significant long - term decline that is being observed .
Steven Goddard writes : " Dr. Walt Meier at NSIDC has convinced me this week that their ice extent numbers are solid .
So why the large discrepancy between their graphs and the UIUC maps ?
I went back and compared UIUC maps vs. NASA satellite photos from the same dates last summer .
It turns out that the older UIUC maps had underrepresented the amount of low concentration ice in several regions of the Arctic .
This summer , their maps do not have that same error .
As a result , UIUC maps show a much greater increase in the amount of ice this year than does NSIDC .
And thus the explanation of the discrepancy .
" it is clear that the NSIDC graph is correct , and that 2008 Arctic ice is barely 10 % above last year - just as NSIDC had stated . "
Halfway through reviewing Half - Life 2 : Episode Two for PC Gamer about a month ago , Valve PR Doug Lombardi asks me if I know about the gnome achievement .
“ No ? ”
“ Did you find the gnome near the start ? ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ You have to put him in the rocket before it launches . ”
“ But is n’t that right near the end of the game ? ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ Does n’t that mean you have to - ”
“ Yeah . ”
“ Oh I ’m so doing that . ”
A month or so later , I have .
Obviously any time you know you ’re going to be coming back to an area , you can set him down there and go off on your own .
My tendancy to put him in areas where I knew something dramatic was going to happen cost me my gnome once or twice .
You ’d think the defense section in the mines would be an easy spot – just leave him there and come back .
Yes .
But do n’t leave him near the people you ’re protecting .
It turns out there ’s a bottomless chasm directly behind them with inadequate safety railings , and antlion swipes send the little guy flying .
The gnome adds poignancy to any scene .
But he ’s a liability in lifts – put him on the floor and he sometimes gets stuck , jamming part of the lift but letting the rest move up , fatally crushing everyone inside .
Except the gnome .
The gnome , I discovered after a quick save - and - load test , is indestructable .
Like The Freeman , he ’s a good listener during exposition .
He managed to fall out of this lift while it was going up , meaning I had to throw myself off a cliff with 3 health to get back down and retrieve him , and pray that the lift was summonable again from the gound floor .
It was .
Ah , how easy all this would have been if Alyx really did hold him on her lap .
And an extra 3 % onto the score , by the way , Valve .
But no , he clips through her , and half - rests within the chassis of the car , sliding around it wildly with the slightest acceleration and hurling himself dramatically out of it at even the gentlest turns .
You get the car after a long trek through some sludge and abandoned buildings infested with zombies .
I left the gnome with Alyx and the Vortigaunt , because I knew you come back to that area once you get the car .
But then I remembered with some degree of horror that you do n’t actually get back into that room again – you have to open the door to it for the two of them using a switch in another room , and it only stays open for a few seconds .
Could I , if I pulled the switch from as far away as it was usable , then spun one - eighty , jumped off the ladder , dashed up the stairs and barged my way past Alyx and the alien , get back in there and grab the gnome ?
No .
I could , however , pull the switch , spin one - eighty , leap off the ledge , dash up the stairs , barge past the NPCs and suck him to me with the Gravity Gun just microseconds before the door slammed back shut .
If I ’d left him a few feet further from the exit , I would have had to repeat the whole section .
Holding a fucking gnome .
Strapping him to the bonnet does not work .
Here ’s the gnome at the end of the Hunter - Chopper pursuit section .
That section is tricky for a few reasons .
1 ) If you steer at all , the gnome falls out of your car .
If you do n’t steer at all , you run straight into the Chopper ’s mines and die .
2 ) If you go fast , he falls out .
If you go slow , the Chopper switches to direct - fire mode , hovers in front of you and fires directly in your face , killing you .
3 ) If you stop to pick up the gnome when he falls out , the Chopper swings down low over your vehicle , and the downdraft sends the gnome flying .
It ’s impossible to put him back in the car under these conditions , or predict where he ’ll go if you fire him into that downdraft with the gravity gun , or survive for more than a few seconds because of all the gunfire .
So it plays a little like a nightmarish version of Speed – you have to keep your velocity above a certain margin to avoid certain death , but at the same time drive as slowly as possible and incredibly carefully .
Alyx sometimes gives the gnome funny looks .
He is also more photogenic in bright lighting conditions , and prefers studio lighting where available .
I could have left the little guy here while I dealt with the Autogun , but I could n’t remember if you go back into the garage after the rebels have fixed your car , or if they take it out to you and the garage is shut .
I left it on the road outside instead .
I ’m not really sure what happened here .
I left him to stand sentry on the high wall outside the Inn , and after the Hunter fight he was face - down in the dirt at the scene of what looks like it must have been a fairly serious explosion .
The gnome knows no fear .
He knows nothing .
White Forest , at freaking last .
The gnome is keen to learn of your ‘ AR3’s .
Who watches the watchers ?
The gnome does .
He watches everyone , unblinkingly .
His presence starts to get a little creepy during the more personal moments .
Ah , his chariot at long last .
Lamarr is permitted to enter first .
Farewell , brave traveller !
May I never , ever set eyes on your stupid fucking face again .
The hatch is sealed , the deal is done .
The achievement is not unlocked .
The worry begins here , and does not end until after the credits roll – the achievement never actually pops up .
But there he goes , exploding in space alongside everyone ’s favourite headcrab eunoch .
I ’m guessing Kleiner wo n’t have time to grieve in the rather more serious context of Episode Three .
It had indeed registered the Achievement .
It ’s nice to have a permanent record of the insanity Valve have inexplicably put me through , but by the end of it the satisfaction of doing something really , really difficult and really , really pointless was enough .
Update !
Trey The Gnome is going even more in - depth on this , since he , you know , is the gnome .
He ’s started his own blog about it , and he ’s taken a load of shots I wish I ’d thought to get .
Up-update !
Chris Livingston , author of the superb webcomic Concerned , had a much , much better idea .
He ’s screenshotting the gnome as if he is Gordon Freeman , and it ’s already produced three completely priceless images .
The rest are here .
Up -up - update !
Er , a few things seem to need clarifying .
In descending order of obviousness :
This is not Halo ( ! ) .
It ’s Half - Life 2 : Episode Two .
This is n’t a review (!? ) .
My Episode
Two review is online here , along with my Portal and Team Fortress 2 ones .
There is n’t really a Gnome Supply Closet in the silo at White Forest (!?? ) .
I was joking in the comments .
There is n’t a second gnome near the rocket launcher cache – Kotaku commenter
Thorn thought he saw one there , but later realised he was thinking of the same place we all got it from near the start .
I was playing on PC .
Steam has an Achievements system just like Xbox Live .
It has been established that due to its design the gnome is probably , but not definitely , an Amelie reference .
My screenshots are definitely Amelie references .
This run through actually took less time than my first , gnome - free play - through of the game .
It ’s harder , but it ’s not significantly slower .
‘ Pentadact ’ in the comments is me , Tom Francis , master of stealth .
I do n’t know why that ’s not made clear anywhere on this site .
Tip !
If you ’re trying for the Grubs achievement , you ’re insane , but commenter Escobard points out a guide by bdmason over at the Steam forums that will help .
It tells you how many you should have killed at the end of each section .
Lastly : Garry has more gnomes than you or I :
The latest test of Project 921 , as its race into space is known , is the climax of China 's defining year as an emerging superpower , coming on top of its hosting of the Olympic Games .
Jonathan Weisman has a fascinating , even riveting narrative of what went down in Washington on Thursday as John McCain made his play to commandeer the high - level negotiations over the bailout bill .
And TPM Reader TW called my attention to a passage that may help to explain the smoldering hostility that made it impossible for McCain even to make eye contact with Barack Obama during last night ’s debate .
We pick up Weisman in that big meeting at the White House …
Pelosi said Obama would speak for the Democrats .
Though later he would pepper Paulson with questions , according to a Republican in the room , his initial point was brief : “ We ’ve got to get something done . ”
Bush turned to McCain , who joked , “ The longer I am around here , the more I respect seniority . ”
McCain then turned to Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell ( R - Ky. ) to speak first .
Boehner was blunt .
The plan Paulson laid out would not win the support of the vast majority of House Republicans .
It had been improved on the edges , with an oversight board and caps on the compensation of participating executives .
But it had to be changed at the core .
He did not mention the insurance alternative , but Democrats did .
Rep. Barney Frank ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , pressed Boehner hard , asking him if he really intended to scrap the deal and start again .
No , Boehner replied , he just wanted his members to have a voice .
Obama then jumped in to turn the question on his rival : “ What do you think of the [ insurance ] plan , John ? ” he asked repeatedly .
McCain did not answer .
One Republican in the room said it was clear that the Democrats came into the meeting with a “ game plan ” aimed at forcing McCain to choose between the administration and House Republicans .
“ They had taken McCain ’s request for a meeting and trumped it , ” said this source .
Congressional aides from both parties were standing in the lobby of the West Wing , unaware of the discord inside the Cabinet room , when McCain emerged alone , shook the hands of the Marines at the door and left .
The aides were baffled .
The plan had been for a bipartisan appearance before the media , featuring McCain , Obama and at least a firm statement in favor of intervention .
Now , one of the leading men was gone .
WASHINGTON , July 11 —
It reads like a tally of terrorist targets that a child might have written :
Old MacDonald ’s Petting Zoo , the Amish Country Popcorn factory , the Mule Day Parade , the Sweetwater Flea Market and an unspecified “ Beach at End of a Street . ”
But the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security , in a report released Tuesday , found that the list was not child ’s play : all these “ unusual or out - of - place ” sites “ whose criticality is not readily apparent ” are inexplicably included in the federal antiterrorism database .
The National Asset Database , as it is known , is so flawed , the inspector general found , that as of January , Indiana , with 8,591 potential terrorist targets , had 50 percent more listed sites than New York ( 5,687 ) and more than twice as many as California ( 3,212 ) , ranking the state the most target - rich place in the nation .
The database is used by the Homeland Security Department to help divvy up the hundreds of millions of dollars in antiterrorism grants each year , including the program announced in May that cut money to New York City and Washington by 40 percent , while significantly increasing spending for cities including Louisville , Ky. , and Omaha .
Gmail has revolutionized the way we communicate and manage information via email .
If you doubt it then it means that you are yet to exploit the extraordinary features of this email app to the fullest .
This article explores some of the outstanding Gmail features and tricks which make this tool a must have for anyone using email to communicate .
The features discussed here will also help long time Gmail users to dig deeper and get the most out of this amazing service .
Consolidate multiple email accounts into one Gmail account
This is probably the most important reason why one should make the switch if he is using a different email service .
With Gmail you do n’t have to worry about checking your different email accounts .
You can consolidate all the multiple inboxes into one Gmail account .
While the option to combine other email accounts into Gmail was always there , recently Gmail made the process a cakewalk by introducing the import option in the settings .
It ’s super easy now to use Gmail as your one stop email service .
Learn to use filters and labels effectively
No other email service lets you filter and organize emails the way Gmail does .
Using “ Filters ” and “ Labels ” in Gmail , you could always keep unimportant emails out of your inbox and be much more efficient in email management .
Here is an old but still useful article from Lifehack on ways to use Gmail filters .
If you are looking to learn more about labels then this article on about.com regarding Gmail labels should help you .
Make use of multiple Gmail addresses you get with one account
This is a gem .
And if you did n’t know about this , here ’s the surprise – with Gmail you actually get an unlimited number of different email addresses .
Yes , unlimited !
How ?
Well [ email protected ] [ email protected ] [ email protected ] here .
Oh , and [ email protected ] is also same as [ email protected ] .
Awesome feature , is n’t it ?
This feature could be used in so many ways .
Like in this article , the Digital Inspiration blog points out how you could use one email for multiple twitter accounts .
That ’s just one use .
There could be many more such tricks .
Get the picture ?
Use Gmail Labs
In my opinion , the next best thing the Gmail team has done after launching Gmail is introducing Gmail Labs .
I was n’t gung - ho about it initially but when the different labs add - ons started rolling out , I was completely speechless .
Gmail became more amazing each day .
There are a number of Labs tools you could enable .
Here are my favorite picks .
Use Browser add -ons
If Firefox is your primary browser ( it should be if it is n’t ) , then you could also install certain add - ons which add more functionality to Gmail .
Here is an article which talks about some of the best add - ons for Gmail available .
Make Gmail your information center
If you were to ask me the name of one person who has exploited Gmail more than anyone else , I would instantly say Steve Rubel .
The man has written some great articles on how he uses the various features of Gmail to organize information efficiently .
One such article is about how he transformed Gmail into his personal nerve center .
It ’s an excellent read .
Hope you like the tricks .
If you know of some other cool ways to use Gmail , do share them in the comments .

Richard Cizik is one of the country ’s most powerful and outspoken Christian evangelical leaders .
He happens to be a Republican , and he has known the GOP ’s presidential nominee for many years .
“ I thought John McCain was a principled person , ” Cizik says .
“ But John McCain has backed off , not just on climate change but on torture and a sensible tax policy — in other words , he ’s not the John McCain of 2000 . …
He seems to be waffling on issue after issue .
“ It ’s not illogical for someone to conclude that John McCain is going to be more like George Bush than John McCain is going to be like John McCain in 2000 . ”
Characterizing the GOP ’s presidential nominee as an unprincipled waffler is strong stuff from the man who oversees governmental affairs and is the chief lobbyist of the 30 - million - member Washington , D.C. - based National Association of Evangelicals .
But Cizik — named this year by TIME magazine one of the world ’s 100 most influential people — is no stranger to controversies that come from strong convictions .
Over the past several years , Cizik , whose organization represents 45,000 churches from 59 denominations , has emerged as a passionate leader in the Creation Care movement — efforts by Christian evangelicals to respond to the perils of global change .
Suffice to say , Cizik ’s efforts have rocked much of his world — including the minds of Focus on the Family founder James Dobson and a phalanx of other old - guard evangelicals like Tony Perkins , Paul Weyrich and Gary Bauer who tried last year , unsuccessfully , to get Cizik fired from his job of 26 years for sounding the global warming alarm .
Dobson and the others , you see , would prefer to keep the evangelical focus on what they call “ the great moral issues of our time , ” specifically abortion , man - woman - only marriage and “ the teaching of sexual abstinence and morality to our children . ”
They have disparaged Cizik for having a “ preoccupation ” with global warming and other related issues , including poverty and overpopulation .
In 2006 Dobson even head - butted Cizik in the press for supporting international regulations of emissions , calling his views “ anti-capitalistic and [ having ] an underlying hatred for America . ”
Cizik , who takes the long view of winning converts to the global warming battle though biblical truths and employing what he describes as a “ winsome , non-argumentative spirit , ” was in Colorado Springs last week for a two day speaking tour with an unlikely partner in crime , the populist commentator Jim Hightower ( who has detailed Cizik ’s work in his latest book , “ Swim Against the Current : Even a Dead Fish Can Go Against the Flow ” ) .
The first night the two addressed a crowd of 500 congregants of the Vanguard Christian Church and the next spoke to a crowd of hundreds of Colorado College students and environmental activists .
And yes , during his speech Cizik made a joking reference to “ people ” who say he should be fired .
He also expressed hope that Colorado Springs — headquarters to Dobson ’s ministry and media empire Focus on the Family — would become ground zero for a renewed “ focus on the Earth . ”
“ We live in the same world , but some people see through different glasses , ” Cizik said of critics .
“ We have to move them . ”
In an extensive Colorado Independent interview shortly after his Colorado stop , Cizik spoke more specifically about his views of the presidential election , including his thoughts on McCain ’s pick of Sarah Palin — who rejects the science of human induced climate change — as his running mate .
Cizik tells of an encounter he had with McCain a year ago , after the candidate had been the target of loathing from evangelical leaders — most notably from the very same James Dobson who has gone after Cizik .
In McCain ’s case , Dobson let it be known in no uncertain terms : “ I would not vote for John McCain under any circumstances … he ’s not in favor of traditional marriage and I pray that we do n’t get stuck with him . ”
McCain , says Cizik , wanted to know what to make of these declarations .
Cizik ’s response ?
Where else are people like Dobson really going to go ?
Ultimately , he says , the criticism may have given old - guard leaders like Dobson leverage over McCain ’s vice presidential choice .
And lo and behold , since Palin was picked , Dobson has been gushing over the ticket , indicating he will in all likelihood “ pull the lever ” for Palin , er , McCain .
“ It is pretty obvious that the Palin nomination plays to identity politics and cultural war issues , ” says Cizik .
“ Her selection is more than an acknowledgment that evangelicals are an important part of the Republican base , and everyone knows that John McCain is not that exciting to religious conservatives . ”
Palin , Cizik says , has certainly excited the Republican base , and picking her was certainly a deft , if cynical , political move by McCain — at least in the short term .
However , in the longer view , his running mate may do just as much to energize the opposition and prove a turn - off to independents .
“ Not everyone in the evangelical movement is fawning over Sarah Palin , ” Cizik says .
Let ’s review the conflicting messages : Just as hurricanes like Katrina and Rita and Ike have laid devastating wakes , McCain has selected a doubter of human - caused global warming as a running mate .
Palin ’s record as a drill - baby - drill - for - oil advocate , including in Alaska ’s National Wildlife Reserve ; supporting shooting wolves from low - flying airplanes ; and de-listing polar bears as an endangered species does n’t exactly resonate among evangelical Christians who have embraced a commitment to caring for God ’s creation .
And , sending perhaps the most important signal of all , McCain himself has chosen not to not to speak out on the issue of climate change , Cizik notes .
His campaign instead has opted to play identity and culture - war politics .
“ He ’s playing that card , and many of us thought he did n’t need to do it — it just polarizes the country , ” Cizik says .
“ The irony of it is that John McCain ca n’t speak with an evangelical voice of faith — let ’s face it , it ’s just not his thing — so I guess the substitute is this other [ Palin ] .
I guess that ’s pretty cynical , but maybe his actions are cynical .
“ The consequences of going to identity and culture - war politics is that experience is denigrated , authority is questioned and ignorance is strength , ” Cizik says .
That said , come Nov. 4 does Cizik plan to cast his vote for Barack Obama ?
He does n’t know .
“ Obama does n’t have the experience all of us would like , ” Cizik says .
“ I ’m not in Washington to be an advocate for the Republican or the Democratic Party ; that ’s not my calling .
I ’m not an ideologue .
I do wish Obama had 10 years experience in the Senate and Sarah Palin had [ more experience ] .
“ I am a Republican , but I ’m not comfortable with giving the Republicans four more years .
I do n’t see John McCain differing enough from the incumbent , and yet Obama is a work in progress , pretty much , so we ’d be taking some risk with him .
It ’s a conundrum . ”

Intel and Microsoft said last week that they planned to finance two groups of university researchers to start over and design a new generation of computing systems intended to break the industry out of a technological cul - de-sac that threatens to end decades of performance increases in computers .
If the research efforts succeed , this would enable the development of new kinds of portable computers and would help computer engineers tackle areas as diverse as speech recognition , image processing , health care systems and music .
For example , a music professor at the University of California - Berkeley , David L. Wessel , envisions a new era of digital musical instruments that would begin to match the rich versatility of acoustic instruments like violins and pianos .
The research grant , worth $ 20 million over five years , will create independent laboratories at Berkeley and at the University of Illinois , Urbana - Champaign , that will be charting a way to reinvent computing .
Each will work on hardware , software and a new generation of applications powered by computer chips containing multiple processors .
The University of Illinois plans to contribute an additional $ 8 million to the project and the Berkeley project is applying for an additional $ 7 million from a state - supported program to match the industry grants .
The computer industry has generally stopped relying on regular increases in the processing speed of chips .
In recent years , it has bet instead that future advances in speed and energy efficiency will come from putting multiple processors on a single silicon chip .
A number of computer functions can then be done in parallel rather than sequentially .
The new research agenda was motivated in part by an increasing sense that the industry is in a crisis of a sort because advanced parallel software has failed to emerge quickly .
Most programmers today still write programs that solve problems in a serial fashion .
The most advanced consumer - oriented microprocessors have up to eight processors , or cores , on a chip , but the industry is moving toward chips with 100 or more .
The problem , according to academic researchers and industry executives , is that the software to keep dozens of processors busy simultaneously for all kinds of computing problems does not exist .
Although the amounts of the grant are modest , both universities have a reputation for early - stage research that has had notable impacts on the computer industry .
The director of the new Universal Parallel Computing Research Center at Berkeley , the computer scientist David Patterson , has been associated with significant breakthroughs both in microprocessor and computer storage system design .
The University of Illinois laboratory will be led by Marc Snir , a professor of computer science , and Wen- mei Hwu , professor of electrical and computer engineering .
The laboratory will include the participation of David Kuck , a University of Illinois researcher who was a pioneer in the field of parallel computing and who is presently an Intel Fellow .
Patterson began warning about an impending performance limit several years ago .
“ Three years ago , ” he said , “ we said the world is going to change and we should do something about this . ”
Wessel , the music professor , said he routinely uses three laptop computers in his composing work to get the kind of computer power he needs .
“ I ca n’t do as much processing on my laptop as I thirst for , ” he said .
A great deal of industry discussion has focused on centralized , or “ cloud , ” computing in recent years .
But the new research laboratories will instead seek breakthroughs in mobile computing systems .
The new systems will be designed to perform tasks that today ’s computers have difficulty accomplishing , like recognizing human gestures and speech .
An advanced parallel computing system will also help scientists create Web browsers that can more quickly pull in complex data , process it and display it .
The two research teams were chosen from applications from 25 U.S. universities .
Both Intel and Microsoft executives said the research funds were a partial step toward filling a void left by the Pentagon ’s Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which has increasingly focused during the Bush administration on military and other classified projects .
Anyone reading these words already knows our political systems are broken beyond repair .
They already know that trying to patch them up by changing one political party for another every few years merely conforms to Einstein ’s definition of insanity : ‘ Doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results . ’
The great man also said something else worth reapeating : ‘ We can not solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them …
We shall require a substantially new manner of thinking if mankind is to survive . ’
Given that we know things are broken , surely the debate must now move on to what exactly should we DO about it ?
The purpose of this essay is to publish some new thinking , to provoke debate , and to describe three simple steps that anyone could take to properly fixing our broken systems .
George Orwell pointed out more than sixty years ago that our rulers deliberately distort language so that everyday words are used by them in a manner exactly opposite to what they are supposed to mean .
Like Ministry of ‘ Defence ’ , for example , which has nothing to do with defence , and everything to do with beating up anyone it can thousands of miles away from home .
Terrorists actually mean freedom fighters and vice versa ; anarachists are really liberators and liberators anarchists .
‘ Encouraging free competition in the market place ’ is better translated as ‘ promoting tyrannical corporate monopolies ’… and so on .
However , perhaps the most sinister misuse of everyday language by our rulers is their interpretation of the word ‘ democracy ’ .
Nothing better demonstrates the success of all this elitist propaganda than the fact that the majority of citizens living in the western world seriously believe they have ultimate control over their leaders .
The proof of this is the fact that they keep on turning up at elections ; they have not yet learnt that it does n’t make a shred of difference who they vote for — so there ’s really no point in bothering .
Tom Paine , writing more than two hundred years ago , clearly saw it when he penned :
‘ Change of ministers amounts to nothing .
One goes out , another comes in and still the same measures , vices , and extravagance are pursued .
It signifies not who is minister .
The defect lies in the system .
The foundation and the superstructure of the government is bad . ’
Fixing the job is not easy .
Not because of the problem of coming up with a better system , but because of the considerable vested interests of those powerful forces benefiting from the existing system , and who will therefore fight tooth and nail to keep it just the way it is .
But that does n’t mean we should n’t try .
Indeed , we cannot really look the future in the eye unless we try .
Identifying and publicising the problem is an important start ; but we must now use that knowledge to evolve a solution .
Although ‘ democracy ’ as we know it is admittedly better than Stalinism say , it is nevertheless a very long way from good government .
The best that can be said for it is that it ’s better than any other existing type of government .
But we can improve it .
After all , we can send people to the moon , and bring them safely back , analyse all the proteins in our bodies , and perform surgery on them ; communicate instantly with anyone anywhere on the planet and watch them while we do so — why should we not be able to improve a system of administration that was known to be broken two hundred years ago ?
I ’ve spent most of my adult life trying to do exactly this .
The system I devised is called Free Democracy , because I believe that freedom is the most important human condition , and that real democracy ( not the existing Orwellian kind ) is the most perfect form of government .
Free Democracy is very simple .
Its central premise is this : any citizen , properly informed , should be able , if she chooses , to make the decisions of her government .
If you start with this basic absolute and then try to devise an administration that delivers it , you ’re taking the most important first step to improving what we have .
The most common objections to the notion are :
1. Ordinary people are too stupid to understand the complexities of government , and be entrusted with the responsibility of its proper administration .
Stupidity has never before barred some people from gaining awesome decision making authority — therefore even if this was a legitimate concern ( and I do n’t believe it is for the reasons shown below ) , it ’s no worse a situation than what we already have .
Truly stupid people are actually quite few in number , and would either be too disinterested in the business of government to bother taking part , or be so heavily outnumbered by reasonably bright people that the effect of any damage they may cause would be cancelled out ( unlike our existing system where the actions of truly stupid people cannot be cancelled out by brighter beings , and are therefore regularly catastrophic ) .
That the citizen should be able to make rational and responsible decisions in a Free Democracy is , of course , essential .
This hinges on three conditions : good education , good information , and simple , cheap , trustworthy communications , all of which are perfectly deliverable ( although considerable improvements to what we have in all these fields will be required ) .
Contrary to popular belief there is actually quite a lot of hard evidence for the success of trusting ordinary people to make big decisions .
The first example with which we in the west are all familiar is trial by jury .
Trial by jury is trusted more than any other form of justice because it relies on ordinary people .
Less well known is the Swiss government , which has for hundreds of years routinely had its decisions made by ordinary Swiss citizens .
My final example is the almost entirely unknown Summerhill School in England which , for about a hundred years , has been almost entirely run by its pupils whose ages range from 6 to 16 , and who manage without any difficulty at all to leave school as well balanced , well educated young people .
2 . There ’s no guarantee that a Free Democracy would be any better than what we have .
True , but what we have is a leadership obsessed with keeping us engaged in permanent war , and a planet locked into a self inflicted ecological death spiral .
How much worse could it be ?
3 . It ’s too expensive to administer .
The taxpayer is already obliged to pay for horrendously expensive government — a government over which he has absolutely no control .
There is no reason to believe that a Free Democracy will be any more expensive than what we already have , but at least it would have the virtue of being entirely and directly under the control of the taxpayer funding it .
4 . It ’s too complicated to administer
Thirty years ago this may have been a legitimate concern .
Today , with twenty first century communications at everyone ’s fingertips , this issue is not quite so relevant .
Although a robust , cheap , simple , secure and trustworthy voting mechanism would indeed be essential , it is not beyond the wit of woman to invent one .
We already trust our financial transactions to the telephone system , why not our votes ?
The core belief of Free Democracy is that any citizen , properly informed , should be able , if he chooses , to make the decisions of his government .
This belief is all that is needed .
No one need join anything or buy anything .
All that ’s required is that core belief .
Designing an administration system that delivers that belief is almost secondary in consideration because the possibilities and various combinations are considerable .
Creating a perfect model is not only impossible , it ’s also unnecessary .
All that ’s needed is somewhere to start , an administration system that will then allow the citizen to shape it for himself .
But you have to start somewhere .
Therefore the model I designed is simply that : a starting point .
It is not meant to be some divine revelation that can never be improved upon .
It is , and should remain , a work in progress , a flexible structure permanently open to the people to change as they see fit .
Providing the core belief is kept intact , and delivered , Free Democracy will survive no matter how the administration changes .
The particular model I designed comprises two core documents : a People ’s Constitution and an Ethical Guide for the Free Democrat .
Neither of these is intended as a model of perfection — they are simply suggestions , a starting point .
My People ’s Constitution borrows extensively from the Swiss Constitution , which is probably the most democratic model of government in current use .
There is much to be learnt from the Swiss .
They have one of the richest economies in the world , despite their landlocked position , lack of natural resources , and no empire to plunder .
Even though they are clearly wealthy , they nevertheless have a sound welfare system ( the preamble of their constitution includes the words : ‘… the strength of a people is measured by the welfare of the weak ’ ) , and they have some of the tightest green credentials in Europe , with the use of fossil fuels entirely banned in some areas .
In addition they have managed to keep their people free of war for about two hundred years , even when completely surrounded by it , twice .
Switzerland is the only substantial nation I know where the people routinely decide government business , and have done for centuries .
Personality politics is almost unknown ( do you know who the Swiss president is ? )
There is much to be learnt from the Swiss — not least of which is that when ordinary people are put in direct control of their government , pretty good things happen .
The People ’s Constitution is meant to be the only law the citizen will ever need , a document that outranks any conflicting law and which the citizen could use for herself if necessary entirely unaided by expensive lawyers .
It opens with an article on human rights , much of which concurs with the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights .
It then mentions citizens ’ duties , for rights must always be conditional to certain duties .
The constitution proposes a decentralised system of government with national government serving only to coordinate administration and security when required to do so by local councils .
The economy is based on the free market model providing certain safeguards and protections are in place ( such as protecting small business and consumer , delivering consumer choice and providing secure employment ) .
Taxation is fixed at 15 % ( including National Insurance ) , and taxpayers are able , if they choose , to determine which government departments should benefit from their taxes .
Justice is wholly administered by public servants and accessible to all , with tribunals and juries of ordinary citizens determining right or wrong , guilt or innocence .
There are constitutional protections for the environment , national heritage and agriculture .
Social welfare and contingencies for states of emergency are covered … and so on .
My second core document , an Ethical Guide , is included because I do not believe there is any place in modern government for established religion .
Whilst the People ’s Constitution ensures that people would be free to practice any religious belief they choose , this must be qualified by ensuring that if and when that practice conflicts with any part of the constitution , the constitution must prevail .
So the Ethical Guide borrows the humane practices common to most religions , without accepting any of the dogma .
It tries to take the good from religion and exclude the bad .
It suggests the way people should behave , not because of the supposed wishes of some supernatural being whose existence cannot be proven , but simply because the values are of themselves widely recognised to be good and right ; and being a guide and not a law , is not of itself enforceable in law .
I promised at the start of this essay to describe three simple steps to fix our broken political systems .
For anyone reading these words that is true ; but for most there is one other step to take .
Anyone reading these words already knows the system is broken , and therefore does n’t need to learn it – however , almost everyone else does need to learn it , because the little darlings really do n’t know .
So the first step ( of four ) for most people is simply to learn how their world really works .
Then they can catch up with the rest of us .
Step One / Two
Become a Free Democrat .
This does not mean joining anything or buying anything .
It simply means accepting that any citizen , properly informed , should have the right , if they choose , to make the political decisions that affect their life .
Step Two / Three
Join with other Free Democrats and draft a People ’s Constitution that could actually deliver Free Democracy to the people .
Step Three / Four
Either stand in elections yourself as a Free Democrat , or refuse to vote in elections unless there is a Free Democrat candidate standing for whom you could vote .
I have stood in two elections , with very minimal publicity ( I am unemployed so cannot afford expensive advertising ) .
So far I have not been elected , but the last time I tried ( last year ) I received one in every eight votes cast , and that was on a campaign budget of about £ 50 .
At first glance it may appear that just one Free Democrat elected to office is not going to achieve much .
I would dispute that .
Simply competing this way promotes the ideal of Free Democracy , which , to an electorate who has never even considered such an alternative , is a move in the right direction .
When I am eventually elected I will be able to canvass my constituents about any forthcoming council debates and then use my votes in those debates according to the majority wish of those constituents — even if I personally disagree with their wishes .
Crude I know , but it would be a start , because although admittedly it would be pretty ineffective , it would be hugely symbolic : it would be the opportunity to start delivering to the voter the service we know they should have — direct control over political decision making .
We CAN fix things .
We CAN use the existing system to replace it with a better one .
It is time to start doing so .

Practical Django Projects and Django 1.0
I recently purchased a copy of “ Practical Django Projects ” , by James Bennett , with the intention of diving straight in and learning Django .
I ’d prepared for this daring feat of code - ninjutsu [ yes , that ’s the correct spelling ] with a crash course in Python via “ Dive Into Python ” , by Mark Pilgrim .
This appears to have been the correct choice , as I ’ve already acquired a confident grasp of the concepts and techniques of Django in less than a few days of playing with it ( granted ; with the odd reference look - up on http://www.djangobook.com/ and http://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/).
However , last night it all went a bit wrong when I upgraded my local version of Django from 0.96 to 1.0 …
Most of my issues were due to the fact that some of the code in the examples , included in Practical Django Projects , was now out of date .
However , I had expected this ( thanks to warnings from Cyril Doussin and Steve Webster ) and went about fixing the problems using the informative Porting Guide on the Django documentation site .
Following my extensive fixes , I was still experiencing issues when decoupling the Admin class from its relevant model .
In most cases , this was a relatively easy process , but in one particular situation , where I had used edit_inline and needed to update the method to use the new InlineModelAdmin objects , I had a slightly confusing issue : I needed to add the InlineModelAdmin object to one of the django.
contrib applications â€ ” FlatPage â€ ” to get the SearchKeyword application to work .
After a short period googling , I found an interesting , well - written blog post by Jason Broyles , “ Add InlineModelAdmin to a django.contrib app ” .
Unsurprisingly , it seemed others had had exactly the same issue .
Jason ’s final model.py and admin.py files were as follows :
# models .py from django.db import models from django.contrib.flatpages.models import FlatPage class SearchKeyword ( models .
Model ) : keyword = models .
CharField( max_length=50 ) page = models .
ForeignKey ( FlatPage ) def __unicode__( self ) : return self .
keyword
# admin.py from django.contrib import admin from cms.search.models import SearchKeyword from django.contrib.flatpages.models import FlatPage from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ class SearchKeywordInline(admin.StackedInline ) : model = SearchKeyword extra = 3 max_num = 6 class FlatPageAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin ) : fieldsets = ( ( None , {' fields ' : ( 'url ' , ' title ' , ' content ' , ' sites ' ) } ) , ( _( ' Advanced options ' ) , {' classes ' : ( ' collapse ' , ) , ' fields ' : ( ' enable_comments ' , ' registration_required ' , ' template_name ' ) } ) , ) list_display = ( 'url ' , ' title ' ) list_filter = ( ' sites ' , ' enable_comments ' , ' registration_required ' ) search_fields = ( ' url ' , ' title ' ) inlines = [ SearchKeywordInline , ] admin.site.unregister( FlatPage ) admin.site.register( FlatPage , FlatPageAdmin )
Jason followed these examples with the following explanation :
The above admin.py file will make it so the SearchKeyword model is accessible in the FlatPages admin interface .
It does this by first creating the SearchKeywordInline class and adding it to a new FlatPage ModelAdmin function .
I also did n't want to loose out on any of the extra options from the default django.contrib.
flatpages
ModelAdmin so I copied lines 6 and 14 - 20 from it and added the code to my file .
Line 23 then unregisters the default FlatPage ModelAdmin and line 24 registers this new one with my inlines included .
This solution fixed my problems , however I was concerned that copying and pasting code from django.contrib.
flatpages
ModelAdmin to admin.py was a massively inelegant solution .
With that in mind , I came up with the following solution using inheritance :
# admin.py from django.contrib import admin from cms.search.models import SearchKeyword from django.contrib.flatpages.models import FlatPage from django.contrib.flatpages.admin import FlatPageAdmin from django.utils.translation import ugettext_lazy as _ class SearchKeyword_Inline(admin.TabularInline ) : model = SearchKeyword extra = 3 max_num = 6 class FlatPageAdmin( FlatPageAdmin ) : inlines = [ SearchKeyword_Inline ] admin.site.unregister( FlatPage ) admin.site.register( FlatPage , FlatPageAdmin )
This worked perfectly .
As a final note , I ’d just like to thank Jason for posting his solution ; without that much needed information , I probably would have spent a lot more time trying to fix the issue than was really required .
It just goes to show that developers that blog are a huge benefit to confused developers everywhere .
THE INCIDENT
WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR :
- Very recently an anonymous poster on /b/ claimed to have hacked Sarah Palin 's Yahoo e-mail account .
- Sarah Palin used the e-mail address gov.sarah@yahoo.com for public communication .
Several media outlets have confirmed this fact prior to this " incident " .
SOURCE : http://thinkprogress.org/2008/09/10/palin-email-privilege/
SOURCE : http://www.commondreams.org/headline/2008/09/15-7
- The e-mail address that the poster hacked was gov.palin@yahoo.com .
This second e-mail address , previously unknown publicly , was used for private communcations .
- Yahoo e-mail addresses , unlike .gov e-mail addresses , are not subject to archiving and oversight .
This fact has led to controversy from several sources , including fellow Republicans , asking her to release e-mails from her Yahoo account .
- The anonymous poster apparently panicked , and released the password onto /b/.
- Several other posters on /b/ took screenshots of the Inbox and various e-mails .
- Some of the screenshots reference several people in Alaska state government .
One of these people is Sean Parnell , Lieutenant Governor of Alaska .
Parnell mentions KFQD Radio's Dan Fagan , to whom he gave an interview about Palin's ACES initiative .
Lt. Gov. Parnell 's e-mail address is verified via an Alaska Republican Central Committee contact listing .
SOURCE : http://gov.state.ak.us/aces/
SOURCE : http://www.alaskarepublicans.com/centralcommittee.aspx
- One of the screenshots references the Yahoo account fek9wnr , Todd Palin , Sarah 's husband who is at the heart of the controversy over her use of Yahoo e-mail for public dealings .
The fek9wnr account was verified as being Todd Palin via a public posting to an automotive enthusiast BBS from August 2006 .

- Several photographs of her family were allegedly downloaded from the e-mail account .
- A scan of profiles .yahoo.com put gov.palin@yahoo.com 's profile update date at 04/05/2008 , long before any VP nod was apparent .
If this were a fake , the perpetrator would 've had to travel into the past and create an account or be very good at guessing who the VP candidate would be 5 + months later , not to mention faking an overwhelming amount of e-mails , photographs , verified private cellphone numbers , and other information .
- A good samaritan in the /b/ thread reset the password account with the intention of handing it over to Palin , a process known on /b/ as " white knighting " .
This locked everyone else out of the account .
The " white knight " posted a screenshot to /b/ of his pending message to one of Palin 's contacts about how to recover the account , but made the critical mistake of not blanking out the new password he set .
- Several other people in the /b/ thread then apparently logged in using this new password , and they all attempted to reset the password at once , causing a security trap at Yahoo to automatically put a 24 - hour lockout on the account .
THE AFTERMATH :
- Sarah Palin was likely notified of the breach by morning , as she had then deleted both the gov.sarah@yahoo.com address ( the one subject to the disclosure controversy in the media ) as well as the gov.palin@yahoo.com address ( the one that was hacked ) .
- The outright deletion of the accounts can be verified by attempting to pull up the public profile on both addresses , which both existed during the incident .
SOURCE : http://profiles.yahoo.com/gov.palin
SOURCE : http://profiles.yahoo.com/gov.sarah
- Both accounts were deleted simultaneously , thus linking the publicly - known e-mail address " gov.sarah " and the private e-mail address " gov.palin " .
- This outright deletion may have the potential to be viewed as destruction of evidence , considering that the e-mails in the now - deleted accounts are the subject of several legal controversies .

- Several ZIP , RAR , and 7Z compilations of the downloaded screenshots , contacts , and photos were made available by anonymous individuals .
- 4 chan is actively ( some say over - actively ) banning and deleting any posts of the screenshots of Palin 's account , contacts , or family photos .
- An anonymous poster to 420 chan , using information from the e-mail account 's contact list , attempted to call Bristol Palin 's cellphone number using the AT&T phone relay service .
Several others allegedly called the cellphone number itself and got Bristol 's voicemail .
These posts were quickly deleted by 420 chan moderators .
- A poster on /b/ did a lookup on the cellphone number which returned this information :
Type : Cell Phone
Provider : Dobson Cellular Systems
Location : Palmer , AK
- An anonymous individual has uploaded some of the screenshots to a photobucket account .

Humans are hardwired to love the sweet , savory and salty foods that provide the energy , protein and electrolytes we need .
In an age of mass - produced products laden with sugar and salt , however , our taste proclivities can readily bring on obesity , heart disease and type 2 diabetes — all among society ’s biggest health problems .
The battery electric
Based on the previous Smart , more than 100 of these battery - electric prototypes have been built by Zytec in Fradley , Staffordshire , and are now being released on a four - year nationwide trial .
The high - temperature , molten - salt battery is a natrium - nickel - chloride unit made by MES - DEA of Switzerland and mounted under the floor where the fuel tank sits in a conventional Smart .
Its rated output is 15.5 kW / hrs and it weighs 302lb .
It runs permanently at temperatures of between 260 and 330 degrees centigrade and keeping the unit to that temperature takes between 10 and 15 per cent of the battery 's capacity .
Nevertheless , these so - called Zebra batteries are robust , with a proven long life and good resistance to overcharging .
The 30 kW /41 hp brushless , liquid - cooled DC motor is designed and built by Zytek , with the motor , the inverter and its controlling electronics in one housing that fits neatly onto the three standard engine mountings .
A conventional transmission is retained , but it is locked into second gear ; there 's no need for more given the torque delivery characteristics and 12,000rpm peak operating speed of the electric motor .
The top speed is 75 mph , 0 - 37 mph takes 5.7sec ( the same as the petrol version ) and while the typical range in everyday use will be about 50 miles , gentle driving can extend that to 70 .
The key to this is gentle acceleration and braking , as the car will recycle the braking energy as current if you do n't hit the anchors too hard .
The battery can be recharged via a conventional 220/240 volt domestic socket - it takes eight hours for a full charge from empty , three - and - a - half hours to charge it from 30 to 80 per cent of its capacity .
On the European Combined cycle , power consumption is about 12 kW / hrs per 62 miles and at current values that costs about 0.02 euros per kilometre ( 2.6 pence per mile ) .
The battery can be recharged at least 1,000 times , which in normal use gives a life of about 10 years .
Inside , the battery Smart is almost identical to its petrol sister ; there 's no gear lever , of course , and there is a charge - level indicator in the middle of the instrument binnacle , but that 's about it .
Starting takes no more than five seconds after a systems check , then it's a simple case of push the pedal and go .
Initial acceleration is scorching as the traction motor delivers all its 88.5 lb ft of torque to the rear wheels from virtually zero revs .
It sounds pathetic to say so , but the electric Smart surges off so quickly it 's quite difficult to manoeuvre in tight places , so you need to learn to cover the brake with your left foot .
In common with other electric cars , you also need to learn to use the horn , as pedestrians simply do n't hear the little car coming .
There is some noise from the driveline in the form of a high - pitched whine , but it is far quieter than some hydrogen fuel - cell cars I have driven .
The standard Smart is hardly the acme of ride quality and with an additional 220 lb ( 110kg ) on board , the electric version is possibly worse , though not by much .
On smooth roads this volt - powered two - seater is fine but the individual wheel suspension rates are high ; it crashes into pot-holes and sleeping policeman are an experience best forgotten .
The electrically powered air - conditioning system , in addition , is a joke .
But in its natural urban environment , the electric Smart is a hoot .
The limited top speed is never a problem and there 's enough instant surge to go for gaps in the traffic .
It 's also reassuring that the Smart has a four - star crash safety rating .
Fans of pure battery - electric technology always seem to have a blind spot about what lies beyond the plug , in other words where the electricity comes from ; most " electric " vehicles are actually coal , gas or nuclear powered .
That said , the terms of the Smart trial insist that the cars be charged from a carbon - neutral or offset electricity supply .
Companies and organisations interested in test - driving one of the electric Smarts must apply to Mercedes - Benz in Milton Keynes ; costs are currently running at £ 380 a month for the lease plus the electricity to charge it .
GOP lawmakers sue to stop Palin investigation RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday September 16 , 2008
Print This Email This JUNEAU , Alaska ( The Associated Press ) - Five Republican state lawmakers filed suit Tuesday to end the bipartisan investigation into Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's firing of the public safety commissioner even though the vice presidential candidate once said she welcomed the probe into allegations of abuse of power .
The lawsuit called the investigation " unlawful , biased , partial and partisan . "
None of the lawmakers who filed the suit in Anchorage Superior Court serves on the bipartisan Legislative Council that unanimously approved the investigation .
The scandal known as " Troopergate " gained national attention after Republican presidential candidate John McCain chose Palin as his running mate .
Since then , Palin and the McCain campaign have sought to distance Palin from the controversy and have taken actions that could slow its resolution until after the November election .
Palin fired public safety commissioner Walt Monegan in July .
Weeks later , it emerged that Palin , her husband , Todd , and several high - level staffers had contacted Monegan about state trooper Mike Wooten , who had gone through a nasty divorce from Palin 's sister before Palin became governor .
While Monegan says no one from the administration ever told him directly to fire Wooten , he says their repeated contacts made it clear they wanted Wooten gone .

SUNNYVALE , California ( Reuters ) - Yahoo
Inc is moving ahead on Thursday with a radical redesign of its home page -- the most heavily trafficked site on the Web -- making changes that give users a personalized view of the wider Web .
An undated screenshot of the new Yahoo home page .
REUTERS / Handout
The Internet media giant is under the gun to deliver on year - old promises to transform Yahoo from a network of more or less insular properties into “ starting points ” that help consumers quickly navigate their way to the rest of the Web .
“ We are going to put what matters to you most at your fingertips , ” said Tapan Bhat , the senior vice president in charge of “ front doors ” -- the main destinations at Yahoo , including Yahoo.com , MyYahoo and the Yahoo toolbar .
The new Yahoo home page features a tab on the left hand column of the page with sophisticated links to the user ’s 10 or 20 favorite sites .
It functions as an alternative to navigation methods like bookmarks , link bars or browser tabs , he said .
In its simplest sense , Yahoo is blending the broadcast , editorially - controlled view that Yahoo.com has long offered with the personalized , self - selected view of information that the company ’s MyYahoo service has long offered .
It mixes things users know they want , with the serendipitous or unexpected .
“ For the first time , we are going to marrying those two to take the best of both , ” Bhat promised .
The changes , which Yahoo is testing on only a small group of users initially , will lead to a full - scale overhaul later .
Two years ago , the last such redesign of Yahoo.com took up to six months to fully implement , the Yahoo executive said .
The makeover of Yahoo.com marks the company ’s 14 - year evolution from the Web ’s pioneering directory of sites to an index of links to a search navigation tool to a complex media destination site .
A spokeswoman said Yahoo planned to invite a random sample of its users amounting to less than 1 percent of audience .
The tests will be conducted in Britain , France , India and the United States , Bhat said .
The new home page relies on slick personalization technology that allows users who have signed into their Yahoo account to see when new information arrives not just on Yahoo sites , like e-mail or news , but off - Yahoo on sites such as eBay Inc auctions or Google Inc ’s Gmail service .
Instead of whisking people to these sites , users can see a preview of the information while staying on the home page , which allows them to quickly navigate across a range of their favorite sites .
The Yahoo home page attracts around 100 million U.S. users a month and 300 million worldwide , Bhat said .
Yahoo is relying on new technology it calls the Content Optimization Knowledge Engine to help its computers determine what the most engaging content may be to a specific user , then serve it up based on their prior surfing habits .
Relevant ads tied to users ’ particular interests are delivered as well .
SLOWLY MOVING THE MOUNTAIN
Yahoo is moving carefully with this personalized approach in the knowledge that less than 15 percent of its user base subscribe to its existing MyYahoo personalization service .
“ It is a leaner look , it is more user friendly , ” said Caroline Dangson , an analyst with market research firm IDC in Framingham , Massachusetts , who was briefed on the changes .
But Dangson said the collective judgment of IDC researchers is that Yahoo has made a series of very exciting announcements over the past year , but has been slow to deliver on any of its promises to open up and transform how its sites function .
The more than 500 million or so monthly users of Yahoo properties have little if nothing to see of these ambitious plans to date .
“ These are announcements .
But when does this really roll out ? ”
Dangson asks of the new home page design .
And while Yahoo moves carefully so as not to anger its base of hundreds of millions of visitors , many of its biggest rivals have made sweeping changes in their own sites , Dangson said .
These include Microsoft Corp ’s MSN , Time Warner Inc ’s AOL , Facebook and News Corp MySpace , everyone it seems , except Google , Dangson said .
Some of those makeovers have frustrated users who prefer “ classic ” versions of their favorite sites , she said , adding to the caution of Yahoo , which attracts some of the biggest audiences on the Web to Yahoo.com , Yahoo News and Yahoo Mail .
The real test of the success or failure of the Yahoo home page redesign will only come when the company opens up Yahoo.com to let independent developers create their own applications to work on Yahoo.com , Dangson said .
That where Google , Facebook and MySpace all are further along , she said .
Separately , in a bid to shore up morale within a company that has been besieged by competition , a tough advertising market and the so far unwonted takeover gestures of Microsoft , Yahoo has introduced a campaign to encourage employees to dress in purple -- the company ’s primary color -- at work .
I hate knocking on my boss ’s door .
I hate it even more when I have to beg for money so I can buy a reagent / reactant .
Fortunately for him , I ’ve been good though in my years as a graduate student ( relative to other colleagues ) .
Why buy the acid chloride when we have 3 L of SOCl 2 and a kilo of the carboxylic acid ?
Similarly , why pay $ 200 / night for a hotel room on the Strip in Vegas when we can pay $ 75.95 on a side street ?
I call my actions “ pennywise ” ; my wife calls them “ cheap . ”
The reality of research , especially for a fledgling group , is the almighty dollar .
All of the countless columns , long hours and the associated b.s. yields more breakthroughs and , with them , more papers .
With more papers comes more exposure ; with more exposure comes more money ( i.e. for the University , unless you know a damn good IP attorney…à la Robert Holton ) .
So , we work long ours , run numerous columns , attempt to cure cancer , etc. , and at the end of the road , what ’s left ?
Typically , a meeting with your boss where he says the following gem : “ The American Cancer Society ranked our proposal 6th out of 47 .
So , I ’m glad about that .
But they ’re only funding the top 5 projects . ”
As chemists , we perpetually attempt to improve our standing by spending more hours in the lab , running more columns , washing more disposable test tubes , using other groups NMR time , etc .
I ’ll drag myself back to point by reiterating the old cliché , “ Necessity is the mother of invention . ”
With respect to our research group , as the money tree becomes less fruitful , I ’ve been forced to think outside the box and rely on other methods besides picking up a Sigma - Aldrich catalog .
“ I ’m a synthetic chemist , ” I tell myself , “ I can make crystal meth in my bathtub if I feel so inclined . ”
The overall message is pretty clear : why buy it if you can make it ?
Most synthesis geeks , are probably familiar with Rochester ’s Not Voodoo website — a resource promising to demystify the magic that is organic synthesis .
Out of all of the pages , I ’m a huge fan of , “ Buy it or Make it Yourself . ”
On this page , scientists are encouraged to vote over whether you ’d make LDA or buy it , for example .
While most of these reagents are no-brainers to a synthetic chemist with a few years under his or her belt , what about the borderline reagents ?
Sure , you can buy 9 - BBN , or you can make it from borane and 1,5 - cyclooctadiene ( if your technique is good enough ) .
Are you confident enough to handle as expensive as a task of making Wilkinson ’s catalyst , or is it more advantageous to buy it ?
Would you really derivatize Hoveyda / Grubbs - II or contract Strem to make the water - soluble version ?
Though chemists can argue over whether you should buy or make a reagent , I ’m surprised at how many of my colleagues favor the catalog to the benchtop .
It ’s refreshing to open up a brand new bottle of 6 - methoxytetralone .
But , at what point do you suck it up , make the damn synthon , and save your group $ 200 ?
My philosophy is simple .
While I ’m in grad school , learning new techniques anyhow , why not make a reactant if I can ?
P.S. My previous readers love to play the game “ which one does n’t belong . ”
Good luck with this one :
Yamaguchi , Lester , Corey , Keck , Nicolaou , Buchholz

There ’s actually 2 that do n’t belong .
A U.S. federal judge on Saturday ordered Vice - President Dick Cheney to preserve a wide range of records from his time in office .
The decision by U.S. District Judge Colleen Kollar - Kotelly is a setback for the Bush administration , which has been pushing for a narrow definition of materials that must be safeguarded under the Presidential Records Act .
A private group , Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , is suing Cheney and the Executive Office of the President in an effort to ensure that no presidential records are destroyed or handled in a way that makes them unavailable to the public .
The judge said the administration 's legal position " heightens the court 's concern " that some records may not be preserved .
In a 22 - page opinion , Kollar - Kotelly revealed that in recent days lawyers for the administration balked at a proposed agreement between the two sides on how to proceed with the case .
She said the administration wanted any court order on what records are at issue in the case to cover only the office of the vice - president , not Cheney himself or the other defendants in the lawsuit : the Executive Office of the President and the National Archives .
The lawsuit stems from Cheney 's assertion , first made in 2003 , that his office is not an entity within the executive branch of government .
The suit alleges that the administration 's actions over the past 7 ½ years raise questions over whether the White House will turn over records created by Cheney and his staff to the National Archives when the newly elected administration takes over in January .
The U.S. presidential election is scheduled to take place Nov. 4 .
Iraq will be plunged into a new war if Israel or the US launches an attack on Iran , Iraqi leaders have warned .
Iranian retaliation would take place in Iraq , said Dr Mahmoud Othman , the influential Iraqi MP .
The Iraqi government 's main allies are the US and Iran , whose governments openly detest each other .
The Iraqi government may be militarily dependent on the 140,000 US troops in the country , but its Shia and Kurdish leaders have long been allied to Iran .
Iraqi leaders have to continually perform a balancing act in which they seek to avoid alienating either country .
The balancing act has become more difficult for Iraq since George Bush successfully requested $ 400 m ( £ 200 m ) from Congress last year to fund covert operations aimed at destabilising the Iranian leadership .
Some of these operations are likely to be launched from Iraqi territory with the help of Iranian militants opposed to Tehran .
The most effective of these opponent groups is the Mujahedin - e - Khalq ( MEK ) , which enraged the Iraqi government by staging a conference last month at Camp Ashraf , north - east of Baghdad .
It demanded the closure of the Iranian embassy and the expulsion of all Iranian agents in Iraq .
" It was a huge meeting " said Dr Othman .
" All the tribes and political leaders who are against Iran , but are also against the Iraqi government , were there . "
He said the anti-Iranian meeting could not have taken place without US permission .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Americans disarmed the 3,700 MEK militants , who had long been allied to Saddam Hussein , at Camp Ashraf in 2003 , but they remain well - organised and well - financed .
The extent of their support within Iran remains unknown , but they are extremely effective as an intelligence and propaganda organisation .
Though the MEK is on the State Department 's list of terrorist groups , the Pentagon and other US institutions have been periodically friendly to it .
The US task force charged by Mr Bush with destabilising the Iranian government is likely to co-operate with it .
In reaction to the conference , the Iraqi government , the US and the International Committee of the Red Cross ( ICRC ) have started secret talks on the future of the MEK with the Iraqi government pressing for their expulsion from Iraq .
Dr Othman , who speaks to the MEK frequently by phone , said : " I pressed them to get out of Iraq voluntarily because they are a card in the hands of the Americans . "
An embarrassing aspect of the American pin-prick war against Iran is that many of its instruments were previously on the payroll of Saddam Hussein .
The MEK even played a role in 1991 in helping to crush the uprising against the Baathist regime at the end of the Gulf war .
The dissidents from Arab districts in southern Iran around Ahwaz were funded by Saddam Hussein 's intelligence organisations , which orchestrated the seizure of the Iranian embassy in London in 1980 which was supposedly carried out by Arab nationalists from Iran .
The one community in Iran most likely to oppose the Tehran government is the Iranian Kurds .
There have been an increasing number of attacks by PJAK , the Iranian wing of the Turkish PKK , which claims to be a separate party .
Based in the Kandil mountains in Iraqi Kurdistan , PJAK has carried out frequent raids into Iran and has reportedly been able to win local support .
But it would be extremely dangerous for the US to be seen as a supporter of PJAK as this would offend the Turks who have a military co-operation agreement with Iran against terrorism .
The city of St. Paul will provide a stage and amplified sound system for people to use near the Xcel Energy Center during the four days of the Republican National Convention .
The stage will be within the public viewing area , a triangle between Fifth St. and the Dorothy Day Center bounded by the westbound lanes of W. 7th St .
That area is where people can gather to express their opinions within earshot and sight of the Xcel , news media outlets and delegates .
" It 's in the Xcel 's field of view , " said police spokesman Tom Walsh .
The city has stressed the need to strike a balance between a safe and secure convention and allowing citizens to be within sight and sound of the delegates .
St . Paul recently won a lawsuit filed by protest groups who had sought a different route and time than the one police gave them .
Citing past court decisions , U.S. District Judge Joan Ericksen ruled that the police and city were granting unprecedented access to the protesters for a convention of a major political party .
Delegates will be getting off their buses near W. 7th and Kellogg , within sight of the public viewing area .
About 35,000 delegates and spectators are expected to attend , and protesters have predicted that as many as 100,000 demonstrators will show up to the event .
The stage will be available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Sept. 1 - 4 , and reservations will be accepted from today until Aug. 11 .
Each person or organization will get 50 minutes of stage time .
The city will provide the sound system , so no outside microphones or equipment are allowed .
" People can speak to whatever they want , " said Brad Meyer , Parks and Recreation Department spokesman .
That said , he added , people need to abide by noise ordinances and other applicable laws .
A permit is required , and applications will be available on the city 's website , www.stpaul.gov, today .
A lottery will determine the schedule , and that takes place Aug. 12 .
The initial schedule will be available Aug. 18 .

Behold , the Tumbler .
This kick - ass replica of the newest Batmobile was built from scratch by Youngbat ( aka Bob Dullam ) .
The functional replica ( it has an engine in there ) was constructed using only photographs and DVD stills for reference , and the whole lot was done in Dullam 's garage .
So far it has cost him somewhere between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000 , and he 's still not done :
The interior is next on Dullam 's list .
When he 's finished , Dullam plans to build a Bat Pod , the crazy dangerous Bat Bike from the new Batman movie , The Dark Knight .

As we mentioned before , the mini -notebook craze could be even hotter than the proverbial egg on a summer sidewalk .
Face it : hot notebooks hurt — especially during shorts season .
No one wants a burn on their legs from a laptop , a keyboard that heats up your fingers , or a mini- notebook that might cause a hot tub–like effect .
So , does the MSI Wind keep its cool compared to other mini-notebooks ?
Let 's find out .
Just like before , we whipped out our Raytek Mini Temp Non-Contact Thermometer Gun and took the temperature at three areas on the Wind : the underside , the keyboard between the G and H key , and the touchpad .
In two out of our three testing areas , the Wind registered temperatures that were closer to our control notebook , a Dell Latitude D630 , than to the other mini-notebooks .
The underside is where the Wind really shined .
It registered a full 21 degrees cooler than the HP Mini-Note and 9 degrees cooler than the Eee PC 4G .
Once again , on keyboard temperature , the Wind was just a few degrees warmer than the Dell notebook and several degrees cooler than the rest of the minis , except for the cool - as - Fonzie CloudBook .
Finally , the touchpad is the only area where the Wind seemed to generate significant heat , although it still bested both Eee PCs .
It seems that the Wind 's CPU is located beneath the touchpad , which would account for its toasty temperature .

What the middle class needs most is not lower income taxes but a slowdown in the soaring inflation of health - care costs .
If health - insurance costs had risen 50 percent rather than 100 percent over the Bush years , middle - income voters would have enjoyed a pay raise instead of enduring wage stagnation .
John McCain ’s health plan , which emphasizes tax changes to encourage employees to buy their own insurance rather than rely on employers , is a start  but only the very beginning of a start .
Some Republicans have brought great energy to this problem .
In the Senate , Robert Bennett of Utah has written a bill with the Oregon Democrat Ron Wyden that would require employers to “ cash out ” employer - provided health care  and then midwife a national insurance marketplace in which employees would join plans that offered more price control and price transparency .
Mitt Romney in Massachusetts put an end to the tax disadvantage that hammers consumers who buy health care directly rather than through their employers .
Rudy Giuliani proposed a federal law to enable low - cost insurers in states like Kentucky to sell their products across state lines in high - cost states like New Jersey .
But it remains unfortunately true that the Republican Party as a whole regards health care as “ not our issue ”  and certainly less exciting than another round of tax reductions .
Unlike liberals , conservatives are not bothered by the accumulation of wealth as such .
We should be more troubled that the poor remain so poor .
With all due respect to the needs of employers , Republicans need to recognize that the large - scale import of unskilled labor is part of the problem .
Meanwhile , the argument over same - sex marriage has become worse than a distraction from the challenge of developing policies to ensure that as many children as possible grow up with both a father and a mother in the home .
Over the past 30 years , governments have effectively worked to change attitudes about smoking , seat - belt use and teenage pregnancy .
Changing attitudes about unmarried childbirth may prove more difficult .
Yet it is a fact that the only way to escape poverty is to work consistently  and that even after welfare reform , low - skilled single parents work less consistently than the main breadwinner in a low - skilled dual - parent household .
At the same time , conservatives need to ask ourselves some hard questions about the trend toward the Democrats among America ’s affluent and well educated .
Leaving aside the District of Columbia , 7 of America ’s 10 best - educated states are strongly “ blue ” in national politics , and the others ( Colorado , New Hampshire and Virginia ) have been trending blue .
Of the 10 least - educated , only one ( Nevada ) is not reliably Republican .
And so we arrive at a weird situation in which the party that identifies itself with markets , with business and with technology cannot win the votes of those who have prospered most from markets , from business and from technology .
Republicans have been badly hurt in upper America by the collapse of their onetime reputation for integrity and competence .
Upper Americans live in a world in which things work .
The packages arrive overnight .
The car doors clink seamlessly shut .
The prevailing Republican view  “ of course government always fails , what do you expect it to do ? ”  is not what this slice of America expects to hear from the people asking to be entrusted with the government .
It is probable that the trend to inequality will grow even stronger in the years ahead , if new genetic techniques offer those with sufficient resources the possibility of enhancing the intelligence , health , beauty and strength of children in the womb .
How should conservatives respond to such new technologies ?
The anti-abortion instincts of many conservatives naturally incline them to look at such techniques with suspicion  and indeed it is certainly easy to imagine how they might be abused .
Yet in an important address delivered as long ago as 1983 , Pope John Paul II argued that genetic enhancement was permissible  indeed , laudable  even from a Catholic point of view , as long as it met certain basic moral rules .
Among those rules : that these therapies be available to all .
Ensuring equality of care may become inseparable from ensuring equality of opportunity .
Equality in itself never can be or should be a conservative goal .
But inequality taken to extremes can overwhelm conservative ideals of self - reliance , limited government and national unity .
It can delegitimize commerce and business and invite destructive protectionism and overregulation .
Inequality , in short , is a conservative issue too .
We must develop a positive agenda that integrates the right kind of egalitarianism with our conservative principles of liberty .
If we neglect this task and this opportunity , we wo n’t lose just the northern Virginia suburbs .
We will lose America .
No one ever believed the Americans ’ explanation of why they wanted to base interceptor missiles in Poland , of all places , some 20 years after the fall of the Soviet empire  not even the Americans .
The idea , said Washington , is to defend the Poles against the alleged threat of an attack from Iran , which has yet to exhibit any hostile intentions toward Warsaw , and in fact does not even possess the sort of missiles the new system is designed to intercept .
Putin ’s pained response 
“ We are being told the anti-missile defense system is targeted against something that does not exist .
Does n’t it seem funny to you , to say the least ? ”  showed signs of the sort of exasperation that reached a crescendo last week with the Russian counterstrike against Georgia ’s invasion of South Ossetia .
Since Bill Clinton invaded the Balkans and severed Kosovo from the Yugoslav torso , the incredibly patient Russians had stoically endured years of abuse , insults , and increasingly open belligerence directed at the Kremlin .
Yet still they tried to have normal relations with the West .
The turning point was reached only recently , as the Americans defended the Georgian invasion of South Ossetia and implicitly justified the murder of a dozen Russian soldiers , who were on a UN - sanctioned peacekeeping mission .
The War Party has had a hard - on for Putin ever since the run-up to our Iraq misadventure , when the Russian leader opposed the drive to war , tried to buy time for the Iraqis via the UN , and openly mocked the lies that rationalized the whole disaster .
Back in the spring of 2003 , when the hunt for those famed " weapons of mass destruction " was becoming too much of an embarrassment even for the coalition of the willingly duped , Putin let loose at a London press conference with Tony Blair :
" Two weeks later they still have not been found .
The question is , where is Saddam Hussein ?
Where are those weapons of mass destruction , if they were ever in existence ?
Is Saddam Hussein in a bunker sitting on cases containing weapons of mass destruction , preparing to blow the whole place up ? "
The Times of London described Blair as standing there " grim - faced . "
What a lovely sight it must have been !
That alone , given the British temperament , is reason never to forgive the Russian leader , but Western animus directed at Putin predates the Iraq war , and is rooted in the Russian leader ’s personal character .
Putin ’s predecessor , Boris Yeltsin , gave the West an easy time of it .
Continuously drunk throughout most of his reign , the formerly minor Communist apparatchik plunged his crisis - stricken nation  still reeling from the impact of the Communist implosion  into a crash program of what might be called Bizarro economics , with predictable results .
Bizarro World , as you ’ll recall , is an alternate universe where all natural laws are inverted and common sense is turned on its head : up is down , right is left , and the winners of auctions are the lowest bidders , not  as in our world  the highest .
This last example applies directly to what occurred under Yeltsin ’s regime , at his direction : " auctions " of property formerly owned by the government and / or the Communist Party were won by those with the most political influence at the court of Czar Boris , not necessarily those who bid highest .
Yeltsin sold off the assets of the nation cheap , often to the lowest bidder ; even more often there was only one bidder .
This is how control of the national assets passed from the old Communist Party to the children of the old Communist Party elite , who were now " businessmen , " albeit a lot closer in type to Al Capone than to Bill Gates .
Having seized control of much of the nation ’s industry  the oil sector , the banks , the electrical grid , the trade in aluminum , precious metals , and big item manufactured goods , like cars  these " oligarchs , " as they came to be called , became powers unto themselves .
Setting up their own regional and industry - wide fiefdoms , they allied themselves with various criminal gangs , thus acquiring an army of enforcers .
As Yeltsin stumbled about in a stupor , this union of the oligarchs with the Russian Mafia established a center of power that quickly came to rival the Kremlin .
The country was sinking into chaos when Yeltsin finally succumbed to the ravages of his vices .
Before he bowed out , however , he had one more moment of glory .
Yeltsin ’s first such moment marked the takeoff of his career as a politician , when he stood on the barricades in front of the Russian parliament and declared that the Soviet coup - plotters  who sought the overthrow of Soviet reformer Mikhail Gorbachev  would not pass .
This gesture propelled him into the presidency after Gorbachev ’s exit , forever after imbuing a weak leader  who presided over the most precipitous national decline seen since the sudden demise of the Aztecs  with an aura of patriotic heroism .
The end of his career , too , was punctuated by Yeltsin rising to the occasion , and , in a moment of clear - eyed sobriety , actually serving the interests of his country , by designating Putin as his heir .
Perhaps it was Yeltsin ’s way of confessing and atoning for his crimes , because Putin immediately moved against the oligarchs , and this was his first great sin in Western eyes , the beginning of the long campaign to defame him as Stalin reborn .
This , of course , is what those who want to keep Russia weak and properly compliant would say about any strong leader in the Kremlin .
Yeltsin , surrounded by a host of American advisers and in a state of constant inebriation , was a pushover .
Putin is anything but , and therein lies the real source of the bile directed at him by Western governments and their attendant elites , especially in the U.S. and Britain .
The oligarchs found themselves hated in Russia as much as they were valorized in the Western press .
With huge bank deposits overseas , where they stowed away most of their ill - gotten wealth , they fled Russia a few steps ahead of the law as their various acts of embezzlement , intimidation , and even murder were uncovered and prosecuted .
Upon their arrival in the West  many fled to Britain , where they quickly gave sagging real estate values a big shot in the arm  they were hailed as brave political " dissidents " in the tradition of Solzhenitsyn and Sakharov .
For the past decade or so they ’ve been agitating for regime - change in Moscow , to which they dream of returning in triumph , regaining their " rightful " place at the pinnacle of power .
The revival of the cold war is proving very useful to this crowd , which is behind much of the anti-Russian propaganda that has filled the airwaves for the past few years .
Economic factors also play a major role .
The sudden resurgence of Russia on account of its status as a major oil producer has got the Americans and the Brits in a real lather , as their economies respectively plummet into the depths of what some are calling another Great Depression .
Russia ’s prosperity sticks in their collective craw , and , in response , the Russophobes have developed an entirely novel theory of political economy , which is an outgrowth of the environmentalist fad and the extreme nationalism of our ruling elites .
It is the absurd idea that any and all countries that depend on oil to generate the bulk of their national income are unnatural , inherently flawed , and even intrinsically aggressive and a threat to the security of the West .
Oil - producing states are inclined , by their very nature , to authoritarianism , they argue , although somehow I do n’t think they mean the state of Texas .
The Bizarro World " logic " of this new economic fallacy is based on the concept that oil is , somehow , not a commodity like any other , that it has some special status over and above all others , and yet this is clearly not the case .
Oil  like wheat , cow ’s bellies , and platinum  is subject to market forces and is unevenly distributed geographically .
The economic arrangements that go into the production , distribution , and sale of oil are not fundamentally different from those related to any other commodity , from bananas to high - grade steel .
The U.S. has been a major oil producer , at least in the past , and that did n’t distort or retard our economic and political development : quite the contrary , it fueled a new era of industrial and intellectual innovation , freeing the individual from the land and inaugurating a new era of political and economic liberalism .
Yet now we are told that oil is a curse that empowers tyrants , who ca n’t be entrusted with such a precious commodity in any event .
This is what is behind much of the buzz against Putin ’s Russia , flush with oil revenues , and the real source of friction between the Kremlin and the West .
It is pure nonsense , economically , but , then again , like most war propaganda , it does n’t have to make sense ; it only has to demonize the enemy from as many different angles as possible .
Congruent with this oil - as - the - root - of - illiberalism thesis is the idea that the Russians and the Chinese , along with their clients and allies , constitute a new pole of ideological attraction , in opposition to the liberal democracy of the West .
In true Bizarro World style , this gets it completely wrong .
Looked at in terms of the last hundred years , or so , it is Russia  which threw off the yoke of the most oppressive regime in modern times  that is moving in the direction of freedom , and the West  where the surveillance state is a fact of modern life , and that document known as the U.S. Constitution is just a scrap of paper  that is moving toward authoritarian rule .
As for China , it has progressed from the Cultural Revolution to the Beijing Olympics in less than the historical blink of an eye .
The U.S. and its allies in Eastern Europe and the Caucasus seem determined to provoke the Russian bear into a confrontation , and the crisis over South Ossetia is just the beginning .
As I have warned in this space for what seems like an eternity , a new cold war between the U.S. and Russia is a project dear to the War Party ’s heart  and it seems to have come to full fruition in the past week or so .
The War Party never sleeps  they ’ve always got a new angle up their sleeves , a new " Hitler " who must be crushed in the name of democracy and decency , and against whom all the resources of the West must be mobilized  until a new enemy is found .
The latest such enemy is Putin ’s Russia , specifically , Putin himself , who is now being characterized as a hybrid monster , an authoritarian admixture of Hitler and Stalin .
Aside from an upsurge in the profits reaped by the makers of armaments , the revival of the cold war also means that the Kremlinologists of old will be back in fashion in Washington  and that all those doctoral dissertations on the history of the Czechoslovakian Communist Party were not written in vain .
The cold war was n’t just an era , it was also an entire industry , consisting of high - level policy wonks , professional anti-Communists and domestic subversive - hunters , as well as the military - industrial complex , which generously subsidized the activities of the former .
This whole network collapsed , along with international communism , back in the 1990s , but anti-Putinism will bring it back to life , thus providing employment for a certain narrow segment of the population , even if the rest of us are selling pencils in the streets .
The Western media is in truly high dudgeon , these days , inveighing against Putin and newly " authoritarian " Russia , but this narrative is belied by the facts .
As one analyst writing on the blog of the Foreign Policy Association put it :
" What is troubling is the U.S. media ’s willingness to similarly toe the party line , but in the absence of any of the coercive measures , such as the state censorship , that the Russian press endures .
There have been no William Dunbars on CNN , despite the fact that every report I ’ve seen on the channel yesterday had been framed as ‘ Russian invasion , ’ with endless clips of Saakashvili alleging Russian crimes , etc. , in a loop of totally pro-Georgian coverage .
Georgia is a key U.S. ally , the 3rd largest troop contingent in Iraq , and occupies a strategic , oil rich zone .
The self - policing in the U.S. media , which has basically been uncritically promoting government talking points , is very disturbing . "
Go read the whole piece , which is unsigned .
It ’s about how the Russian and Western media combines reported two entirely different wars , which had very little to do with one another .
One explanation is that with Russia moving toward more freedom , in fits and starts , and we in the West moving toward much less , we ’re converging somewhere in midstream .
Indeed , one could make the case that the Americans and their British counterparts are too well - trained to go off - message , while in Russia they still have to be constrained by formal rules and regulations .
Official censorship simply is n’t necessary in the West , because everyone knows what to say  and , more importantly , what not to say .
Yes , it ’s disturbing , but at least from my vantage point , not all that surprising .
Ever since 9/11 , and even predating that signal event , we ’ve been headed in this direction , with the media ( in alliance with demagogic politicians ) policing not only itself but the entire society to make sure no pockets of dissent exist .
Which brings me back , as has been the case for the past week or so , to the subject of Antiwar .com ’s survival .
Yes , we ’re in the midst of our end - of - summer fundraising campaign , and we ’re having a rough time of it .
I ’m not surprised .
Times are bad economically , for most of us , and charitable contributions are down across the board .
Which is all the more reason why it ’s so important that you make your contribution , and make it today : our creditors are knocking on the door , and the challenges we face , in this new era of a revived cold war , are all the more onerous .
The prospects for peace look darker than ever , a fact that only underscores the importance of our work and the continuity of this Web site .
We provide an alternative voice in a time when the conventional wisdom , which is invariably conducive to the War Party ’s agenda , is not just factually wrong , but actively dangerous .
Our task of educating the American people about foreign policy issues from a non-interventionist perspective has never been more vital  nor more endangered by our lack of resources .
We are fighting an uphill battle .
Wo n’t you help us even the playing field , just a little bit ?
The War Party has unlimited resources .
We have you .
We depend on your tax - deductible donations to keep this site going , so we can keep bringing the truth about American foreign policy to the people .
It ’s essential that we make our fundraising goal of $ 70,000 this quarter .
If we do n’t , huge cutbacks in our coverage will be required .
It ’s as simple as that .
Your contribution makes all the difference , so make it today .

Hello , it 's a new species of Pacific iguana
A new species of Pacific iguana has been uncovered by Australian and US researchers , but already its future is looking grim .
In a paper published online in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B , the team shows there are three living species of Brachylophus iguanas , not two as indicated in current taxonomy .
The new species is named Brachylophus bulabula after the Fijian word for hello .
" In the reptile world the Fijian iguanas are iconic , " says lead author Associate Professor Scott Keogh , of the Australian National University 's School of Botany and Zoology .
" To discover a new species of them is very exciting . "
But he says the new species and its cousins are under threat from habitat loss and attacks by feral cats and mongooses .
Already extinct
Two species of the iguana are already extinct , having been eaten out of existence about 2800 years ago by the earliest arrivals on the island , Keogh says .
He says of the surviving three species , the B. vitiensis , , or Fiji crested iguana , is listed as critically endangered and the other two as status unknown , due to lack of information about their numbers .
The new species was uncovered after analysis of the mitochondrial DNA of 61 iguanas from 13 islands .
The study shows the B. bulabula iguana is genetically and physically different from the two other species .
It has a different coloured nose , is intermediate in size , has a slightly different pattern on its body and is found only in the central region of Fiji .
As part of the research the team also evaluated competing arguments about how the iguana arrived in the Pacific .
He says the Pacific iguanas of the Fijian and Tongan archipelagos are a bio-geographic enigma because their closest relatives are found only in the Americas .
' Floated on some kind of raft '
Keogh says the genetic analysis adds weight to the theory the iguanas " floated on some kind of raft " to the Fijian islands somewhere between 13 to 14 million years ago .
The competing argument suggests the animals came via Asia when Fiji was connected to Melanesia .
" The problem with that is it requires there to be relatives in Asia and there are n't , " he says .
The analysis also shows that with only one exception , every island for which there were samples was represented by at least one distinct iguana lineage .
Keogh says their work is particularly important in helping the Fijian Government find ways to protect the reptile .
The largest grouping of the rare reptiles is found on Yadua Taba , the official reserve for the crested iguana , where some 10,000 iguanas are believed to live .
People cannot say that they did not receive Notice .
Notice is given sometimes by books or movies such as the " Wizard of Oz " ( 1939 ) , " The Matrix " ( 1998 ) , " ' V ' for Vendetta , " ( March 17 , 2006 ) and " The Truman Show " ( 1998 ) staring Jim Carrey whereby Truman ( Carrey ) discovers the Truth and finds a way out of the corporation that intended to take care of all his needs from cradle to grave in exchange for his life in the fiction world .
Herein lies a study of the " Wizard of Oz " in which Notice was given and remains current even to this day .
The following is from the Library of Halexandria :
The Wizard of Oz
The Wizard of Oz was produced as a motion picture in 1939 by Metro - Goldwyn - Mayer .
( Book by L. Frank Baum ; Adaption by Noel Langley ; Screenplay by Florence Ryerson , Noel Langley , and Edgar Allan Woolf ; Lyrics by E. Y. Harburg ; Produced by Mervyn LeRoy ; Directed by Victor Fleming . )
Many people believe that The Wizard of Oz was ( and is ) an allegory for the radically new state of affairs that existed in America in the 1930s , following the stock market crash and the bankruptcy of the United States Government which occurred immediately thereafter .
For all extents and purposes , it can still be viewed as the current state of affairs , inasmuch as the allegorical nature , the clues strewn throughout the story , are still relevant today .
The authors of Redemption in Law , Theory and Practice [ BBC of America , 2000 ] have , for example , provided an interesting interpretation of the story of The Wizard of Oz , one which bears a considerable amount of attention being paid .
Much of what follows , comes from pages 180 to 185 of their book .
The initial setting of the story is , of course , Kansas , the geographical center of the USA , and the symbol for the heartland of America .
The tornado ( twister ) that arrives is all about the whirling confusion that existed after the stock market crash , the theft of the country ’s gold , the US Bankruptcy , and the Great Depression .
The twister takes Dorothy and her dog , Toto , into a new , artificial dimension , above the solid ground of Kansas .
Upon their arrival , Dorothy notes : “ Toto , I have a feeling we ’re not in Kansas anymore . ”
Right on , Dorothy .
After the bankruptcy , Kansas was no longer “ Kansas ” , but now “ KS ” , an artificial corporate venue of the bankrupt US , a newly established “ federal territory ” , and part of the “ Federal Zone ” .
Dorothy and Toto were “ in this state ” , which according to Redemption in Law , implies they were for tax jurisdiction purposes in the “ District of Columbia ” ( aka “ United States ” ) -- whereas Kansas is not included in “ this state ” , “ KS ” is .
One of the first entities Dorothy met was the Scarecrow , who represented the legal Straw Man which had been created as an artificial aspect of the former American sovereigns .
The legal term , Straw Man , describes a fictitious or artificial person created by law at one ’s birth via the inscription in all - capital letters on the birth document / certificate -- the latter being document of title and a negotiable instrument .
It is allegedly by way of the Straw Man that the creditors of the US Bankruptcy can so effectively ( and legally ? ) take for their own use the benefits of individuals ’ labor , creativity , talents , and productivity .
In the movie the Scarecrow , describes his straw - man persona by noting : “ Some people without brains do an awful lot of talking .
Of course , I ’m not bright about doing things . ”
The Scarecrow then succinctly describes himself in the classic song , “ If I Only Had a Brain . ”
The lyrics include : “ I ’d unravel every riddle , For every ‘ individdle , ’ In trouble or in pain . ”
The translation is that for every individual , who discovers the existence of his or her legal Straw Man , all political and legal mysteries , complexities , and confusions begin to be resolved .
And once that same individual takes legal title to his or her Straw Man , he or she can protect themselves from legal trouble or legal damage .
The Tin Man arrives next on the scene .
I.e. the “ T - I - N ” ( Taxpayer Identification Number ) Man is a hollow man of metal , a “ vessel ” or “ vehicle ” , the newly created commercial code words for the Straw Man .
Just as the Scarecrow / Straw Man has no brain , the Tin Man has no heart .
Both are “ artificial persons ” .
Natural person are created by nature or God , while artificial persons are created by human laws , for the purposes of society / government ( “ bodies politic ” or “ corporations ” ) .
One of the definitions in Webster ’s Dictionary is “ counterfeit ” .
Thus the Tin Man might also represent the mechanical and heartless aspect of commerce and commercial law .
As they are reputed to say in the Mafia : “ Nothing personal , it ’s just business . ”
The Tin Man also carries an ax .
Did you ever wonder about that ?
The ax is a traditional symbol for that which is above a King .
In this case , commercial law , i.e. Corporate Rule is above the sovereign !
It ’s not a nice connotation -- any more than the “ Axis Powers ” of World War II included Nazi Germany , Italy ( a fascist state ) and Japan ; or the more recent “ Axis of Evil ” , coined by President George Bush in 2002 , but curiously not yet applied to Cheney , Ashcroft and himself -- the ABC ’s of such .
The Tin Man , expressing relief after Dorothy had oiled his arm , said : “ I ’ve held that ax up for ages . ”
And perhaps he is still having to do so .
For the symbol for fascism is the “ fasces ” , a bundle of rods with an ax bound up in the middle , but with its blade projecting .
This fasces may be found on the American Mercury - head Dime ( the Roman deity Mercury was the God of Commerce ) , and on the wall behind , and on each side of , the speaker ’s podium in the US Senate ( each gold fasces being approximately six feet in height ) .
At the base of the podium of the seal of the US Senate are two crossed fasces .
Hmmmm ...
Dorothy , the Scarecrow and Tin Man are soon joined by the Cowardly Lion .
Known as the “ king of the beasts ” , it ’s surprising to find one so cowardly .
It appears to represent the once - fearless American people who had lost their courage , the courage to denounce the US Bankruptcy , and inform its creditors that they were not the chattel that could be used as collateral for the moneys allegedly owed .
Of course , dealing with the IRS tends to leave most of us in the cowardly state ; but that is due in large part to the heartless , brainless actions of an organization operating strictly under the laws of Commerce .
In order for Dorothy and the gang to find the Wizard ( the supposed answer to their prayers ) , they had to “ follow the yellow brick road . ”
In other words , follow the money -- the trail of the gold taken from America -- and find who had absconded with it .
It ’s important to recall from the beginning of the movie , that the Wizard was represented by a traveling mystic , a “ Professor Marvel , ” whom Dorothy had first encountered when she ran away with Toto .
The Professor ’s shingle claimed that he was “ Acclaimed by the Crowned Heads of Europe , Past , Present , and Future . ”
That ’s quite a claim -- to include the future -- but seems well justified in that the Wizard is still acclaimed by the “ crowned heads of Europe . ”
Before the Banksters looted America , they had already disempowered the monarchies of Europe and looted their kingdoms .
And with a human skull atop the perch above the door to his wagon , the Wizard began to lecture Dorothy about the priests of Isis and Osiris and the days of Egypt ’s pharaohs .
Between 1916 and 1933 , most of America ’s gold was rounded up -- aided by President Franklin Roosevelt ( whose physical problems may well have symbolized America ’s “ crippled state ” ) .
The gold went to The Federal Reserve private Bank , and was shipped off by the Fed owners to England and Germany .
This was accomplished because of the fact Federal Reserve Notes could be redeemed in gold , and their use carried an interest penalty that could also only be paid in gold .
The US traded its gold for paper , while its previous currency , United States Notes , carried no such interest requirement .
When the US Bankruptcy was declared in 1993 , there was the added caveat that all Americans were required to turn in all gold coins , gold bullion , and gold certificates by May 1 --
Our heroine was Dorothy Gale .
Did you know her last name ?
Or that a gale , with the impact of water as well as wind , is considered potentially more powerful than a tornado ?
In any case , when she and her friends emerged from the forest , they were elated to see the Emerald City only a short distance away .
The Wicked Witch of the West , desperate for the ruby slippers that Dorothy was wearing , knew she had to make her move before Dorothy and the others were inside the walls of Emerald City .
But what was so special about Dorothy ’s slippers ?
Was the Wicked Witch an earlier version of Emelda Marcus ?
Or something else ?
Obviously , Dorothy ’s red-colored , ruby slippers were the same color as blood , as in flesh and blood , thus symbolizing a living , breathing man or woman -- i.e. a non-corporation , a natural person .
As such her slippers also symbolized “ private ” as opposed to “ public ” .
( Even a Social InSecurity card uses a red serial number , signifying the private - side account and its attachment to the public - side . )
It is likely the ruby slippers symbolized the blood in the veins of the American people -- as opposed to “ citizens of the United States ” , where the blue and black ink on a birth certificate is the “ corporate blood ” .
The Wicked Witch wanted the life blood of the living human beings -- not just their Straw Men .
Her tactic was to cover the countryside with poppy flowers -- i.e. the source of heroin , opium , and morphine -- symbolically drugging Dorothy , et al into unconsciousness , and then just step in and snatch the slippers .
I.e. dull the senses of the American people and then slip in and swipe the gold .
The drugging worked on Dorothy , the Lion and Toto , the flesh and blood friends , but did not effect the artificial persons of the Scarecrow and Tin Man .
The latter two cried out for help , and the Good Witch of the North came to the rescue with a blanket of snow to nullify the narcotic effect of the poppies on Dorothy , the Lion and Toto .
[ So , who ’s the “ Good Witch of the North ” ?
Perhaps , that remains to be seen . ]
The identity of the Wicked Witch of the West is pretty clear .
Recall that her counterpart in the first part of the film was “ Almira Gulch ” , who supposedly “ owned half the county ” ( or perhaps half the country ) .
Miss Gulch had arrived at Dorothy ’s farm with an “ Order from the Sheriff ” ( an Executive Order from President Roosevelt ? ) demanding that Toto be handed over , because allegedly he had bitten Miss Gulch .
Despite Aunt Em ’s assertion about Toto ( “ He ’s really gentle , with gentle people , that is . ” )
Miss Gulch pressed her case saying that to withhold Toto would be to “ go against the law ” .
When Dorothy refused to surrender toto , Miss Gulch lashed out with , “ If you do n’t hand over that dog I ’ll bring a damned suit that ’ll take your whole farm ! ”
70 % of the attorneys in the world reside in the West -- America .
95 % of all lawsuits in the world are filed under US jurisdiction .
The Wicked Witch of the West ( Miss Gulch ) was dressed in black , the choice of color for judges ’ robes .
Thus she represents judges and attorneys , essentially the American legal system ( including the attorney - run US Congress ) .
These are the executioners and primary henchmen for transferring the wealth of America from the people to the banksters .
The “ Bar ” has a curious history .
It represents the body of attorneys , counselors , judges and the members of the legal profession .
It has been alleged that Black ’s Law Dictionary , for example , is copyrighted British law and that the so - called American Bar Association is a branch or subset of the Bar Council ( the sole bar association in England and Wales ) .
As the copyrighted property of a British company , all state Codes in the US are commercial , private British - owned law .
Attorneys may be even worse , if possible , than we thought !
Apparently , the Wicked Witch of the West is nothing more than an operative of the “ crowned heads of Europe ” ( who are owned by the Banksters ) , and desperately wanted not only the precious metals of America , but the life blood of America ’s labor .
Her counterpart , of course , wanted to take Toto .
The word , Toto , comes from the phrase , “ in toto ” , which according to Black ’s Law Dictionary ( the British “ rule book ” ) is : “ in the whole , completely . ”
In other words , she wanted everything !
Once Dorothy and the gang had encountered the mighty Wizard of Oz , they initially fell for the illusion .
But with Toto ’s aid in pulling back the curtain , they quickly realized the Wizard was nothing more than a con man .
Even when he supposedly helped Scarecrow about getting a “ brain ” , he cited “ the land of ‘ E Pluribus Unum , ’ ” , which is Latin for “ one out of many . ”
This phrase appears of the American One Dollar Bill , but might be thought of as “ converting the many into one ” , i.e. establishing a “ New World Order ” .
The Wizard was also supposedly amenable to taking Dorothy back in his balloon , but ended up leaving her behind .
Fortunately , the Good Witch of the North ( Santa Claus ? ) , stepped in to tell Dorothy , “ You do n’t need to be helped .
You ’ve always had the power to go back to Kansas . ”
All she had to do was to use her slippers !
The contention is that everyone has the right and power to reclaim their Sovereignty , but just forgot .
The actual act of reclamation -- the Remedy and Recourse , is telling the Banksters that you are no longer collateral , i.e. filing with a Secretary of State .
Because the IRS ( Infernal Revenue Service ) is an accountancy firm and collection agency for the private Federal Reserve Bank , having been constituted under the UCC at its inception in 1954 ( and operating strictly in that realm ever since ) , filing or not filing income tax returns becomes an interesting study in itself .
Just be sure to do your own research !
The title of the movie also carries a message .
A “ wizard ” , of course , is “ a very clever or skillful person . ”
“ Oz ” on the other hand is an abbreviation for “ ounces ” , which is always the unit of measurement for gold , silver , and other precious metals .
Even for large quantities of gold , etceteras , the amount is expressed in million ounces of gold , and not tons or pounds .
In the end , Dorothy ( i.e. the American people ) and Toto made it home .
There is , in fact , Remedy and Recourse in law .
It ’s there , disguised , camouflaged , encoded .
( Why do you think States call their statutory laws , “ codes ” and not laws ? )
It ’s a matter of learning the law .
All of it .
It ’s the necessary condition for becoming sovereign once again .
Unless , of course , you ’d prefer to continue to be conned by the Banksters .
The Wizard of Oz is really a delightful movie .
The fact that it symbolizes one of the worst episodes in the world ’s history of the denial of freedom or justice , should not be construed to imply that the movie and story are not entertaining .
In fact , once the symbolic nature is seen and understood , it is a simple step to smile , take the next step to go beyond it , and go forth as if you knew where you were going .
It ’s all just part of The Fool ’s Journey , and the strange path we have each chosen to fulfill our diverse and unique destinies .
We always have that choice !
It ’s called Free Will .
Meanwhile , it is worth while recalling the sage advice of Lao Tzu ( c. 600 B.C.E. ) and more recently and succinctly in our Oz analogy , Frank Zappa ( May 1977 ) :
" The more prohibitions there are , the poorer the people will be . "
" The illusion of freedom will continue as long as it's profitable to continue the illusion .

06-13-08 : ' The Autopsy and Other Tales ' by Michael Shea from Centipede Press ; Agony Column Podcast News Report : Chuck Palahniuk Reads " Loser " at the Sundance Kabuki Theater on May 22 , 2008
Insectile Delight Eye of the fly .
One of the most influential books in my reading development was ' Polyphemus ' by Michael Shea , an Arkham House hardcover from 1987 with wonderful line illustrations by John Stewart .
The stories in ' Polyphemus ' are all over the map , from the cosmic - critter SF of the title tale to the supernatural horror - fantasy of ' Pearls of the Vampire Queen ' to the gritty , intense science fiction horror of ' The Autopsy ' .
This latter story in particular was and remains one of the most memorable and intense reading experiences I 've ever had .
Shea 's creation for this story is certainly a high - point in horror - creature fiction .
Sure , there 's lots of gore in the story , but what really stands out is the conceptual back - story of the monster .
On an intellectual level , this is as horrible as it can possibly get , and Shea 's writing is a big reason why .
Of course , the Arkham first is out of print , and a used copy will set you back some 80 bucks .
Which is why ' The Autopsy and Other Tales ' ( Centipede Press ; Fall 2008 ; $ 95 ) proves to be a pretty good bet .
This book collects all the material in ' Polyphemus ' , including the great illustrations .
Plus it adds a lot of new stuff , including ' I , said the Fly ' ( Which I have rattling around somewhere in a fifty - dollar limited edition ) and Shea 's Lovecraftian novel , ' The Color Our of Time ' .
It 's an oversized volume , with , we are told , " a host of scientific color artwork " .
Recall from our interview that publisher Jerad Walters is a fan of Scream / Press and their gorgeous designs ; check out the cover of the ARC , and you can see why I 'm stoked about this forthcoming collection .
I think the look and feel will match the quality of the content .
But then do the math ; 500 signed , limited editions at $ 95 a pop .
Given the current cost of ' Polyphemus ' ( some 3,000 + copies printed and sold out ) , this seems like a great deal .
But the real deal is that reading this book can seriously damage your mind , and that 's a service worth more than money .
Maybe more than life , or what follows – on a good day .
Agony Column Podcast News Report : Chuck Palahniuk Reads " Loser " at the Sundance Kabuki Theater on May 22 , 2008 : " Maybe it's the Hello Kitty . "
Autograph hound and actual dog .
According to my count , which is quite possibly off , today 's podcast is episode 400 , and if were going to cross a Rubicon , what better way than to podcast a live reading of an unpublished story by Chuck Palahniuk ?
Once again , this comes from the live show with Chuck , so here 's what you get ; " Loser " , then some Q&A with the audience then more contest and a wrap .
Now you might not hear this in the audio , but what we were throwing about were Chuck 's " autograph hounds " .
You 'll need to read ' Snuff ' to figure out why this is so funny or horrific , depending on your perspective , but these doggies were really damned cute !
06-12-08 : Mario Guslandi Reviews ' The Land at the End of the Working Day ' by Peter Crowther ; Agony Column Podcast News Report : Chuck Palahniuk Interviewed Live at the Sundance Kabuki Theater , May 22 , 2008
The Well - Told Tale from the Well
Where everybody knows your game ...
Today , I 'm featuring Mario Guslandi's review of ' The Land at the End of the Working Day ' by Peter Crowther , which he evidently quite enjoyed .
Crowther is clearly one of the most important figures in genre publishing today .
He created PS Publishing , a press that I 've enthusiastically collected to the limits of my financial ability .
Were I to be firmly ensconced in the world of corporate IT , my walls would be lined with duplicates of every PS Publishing title .
You can't go wrong with their books .
The upshot is that it 's easy to think of Crowther as an editor , and forget that he 's one hell of a writer as well .
But I first encountered Crowther as a collaborator with James Lovegrove when I picked up a delightful little paperback horror novel titled ' Escardy Gap ' .
Since then I 've read lots of Crowther 's work , including ' Darkness , Darkness ' ( from Cemetery Dance Publications ) and ' Songs of Leaving ' ( from Subterranean Press ) .
Crowther 's latest is a visit to a style of fiction that I 've long loved .
One of the first science fiction paperbacks I ever bought was Arthur C. Clarke 's ' Tales from the White Hart ' , a collection of stories overheard in a genteel pub .
Pubs may not be so genteel these days , nor are the stories that transpire there .
Here 's Mario's review of Peter Crowther 's ' The Land at the End of the Working Day ' .
I threw in the additional link in case you were busy sipping your brew when the first one came .
Agony Column Podcast News Report : Chuck Palahniuk Interviewed Live at the Sundance Kabuki Theater , May 22 , 2008 : Hosted by The Booksmith
Today 's podcast is the first half of the Chuck Palahniuk show at the Sundance Kabuki Theater , on May 22 , 2008 .
I acted as sort of an emcee and interviewed Chuck on stage .
The event was hosted by the wonderful folks at The Booksmith , a venerable san Francisco Bookstore that has helped Chuck nurutre his career from the get - go .
Our conversation took a very different turn from the one we had in the studio podcast earlier this week .
As an official First Book enthusiast , I asked Chuck about the circumstances and parts of his life that led to his first book , ' Fight Club ' .
As ever , Chuck manages to be both informative and entertaining .
He does use some language that would make this interview unbroadcastable on my NPR affiliate , so be warned , or ( more likely ) look forward to enjoying his ability to use R- rated language in an entertaining manner .
Here 's the link to the MP3 .
I did try to leave the audio pretty much untouched , so you 'll hear a good deal more besides .
The show starts with Chuck explaining what will happen , then a giveaway of some books , then our interview about his First Book , ' Fight Club ' .
Chuck was in fine form and we all had a blast ; now its your turn !
06-11-08 : Robert Scheer Examines ' The Pornography of Power ' ; Agony Column Podcast News Report : William Gibson Phone - In Interview on KUSP
Obscene Authority Guys just wanna have fun .
Every Wednesday , I have something to look forward to .
I 'm a subscriber to the San Francisco Chronicle .
It 's something of a sentimental link ; when I was a kid , my parents lived in the Bay area and they used to subscribe .
When I first relocated up here some mumble years ago , I wrote for their book review section under the talented and busy Pat Holt .
These days , I look forward to their editorial pages because they 're highlighted by David Sirota ( interview , ' Hostile Takeover ' review ) and Robert Scheer , creator of Truthdig.org and one of the mainstays of KCRW 's Left , Right and Center .
Scheer is an extraordinary talent , a man who can write one rant after another , never froth , always stay on target and deliver a killing blow to those whose truths he elects to expose .
So I was quite thrilled to snag the copy of ' The Pornography of Power ' ( Twelve Books / Hachette Book Group ; June 9 , 2008 ; $ 24.99 ) .
Your 25 bucks gets you 237 pages of non-stop , high - tension , heartache - inducing political commentary .
Whether or not you agree with his stance – I think he 's really right - on , for the most part – you have to admire the power of his prose .
Political commentary of this type has no real backstop beyond the lilt and the muscle of the language .
Scheer knows how to the burn a sentence at both ends .
' The Pornography of Power ' starts with words you 'd never expect from Scheer ; " It was odd to be with Richard Nixon alone .
Odder that what he had to say made so much sense , more than the four other presidents I have interviewed . "
Now , Scheer , can't , as he says , " quite bring myself to dedicate this book to Nixon , " but he does allow that Nixon had some ideas that inspired this book .
I suppose that I 'm one of the " younger readers " that Scheer talks about , because frankly it 's not in my living political memory that Nixon was the veep for a true hero , Dwight D. Eisenhower .
Indeed , it 's Eisenhower 's warning about the dangers of the Military - Industrial Complex that inform the backdrop of Scheer 's examination of its consequences here in the 21st century .
From " The Gift of 9/11 " to " $ 75 Billion Under the Sea " ( because nuclear subs are really going to work in the so - called War on Terror ) to " The Humbling of Pax America , " Scheer lays out a vision of a national policy driven by corporate greed with results that are not felicitous to the not - so Silent Majority .
You may think that your interest in this book would entirely depend upon whether or not your political views are aligned with Scheer 's , but that 's not necessarily the case .
Scheer is an inspired writer , and his anger is highly entertaining no matter where its directed .
Passionate , well - crafted prose is always worth reading , especially if it does n't match up with your understanding of the world .
We read to have our opinions challenged , not confirmed .
And even if you think you 're going to agree with Scheer going in , the chances are that he 's going to say something that grates .
You do n't read a book titled ' The Pornography of Power ' for comfort .
This is dis -comfort reading at its finest .
Turn a page and grumble – then get out and do something about it .
The difference between anger and inspiration is merely a matter of perspective .
06-10-08 : A 2008 Interview with Chuck Palahniuk ; William Gibson Phone - In Interview Live on KUSP Tuesday , June 10 , 10 - 11 AM PDT ( TODAY ! )
" It 's shameful and dirty and disgusting "
Smile , you 're on candid camera .
I 've got a lot of Chuck Palahniuk coverage in the coming days , including video of the live interview I did on stage .
The first interview I have to podcast is our studio interview that includes a reading of Chapter 14 from ' Snuff ' , which he explained to me later – on stage – was part of his very first novel .
Palahniuk 's latest novel is both everything you expect it to be – graphically sexual and quite disturbing , weird and creepy on an invasive , interpersonal level – and not at all like you expect , as it rounds out with a rather sweet and innocent love story .
No matter how you shake it , its a compelling page - turner , though , clearly , not for all tastes .
As is this interview .
The material contained herein is quite inflammatory and may offend some listeners , particularly the reading .
Of course , I hope that 's why youre here , to have your brain stirred by the experts , and nobody is better at discomfiting your brain than Chuck Palahniuk .
Needless to say , I dont think this interview is going to air very soon on any radio station , though I may try to see if I can edit around that ... racy stuff .
But if you want to race without edits , then listen up , there 's more and more different stuff to come .

06-09-08 : A 2008 Conversation with Karen Joy Fowler ; William Gibson Phone - In Interview Live on KUSP Tuesday , June 10 , 10 - 11 AM PDT
" I wanted a book about survivors " Springtime for Karen Joy Fowler in Santa Cruz .
Karen Joy Fowler is the storybook example of writer who just can't be pinned down .
She 's one of the most eloquent speakers on the power of genre fiction , but what she writes is truly in the eye of the beholder ; her work is the Sarah Canary of the literary world .
The Science Fiction Writers of America gave her the 2008 Nebula Award for her short story ' Always ' , which is a perfect tie - in to her latest mainstream ( sort of ) novel ' Wit 's End ' .
' The Jane Austen Book Club ' was a major bestseller and a hit movie , but she 's often talked about the similarities of Austen fans and science fiction fans .
She does n't deliberately blur the boundaries like some writers ; for Fowler , the difference comes from within , from her perceptions of the world around her .
Those perceptions are unusual , intelligent and highly entertaining when they rise up in words from the printed page to unfold in readers ' imaginations ; anything she writes is both unique and universally appealing .
Fowler was kind enough o speak to me recently in a gorgeous early - spring day in Santa Cruz .
You can hear the birds chirping and even one low - flying plane , some hotshot trying to get a good view of the California coast .
Here 's the link to the MP3 file of our interview .
We talked quite a bit about ' Wit 's End ' , a magnificent , complicated and very sweetly funny novel about a young woman who ends up staying in the house of a Santa Cruz - based mystery writer .
Fowler 's story is an absorbing mystery about characters and place , exploring how writers create places that are super - imposed upon the places we actually live in , overlaid on our lives in their words .
She 's all about the power of language to enchant , to show us ourselves in a manner informing , a little alarming , and poignant .
' Wit 's End ' has so much the power of place , of the people who make a place , that it can't help but sweep you away .
Use the bird chirping as your soundtrack .
From Impeachment Left to Right
" The 110th Congress is n’t over .
We ’re starting our work , and then we ’re doing it in a period where the Congress is in recess .
I ’m calling everybody back . " -- John Conyers on DemocracyNow , Aug.14,2008
House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers has taken the highly unusual step of calling his committee back from summer recess in order to investigate allegations by Ron Suskind that the Bush administration forged a letter to buttress the links made between Saddam and 9/11 , and Saddam and WMD .
The congressional Authorization for the Use of Force Against Iraq , the " " War Resolution " which , as far short as it fell of a congressional declaration of war , gave the invasion its constitutional legal cover , and gave Bush the authorization to invade only after he had certified to congress the existence of these two critical links .
If Saddam had nothing to do with 9/11 , and if he did not possess WMD , the war was off .
The Authorization for the Use of Force stipulated :
Sec. 3 ( b ) Presidential Determination .--
In connection with the exercise of
the authority granted in subsection ( a ) to use force the President
shall , prior to such exercise or as soon thereafter as may be feasible ,
but no later than 48 hours after exercising such authority , make
available to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the
President pro tempore of the Senate his determination that --
( 2 ) acting pursuant to this joint resolution is consistent
with the United States and other countries continuing to take
the necessary actions against international terrorist and
terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations ,
or persons who planned , authorized , committed or aided the
terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 .
-" I have also determined that the use of armed force against Iraq is consistent with the United States and other countries continuing to take the necessary actions against international terrorists and terrorist organizations , including those nations , organizations , or persons who planned , authorized , committed , or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11 , 2001 . "
- George Bush , certification to Congress to authorize the use of force in Iraq , March 23 , 2003
[ Adam Boulton , Sky News ( London ) : ]
One question for you both .
Do you believe that there is a link between Saddam Hussein , a direct link , and the men who attacked on September the 11th ?
THE PRESIDENT : I can't make that claim .
THE PRIME MINISTER : That answers your question .
-" No , we 've had no evidence that Saddam Hussein was involved with September the 11th .

An Australian hotel offering free drinks to women who took off their underwear is to be investigated by alcohol regulators , authorities say .
The Saint Hotel in Melbourne said women who hung their underwear above the bar on No Undie Sundie would receive A$ 50 ( $ 39 ; £ 22 ) of drinks vouchers .
Women who flashed underwear at hotel staff would also get free drinks .
The Saint stoked controversy in June by hiring a dwarf to pour free alcohol down customers ' throats .
The director of Victoria state 's alcohol licensing authority said the event - which had been scheduled for this weekend - " looks like an inappropriate liquor promotion " .
" We will be investigating with a view to banning it , " Sue Maclellan told Melbourne 's Herald Sun newspaper .
Women 's protection groups said the initiative was " almost an invitation to sexual assault " , Reuters news agency reported .
Posters advertising this weekend 's promotion showed US singer Britney Spears partially exposed and getting out of a car .
Local Mayor Janet Cribbes said the ad was " bordering on being pornographic " .
Managers at the hotel , which describes itself as " the home of Melbourne 's fashionable set " , were unavailable for comment on Thursday .

Scottish artist Sandy Smith has gotten loads of well - deserved press and internet buzz around his brilliant Computer Installations project , but his site showcases a ton of interesting tech and socially - tinged installation work , as well as some awesome insight into each piece from the artist himself .
For Computer Installations , including the obsolescent beauty of “ Mauritian Sunset ” , pictured below , he took old computer monitors , donated by his alma mater , the Glasgow School of Art , and turned them into gorgeous large - scale installation pieces .
Eye - grabbing from the front and equally intriguing from the back .
I love the “ technology behind the curtain ” vibe ; the allusion toward so many beautiful things whose veneer faces us while the nuts and bolts of how their allure is maintained is hidden .
The door also intrigues me .
You do n’t have to travel around the outside of the entire piece to see both the gilded and the mechanical side ; there ’s a passageway right there in the middle , a portal , and Smith invites us to openly transverse between the two .
This way we see the honest connection between the colourful light and all those dull , grey wires that are working so hard to create it .
They might not be as pretty or as celebrated , but they ’re responsible for all the shiny glory shimmering on the other side .
For “ Green / Blue Horizontal ” , inspired by the ubiquitous Windows wallpaper “ Bliss ” , he created a walk - in corner installation from more than 60 computers .
Programmed to glow blue and green , people could walk inside the amazing luminescence created by the piece and find some bliss of their own .
But that ’s just the beginning .
In his own description of his installation work “ Sapere Aude ” , Smith ’s flair for the written explanation really kicks in .
This guy is n’t just an artistic bright light , he ’s also self - deprecating and funny as hell :
“ …we set forth our intention to work collaboratively in an exploration of Immanuel Kant ’s essay ‘ What is enlightenment ’ .
It was a lofty project , and a beautiful proposal , where we would explore ‘ why we make crap things with highbrow ideas . ’
Not us personally , but everybody and us …
It would be too impertinent to suggest that by merely attempting this process we have resolved anything so lofty as our intentions and ambition desired , but I put it to you that maybe , just maybe , that ’s okay .
This is not to excuse ourselves – you read me too literally .
We like this shit .
And thus maybe we should not seek to explain ourselves just too much , and instead ‘ have courage to use your [ our ] own reason ’ .
Or , as Kant paraphrased in the first paragraph of ‘ What is enlightenment ? ’ , Sapere aude .
Kant .
What a cunt . ”
Seriously .
How can you not love this dude ?
For “ Please Do n’t Break My Heart ” , he sculpturally constructed the phrase “ All The Time I Was Making This I Was Thinking Of You ” from 100 sheets of mounting board he super - glue together .
Standing 2 metres tall but only 12 centimetres deep , the precarious fragility of the whole piece was intentional .
With that in mind , the picture below is the only one he has of the completed piece as it appeared at the exhibition opening .
That night someone bumped into it and the whole thing collapsed .
Oddly enough , I think , knowing what it spelled out in the first place , the broken down version is even more beautiful .
A wonderful physical adaption to the tenuous nature of the sentiment it once spelled out .
I also wonder if maybe , having built it to a dimension that made it so easy to topple , this was Smith ’s secret intention the whole time .
For “ All The Time I Was Making This I Was Thinking Of You ” , part of the Studio Project 9 residency at Glasgow ’s Market Gallery , Smith spent 18 hours a day placing 600 hand - made paper flowers and 1200 leaves onto four large trees .
Sitting in the “ meadow ” between the four trees is an angular block , lit from within , whose perforations spell out “ Every day in every way I am getting better and better ” .
On his site Smith says “ What ’s it all about ?
The optimism , beauty and misplaced trust of striving to make Art contrasted with the puritan work ethic involved .
Making a nice place to sit .
Endeavour , arrogance , naivety , spontaneity , Dead Poets Society and art . ”
Finally , in another project that sources from the deep well of the net ’s collective emotional concious , the appropriately titled “ Google Image Search ” is a video installation consisting of two monitors .
One displayed a single word , and the other displayed the top 20 image results for that word from Google .
From the vast list of words used in the total 74 - minute looped video , you can watch two of them right here : “ Free ” and “ Freedom ” .
It 's the creepy plotters who rule us we should really be scared of
There is no such organisation as ‘ Al Qaeda ’ .
The spooks know this , Cabinet Ministers know this and so do the ‘ security correspondents ’ who so readily trot out the spooks ’ point of view on our broadcasting networks .
Of course , there are terrorists , and there are also fantasists , fanatics , low - lifes and camp followers who plot and attempt horrible things .
Some of them even call themselves ‘ Al Qaeda ’ these days because they have learned that this is a good way to scare us .
But , while they are a menace , they are not as big or as organised a menace as the Government likes to make out .
Former Home Secretary John Reid reeled out a boastful , alarmist statement about some arrests of alleged terrorists
The State and the vainglorious bureaucrats of the ‘ security ’ services need to pretend that the terrorists are a tightly organised and terrifying threat , to make themselves look big as well – and to help them get hold of new powers to snoop on us and push us around .
Some of you may remember the rather squalid behaviour , back in the summer of 2006 , by the then Home Secretary , the unrepentant ex-communist brute John Reid .
Lightly tossing aside the wise tradition that in free countries Ministers stay out of criminal justice matters , he reeled out a boastful , alarmist statement about some arrests of alleged terrorists , using words so preju-dicial that I will not reproduce them here .
When , two years later , a jury was unconvinced by many of the claims made by the authorities in this case , the same nastiness re-emerged in a different way .
Tame commentators were briefed to hint – baselessly – that the jury were stupid , inattentive or lazy , or even to blame the Americans for forcing our police to act before they were ready .
What is all this about ?
Remember , the authorities were tailing the alleged plotters from April to August .
They had filmed them , recorded their conversations , searched their homes .
If a real attempt had been made by the alleged plotters to blow up any planes , the police would have been able to prevent it .
But I suspect that someone , somewhere , was n’t happy with that .
What was wanted was not just the prevention of a potential outrage through diligent surveillance .
What was wanted was a nice big propaganda success , after which we would face another call for detention without trial , compulsory identity cards , and all the rest of the 1984 rubbish this Government wishes to impose on us .
Ill Kim needs a way in from the cold war
Can it be a year since I was in North Korea , shamefully laying flowers at the feet of a giant image of the dead Great Leader , Kim Il Sung ?
Yes , it can .
I thought then , and I think now , that this bankrupt and hopeless country has n’t got much longer to run .
The problem was and is that the Dear Leader , Kim Jong
Il , has n’t got anybody to surrender to .
The South Koreans do n’t want to pay for rebuilding the North , which would wipe out their economy .
George W. Bush , always scanning the horizon for someone to be afraid of , needs to pretend that North Korea is a terrible threat to the USA .
And Kim fears that if he just steps down , and admits that the weird godless religion of
Kim - worship is a lie , he will probably be torn to pieces by the disillusioned , half - starved mob .
Is he dead ?
How would anybody know ?
In any case , being dead is not necessarily a disadvantage in North Korean politics .
His father is dead , and is still the official ruler of the nation .
Is he ill ?
I expect so .
He has not treated his body as a temple , and North Korean elite medicine ( how can I put this ? ) relies rather too heavily on feeding the sick person the private parts of dogs .
I am more worried about how the North Koreans are .
We , and especially the US , really should make it easier for them to rejoin the world .
It is cruel and pointless to continue the pretence that they are a menace to anyone but themselves .
When a child ’s thoughts are a State secret
A contributor to my blog reports as follows :
‘ We found out last night from my nine - year - old daughter that in her nice new Year 5 class they will have an “ emotional diary ” in which they can write anything they want about their thoughts / feelings / problems etc .
And they have been told quite clearly that their parents will never be able to look in this “ diary ” . ’
This makes my skin crawl .
The theft of children from their parents by the State is now far advanced .
Is your nine - year - old keeping a secret diary that you are n’t allowed to see ?
True confessions of the Tatler Tory airheads
In normal times , the pictures of simpering airheaded Young Tories in Tatler , posing as if the world belongs to them by right , would have sunk the Conservatives for ever .
But these are not normal times and the boring hate cult directed against Gordon Brown ( how many times can you kill a corpse ? ) has ended any rational political discussion .
Even so , I feel the need to record one or two things about David Cameron which emerge from the book written about him by the fashionable Dylan Jones .
One , Mr Cameron very nearly admits that he has been making political capital out of the sad disability of his son , Ivan .
He repeatedly says that it is a ‘ difficult balance ’ .
And he also says three times that he does n’t mind if people criticise him for this , ending : ‘ It ’s a weird thing to say but I do n’t mind if people attack me for it . ’
So he wo n’t mind if I attack him for it , will he ?
It ’s wrong .
Two , he describes himself as ‘ the sort of person who ’s quite open ’ , but alas
this openness still does n’t extend to his past drug - taking .
Even so , Mr Jones elicits the nearest we have yet got to a confession .
It ’s
on Page 210 and takes the form of an admission that once he started trying
to become an MP , he also started to ‘ be more careful ’ in order to protect his future career .
By the way , those of you still harbouring hopes that a Cameron government will be a change from New Labour should note that there were little love - letters to three Blairites – Andrew Adonis , Alan Milburn and Stephen Byers – in an interview
that Shadow Chancellor George Osborne gave to an admiring Guardian newspaper last week .
How long before defections begin from New Labour to Blue Labour ?
**************************************
Have you noticed the new large blue metal markers on motorways , supposed to help the emergency services find you if you break down ?
They are marked in kilometres , not miles , even though distances on all motorway signposts are still shown in miles .
Clearly the Government is preparing to introduce these unwanted measures by stealth , knowing it could never do so openly .
Just a word about the usual excrescence from Karl Rove this morning .
Obama knows this lipstick thing is a cynical , knowingly dishonest attempt to push the news cycle one more day into triviality before Palin has to actually face real scrutiny , and we have our first chance to see whether she is who she says she is .
It 's a desperate tactic to run out the clock or to find a way to navigate the now - tsunami of evidence that Sarah Palin is unfit for the vice - presidency on account of her total lack of knowledge or expertise in foreign affairs , the thinnness and extremism and recklessness of her public record as mayor and governor , and the obvious and most important fact that she clearly cannot be trusted to tell the truth .
Obama must n't let these schoolyard tactics unbalance him .
He has n't in the slightest , so far , mind you , a feat of astonishing mental and psychological calm .
My advice for what it 's worth : Hang in .
The facts are on your side and the issues are overwhelmingly in your favor .
They 're trying to force you to blink .
Do n't .
Hysteria will end at some point .
Patience and steel .
Patience and steel .

White House Treads Lightly in Presidential Politics
The White House tries to stay out of this year 's intense presidential contest
WASHINGTON , Sept. 17 , 2008  --
There 's no question President Bush has moved out of the spotlight as Americans have focused their attention on the two men campaigning to be elected the new commander in chief .
It 's a common trend , not just for this president but for presidents in the past who have just a few short months before they wave goodbye to the Oval Office .
But tiptoeing can be tricky when a major crisis arises and the president is expected to reassure the public .
The economy this week is a case in point .
In the past , Bush has used the phrase , " the economic fundamentals are strong , " when trying to reassure Americans about the economy .
But when pressed about how strong the president felt those fundamentals were today , White House Press Secretary Dana Perino quickly caught that it was the same phrase that made a splash in the headlines when it came from the lips of Republican presidential candidate John McCain earlier this week .
" I recognize that this issue of strength has come into the 2008 election ; I 'm not going to try to get involved in it , " Perino said .
On Monday , when grim economic news was at the forefront , McCain was attacked by Democrats for his recent statements that " the fundamentals of our economy are strong . "
The Arizona senator quickly tried to set the record straight later that day , saying the economy was in a " crisis . "
He appeared the next morning on network news outlets with the same message .
At the White House today , Perino tried to clarify the president 's position , but also tried to avoid politicizing the issue .
" What I said is that we have the strength to be able to deal with this crisis in our economy , " she said .
" And I know that you 're not asking the question in the forum of a 2008 campaign , but I know as soon as I say something you 're going to turn it around and it will be a part of the 2008 campaign , and I 'm not going to play the game . "
Defending Billion - Dollar Moves
Although Bush has n't spoken publicly on specific government moves to rescue some companies and let others meet their fate , Perino briefed reporters on the process of the most recent bailout , the $ 85 billion government loan to insurance giant AIG .
" [ Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ] came in with a recommendation , and the president agreed with that recommendation , and he told Secretary Paulson and [ Federal Reserve chief ]
Ben Bernanke to go forward and implement their plan as they saw fit , " Perino said .
When pressed on the impact taxpayers will feel as a result of the government bridge loan to AIG , she explained , " I believe that Treasury thinks that they will be able to pay the taxpayers back , but it 's just going to take us some time to work through this crisis . "
Perino added there is a " mixed picture " when it comes to the economy and spoke of " the resiliency and the flexibility " of the market .
" We 'll weather the storm and we 'll be better for it , " she reassured .
Since news of Lehman Brothers ' demise and the sale of Merrill Lynch to Bank of America broke during the weekend , the president has stayed relatively mum in public .
He gave a brief public statement on the markets Monday at a joint statement with the president of Ghana .
" I know Americans are concerned about the adjustments that are taking place in our financial markets , " Bush said in the Rose Garden .
" In the short run , adjustments in the financial markets can be painful -- both for the people concerned about their investments , and for the employees of the affected firms .
In the long run , I 'm confident that our capital markets are flexible and resilient , and can deal with these adjustments . "
Press Corps Calls for More Coverage
The president met with Paulson , Bernanke and other members of his financial team Tuesday and was scheduled to give a statement to the press after the meeting .
However , an hour before the meeting began , the White House banned cameras and reporters .
" There are times , believe it or not , when policymakers actually need to , like , work on making some policy , " Perino explained today .
" Everyone was very busy yesterday making sure that all the I 's were dotted and T's were crossed before they moved forward with action last night .
So you did n't hear from the president yesterday . …
I do n't expect you 'll hear from the president today on this , either . "
Reporters quickly pointed out the president has n't held a news conference since July 15 .
" If you guys had him in here , almost everything would be geared towards the election , and he is cognizant of that , " Perino said .
" I mean , every time that I would think about maybe having a press conference , the news of the day would be such that we might be talking about lipstick on a pig , and the president is just not going to get involved in it , " Perino said , referring to one of the most recent squabbles between the presidential campaigns mincing words .
But the press corps would n't take that as the last word and ABC News '
Ann Compton reminded Perino that Bush 's term in office does n't end until Jan. 20 , 2009 , at noon .
" I grant you that it 's been a while and I understand that people want to hear from the president during this time , " Perino said .
" You heard from him Monday and I will update you as soon as I can as to when you 'll hear from him again . "
After the briefing with Perino , Bush met with the president of Panama in the Oval Office .
Deb Riechmann of The Associated Press attempted to ask Bush why he has n't taken questions from the press since Aug .
6 . The president did n't seem to hear her and before a follow - up could be asked , the press was herded out of the room .
" Another evening at work , in Chicago 's loop .
If you take a close look , you might even see a superhero or two . "
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) --
The Bigfoot in the freezer is made of rubber , a Web posting asserted Tuesday .
The frozen creature reputed to be Bigfoot turned out to be made of rubber , an enthusaist reports .
The initial promoter of two hikers ' claim that they found the body of Bigfoot in Georgia said he has determined that the discovery was a hoax .
The body turned out to be rubber , and the two men who claimed that they found it , Matthew Whitton and Rick Dyer , have admitted that it was a costume , said a posting Tuesday on the Web sites of Searching for Bigfoot Inc. and Squatchdetective .
The posting purportedly was written by Steve Kulls , who maintains the Squatchdetective Web site and hosts a similarly named Internet radio program , where the find was announced weeks ago .
In addition , Stanford University anthropologist Richard Klein said Monday that he was not aware he had been identified as participating in the project and would not be involved in any effort to examine the purported Bigfoot carcass .
Whitton and Dyer announced last week that they had found the body of a 7 - foot - 7 - inch , 500 - pound half - ape , half - human creature while hiking in the north Georgia mountains in June .
They said they put the carcass in a freezer and had spotted about three similar living creatures .
" We were not looking for Bigfoot , " Whitton , a Clayton County , Georgia , police officer , said Friday during a news conference .
" We would n't know what we were doing if we did . "
He and Dyer insisted that scientific analysis would bear out their claim .
The hoax was discovered after an " expedited melting process , " Kulls wrote .
" A break appeared up near the feet area ... as the team and I began examining this area near the feet , I observed the foot which looked unnatural , reached in and confirmed it was a rubber foot . "
Kulls said he contacted Tom Biscardi , the self - described " Real Bigfoot Hunter " who has been searching since 1971 for the creature of legend and appeared alongside Whitton and Dyer at the news conference .
" Later that day , Tom Biscardi informed us that both Matthew Whitton and Ricky Dyer admitted it was a costume , " the posting said .
Whitton and Dyer reportedly agreed to sign a promissory note and an admission of the hoax and meet with Biscardi at their hotel on Sunday .
But when Biscardi went to the hotel , the two had left , Kulls wrote .
" At this time , action is being instigated against the perpetrators , " the posting said , adding that the motives behind the claims were unknown .
iReport.com : Do you believe in Bigfoot ?
The posting said Biscardi 's organization , Searching for Bigfoot Inc. , " is seeking justice for themselves and for all the people who were deceived by this deception . "
Kulls did not immediately return a call to the Squatchdetective contact number .
A woman answering the phone at Searching for Bigfoot Inc. said Biscardi had been ill and said she was not sure when he would be returning calls .
A number listed as belonging to Matthew Whitton was disconnected as of Tuesday .
Efforts to locate a phone number for Dyer on Tuesday were unsuccessful .
Dyer and Whitton failed to show up Monday for a scheduled appearance on CNN's " American Morning . "
Kulls said that at the time he first interviewed Dyer on July 28 for the radio program , he suspected the duo's motive was financial .
On August 12 , he said , the two " requested an undisclosed sum of money as an advance , expected from the marketing and promotion . "
Two days later , after signing a receipt and counting the money , Dyer and Whitton showed the Searching for Bigfoot team the freezer containing what they claimed was the body : " something appearing large , hairy and frozen in ice , " Kulls wrote .
Dyer , he said , insisted on holding the news conference and told Biscardi he would not release the body unless the briefing was held Friday .
On Sunday , the research team was able to extract some hair and burn it .
The hair sample " melted into a ball uncharacteristic of hair , " Kulls wrote .
Biscardi then gave the group permission to expedite the melting process , and the rubber foot was discovered , Kulls wrote .
Meanwhile , Klein , the Stanford professor , said Monday that he was " sorry that my name and Stanford 's name have been brought into this . "
Klein's name was mentioned Friday as one of four scientists , two of them Russian , who would analyze the corpse .
Klein said he was unaware that Biscardi had identified him .
He said he had been contacted by Biscardi in the past and responded to a request to examine bones that were identified as coming from a deer .
" He seems like a nice enough guy , " Klein said , " but I can't imagine why anyone would devote their lives to proving the existence [ of Bigfoot ] .
Anything has a remote chance of being true , but there is virtually no prospect of this animal being real . "

Scrubbed
A political celebrity , McCain is considered a top contender for the nomination .
The former No. 3 official at the CIA pleaded guilty Monday to defrauding the government , closing an investigation that linked the nation ’s preeminent spy service to the corruption scandal involving former Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham .
In admitting that he abused his rank to steer lucrative contracts to cronies , Kyle Dustin “ Dusty ” Foggo , the agency ’s onetime executive director , became one of the highest - ranking officials in CIA history to be convicted of criminal charges .
But the deal also involved major concessions from prosecutors , who allowed Foggo to admit guilt to a single fraud charge , wiping out 27 additional counts that included money laundering and conspiracy .
Foggo , 53 , faces up to 20 years in custody and a $ 250,000 fine , but prosecutors indicated that they would recommend he serve no more than 37 months .
Mark MacDougall , an attorney for Foggo , said his client “ made the difficult decision to bring this case to a close in the best interest of his family and to get on with the rest of his life . ”
Advertisement
The revelations of Foggo ’s crimes surfaced two years ago during one of the most tumultuous periods in recent agency history , and added to the pressure on the Bush administration to remove Porter J. Goss as CIA director in 2006 .
Foggo , who served as a procurement officer in Germany before being named to manage most of the agency ’s day - to - day operations , was accused of directing millions of dollars in business to a longtime friend , Brent Wilkes , who is serving a 12 - year sentence after being convicted of bribing Cunningham .
Prosecutors said Foggo and Cunningham helped steer an estimated $ 100 million in contracts to Wilkes ’ firms .
Cunningham , a Republican from Rancho Santa
Fe , is serving eight years in prison after pleading guilty in 2005 to taking $ 2.4 million in bribes from defense contractors and evading more than $ 1 million in taxes .
“ Throughout the years - long scheme , Foggo had a standing offer for a high - level , high - paying position with his best friend Brent Wilkes , ” prosecutors in San Diego and Alexandria , Va. , said in a statement .

Foggo admitted to allowing Wilkes to conceal their close relationship by using shell companies and false cover stories to obscure Wilkes ’ interest in the CIA contracts , they said .
In one instance , Foggo was accused of helping Wilkes win a $ 3 - million contract to supply bottled water to CIA personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Prosecutors said that in addition to the promise of a lucrative job , Foggo received lavish gifts from Wilkes , including meals , private jet flights , a Hawaiian vacation and a weeklong stay valued at $ 44,000 at a Scottish castle .
The two had been friends since the early 1970s , when they were on the same high school football team in Chula Vista .
They were roommates at San Diego State University , and each served as best man at the other ’s wedding .
Many in the agency were stunned when Goss selected Foggo for the agency ’s third - ranking position .
Foggo had never served as a case officer or an analyst -- the jobs that typically garner the most respect within the CIA .
But as a procurement officer at a secret CIA post in Frankfurt , Germany , he was in a position to cultivate contacts with members of Congress and other influential officials who visited during overseas trips to war zones .
Goss had served as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee before being named CIA director .

Goss ’ tenure as director was marked by clashes between his senior aides and longtime agency veterans , some of whom resigned in protest over what they described as disrespectful treatment .
The tumult became a distraction at the agency , which was already struggling to manage the demands of its pursuit of Al Qaeda and the spiraling violence in Iraq .
Foggo ’s legal troubles became a source of particular embarrassment in May 2006 , when his CIA office and his home were raided by federal agents as part of a widening criminal investigation .
Agency veterans said they could not recall a case when the FBI had raided an office at CIA headquarters .

A CIA spokesman declined to comment on Monday ’s guilty plea , except to note that the CIA inspector general ’s office had initiated an internal probe and cooperated with the FBI investigation .
Current CIA Director Michael V. Hayden eliminated the executive director position after joining the agency in 2006 .

Steganography is the art of hiding message when they are sent , in a process akin to camouflage .
In cryptography , on the other hand , no attempt is made to hide the message , only to conceal its content .
Today , Wojciech Mazurczyk and Krzysztof Szczypiorski of the Warsaw University of Technology in Poland explain how VoIP services are wide open to steganographic attack and even measure how much information can be sent covertly in this way .
VoIP services such as Skype are vulnerable to steganographic attack because they use such a high bandwidth and that makes it relatively easy to embed a hidden message in the bit stream in a way that it is almost impossible to detect .
For precisely this reason , the US Department of Defence specifies in that any covert channel with a bandwidth higher than 100 bps must be considered insecure for average security requirements .
For high security requirements , the DoD says the data rate should not exceed 1 bps , making it next to impossible to embed a hidden code without it being noticed .
So VoIP systems such as Skype , with their much higher data rates , are difficult to secure .
And to prove it , Mazurczyk and Szczypiorski have tested a number of steganographic attacks ( including two new ones they ’ve developed themselves ) on a VoIP system to determine how much data could be sent .
They say that during an average call ( that ’s 13 minutes long according to Skype ) they were able to covertly transmit as much as 1.3 Mbits of data .
That should get a number of governments , companies and individuals thinking .
How secure is your VoIP system ?

It 's a suburban neighborhood , on Sunday morning .
There is a three - way stop at which hardly anyone ever goes the other direction than the main one .
But you often see a police car in the nearby parking lot , keeping his sharp eye out for evil lawbreakers .
These are the dangerous criminals who slow down almost to a full stop that causes the car to shift back the other direction , but do n't quite do this .
Instead they do what is sometimes called a " rolling stop " which stops short of full immobilization .
The policeman in the car regards this as " running a stop sign , " as if you paid no attention to it at all , and he 'll give you a ticket whenever he catches you doing it .
From the policeman 's point of view , it 's like shooting fish in a barrel .
One recent empirical accounting at this intersection ( I dragooned some neighborhood kids into keeping count ) observed that more than 9 in 10 people do not come to what the law regards as a " full stop . "
I should know about this because , try as I might to be a law - abiding citizen , I have now received my fifth ticket this year at this very intersection one block from my house .
That 's not a typo .
Five !
I know it sounds crazy — why the heck can't I obey those who are ordained to keep me safe ? — but when you consider that I go through this intersection several times per day , I 'm actually doing rather well .
It goes without saying that this is a racket .
The city is many hundreds of dollars richer because of my penchant for law breaking alone , and probably hundreds of thousands richer if you include everyone else's .
But it was n't until someone drew my attention to this link that I understood the full extent of what this whole racket is about .
Yes , it 's about money .
But there is more to it than that .
You see , it turns out that I 'm an archetype , a person who rolls through stop signs in my safe neighborhood and then gets outraged when the ticket is issued and attempts to " fight authority " rather than pay up .
So , fool that I am , I actually believe in " challenging the system . "
I take seriously the claim that I 'm innocent until proven guilty .
Can you believe the naïveté ?
It 's typical of suburbanites .
We challenge tickets , especially frivolous ones .
And this , it turns out , is precisely what the police want us to do , for reasons explained below .
So on the appointed court day , I leave the office to go to the courthouse to fight this ridiculous ticket .
I sit for hours and hours until I 'm given a chance to declare my innocence .
All the while , the cop who stopped me stands at the back of the courtroom with his arms folded over his bulletproof chest .
He is heavily armed .
I , on the other hand , was searched before I even walked in .
If at this point I declare my innocence , I am given the opportunity for a trial with my own attorney , whom I must pay because I 'm not poor enough to have the court appoint a lawyer even if I wanted it to .
This trial is scheduled for sometime in the future , which means another trip to the courthouse , and another opportunity for the cop to enjoy the air - conditioned surroundings of the courtroom he rules .
What chance is there for me ?
In the end , I would probably have to declare myself guilty of something or other , and pay a lesser fine ; meanwhile I will have missed at least two days of work .
What 's going on here turns out to do with the way policemen are paid .
According to federal labor law , they are only allowed to be scheduled for patrolling up to 40 hours per week , just as the rest of us can only be scheduled to work up to a certain number of hours .
Courtroom time — and by subpoena , they have to be there — often counts as overtime , meaning 50 % more than they are paid for patrolling during regular hours .
In the case examined by John Stossel on 20 / 20 , a policeman named Officer Kanapsky made an additional $ 21,562 over his regular pay just by standing around in court .
The more tickets he issued , especially for minor issues that outraged people are likely to challenge in court , the more money he made .
This is a result of labor law .
As the Department of Labor says , " An employer who requires or permits an employee to work overtime is generally required to pay the employee premium pay for such overtime work . "
Now , it starts to make sense .
You and I — his employers , so to speak — are paying a premium for his court time , which is why he spends his patrolling time trying to goad people into going to court .
The policeman is being paid time and a half to waste our time and to cause our insurance rates to rise .
In the private sector , the permission to work more than 40 hours per week is a real benefit to the employee and the employer , though the terms ought to be left to the contracting parties .
But in the police work , this overtime permission results in a scam that causes police to engage in low - risk , high - revenue earning activities that exploit the population .
It occurs to everyone who is given a frivolous ticket : surely the cop 's time would be better spent stopping real crimes , not harassing nonthreatening citizens .
Now we can better see why they do this .
It may be a product of federal overtime rules , another case in which the ghost of FDR haunts us every day .
But what to do about it ?
Denounce the cop on the spot ?
That 's not a good idea .
It strikes you immediately when you are stopped by a policeman that there is a huge disparity of power at work here .
You are effectively captured by them .
You must comply no matter what .
They have the legal right to use any method to keep you quiet and docile and to punish you to the point of death if you resist .
YouTube is filled with clips showing people being subjected to the latest weapon of choice : the taser gun .
The police love the taser gun .
It leaves no trace of physical injury .
You are shot through with electricity , which causes frightening physical and mental convulsions , but there is nothing you can take a picture of .
No bruises .
No wounds .
No broken bones .
This is all the better for them — and all the worse for you .
Never forget what happens to you if you decide to run instead .
That 's a death sentence .
Forget that the instinct to evade your captors is universal and deeply embedded in our mental / biological equipment .
The state operates on the assumption that you are its slave when it wants you to be , and otherwise free in name only .
This is especially true in the age of Bush , in which all police at all levels have morphed into militarized " security personnel . "
The friendly , helpful policeman of old civics texts seems to be a thing of the past .
In any case , the phenomenon of Officer Kanapsky raises fundamental questions not only about federal labor law but also about the role of the police in any community .
Do they really stop crime ?
Sure , they arrive after a crime has been committed ; they take fingerprints ( those only seem to work in the movies ) and file reports .
In real life , however , crime prevention is due to the private sector : locks , alarm systems , and the like .
This is what prevents crimes from taking place .
The police are n't so hot at prosecuting crime either , but for people who commit crimes like slowing down at three - way stops .
Yet we are all somehow under the illusion that the police are the reason we are safe .
It is the core mythology of our civic religion .
If you do believe that they do more good than harm , consider the unseen costs .
What kind of private alternatives are being crowded out by the very presence of the police ?
It is also deeply troubling that most people believe there are n't too many police but too few .
How many are too many ?
What if one in three people were a cop ?
One in two ?
Maybe we should have two cops for every one civilian .
How safe we would be !
Really , there is an ethos in this country that you can never have too many cops on the street , and the idea of hiring more nearly always garners public support .
And yet , when it comes right down to it on the particulars , we can't stand the police .
We keep a constant lookout for them when we drive .
We dread being pulled over .
We know in our hearts that they are out to get us , and represent more of a threat than a security for our freedoms .
In the end , we need to realize that the police are like all other government employees : self - interested , living off tax dollars , parasitical on our liberties .
The case of Officer Kanapsky shows precisely how and why .

FROM CNN's Jack Cafferty :
" In the 21st century , nations do n't invade other nations . "
So says John McCain , as part of his tough talk about Russia 's attacks on Georgia .
In calling for Russia to get out , McCain says he does n't think we 'll reignite the Cold War , but that you can't justify the " extent and degree " of Russia 's intervention in Georgia .
The presumptive Republican nominee insists that we need to make sure that in the 21st century , we all have respect for the sovereignty and independence of nations .
Watch : Cafferty : McCain a hypocrite ?
Say what ?
The United States invaded the sovereign nation of Iraq more than 5 years ago .
And you , Senator McCain , were all for the idea .
You voted for the war , remember ?
At the time , McCain insisted that the U.S. needed to act before Saddam Hussein could develop more advanced weapons .
And since then , McCain has remained steadfast in his support of arguably the biggest foreign policy blunder in the history of this country .
At one point , McCain said U - S troops could remain in Iraq , a sovereign nation , for 100 years .
When it comes to punishing Russia for its actions , the Arizona Senator says its potential membership in the World Trade Organization should be reviewed along with its membership in the G - 8 .
He believes an international peacekeeping mission should be sent to Georgia and that NATO should re-consider adding Georgia and Ukraine to the alliance .
Here ’s my question to you :
Is John McCain hypocritical to condemn Russia for invading Georgia when he voted to invade Iraq ?
Interested to know which ones made it on air ?
Norm from Alabama writes :
Of course he is being hypocritical about this , just as he is about everything else .
Example : all the pontificating about Obama being " presumptuous " and then McCain goes on TV to speak for America as though he were in fact its leader .
Hypocrisy runs through his veins right along with nastiness and dishonesty .
Josh from Illinois writes :
Of course he is and I 'm glad someone in the media is finally pointing that out !
“ In the 21st century , nations do n't invade other nations ? " Clearly Senator McCain needs more nap time .
Dave from Missouri writes :
Absolutely not !
Iraq was controlled by a dictator and Georgia has a legally - elected president .
The two should not even be considered in the same category .
Donna from Wisconsin writes :
Of course !
Same with Bush telling Putin to back off .
Excuse me ?
You would n't listen to anyone tell you to ' back off ' Iraq !
Our nation ’s image and credentials have been severely damaged by Bush , and McCain will only make it worse .
Stan writes :
Of course McCain is being hypocritical .
He 's a Republican after all .
The Bushies lecturing the Russians on the sovereignty of nations is analogous to the weasel lecturing the fox on the rights of chickens .
James from Prescott , Michigan writes :
Absolutely !
The Russians were only surging and continue their surge in McCain ’s surgeable tradition .
Vince from Carson City , Nevada writes :
Is the Pope ...?
Does a bear ...?
Duh .
Hayden Panettiere : Lastest Hollywood Hippie ( Photos )
is the latest celebrity to wear a long flowing dress reminiscent of the 60's hippie movement .
The psychedelic pattern of the sundress hearkens back to the days when a young person rejected conventional society and advocated love , peace , and adopted simple , idealistic values .
The teen actress was on hand at a 2008 ESPY 's Giant Event at J Bar and Lounge in Los Angeles on Monday .
The gown actually does give the starlet some unwanted girth around her middle .
Solid colors tend to slim while flowery multi-colored patterns have the opposite effect .
Panettiere is among a growing group of celebrities who are wearing the paisley - like patterns .
Check out other stars who have been seen out and about in flowing florals and have thus been labeled Hollywood Hippies .
Even Suri Cruise , age two , has embraced the latest style .
The toddler was at Union Station in L.A. yesterday , watching mom , Katie Holmes , film a cameo appearance for the ABC show Eli Stone .
Suri was photographed in her own flowing sundress .
She completed her look with bare feet - in true flower child form .
All she lacked was a fist full of wild daisies to make the look complete .
Check out more photos below .

Yard chief ' trying to silence Paddick ' with bid to block his testimony at De Menezes inquest
Scotland Yard chief Sir Ian Blair was today accused of trying to silence one of his fiercest critics .
Brian Paddick , who has been scathing about his former boss since leaving the Yard , has been asked to give evidence at the inquest into the death of Jean Charles de Menezes .
The relatives of the 27 - yearold Brazilian electrician , who was shot dead by firearms officers who mistook him for a terror suspect , want Mr Paddick to testify against the force at next month 's hearing .
Sir Ian Blair , right , is accused of trying to stop Brian Paddick , left , giving evidence at the Jean Charles de Menezes inquest
Mr de Menezes 's family believe he was killed unlawfully and they want individual officers to face criminal charges over the shooting .
If he is allowed to give evidence , Mr Paddick will address the police shoot - to - kill policy , codenamed Operation Kratos , which was set up to tackle suspected suicide bombers .
However , Sir Ian and his senior officers are said to believe the former Deputy Assistant Commissioner does not have enough experience to comment on the controversial policy .
They want the coroner to exclude him from the list of witnesses who will testify at the inquest .
The Metropolitan Police 's extraordinary legal move raised the stakes for the inquest , which will have a crucial influence on whether Sir Ian can survive in office until his five - year contract finishes in January 2010 .
Senior Yard sources believe that Sir Ian - never far from controversy in his three and half years in charge of Britain 's biggest force - would be forced to step down if the inquest rules that Mr de Menezes was unlawfully killed .
Mr Paddick quit the Met in the wake of the shooting in Stockwell Tube station , South London , on July 22 , 2005 .
He claims that he was sidelined by Sir Ian because he disputed the Commissioner 's version of the events on the day of the shooting .
An independent inquiry later found that Sir Ian had told the truth about what happened .
Mr de Menezes was shot dead by firearms officers who believed he was a suicide bomber .
He had just boarded a train at the station when he was pinned down and shot seven times in the head at point - blank range .
Met chiefs are expecting a barrage of criticism at the inquest , which starts at the Oval cricket ground on September 22 .
The court will hear evidence for the first time from the two firearms officers who shot Mr de Menezes .
Last year the Met was convicted at the Old Bailey on one general health and safety count over the shooting .
Scotland Yard said yesterday : ' Although no formal notification has yet been given to the coroner , the Met are proposing to raise with the coroner the relevance and scope of any evidence Mr Paddick can give to the inquest in relation to the death of Jean Charles de Menezes .
' The final decision as to which witnesses are appropriate for the inquest remains with the coroner . '
The spokesman added that , at present , Sir Ian is not on the list of witnesses .
Earlier this year , Mr Paddick - who until his retirement was Britain 's highest ranking gay officer - was the unsuccessful LibDem candidate for London Mayor .
El titular del Ejecutivo dijo que México tiene que afinar sus acuerdos para atacar a este flagelo que es común en cualquier país , y llamó a impedir que el miedo y el cobijo social permitan que impere la criminalidad
El presidente Felipe Calderón aseguró que los criminales no encontrarán a un México de rodillas por el temor que pretenden sembrar después de los hechos ocurridos en Morelia , Michoacán .
El titular del Ejecutivo hizo una llamado a poner punto final a la tolerancia y el cobijo social a la delincuencia , la cual , acusó , ha crecido por diversos factores , como la corrupción , la ineficacia o el miedo , o por la mezcla de todos .
En un fuerte mensaje previo a su visita a los heridos por los hechos en Morelia , el mandatario aseguró que es un error pensar que la tolerancia a la criminalidad permitirá vivir en paz .
" Es el camino equivocado , porque eso pondrá a México de estar en riesgo de sus miserables intereses " .
También , dijo Calderón , tiene que reaccionar la comunidad internacional y México afinar en sus acuerdos para atacar a un flagelo que es común en cualquier país .
Acompañado por Genaro García Luna , sostuvo que es crucial que órganos de gobierno actúen unidos para acelerar la recuperación de la confianza en las autoridades .
" La tragedia de Morelia es reflejo de una situación límite que pone en riesgo la seguridad interior de la nación , y que demanda una respuesta de Estado superior a cualquier posición política o de partidos .
El pretender obtener dividendos a partir del dolor o el sufrimiento de las familias que perdieron a sus seres queridos van a enfrentar el rechazo unánime y rotundo de la sociedad .
Ante la magnitud de este dolor , México reclama unidad para rechazar categóricamente y sin matices estos actos de barbarie , unidad para denunciarlos , unidad para negarles el cobijo social para realizar sus actividades , unidad para apoyar también la acción del gobierno para ir contra ellos como vamos a ir .
Es necesario de la comunidad internacional sume esfuerzos en la lucha contra un enemigo que no reconoce fronteras " .
Es momento , dijo el mandatario , de sumar esfuerzos para limpiar a México de esta delincuencia , para lo cual la participación ciudadana es clave en la estrategia contra le delito .
Por ello convocó a todos los mexicanos de sus respectivas esferas a dar lo mejor de sí y no permitir que el miedo y el cobijo social permitan que impere la criminalidad .
" Los tristes acontecimientos ocurridos en Morelia han enlutado al país y son una muestra de que los criminales cuando actúan no lo hace sólo contra el gobierno federal , sino contra la sociedad , porque con la intimidación y el sacrificio en que incurren no es sólo contra las autoridades , sino que involucra a todos " .
Expresó a los heridos y a los deudos de las personas fallecidas , que no están solos y , por el contrario , esta lucha se mantendrá más firme que nunca , por ello convocó a la sociedad a proporcionar información y denunciar estos infames actos a través de los medios anónimos , a fin de permitir atrapar y castigar a quienes incurrieron en ese crimen .

" America has finally come to this point where you can pick a man of colour and that not be a drawback , " the legendary 81 - year - old guitarist said of Senator Barack Obama , who clinched the Democratic presidential nomination last week and would become the country 's first black president if he wins in November .
Introduction A couple of years ago , I wrote about compiling C DLLs and using them from Perl code .
Today , Python is my language of choice , and I want to write about how to achieve the same in Python .
It turns out that ( like many other things ) using C/C++ DLLs in Python is much simpler .
ctypes - the Python module that implements it , is one of the best designed and documented foreign function interfaces ( FFIs ) I 've seen in any language .
And true to the ' batteries included ' dogma , it is part of the Python standard library ( from version 2.5 ) .
Simple types and buffers
Here 's a sample function written in C and compiled into a DLL .
The header file : # define DLL_EXPORT __declspec(dllexport ) DLL_EXPORT int __stdcall test_buf ( char * buf , int num , char * outbuf ) ;
Here 's the implementation : int __stdcall test_buf ( char * buf , int num , char * outbuf ) { int i = 0 ; for ( i = 0 ; i < num ; ++i ) { outbuf [ i ] = buf [ i ] * 3 ; } return num ; } Now , here 's how to call this from Python using ctypes : from ctypes import cdll , windll , c_long , c_int , c_char_p , create_string_buffer #
Use cdll for functions compiled with __cdecl # libc = cdll.msvcrt print " The time ( ) is : " + str ( libc.time ( ) ) #
Use windll for Windows API and functions # compiled with __stdcall # test_dll = windll.dll_test #
Load the function test_buf from the DLL test_buf = test_dll.
test_buf # Create a pointer to a Python data buffer data_in = c_char_p ( ' \x04\x21\x41\x1 F ' )
# Allocate space for the output buffer data_out = create_string_buffer ( 4 ) # A ' long ' object numbytes = c_long ( 4 ) #
Finally , call the function test_buf , passing it the prepared # parameters and receiving the return value # ret = test_buf ( data_in , numbytes , data_out ) #
Inspect the results # import binascii print " Returned " , ret print " Out = " , binascii.hexlify ( data_out.raw ) .upper ( )
Callbacks ctypes can also gracefully handle callback functions ( a non trivial task for FFIs ) .
Here 's another C function compiled into the DLL : DLL_EXPORT int __stdcall test_cb ( void ( * fp ) ( int ) , int arg ) ;
With a trivial implementation that 's enough to demonstrate what we need : int __stdcall test_cb ( void ( * fp ) ( int ) , int arg ) { fp( arg ) ; } And here 's the Python code to call it : from ctypes import windll , c_int , CFUNCTYPE test_dll = windll.dll_test test_cb = test_dll.test_cb #
Define a callback function type , as a function that returns # void and takes a single integer as an argument # CB_FUNC_TYPE = CFUNCTYPE ( None , c_int ) def foo ( arg ) : print ' foo Called with ' , arg # Wrap foo in CB_FUNC_TYPE to pass it to ctypes cb_func = CB_FUNC_TYPE ( foo ) #
Finally , call test_cb with our callback .
Note the printed # output # test_cb ( cb_func , 10 ) Note that I 've used the CFUNCTYPE function to create the callback prototype .
This tells ctypes that the callback will be called using the standard C calling convention .
This is because I 've specified no convention when declaring void ( * fp ) ( int ) .
Had I declared test_cb as : DLL_EXPORT int __stdcall test_cb ( void ( __stdcall * fp ) ( int ) , int arg ) ; I would have to use WINFUNCTYPE instead of CFUNCTYPE ( the rest being exactly the same ) .
The lesson from this is simple : while you 're quite free to define any calling convention as long as it's your code at both sides of the call , be careful to notice the calling conventions for all functions and callbacks in 3rd party C/C++ code you want to call from Python .
2 Large Solar Plants Planned in California , Will Each Be 10 Times Bigger Than Largest Now in Service
August 14th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Pacific Gas and Electric Now Under Contract to Deliver 24 Percent of Energy from Renewables by 2013
In a landmark announcement today , Optisolar and the Sunpower Corporation said they plan to build 2 solar plants that will produce a total of 800 MW of power .
During peak hours , the plants will produce as much energy as a small nuclear reactor or a large coal plant .
According to Sunpower chairman Thomas H. Werner , the Sunpower plant alone will have as much photovoltaic capacity as was installed worldwide during the past year .
The solar power created from the plants will provide enough energy for 239,000 homes annually .
With the addition of the two proposed plants , PG&E is now under contract to produce 24 % of future power deliveries from renewable resources ( wind , biomass , geothermal , solar ) .
This will exceed the 20 % renewable energy requirement imposed by California .
Hopefully the saying “ As goes California , so goes the nation ” applies here , as many other states get more than enough sunshine to match California .

The hookers are coming .
Get your prayer books ready .
That ’s the mantra of a local Christian group planning to help save sex workers during the Democratic National Convention .
Streets Hope , a group dedicated to getting hookers off the streets , claims that " an estimated 40,000 prostitutes " will be brought to Denver for the DNC .
We have no idea where they came up with such an apocalyptic number — or how many shuttles from DIA will be needed to accommodate the influx of clear plastic heels .
All we know is the folks from Streets Hope , and their partners at Open Door Ministries and the Mile High Baptist Association , will be ready .
Last night , more than fifty volunteers showed up at a church off Pecos Street to pray , sing and learn their plan of attack .
Their mission , according to the group ’s training flyer , is to reach " those who want to leave the adult industry . "
Starting next Friday , the group will distribute business cards to hotels , strip clubs , cab drivers and other dens of sin , with a hotline number for women to call if they are looking for a " way out . "
Social workers and counselors will answer the calls and even send volunteer " intervention teams " to rescue the women and bring them to a safe house , if that ’s what the caller desires .
But of course , they might also just pray with them .
The training flyer lists as its first priority : " Pray as often as possible before the DNC , during the DNC , and after the DNC . "
For with thousands of prostitutes descending on the city -- not to mention hordes of heathen liberals ! -- prayer seems like the group ’s best hope .
" If we are not covered in prayer , we will not win the spiritual battle that will surely be waged against us as we enter the enemy ’s territory , " the flyer states .
" We must pray without ceasing . " -- Lisa Rab
In China , It ’s All About the Numbers
Why are the Chinese so attracted to numbers ?
Do they hold the key to ancient secrets or are they merely an odd fixation ?
The Chinese believe that some numbers are lucky and some are n’t , as do their counterparts throughout the world .
The difference is that lucky numbers are a big industry in China where people can actually select their own phone numbers , license plates , and other random things , which is an expensive , as well as lucky , purchase .
In China , numbers are often integrated with sounds and have associative meanings .
For example , the number eight is considered the luckiest number of all because it is pronounced “ ba ”  which sounds like “ fa ” ,  the Chinese word for prosperity .
House numbers and telephone numbers containing the number eight are extremely sought after , and it is no coincidence that the Beijing Olympics began on 08/08/2008 at 8 pm .
Conversely , the number four is considered bad luck because it is pronounced “ si ”  which is similar to the Chinese word for death .
When ordering dishes in a Chinese restaurant , the courses are usually even - numbered , such as four , six , eight , etc .
It is also customary if a guest visits a home bearing a gift of fruit the number will be even .
When buying apartments in China , those that are on even numbered floors are always the first to sell out .
The fourth floor , on the other hand , is usually the cheapest , and usually foreigners , oblivious to the number ’s connotations , occupy it .
The number six is considered very lucky , because the pronunciation sounds like the word for “ flow ” , suggesting that everything will go very smoothly .
The car license plate “ AC6688 ” recently sold for 80,000Y ( $ 11,700 US dollars ) .
The number two is lucky as well , because it suggests harmonious existence and reproduction .
Some odd numbers are also considered favorable .
Five is very significant because it relates to the five elements of Feng Shui ( metal , wood , water , fire and earth ) , the five basic colors ( red , green , yellow , black and white ) and the five tastes ( sweet , sour , salty bitter and pungent ) .
The number one is favored by young lovers and is exemplified in the Chinese idiom , “ one heart and one soul . ” 
A man will usually send one flower to his beloved to express undivided love or he may send nine ( jiu ) , which is a homonym for the word denoting forever .
The number seven has experienced a bit of a renaissance as it was traditionally associated with anger .
In recent years it has become more acceptable as it sounds a little bit like the words for “ wife ” or “ family ” .
What ’s in a number ?
Who can say , but do YOU dare to find out ?

BOSTON -
The state 's eleven district attorneys have each kicked in more than $ 2,000 to fight a ballot question that would decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana .
The $ 27,670 raised for the newly formed Coalition to Save Our Streets is dwarfed by the $ 648,473 raised by the Committee for Sensible Marijuana Policy , which backs the question .
Middlesex District Attorney Gerry Leone has criticized the question , which he said sends the wrong message to children .
Supporters say the marijuana laws are antiquated .
If the measure , which would make having an ounce or less of the drug a civil offense punishable by a $ 100 fine , is approved , Massachusetts would become the 13th state to lift or ease criminal penalties on marijuana possession .

About 50 Buddhist monks gathered to begin a new demonstration in Sittwe , Rakkhine State r at around 2 pm on September 13th .
But they were broke up by the security forces while they were gathering at Way Thar Lee stadium .
I could not confirm how many were arrested .
Buddhist monks led a massive pro-democracy demonstrations on 18th of September 2007 .
The military opened fire on the demonstrators on 26th of September and many monks and people were killed .
“ Wall Street has to look at the world differently , ” said Manoj Jain , the chairman of Pipal Research , a 400 - person firm with offices in Chicago , Delhi and Gurgaon .
Moving high - value jobs out of high - cost cities is “ no longer a hypothesis , ” he said .
Pipal has “ more work than it can take ” right now , he said , and is seeing new clients beyond United States banks , like investment management companies and European financial firms .
Like analysts at most offshore research operations , Pipal ’s number crunchers do not make recommendations , or generally put their name to the research they write .
Instead , they work with the big - name bank or fund analyst to create the research that they want .
Permanently moving banking jobs out of New York or London is a touchy subject on Wall Street .
Many investment banks , including Morgan Stanley , Goldman Sachs , Merrill Lynch and Citigroup , would not make executives available to discuss the topic .
Press officers for most banks asked not to be quoted or argued over semantics .
For example , one spokesman said his bank ’s fast - growing India support operations are not an outsourcing facility , but a “ center of excellence ” ; another argued that large cost cuts at his bank ’s New York and London headquarters were really “ re-engineering ” so the bank should not be included in such an article .
“ Some of that is self - serving , ” Octavio Marenzi , chief executive of Celent , said of the impulse to keep quiet .
“ If I admit that research analysts can be off - shored to India , that means that I could too . ”
He said the “ more advanced firms ” will be able to use the cost differences and talent pools in India , and in the future in China , to their advantage .
A few banks have openly embraced off - shoring .
Credit Suisse has 6,500 employees around the world working in lower - cost locations in India , Poland and Singapore .
Of these about 500 are doing high - value jobs .
Enlarge By Marc Serota , Getty Images Republican presidential candidate John McCain speaks in January in Miami with his wife Cindy , center , and daughter Megan , right .
The United Auto Workers union disapproves of John McCain 's unclear message about whether he bought his daughter a hybrid car or if she bought it herself .
LANSING , Mich . ( AP ) 
The head of the United Auto Workers union said Wednesday that Republican presidential nominee John McCain lost credibility by first saying he bought his daughter a Toyota Prius , then saying she purchased it .
Ron Gettelfinger told reporters in a conference call that motorists have a right to choose any car they want .
" But we think that a person who has declared himself ... the nominee of the Republican Party should be straight with the American people , " he said .
" It 's very insulting to try to skirt something as simple as whether or not you bought a particular vehicle . "
Added Jim Graham , president of UAW Local 1112 in Youngstown , Ohio : " If he is going to lie about an issue as small as a Prius , what 's he going to do on the big issues ? "
The UAW has endorsed Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama .
In response , the McCain campaign said the Arizona senator is an advocate of alternative - fueled vehicles and has proposed a $ 300 million prize for whoever can develop a better automobile battery , along with $ 5,000 tax credits for consumers who buy new zero-emission vehicles .
Regional spokeswoman Sarah Lenti said in a statement that McCain wants America to " take the lead in the way we power transportation , " saving U.S. jobs .
" He is trying to promote change and to do this by pushing American companies to develop an affordable battery operated car , " she said .
Lenti did n't say whether McCain or his daughter had purchased the Prius , but noted : " The UAW should lay off Megan McCain . "
The accusation of a McCain flip - flop surfaced Wednesday in a presidential campaign that has grown increasingly acrimonious .
According to an October 2007 New York Times article , McCain told a student last fall in South Carolina who asked what the candidate was personally doing to reduce greenhouse gases that he had bought the hybrid Prius for his daughter , Meghan .
But when questioned Sunday by a reporter at TV station WXYZ in Southfield , Mich. , McCain said , " She bought it , I believe , herself . "
During the conference call , Gettelfinger pointed out that there are a number of hybrid vehicles made by domestic automakers .
He praised Obama for backing the domestic automakers ' request that the federal government back $ 50 million in loan guarantees the auto industry wants so it can retool its factories to make more fuel - efficient and alternative - energy vehicles .
" With McCain , finally he came on board with the $ 25 billion support , " Gettelfinger said , referring to automakers ' earlier and lower loan guarantee request .
" Barack Obama came on board very early on for $ 50 billion . "
The Obama campaign has been pushing the economic message hard in Michigan , a critical Midwestern battleground state Obama almost has to win if he wants to gain the White House .
Tuesday evening , Michigan Lt. Gov. John Cherry held an economic roundtable meeting in Grand Rapids , Mich. , to discuss what it says are the ways " the Michigan 's economy has suffered under the failed Bush - McCain economic policies . "
Obama 's Michigan policy director , Jenna Pilat , was to hold a similar roundtable discussion Wednesday night in Traverse City , Mich .
The Obama campaign was also sending actor Kal Penn and actress Jurnee Smollett to six university campuses on Wednesday to register student voters .

Presidential historians and political scientists say the current approach is no harsher than those of yore .
Historians say McCain camp not sleaziest
David Axelrod , Barack Obama ’s chief strategist , said Sunday that John McCain is running the “ sleaziest and least honorable campaign in modern presidential campaign history . ”
It was a line trotted out all weekend by various Obama staffers as part of an effort to portray the Republican nominee as a purveyor of the slimiest tactics in recent memory .
Yet presidential historians and political scientists interviewed by Politico scoffed at the notion , suggesting McCain ’s approach is no harsher than those used in previous modern campaigns and certainly not by comparison to many historic campaigns .
Advertisement
“ The idea that this campaign is the sleaziest ever is absurd , ” said David Greenberg , a professor of history and media studies at Rutgers who has written books on Presidents Coolidge and Nixon .
" In fact , there 's been very little that 's below the belt , and aides have been fired on all sides when they 've gotten near , let alone crossed , the lines .
There 's nothing at all to rival the Swift - boating of Kerry in 2004 , the imputations of un-Americanness to Dukakis in 1988 , the anti-Catholic stuff against Al Smith in 1928 and the regular resort to slander and character assassination of so many 19th - century campaigns . "
“ It ’s not new or novel , ” said Vanderbilt University political science professor John Geer , author of " In Defense of Negativity . "
“ McCain 's tactics are no different than what we 've seen in recent years , " he said .
" Presidential campaigns in the past few decades were worse in many ways . ”
Geer , who researched his 2006 book in part by watching virtually every presidential campaign spot from 1964 to 2004 , points to the 1964 election , among others .
In that contest between President Lyndon Johnson and Sen. Barry Goldwater , the Democratic president offered the notorious “ Daisy Girl ” ad that suggested election of his Republican rival would lead to nuclear Armageddon .
A lesser - known but equally hard - hitting LBJ attack portrayed a young girl licking an ice cream cone as a woman off - camera suggested nuclear radioactive material generated by a Goldwater administration would poison the food supply .
And it ’s often forgotten that 1984 Democratic nominee Walter Mondale ran a bruising set of attack ads against President Ronald Reagan .
Channeling LBJ , themes included possible nuclear war — footage of children was interspersed with ballistic missiles and nuclear explosions — along with slashing attacks over fiscal and foreign policy , Geer said .
At issue this year are McCain campaign claims and ads that several news organizations have branded as false or , at best , highly misleading .
Both McCain and his running mate Sarah Palin have , if nothing else , played fast and loose with her role as an anti-earmarking champion .
In a television ad , the campaign also asserts that Obama , as an Illinois state senator , backed legislation to teach “ ‘ comprehensive sex education ’ to kindergartners . ”
The truth is that the legislation allowed local school boards to teach “ age - appropriate ” sex education , not comprehensive lessons to kindergartners .
Obama ’s campaign has also cried foul over a recent McCain ad claiming Obama and congressional Democrats plan to push forward " painful tax increases on working American families . "
According to the nonpartisan FactCheck.org , the ad is flat - out wrong because Obama ’s economic plan would produce a tax cut for the majority of American households , with middle - income earners saving the larger percentage of their incomes .
Then there is last week ’s “ lipstick on a pig ” controversy , in which the Obama campaign contends the Republican ticket is feigning outrage over Obama ’s use of that phrase .
Obama insists his remark was not directed at McCain running mate Palin , whose nomination acceptance speech had highlighted her lipstick as a reflection of her tenacious political demeanor ; the McCain camp claims it was an example of outright sexism .
“ Taking one quote and blowing it out of context is commonplace .
That ’s what you do in a campaign , ” said Julian E. Zelizer , professor of history at Princeton University .
It ’s possible that the 2008 campaign has appeared to some as if it ’s among the sleaziest because the candidates quickly dispensed with pleasantries that usually begin general election campaigns .
That may be a reflection of the truncated general election campaign because the Democratic nominating contest dragged on through June and the nominating conventions were not held until after the Beijing Olympics .
“ What surprises me about this campaign is how they ’ve barely even bothered with intro , feel - good ads , ” Geer said .
“ It ’s certainly starting out pretty negative , but again , you ’ve got high stakes , you ’ve got two candidates that disagree with each other on issues . ”
It should not be surprising that McCain ’s campaign race has ratcheted up the heat on Obama so strongly , said Kenneth Long , a political science professor at Saint Joseph College , in West Hartford , Conn .
“ We have long a history of negative campaigning ; this hardly comes close to the most negative , ” Long said .
“ Voters say that they do n’t like negative campaigns , and they do n’t .
But that said , we know that negative campaign ads are the most effective . … if you just run campaign ads that are purely positive , it tends not to move any voters . ”
Can a regular person alter human history with the click of a button ?
Overnight , or even sooner , one statement , video , audio clip , picture or document can dramatically shift the national dialogue .
In the past , main stream media led the way .
A picture of Dukakis looking puny in a tank marked his campaign ’s derailment in 1988 .
One mistaken pool report of George H.W. Bush at the supermarket reportedly looking surprised while viewing a scanner swiping groceries spelled doom for his second term , falsely becoming fodder for those calling him ‘ out of touch ’ .
In every occasion , however , normal voters could not drive any narrative or use any advanced medium to significantly reach prominent national attention .
No one denies this coming Presidential election will change the trajectory of world events , impacting generations to come .
Before the internet demolished once impenetrable media barriers , people wanting to influence history so quickly had to do so with the barrel of a gun .
But now , that power is in each person ’s hands ( literally ) .
Here ’s a list of 10 ways one person , a collection of people , or a campaign used the web ’s full potential to change the 2008 election .
10 College Student Helps Palin
Adam Brickley registered a blog in February of 2007 with a simple vision ; draft Alaska ’s Governor Sarah Palin for Vice President .
When asked what inspired him , he says , “ She ’s somebody who can really connect with the conservative base . ”
The 21 year old college student relentlessly supported her , posting frequently with his thoughts on the choice .
When McCain finally picked Palin , she and her husband , Todd , put in a call to Brickley to thank him personally .
9 Macaca Moment
George Allen was a rising star in the GOP , slated for a promising presidential run when he campaigned in what was considered an easy reelection bid during the 2006 Virginia senatorial race .
His competitor , Jim Webb , sent a ‘ tracker ’ of Indian descent to capture video of the opposing side ’s rally .
Allen pointed out the Democratic activist and proceeded to call him a slur , ‘ Macaca ’ .
The Youtube video posted by the Webb campaign ignited a media storm , even attracting national attention , and Allen lost the race by a few thousand votes , effectively ending any hope for a 2008 run for the White House .
8 Obama ’s Candidacy
Without the power of organizing without organizations , Obama might have become an interesting footnote to the Iowa primary season .
He built an impressive ground campaign reliant on new social tools that allowed supporters to exponentially increase their outreach .
One of the four founders of Facebook , Chris Hughes , left the radically expanding company to join the Obama team , developing an advanced social network for supporters to organize , share and donate , which ultimately led to a shocking first place finish in Iowa .
New media not only allowed his candidacy ’s realization , but continues to sustain his efforts through a massive fund raising machine online that has , so far , attracted over 2 million individual donors .
7 McCain Learns Youtube
Dragging slightly in the polls , McCain ’s campaign , under the new direction of Steve Schmidt , learned how to exploit the viral nature of Youtube .
They uploaded three videos attacking Obama ; one called ‘ Celeb ’ , then ‘ The One ’ , and finally ‘ Troops ’ .
The exploit was successful ; everyone buzzed and the media picked them up .
McCain did not have to put any precious money in to placing these ads on the air , but gained copious amounts of national free time by virtue of the video ’s news - worthiness .
All the networks played the ads repeatedly , holding discussions on the content and nature of the attacks ; but to no avail for the Obama camp , as their lead started to dwindle .
6 FISA Trouble
Amendments to the 1978 FISA legislation included wording intended to protect large phone companies from lawsuit for past compliance with warrantless Bush administration surveillance activities .
Nearly all members of congress , save a few , agreed to the necessity of continued surveillance of physical or electronic communications possibly connected to terrorism .
However , the whole packaged bill containing the retroactive telecom immunity was not met so universally .
Wanting to seem tough on defense , Senator Obama , who once pledged to filibuster telephone company protection , released statements supporting the legislation despite its shortcomings .
He reiterated his opposition to parts of the bill but said he nonetheless would vote for it when on the floor .
This outraged the netroots , some of Obama ’s most rabid supporters .
They passionately voiced their distaste with Obama , initiating a movement they called , “ You can tap my wallet or my phone , but not both ” .
Angered fans organized a group on Obama ’s own social network against him .
Never before in Presidential politics had advanced social tools made way for protestations against the source that supplied them .
Obama finally wrote a blog explaining his reasoning behind compromising on the legislation , still to no avail among the netroot activists .
He experienced a small lag of donations from the virtual stand off .
5 Terrorist Fist Jab
Senator Obama claimed primary victory in the Xcel Energy Center on June 3rd .
After the speech , his wife joined him on stage and in a congratulatory fashion , gave him a little fist pound .
The media attempted to define the gesture in several , awkward ways .
On a conservative columnist ’s online article , a disgruntled commenter , “ Larry ” in Alpine , TX , named it a ‘ Hezbollah - style fist jab ’ .
Writing humorously of the different ways the media tried to call the dap , Slate author Christopher Beam accidentally failed to delineate the comment from Cal Thomas ’ piece .
Human Events removed the defamatory comment , making it appear that Cal intentionally scrubbed the incendiary portion only after criticism since the original phrase no longer remained in the comment section .
Despite realizing what confusion ensued over the article and posting a correction , it was too late , as multiple news sources quoted the piece and also mistakenly referenced Thomas ’ column .
Just a short while later , E.D. Hill of FOXnews listed a few different ways the greeting had been called , saying , “ A fist bump ?
A pound ?
A terrorist fist jab ? ”
Everyone criticized the show for lending credence to people ’s fears of Senator Obama .
E.D.
Hill apologized but lost her job as host that week anyway .
The misconception eventually landed on the front page of the controversial New Yorker cover .
4 Rejecting Hagee and Parsley
Senator McCain called Rod Parsley a spiritual adviser .
John Hagee emphatically endorsed him .
Parsley says America was founded to defeat Islam .
Hagee says the Catholic Church is the ‘ Great Whore ’ and an ‘ Apostate Church ’ , and claims God purposely sent Adolf Hitler to get the Jewish people back to Israel .
A big stink was made at liberal blogging sites , like the HuffingtonPost and OpenLeft , over statements made by both .
The internet lit up with opinions on the subject matter , some upset that there existed a sort of double standard over one ’s pastoral associations .
Reporters asked McCain about specific statements delivered by both pastors , forcing McCain to ultimately reject their endorsements .
The trouble ignited by bloggers hurt McCain ’s already flimsy relationship with the religious conservatives , partly reminding everyone of his statement during the 2000 election concerning Reverend Falwell being an ‘ agent of intolerance ’ .
3 Is He Muslim ?
Even prior to Obama ’s candidacy appearing more and more viable , untraceable e-mails sent between concerned friends unequivocally declared he secretly held to the Islamic faith .
Different variations of the e-mails concerned his elementary school , swearing in on the Koran , Mohamed as his middle name , quoting his books improperly , what the Bible says of the anti-Christ , refusing to say the pledge , connections to political events in Kenya and more .
Despite fighting the Smear - type campaigns on cable networks and fact - check sites , unsure Democratic voters neglected to support Obama in the primaries , leading to some very close races with Senator Clinton .
The rumors continue to find support through low information voters refusing to not believe in their close friend or family ’s e-mails .
2 Reverend Wright
In the middle of March , Youtube clips of Obama ’s pastor , Reverend Jeremiah Wright , looped endlessly on personal computer monitors around the country .
They contained offensive remarks about God ’s judgment on America and the government ’s involvement in allegedly spreading AIDs .
News stations around the country played them repeatedly , leading to discussions regarding Obama ’s chances of winning the election dwindling and voters being permanently turned off .
It all culminated in a speech on race called “ A More Perfect Union ” , now watched millions and millions of times on Youtube alone .
Pundits continued to discuss the Wright controversy ad nauseum , but their attention was directed elsewhere just a short while later when newly released video caught Hillary Clinton in a lie about sniper fire .
1 Bloggers vs. Palin
Senator McCain ’s unexpected choice for Vice President took everyone , perhaps even his own staff , by complete surprise .
Barely anyone knew anything about her , causing bloggers to engage in a frenzy of research and rumors .
Most notably , they passed around information suggesting Governor Palin ’s youngest son , Trig , actually belongs to her eldest daughter , Bristol .
Such a commotion came of the rumors that it gained traction on legitimate news sources such as Drudge and the Atlantic .
Just three days after her nod , the campaign released a statement verifying that Bristol Palin was five months pregnant .
This stopped the endless rumors online , but gave way to a national frenzy over the scandalous behavior of the potential VP ’s family .
Botching the Governor ’s important first impression to the nation , the McCain campaign feverishly developed a prime time speech for Wednesday night of the convention .
The discussions on cable networks , newspapers and blogs generated over 40 million viewers for the Palin speech which the media widely praised .
Conservatives already excited by the pick were even more energized by their conceived enemies in the media and on the ‘ angry left ’ .
However , the speech proved to be a double - edged sword for Palin , adding up to a record $ 10 million worth of contributions by enraged Obama supporters online during the 24 hours between her and McCain ’s acceptance speeches .
Bill Burton , Obama ’s spokesperson , commented , “ I hope she gives a speech every day . ”
Final Thoughts
In a majority of these cases , the web encouraged the dissemination of media not particularly flattering for the candidate in question .
A lot of them involved the mainstream media picking up a story with sufficient online buzz .
24/7 Cable news will likely remain an American staple for a long time , yet 2008 showed us regular people wo n’t be powerless forever in what stories capture America ’s living rooms .
If 2004 was our collective infancy learning the web ’s capabilities , 2008 marks the toddler years of using those modern tools .
We ’re only catching the beginning of this user - defined generation , leading to what some call the ‘ Youtube - ification of Politics ’ .
Dual Citizenship — Loyal to Whom ? by Dan Eden
In case you missed it :
Someone wrote and asked me , “ Why are there Israeli - but not Mexican - American Dual Nationals ? ”
Well , here ’s my take on this .
I ’d also like your views and opinions .
Unless we are Native American Indians , all Americans have their origins in some other country .
Both of my parents were from England .
They were proud to be “ British ” but they were most proud of achieving their American citizenship .
Sure , we had pictures of the Queen and nick - nacks with the Union Jack on them .
My mother even celebrated the traditional 4 o’clock tea time and was good at making Yorkshire Pudding .
In the late 60 ’s my older brother served in the US Army and did his tour in Viet Nam .
When it came down to “ allegiance , ” we were all patriotic Americans .
Period .
The word “ allegiance ” means that we promise loyalty .
It also carries with it the expectation that this loyalty will be exclusive and unrestrained .
In the case of a declared war or real threat or conflict , for example , our allegiance to America should preclude any other interest , be it another country or political ideology .
When they took their oath to become American citizens , my parents had to pledge their “ allegiance ” exclusively to America and renounce their allegiance to “ any and all foreign governments . ”
That included Great Britain , one of our strongest allies .
Before Viewzone asked me to research the meaning of “ dual citizenship , ” I had never heard of the term .
How could someone be a citizen of two countries at the same time ?
But I was just ignorant .
Dual nationalities and citizenships are quite common .
From my internet research , I learned that in 1997 , a French Canadian with a U.S. passport ran for mayor of Plattsburgh , N.Y .
He argued that the incumbent spoke French too poorly to be running a city so close to Quebec .
He lost .
Also in 1997 , a retired top American official for the U.S. EPA ( Environmental Protection Agency ) ran for president of Lithuania .
He was inaugurated in February to a burst of fireworks !
In 1996 , Dominicans from New York not only could vote in the Dominican Republic ’s presidential elections for the first time , they could vote for a fellow New Yorker .
Multiple nationalities have become so commonplace that some analysts fear the trend is undermining the notion of nationhood , particularly in the place with the most diverse citizenry on Earth : the United States .
Debate over the issue intensified in the late 1990s , when Mexico joined the growing list of poor nations that say it ’s OK for their nationals to be citizens of the countries to which they have migrated .
Under the law that took effect in 1998 Mexicans abroad — most of them in the United States — will be able to retain Mexican citizenship even if they seek U.S. citizenship .
And naturalized Americans of Mexican descent will be able to reclaim their original citizenship .
The Mexican government stopped short , for now , of giving expatriates the right to vote .
Security Issues
Since citizenship carries with it a responsibility to be exclusively loyal to one country , the whole concept of dual citizenship and nationality raises questions about which of the dual citizenships have priority .
This is extremely important when the two countries have opposing interests .
It can be a deadly problem when a dual citizen is in a high position within our American government .
Can one imagine a Japanese citizen serving in the Pentagon during WWII ?
Or how about a citizen of the Soviet Union holding a cabinet position in the White House during the Cold War ?
Today ’s conflicts are centered in the Middle East .
America needs to balance foreign policies towards oil producing Arab nations with our goal being peace and stability in the region .
This places a burden on our government to be even - handed in our dealings with the Arab world and Israel .
While the Iraq War was waged on lies about Weapons of Mass Destruction and revenge for 911 , the real reason has emerged as a well designed global plan to improve the power and leverage of Israel .
Added to this policy is yet another potential blow to American interests and security — the impending War with Iran .
This war will be waged for the security of Israel and will be paid for by the blood of American soldiers and the hard - earned money of American citizens whose quality of life is inversely tied to the cost of petrolium .
Recently , in their much lauded paper , The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy , Harvard professor , Stephen Walt , and University of Chicago professor , John Mearsheimer , focused attention on the strong Israeli lobby which has a powerful influence over American foreign policies ( see BBC article ) .
They detail the influence that this lobby has exerted , forming a series of international policies which can be viewed as in direct opposition to the interests and security of the American people .
These acts and policies are more often than not carried out by US government appointees who hold powerful positions and who are dual American - Israeli citizens .
Since the policies they support are often exclusively beneficial to Israel , often to the detriment of America , it has been argued that their loyalties are misdirected .
A few classic examples can be cited here .
Jonathan Jay Pollard was an American - Israeli citizen who worked for the US government .
He is well known because he stole more secrets from the U.S. than has any other spy in American history .
During his interrogation Pollard said he felt compelled to put the “ interests of my state ” ahead of his own .
Although as a U.S. Navy counter - intelligence specialist he had a top - secret security clearance , by “ my state ” he meant the state of Israel .
Literally tens of thousands of Americans holding U.S. passports admit they feel a primary allegiance to the state of Israel .
In many instances , these Americans vote in Israeli elections , wear Israeli uniforms and fight in Israeli wars .
Many are actively engaged both in the confiscation of Palestinian lands and in the Israeli political system .
Three examples come to mind :
One is Rabbi Meir Kahane , who founded the militant Jewish Defense League in the U.S. in the 1960s , then emigrated to Israel where , eventually , he was elected to the Knesset .
Until he was shot and killed at one of his U.S. fund - raising rallies in 1990 , the Brooklyn - born rabbi shuttled between Tel Aviv and New York , where he recruited militant American Jews for his activities in Israel against Palestinians .
He claimed to be a “ dual citizen ” of America and Israel .
Another Jewish American , James Mahon from Alexandria , Virginia , reportedly was on a secret mission to kill PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat when he was shot in 1980 by an unknown assailant .
When he was shot , Mahon held an American M - 16 in his hand and a U.S. passport in his pocket .
Then there was Alan Harry Goodman , an American Jew who left his home in Baltimore , Maryland , flew to Israel and served in the Israeli army .
Then , on April 11 , 1982 , armed with an Uzi submachine gun , he walked , alone , to Al - Aqsa , Jerusalem ’s most holy Islamic shrine , where he opened fire , killing two Palestinians and wounding others .
Both the U.S. and Israeli governments played down the incident , as did the media .
Most recently , US Navy Petty Officer , Ariel J. Weinmann , while serving at or near Bahrain , Mexico , and Austria , “ with intent or reason to believe it would be used to the injury of the United States or to the advantage of a foreign nation ( Israel ) , [ attempted ] to communicate , deliver or transmit classified CONFIDENTIAL and SECRET information relating to the national defense , to a representative , officer , agent or employee of a foreign government . ”
Weinmann was apprehended on March 26 after being listed as “ a deserter by his command , ” according to the US Navy .
The information he gathered was supplied to Israel .
The examples of Kahane , Mahonm , Goodman and Weinmann raise the question of when a U.S. citizen ceases to be , or should cease to be , a U.S. citizen .
U.S. Law at one time clearly stated that an American citizen owed first allegiance to the United States .
A U.S. citizen should not fight in a foreign army or hold high office in a foreign country without risking expatriation .
What the heck happened ?
The 1940 Nationality Act
Section 401 ( e ) of the 1940 Nationality
Act provides that a U.S. citizen , whether by birth or naturalization , “ shall lose his [ U.S. ] nationality by …voting in a political election in a foreign state . ”
This law was tested many times .
In 1958 , for instance , an American citizen named Perez voted in a Mexican election .
The case went to the Supreme Court , where the majority opinion held that Perez must lose his American nationality .
The court said Congress could provide for expatriation as a reasonable way of preventing embarrassment to the United States in its foreign relations .
But then something very odd happened .
In 1967 an American Jew , Beys Afroyim received an exemption that set a precedent exclusively for American Jews .
Afroyim , born in Poland in 1895 , emigrated to America in 1912 , and became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1926 .
In 1950 , aged 55 , he emigrated to Israel and became an Israeli citizen .
In 1951 Afroyim voted in an Israeli Knesset election and in five political elections that followed .
So , by all standards he lost his American citizenship — right ?
Wrong .
After living in Israel for a decade , Afroyim wished to return to New York .
In 1960 , he asked the U.S. Consulate in Haifa for an American passport .
The Department of State refused the application , invoking section 401 ( e ) of the Nationality Act — the same ruling that had stripped the American citizen named Perez of his U.S. citizenship .
Attorneys acting for Afroyim took his case to a Washington , DC District Court , which upheld the law .
Then his attorneys appealed to the Court of Appeals .
This court also upheld the law .
The attorneys for Afroyim then moved the case on to the Supreme Court .
Here , with Supreme Court Justice Abe Fortas , Lyndon Johnson ’s former attorney and one of the most powerful Jewish Americans , casting the swing vote , the court voted five to four in favor of Afroyim .
The court held that the U.S. government had no right to “ rob ” Afroyim of his American citizenship !
The court , reversing its previous judgment as regards the Mexican American , ruled that Afroyim had not shown “ intent ” to lose citizenship by voting in Israeli elections .
Huh ?
While Washington claims it has a “ good neighbor ” policy with Mexico , the U.S. does not permit Mexicans to hold dual nationality .
The US makes them become either U.S. or Mexican — you ca n’t be both .
But the U.S. , in its special relationship with Israel , has become very sympathetic to allowing Israeli - Americans to retain two nationalities and allowing U.S. citizens not only to hold public office in Israel , but to hold US government positions as well !
No other country holds this special exception to our laws of citizenship .
So , you might ask , are there any other dual Israel - American citizens who hold US government positions that could compromise American security ?
Yes .
Consider the following list that I obtained on the web :
Michael Mukasey
Recently appointed as US Attorney General .
Mukasey also was the judge in the litigation between developer Larry Silverstein and several insurance companies arising from the destruction of the World Trade Center .
Michael Chertoff
Former Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division , at the Justice Department ; now head of Homeland Security .
Richard Perle
One of Bush ’s foreign policy advisors , he is the chairman of the Pentagon ’s Defense Policy Board .
A very likely Israeli government agent , Perle was expelled from Senator Henry Jackson ’s office in the 1970 ’s after the National Security Agency ( NSA ) caught him passing Highly - Classified ( National Security ) documents to the Israeli Embassy .
He later worked for the Israeli weapons firm , Soltam .
Perle came from one the above mentioned pro-Israel thinktanks , the AEI .
Perle is one of the leading pro-Israeli fanatics leading this Iraq war mongering within the administration and now in the media .
Paul Wolfowitz
Former Deputy Defense Secretary , and member of Perle ’s Defense Policy Board , in the Pentagon .
Wolfowitz is a close associate of Perle , and reportedly has close ties to the Israeli military .
His sister lives in Israel .
Wolfowitz came from the above mentioned Jewish thinktank , JINSA .
Wolfowitz was the number two leader within the administration behind this Iraq war mongering .
He later was appointed head of the World Bank but resigned under pressure from World Bank members over a scandal involving his misuse of power .
Douglas Feith
Under Secretary of Defense and Policy Advisor at the Pentagon .
He is a close associate of Perle and served as his Special Counsel .
Like Perle and the others , Feith is a pro-Israel extremist , who has advocated anti-Arab policies in the past .
He is closely associated with the extremist group , the Zionist Organization of America , which even attacks Jews that do n’t agree with its extremist views .
Feith frequently speaks at ZOA conferences .
Feith runs a small law firm , Feith and Zell , which only has one International office , in Israel .
The majority of their legal work is representing Israeli interests .
His firm ’s own website stated , prior to his appointment , that Feith “ represents Israeli Armaments Manufacturer . ”
Feith basically represents the Israeli War Machine .
Feith also came from the Jewish thinktank JINSA .
Feith , like Perle and Wolfowitz , are campaigning hard for this Israeli proxy war against Iraq .
Lawrence ( Larry ) Franklin
The former Defense Intelligence Agency analyst with expertise in Iranian policy issues who worked in the office of Undersecretary of Defense for Policy Douglas Feith and reported directly to Feith ’s deputy , William Luti , was sentenced January 20 , 2006 , “ to more than 12 years in prison for giving classified information to an Israeli diplomat ” and members of the pro-Israel lobbying group American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) .
Franklin will “ remain free while the government continues with the wider case ” and his “ prison time could be sharply reduced in return for his help in prosecuting ” former AIPAC members Steven J. Rosen and Keith Weissman , [ who ] are scheduled to go on trial in April [ 2006 ] .
Franklin admitted that he met periodically with Rosen and Weissman between 2002 and 2004 and discussed classified information , including information about potential attacks on U.S. troops in Iraq .
Rosen and Weissman would later share what they learned with reporters and Israeli officials . ” ( source : sourcewatch.com ) .
Edward Luttwak
Member of the National Security Study Group of the Department of Defence at the Pentagon .
Luttwak is reportedly an Israeli citizen and has taught in Israel .
He frequently writes for Israeli and pro-Israeli newspapers and journals .
Luttwak is an Israeli extremist whose main theme in many of his articles is the necessity of the U.S. waging war against Iraq and Iran .
Henry Kissinger
One of many Pentagon Advisors , Kissinger sits on the Pentagon ’s Defense Policy Board under Perle .
For detailed information about Kissinger ’s evil past , read Seymour Hersch ’s book ( Price of Power : Kissinger in the Nixon White House ) .
Kissinger likely had a part in the Watergate crimes , Southeast Asia mass murders ( Vietnam , Cambodia , Laos ) , Installing Chilean mass murdering dictator Pinochet , Operation Condor ’s mass killings in South America , and more recently served as Serbia ’s Ex-Dictator Slobodan Milosevic ’s Advisor .
He consistently advocated going to war against Iraq .
Kissinger is the Ariel Sharon of the U.S. Unfortunately , President Bush nominated Kissinger as chairman of the September 11 investigating commission .
It ’s like picking a bank robber to investigate a fraud scandal .
He later declined this job under enormous protests .
Dov Zakheim
Dov Zakheim is an ordained rabbi and reportedly holds Israeli citizenship .
Zakheim attended Jew ’s College in London and became an ordained Orthodox Jewish Rabbi in 1973 .
He was adjunct professor at New York ’s Jewish Yeshiva University .
Zakheim is close to the Israeli lobby .
Dov Zakheim is also a member of the Council on Foreign Relations and in 2000 a co-author of the Project for the New American Century ’s position paper , Rebuilding America ’s Defenses , advocating the necessity for a Pearl - Harbor - like incident to mobilize the country into war with its enemies , mostly Middle Eastern Muslim nations .
He was appointed by Bush as Pentagon Comptroller from May 4 , 2001 to March 10 , 2004 .
At that time he was unable to explain the disappearance of $ 1 trillion dollars .
Actually , nearly three years earlier , Donald Rumsfeld announced on September 10 , 2001 that an audit discovered $ 2.3 trillion was also missing from the Pentagon books .
That story , as mentioned , was buried under 9 - 11 ’s rubble .
The two sums disappeared on Zakheim ’s watch .
We can only guess where that cash went .
Despite these suspicions , on May 6 , 2004 , Zakheim took a lucrative position at Booz Allen Hamilton , one of the most prestigious strategy consulting firms in the world .
One of its clients then was Blessed Relief , a charity said to be a front for Osama bin Laden .
Booz , Allen & Hamilton then also worked closely with DARPA , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , which is the research arm of the Department of Defense .
Judicial Inc ’s bio of Dov tells us Zakheim is a dual Israeli / American citizen and has been tracking the halls of US government for 25 years , casting defense policy and influence on Presidents Reagan , Clinton , Bush Sr. and Bush Jr. Judicial Inc points out that most of Israel ’s armaments were gotten thanks to him .
Squads of US F - 16 and F - 15 were classified military surplus and sold to Israel at a fraction of their value .
Kenneth Adelman
One of many Pentagon Advisors , Adelman also sits on the Pentagon ’s Defense Policy Board under Perle , and is another extremist pro-Israel advisor , who supported going to war against Iraq .
Adelman frequently is a guest on Fox News , and often expresses extremist and often ridiculus anti-Arab and anti-Muslim views .
Through his racism or ignorance , he actually called Arabs “ anti-Semitic ” on Fox News ( 11/28/2001 ) , when he could have looked it up in the dictionary to find out that Arabs by definition are Semites .
I. Lewis “ Scooter ” Libby
Vice President Dick Cheney ’s ex-Chief of Staff .
As chief pro-Israel Jewish advisor to Cheney , it helps explains why Cheney is so gun-ho to invade Iran .
Libby is longtime associate of Wolfowitz .
Libby was also a lawyer for convicted felon and Israeli spy Marc Rich , whom Clinton pardoned , in his last days as president .
Libby was recently found guilty of lying to Federal investigators in the Valerie Plame affair , in which Plame , a covert CIA agent , was exposed for political revenge by the Bush administration following her husband ’s revelations about the lies leading to the Iraq War .
Robert Satloff
U.S. National Security Council Advisor , Satloff was the executive director of the Israeli lobby ’s “ think tank , ” Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
Many of the Israeli lobby ’s “ experts ” come from this front group , like Martin Indyk .
Elliott Abrams
National Security Council Advisor .
He previously worked at Washington - based “ Think Tank ” Ethics and Public Policy Center .
During the Reagan Adminstration , Abrams was the Assistant Secretary of State , handling , for the most part , Latin American affairs .
He played an important role in the Iran - Contra Scandal , which involved illegally selling U.S. weapons to Iran to fight Iraq , and illegally funding the contra rebels fighting to overthrow Nicaragua ’s Sandinista government .
He also actively deceived three congressional committees about his involvement and thereby faced felony charges based on his testimony .
Abrams pled guilty in 1991 to two misdemeanors and was sentenced to a year ’s probation and 100 hours of community service .
A year later , former President Bush ( Senior ) granted Abrams a full pardon .
He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Reagan Administration ’s State Department .
Marc Grossman
Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs .
He was Director General of the Foreign Service and Director of Human Resources at the Department of State .
Grossman is one of many of the pro-Israel Jewish officials from the Clinton Administration that Bush has promoted to higher posts .
Richard Haass
Director of Policy Planning at the State Department and Ambassador at large .
He is also Director of National Security Programs and Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) .
He was one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the first Bush ( Sr ) Administration who sat on the National Security Council , and who consistently advocated going to war against Iraq .
Haass is also a member of the Defense Department ’s National Security Study Group , at the Pentagon .
Robert Zoellick
U.S. Trade Representative , a cabinet - level position .
He is also one of the more hawkish pro-Israel Jews in the Bush ( Jr ) Administration who advocated invading Iraq and occupying a portion of the country in order to set up a Vichy - style puppet government .
He consistently advocates going to war against Iran .
Ari Fleischer
Ex - White House Spokesman for the Bush ( Jr ) Administration .
Prominent in the Jewish community , some reports state that he holds Israeli citizenship .
Fleischer is closely connected to the extremist Jewish group called the Chabad Lubavitch Hasidics , who follow the Qabala , and hold very extremist and insulting views of non-Jews .
Fleischer was the co-president of Chabad ’s Capitol Jewish Forum .
He received the Young Leadership Award from the American Friends of Lubavitch in October , 2001 .
James Schlesinger
One of many Pentagon Advisors , Schlesinger also sits on the Pentagon ’s Defense Policy Board under Perle and is another extremist pro-Israel advisor , who supported going to war against Iraq .
Schlesinger is also a commissioner of the Defense Department ’s National Security Study Group , at the Pentagon .
David Frum
White House speechwriter behind the “ Axis of Evil ” label .
He lumped together all the lies and accusations against Iraq for Bush to justify the war .
Joshua Bolten
White House Deputy Chief of Staff , Bolten was previously a banker , former legislative aide , and prominent in the Jewish community .
John Bolton
Former UN Representative and Under - Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security .
Bolton is also a Senior Advisor to President Bush .
Prior to this position , Bolton was Senior Vice President of the above mentioned pro-Israel thinktank , AEI .
He recently ( October 2002 ) accused Syria of having a nuclear program , so that they can attack Syria after Iraq .
He must have forgotten that Israel has 400 nuclear warheads , some of which are thermonuclear weapons ( according to a recent U.S. Air Force report ) .
David Wurmser
Special Assistant to John Bolton ( above ) , the under - secretary for arms control and international security .
Wurmser also worked at the AEI with Perle and Bolton .

I do n’t know about you , but dual citizenship is fine with me for an ordinary citizen .
But if you hold an official position that demands that you put American interests above all else — if you should look transparent and fair to the rest of the world regarding your formation of Middle East foreign policies , then this is a dangerous trend .
Even if there were no pro-Israeli agenda , the fact that decision makers have a bias or an allegiance to one of the parties involved in the current conflict should have raised red flags long before now .
If you think we ’re being unfair here , ask yourself :
How you would react to the Head of Homeland Security if he or she were a dual national with citizenship in Iran , Lebanon or Saudi Arabia ?
UPDATE : December 4 , 2007
Ask yourself why you do n’t feel the same about Israeli dual citizenship .
Then you will understand how powerful the Israeli lobby has been in “ adjusting ” your acceptance of their special status .
Hey , I could be way off on this .
Let ’s hear from you .
Newsweek ’s Michael Isikoff reports that Iraq war architect Paul Wolfowitz has been rewarded with a new position in the Bush administration which will allow him to oversee classified intelligence and inform policies on WMD issues .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has offered Wolfowitz , a prime architect of the Iraq War , a position as chairman of the International Security Advisory Board , a prestigious State Department panel , according to two department sources who declined to be identified discussing personnel matters .
The 18 - member panel , which has access to highly classified intelligence , advises Rice on disarmament , nuclear proliferation , WMD issues and other matters .
“ We think he is well suited and will do an excellent job , ” said one senior official .

Matt Simmons and the Five Psychological Stage of Grief
This is a wonderful clip .
Matt Simmons is the author of ‘ Twighlight in the Desert ’ , is a leading US investment banker , and a long - term advocate of the peak oil argument .
When he was asked to go on CNBC ’s ‘ Fast Money ’ to discuss the high oil prices , he clearly stunned the presenters with his forthright analysis of society ’s current perilous situation .
When asked if $ 147 a barrel is a ‘ wake up call ’ he replied “ yes , but we ’re not having a wake up call , we ’re having a witch hunt for who got us here ” , a succinct analysis of the current world situation .
What was especially fascinating to watch was when he was asked for his prognosis of the near future .
The nub of his argument is that oil is still actually very cheap , and that the biggest danger the world faces at the moment is those people who argue that the current high prices are a blip , a bubble , a speculators spike .
When asked for his scenario of the next year or two , he replied that the US would keep dropping its inventories ( of oil ) and feeling good about it , which would be followed by a shortage , which would , in turn , lead to “ a run on the banks so fast your eyes would spin .
This is when everyone tops up their tank .
We have n’t run out of oil , but we could literally run out of usable diesel and gasoline and then we would have the Great American Disaster , because within a week we ’d have run out of food ” .
At this point the looks on the faces of the presenters is priceless .
Yet Simmons is n’t finished yet .
What can we do now , he is asked .
We need to retreat from our oil addiction , “ start living in villages again , eliminate long distance communiting by liberating the workforce and paying by productivity and growing food locally , and starting to embrace an enormous amount of R&D into things we ’re not really doing anything about today , likek ocean energy , geothermal , then within 5 - 7 we could get ourselves out of a very deep hole , but we have to do it real quick ” .
The programme ’s oil analyst then quickly goes straight off back into business - as - usual , and the discomfort evident in those in the studio subsides .
In Richard Heinberg ’s ‘ Peak Everything ’ , he cites Elizabeth Kubler - Ross ’s five psychological stages people go through when told they have a terminal illness , denial , anger , bargaining , depression , acceptance .
I am increasingly finding these a useful scale by which to measure where people are at in the peak oil debate .
While Simmons appears to have moved , in this piece , to acceptance , the presenters are still in the bargaining phase , as if we can somehow haggle and trade our way out of this .
When I look around at UK society today , we see the denial about peak oil in the tabloids arguing that high oil prices are all the governments fault , and in the conspiracy loons who argue there is still hundreds of years worth of supplies which some mythical ‘ they ’ are hiding from us , the anger in the striking hauliers and other fuel protesters , the denial in government circles who still argue that oil will cost $ 67 a barrel in 2020 , the bargaining in the debates around the 2 p duty on fuel , the depression about it seems to be pretty common in writers on the subject , and then the acceptance , which I guess is what Transition work is trying to do , to look at the practicalities of where to go once people accept what is happening .
It is fascinating to see what happens as people move through these stages , and I see lots of people moving through them quite quickly these days !
What is so fascinating about this clip , is that it is somehow a microcosm of what happens when people in denial and in bargaining meet someone from the acceptance stage .
Now all we need is for Simmons ( and others ) to really integrate climate change into his thinking , and then that acceptance would be even more powerful !
These exchanges are happening more and more these days , and what is important , I think , is not to take any of these 5 stages as being somehow superior to any of the others , there is no moral high ground here , rather they are all perfectly natural responses to a bewildering situation , although ultimately , the faster we can move towards acceptance , the faster we can actually start in earnest our preparations for life after oil .

I searched and searched this picture looking for a some violent looking Muslim and then I finally see some poor woman in a scarf , minding her own business , pushing a baby carriage .
THATS what this is about ?
Some poor mother not bothering anyone ?
Geez , way to over - react people .

PHOTO BY NOEL NEUBURGER The McClatchy Co. president , chairman and CEO Gary Pruitt rolls up his sleeves for the dirty work ahead : Guiding McClatchy through the “ titanic downturn . ”
Advertisement
One of Gary Pruitt ’s favorite hikes is the Half Dome Cables Route in Yosemite National Park .
The 52 - year - old president , chairman , and chief executive officer of The McClatchy Co. keeps photographs of himself and friends scrabbling up the steep granite incline on the desk in his Q Street office in Midtown Sacramento .
Misty , subdued landscapes of Half Dome and Bridalveil Fall adorn an opposite wall , solemn windows looming over the rectangular granite meeting table where Pruitt and company plot the moves of the third largest newspaper chain in the country .
Those moves have taken on a deep sense of urgency as of late .
Since Pruitt began engineering the risky , controversial purchase of the Knight Ridder newspaper chain three years ago , McClatchy ’s price per share has plummeted nearly 90 percent .
It ’s as if the company clawed its way up the Cables Route , only to plunge down the 4800 - foot precipice on the other side .
As this issue was going to press , Pruitt resigned from four trusts that control 80 percent of McClatchy ’s voting stock , sparking speculation that the publicly traded company may go private — a move that would undoubtedly anger shareholders — with Pruitt cast as the fall guy .
Pruitt says that ’s nonsense , but everyone ’s waiting for the splat .
However , Pruitt has defied the odds before .
In a decade of industry decline and stiffening competition from the Internet , the boyish , charismatic CEO known to quote Rolling Stones lyrics charted a steady course to the top .
Then the bottom fell out of the real - estate market , sucking McClatchy and the entire newspaper industry down with it .
They ’re already calling 2008 the year the newspaper died .
It is the worst year of Gary Pruitt ’s life .
I first learned Pruitt was a Rolling Stones fan while researching a story I was writing about the Knight Ridder purchase .
I ’m three years younger , and happen to be a pretty big fan myself .
I called him and asked a few obvious questions about the purchase , then changed the topic to the Stones .
We ended up trading arcane facts about the world ’s greatest rock ’ n ’ roll band for another 20 minutes .
Every call after that ’s been the same .
Our love and knowledge of Stones lore provides a common mythology that transcends the fact that Pruitt heads the third largest newspaper corporation in the country and I work at the local alternative newsweekly .
Sacred though our bond may be , it was the only leverage I had to gain a live audience with the beleaguered chief executive .
Wearing black boot - cut stretch jeans and an awesome Rolling Stones shirt I got off the clearance rack at Macy ’s , I approached him at a Rotary Club luncheon four months ago .
He was the scheduled speaker , standing tall , slim and athletic within a circle of silvery - haired Rotarians .
I stepped into the circle and parted my black sport coat to display the shirt .
“ Gary , I wore this just for you , ” I beamed .
“ Hey , that ’s a cool shirt ! ”
How could he turn me down ?
Actually , he canceled the first interview , which would have taken place the week after McClatchy ordered a nationwide , 10 percent across - the - board cutback , laying off 1,400 of its 14,000 employees .
He thought my concept of setting the drama surrounding the company to the music of the Rolling Stones was interesting , but the timing was n’t right .
When we finally did meet last month , the timing still was n’t right .
“ I thought about the Rolling Stones theme ; I enjoyed reading your e-mails , ” he said .
“ But I was afraid if we tied it too closely to that , it may seem to make light of what is obviously a very serious situation .
I did n’t want to appear to be taking it lightly , because I do n’t . ”
Which is a shame , because Pruitt ’s Rolling Stones stories are much better than mine .
May the good Lord shine a light on you
Make every song the same ,
your favorite tune .
— The Rolling Stones ,
“ Shine a Light , ” Exile on Main Street
Pruitt first saw the Stones on his 15th birthday in 1972 , when he camped out overnight to watch the band ’s Fourth of July concert at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in Washington , D.C .
“ In that concert , you felt anything could happen , good or bad , ” he recalled .
“ You did not feel like you or anyone else was in total control , which is thrilling but scary .
You never have near that feeling at a concert now . ”
Indeed .
Nowadays , that thrill has been reserved for newspaper executives .
He caught the Rolling Stones 1975 tour at the Gator Bowl on the night he graduated from the University of Florida at the age of 18 .
He studied First Amendment law at UC Berkeley , and was hired as McClatchy ’s in - house counsel in 1984 .
He took over the publishing helm at The Fresno Bee in 1991 .
McClatchy had purchased a string of three medium - sized South Carolina dailies the previous year , and Pruitt ’s fortunes rose with the company .
In 1994 , he was promoted to chief operating officer ; by 1996 , he was commanding the fleet as McClatchy ’s CEO .
Under his leadership , McClatchy ’s stock continued to rise , and Wall Street took notice .
The fact that Pruitt occasionally threw a little rock ’ n ’ roll into the mix at shareholder meetings did n’t hurt .
“ Hey , at each annual meeting , we show our photography set to a song , ” he enthused .
“ This year we did — they ’re not always current ! —'( What ’s So Funny ’ Bout ) Peace , Love and Understanding , ’ by Elvis Costello .
We did Jimmy Eat World , ‘ Middle ’ ; the New Radicals , ‘ You Get What You Give . ’
We did ‘ Rockin ’ in the Free World , ’ Neil Young .
Did the original ‘ This Land is Your Land ’ with Woodie Guthrie .
Did some reggae songs .
So yeah , our shareholders meetings are different in that respect . ”
The industry was already in a decade - long decline , but McClatchy ’s circulation and readership continued to climb , validating Pruitt ’s belief that a firm commitment to quality journalism was essential to succeed .
From the beginning , the company ’s strategy had been to acquire newspapers in high - growth markets where no daily competition existed , and it paid off in higher net profits , a steadily rising price per share and more money for newsrooms .
“ Our strategy has always been consistent with striving to be and achieving the status of leading local media company , ” Pruitt said .
“ That means having the biggest audience , the most advertising revenue .
What it takes to be the leading local media company has certainly changed over time , but our feeling is , if you pick your markets carefully and execute well , you should be able to do well over time . ”
Evolution and creationism can both be examined , says Professor Reiss Creationism should be discussed in school science lessons , rather than excluded , says the director of education at the Royal Society .
Professor Michael Reiss says that if pupils have strongly - held beliefs about creationism these should be explored .
Rather than dismissing creationism as a " misconception " , he says it should be seen as a cultural " world view " .
Teachers should take the time to explain why creationism had no scientific basis , Prof Reiss said .
He stressed that the topic should not be taught as science .
This was more valuable than simply " banging on " about evolution , he said .
Prof Reiss , a biologist and Church of England minister , said he now believed it was more effective to engage with pupils ' ideas about creationism , rather than to obstruct discussion with those who do not accept the scientific version of the evolution of species .
Evolution Creationists take a literal interpretation of the Bible 's description of the origin of life and reject the Darwinian concept of evolution .
Some Muslims also support creationist theories .
Prof Reiss , speaking at the British Association Festival of Science at the University of Liverpool , estimates that about one in 10 children is from a family which supports a creationist view rather than evolutionary .
He says that in his experience it is more effective to include discussion about creationism alongside scientific theories such as the Big Bang and evolution .
I realised that simply banging on about evolution and natural selection did n't lead some pupils to change their minds at all
Professor Michael Reiss
" An increasing percentage of children in the UK come from families that do not accept the scientific version of the history of the universe and the evolution of species .
" What are we to do with those children ?
My experience after having tried to teach biology for 20 years is if one simply gives the impression that such children are wrong , then they are not likely to learn much about the science that one really wants them to learn .
" I think a better way forward is to say to them 'look , I simply want to present you with the scientific understanding of the history of the universe and how animals and plants and other organisms evolved ' .
He also added a clarification on his position regarding creationism in schools .
" Some of my comments about the teaching of creationism have been misinterpreted as suggesting that creationism should be taught in science classes .
Creationism has no scientific basis .
" However , when young people ask questions about creationism in science classes , teachers need to be able to explain to them why evolution and the Big Bang are scientific theories but they should also take the time to explain how science works and why creationism has no scientific basis .
" I have referred to science teachers discussing creationism as a worldview ' ; this is not the same as lending it any scientific credibility . "
Understanding the universe Prof Reiss said that he had shifted his own views on how to respond to creationism .
" I realised that simply banging on about evolution and natural selection did n't lead some pupils to change their minds at all .
" Now I would be more content simply for them to understand it as one way of understanding the universe . "
This was challenged by Simon Underdown , senior lecturer in the department of anthropology at Oxford Brookes University .
Creationism should be taught within the context of religion rather than science , said Dr Underdown .
" It is not something that fits within the mainstream of science . "
With so much to be crammed into science lessons , it was not a worthwhile use of time to include lessons about creationism , he argued .
Others also argued that such views had no place in science lessons .
In a leading article The Times said , " to consider creationism and its stepchild intelligent design as if they were science is to inflict an injustice on schoolchildren " .

A tangle of tubes and polyurethane pouches binds a naked man and woman — he , paunchy and unperturbed , she , slim and similarly unself - conscious .
This setup is not some esoteric sex game ; it ’s “ Smell Blind Date , ” an installation created by artist James Auger on display this past spring in New York City as part of the Museum of Modern Art ’s exhibition Design and the Elastic Mind .
The PVC tubes — which run between the subjects ’ chests , with outlets extending to pouches attached to their noses , armpits and genitals — allow the man and woman to inhale each other ’s body odor through a wall that divides them .
In theory , they are on a truly blind date , each undistracted by the other ’s looks , assessing the other ’s potential as a mating partner by his or her smell alone .
DUBAI ( Reuters ) - Two Gulf Arab investors have expressed interest in buying General Motors Corp ’s ( GM ) Hummer brand , the company ’s Middle East chief told Reuters on Tuesday .
Hummer vehicles are displayed outside a dealership in Chantilly , Virginia , June 3 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
“ For sure , there has been interest from various parties within the Gulf ... there is a precedent in the cases of Aston Martin , Ferrari or Daimler and those kinds of solutions could be very realistic solutions , ” GM Middle East Managing Director Terry Johnsson said in a telephone interview .
GM was readying sales documents for its Hummer brand and had initial expressions of interest from potential buyers that it hoped to develop into formal sale talks , the automaker ’s Chief Executive Rick Wagoner said on August 21 .
“ Apparently , we have had two separate investors raise their hand as being interested , but I do n’t know what ’s happened since then , ” Johnsson said .
Johnsson said he was not directly involved in the sale process .
Analysts have said they expect the military - derived Hummer brand to be a tough sell for GM , which aims to raise up to $ 4 billion in asset sales through 2009 as part of a plan to conserve cash and ride out a brutal downturn in U.S. sales .
Making vehicles that average between nine and 14 miles per gallon , Hummer is not a particularly attractive asset as gasoline prices squeeze drivers worldwide and environmental concerns increasingly trump any other notion of what is cool .
Modeled on U.S. military vehicles widely deployed in the Gulf War in 1991 , the Hummer sports utility vehicle ( SUV ) made its debut shortly afterwards , when U.S. gasoline prices were less than half what they are now .
GM ’s U.S. sales were down 18 percent through July and analysts have raised concern about a cash burn at the top U.S. automaker that reached $ 3.6 billion in the latest quarter .
Detroit automakers have been hit hard by a dramatic shift in buying to passenger cars and fuel - efficient , car - based SUVs , forcing them to restructure .
The Gulf would be one viable option where rapid economic growth , low fuel prices and the brand ’s position as a status symbol have made the region one of the biggest buyers of the Hummer .
“ The Hummer as a total volume is small , but in terms of growth it is going very fast , ” said Johnsson .
“ The brand is extremely vibrant ... which augurs very well . ”
Tata Motors Ltd , India ’s No.1 vehicle maker , in June completed the $ 2.3 billion acquisition of Jaguar and Land Rover from Ford Motor Co .
Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Development
Co bought a 5 percent stake in Ferrari in 2005 , while Kuwait ’s Investment Dar last year bought half of Aston Martin .

According to The Los Angeles Times , the 20 year - old son of Hip Hop superstar Dr. Dre was found dead Saturday morning , when his mother attempted to wake him .
The city ’s coroner told the newspaper that reports stated that the young man born Andre Young , Jr. had been in Los Angeles partying , when he returned to his mother ’s Woodland Hills , California residence at approximately 5:30 am .
He was found less than five hours later , unresponsive .
Cause of death has yet to be determined .
Dr. Dre has yet to release any statement nor confirm relations .
The mother has also remained anonymous , although the mother is believed not to be Dre protege and ’90s R&B singer Michel ’le , with whom Dre did have a son .
Dr. Dre has at least five children , two of whom have stated aspirations to rap .

Report : Because of Bush obstinance , civil liberties board exists ' in name only '
RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday July 9 , 2008
Print This Email This President Bush is refusing to nominate the House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's pick to serve on a government privacy and civil liberties board , raising the prospect that the board will remain member - less and inactive until his term is over .
The report from Newsweek 's Michael Isikoff and Mark Hosenball , ironically came the same day the Senate voted to approve a controversial surveillance bill decried by civil liberties advocates .
Without any public announcement , the White House recently sent a letter to Capitol Hill stating it would nominate only one of two names recommended by congressional leaders to sit on the five - member civil liberties panel .
The candidate whose name it would not forward : Morton Halperin , a veteran and sometimes controversial civil liberties advocate who has a famous role in the history of modern debates over government wiretapping .
While serving on the National Security Council during the early days of the Nixon administration , Halperin 's phone was secretly wiretapped by the FBI because his then boss , Henry Kissinger , suspected he was leaking to the press .
The White House gave no explanation for why it had vetoed Halperin from serving on the civil liberties panel .
But the move prompted Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to tell the White House that the Senate , in retaliation , will not move any of President Bush 's three candidates for the panel ( one of whom , Ronald Rotunda , was once a legal adviser to former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ) .
" How would we ever get our nominees confirmed if we could only confirm Republicans ? " explained Jim Manley , Reid 's spokesman , when asked about the majority leader 's hardball stand .
The five - member Privacy and Civil Liberties Board was created in 2004 after being recommended by the 9/11 Commission .
President Bush initially refused to nominate anyone at all leaving the commission vacant since the previous board 's term ended in January .
" Although it was first mandated by Congress in Dec. 2004 , and reauthorized with newly independent powers nearly a year ago , the civil liberties board exists today in name only , " Isikoff and Hosenball write .
" It has no office , no staff and no members . "
If you 've never heard of the exciting field of synthetic biology , you 're not alone , but you might want to get wise to the field 's controversial promise to create life from scratch .
About two - thirds of U.S. residents are clueless as well , having never heard of the synthetic biology .
Only 2 percent in a new telephone survey of 1,003 adults said they have heard a lot about the work , which crosses biology with technology and promises to create forms of life that Nature never thought of .
Synthetic biologists engineer and build or redesign living organisms , such as bacteria , to carry out specific functions .
The field is a scientific playground for the genetic code , where previously nonexistent DNA is formulated in test tubes .
By taking genetic engineering to the extreme , synthetic biologists aim to make life in the lab .
The promise is that the novel organisms will fight disease , create alternative fuels or build living computers .
Already , researchers have transplanted genetic material from one microbe species into the cellular body of another , described last year as the living " equivalent to converting a Macintosh computer to a PC by inserting a new piece of software . "
" We face daunting problems of climate change , energy , health , and water resources , " a group of 17 leading scientists in the field stated last year .
" Synthetic biology offers solutions to these issues : microorganisms that convert plant matter to fuels or that synthesize new drugs or target and destroy rogue cells in the body . "
Now you know .
But why should you care ?
For one , the field " is potentially controversial because it raises issues of ownership , misuse , unintended consequences and accidental release , " according to a report earlier this year commissioned by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council in England .
In a nutshell , some fear microscopic lab freaks might escape and wreak havoc .
That in mind , scientists are concerned that the United States is falling behind other countries in many areas of science and technology and that the current administration has been downright hostile toward some fields of science .
Obtaining federal funding for cutting - edge research can be challenging when the public does n't even know what the research is about or what its benefits might be .
And as the new poll showed , we tend to fear what we do n't know .
Respondents were asked how they viewed the potential risks and rewards of the new technology .
" Those more familiar with synthetic biology are more inclined to have a positive assessment of the tradeoff , " the pollsters found .
" Early in the administration of the next president , scientists are expected to take the next major step toward the creation of synthetic forms of life , " said David Rejeski , director of the Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies .
" Yet the results from the first U.S. telephone poll about synthetic biology show that most adults have heard just a little or nothing at all about it . "
The poll was conducted in August by Peter D. Hart Research Associates .
The results were announced today .
Nearly half of the poll respondents said they have heard nothing at all about the broader field of nanotechnology .
Again , " there is a positive association between awareness of nanotechnology and the belief that the benefits of nanotechnology will outweigh the risks , " the analysts found .
Congress supporters were jubilant after the vote India 's Congress party - led government has survived a vote of confidence over a civilian nuclear deal with the US .
The government motion received 275 votes with 256 against , Speaker Somnath Chatterjee said , hours after adjourning the debate amid claims of vote buying .
The vote came after the government 's left - wing allies withdrew their support in protest at the controversial accord .
If the government had lost the vote , India would have faced early elections , casting the nuclear deal in doubt .
The lower house was packed to capacity , with MPs summoned from their sick beds and even from prison cells to take part in the vote .
After it was held there was brief confusion over the counting process .
Most voting was electronic , but about 50 votes were cast on paper which delayed the result .
At least four MPs were too ill to vote from the chamber of the 543 - seat house itself , but it is still not clear why so many MPs cast paper ballots .
A number of MPs also abstained .
TIMETABLE FOR NUCLEAR ACCORD
Approval needed from IAEA , expected to meet on 1 August Consent also required from 45 - member Nuclear Suppliers Group Congress to approve deal before President Bush signs it into law All this to happen before Mr Bush 's tenure expires on 19 January 2009
Q&A : India confidence vote Ugly debate precedes polls Dramatic scenes as vote won
There were Congress celebrations when victory became clear , with dancing supporters cheering , clapping and letting off firecrackers in front of party leader Sonia Gandhi 's house in Delhi .
Prime Minister Manmohan Singh thanked MPs for " such a convincing victory " .
" This will send a message to the world at large ...
India is prepared to take its rightful place in the comity of nations , " he told reporters .
The US welcomed the result and said it would work closely with the Indian government to have the deal ratified .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says the vote had looked too close to call .
But the government managed to scrape through with the support of smaller parties and independent members .
India faces a general election next year and many political parties have used the debate over the nuclear deal to stake out their positions ahead of the polls , our correspondent says .
The deal itself is now more dependent on whether it gets through the US Congress before elections in November , than on political opposition in India .
Tight vote
Two days of debate on the nuclear accord ended in uproar amid opposition allegations of vote buying .
Opposition Bharatiya Janata Party ( BJP ) members waved fistfuls of money in the air , alleging that they had been offered bribes to abstain .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Advertisement Mr Chatterjee adjourned proceedings for several hours .
He called it a " very sad day " for the Indian parliament , adding : " Nobody will be spared if found guilty . "
The prime minister has promised his party will co-operate in an inquiry into the claims .
With the left withdrawing support , the government could rely on only 226 members in the 543 - seat parliament , and needed 46 more to be absolutely sure of a majority .
India 's media was awash with reports of alleged defections and desertions among MPs ahead of the vote .
Under the accord , India , which has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , would gain access to US civilian nuclear technology and fuel .
Mr Singh called the victory " impressive "
In return its civilian nuclear facilities would be opened to inspection .
Nuclear weapons sites would remain off - limits .
The communists fear the accord could give the US too much influence over Indian foreign and nuclear policy .
The main opposition Hindu nationalist BJP fears that the deal could compromise India 's ability to test nuclear weapons in the future .
India is under pressure from Washington to sign the accord before the US presidential election in November .
Last week , Indian officials met members of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , the world nuclear regulatory body , in Vienna to discuss plans to safeguard India 's civilian nuclear facilities .
The IAEA 's approval of the plan is a key condition for enacting the deal .
HAVE YOUR SAY
Whether the government stays in power or not , it has lost the credibility and confidence of people at large Rakesh Punia , Delhi
If the IAEA signs the agreement , the deal will go to the 45 - nation Nuclear Suppliers Group , which regulates global civilian nuclear trade , for approval .
It must then be approved by the US Congress before President Bush can sign it into law .
Critics of the deal fear assistance to India 's civil programme could free - up additional radioactive material for bomb - making purposes .

What are these ?
Canadian James
Boppre , former owner of a successful landscaping business , was on parole with house arrest on condition of sobriety after drunk driving and weapons convictions .
On the evening of July 30th , Boppre fell off the wagon in a serious way .
It started out with booze and ended with Boppre crashing into a parked car , speeding , drunk , high on crack , and masturbating naked with a similarly nude hooker , who was also masturbating .
Yeah , Brendon Alan Erhardt has nothing on this guy ... except a video camera .
Sordid details below the jump .
Boppre elected to celebrate Wednesday by getting drunk , and in an obviously solid cognitive state , decided to hop into his truck and go find a prostitute .
Lady of the night found , Boppre decided smoking some crack with his new friend was a smashing idea , as was taking off their clothes and masturbating .
And driving around .
Speeding .
Somewhere during the execution of this plan , Boppre misjudged a corner and crashed into a parked car at high speed .
Car disabled , Boppre then grabbed his clothes and ran off like a streak in the night .
His cunning plan was ruined when eye - witnesses followed him to a hiding spot and pointed the cops in his direction .
So what 's next for Mr. James Boppre ?
Well , the judge in the case wanted to reward what he considered Boppre 's good behavio , at least up to that point .
He had managed to stay out of trouble up until his ... you know ... his booze , crack , hooker and car crashing binge — so the judge levied the minimum four - month jail sentence , prohibited him from driving for five years , added three years of probation and recommended counseling .
We recommend sending this guy into the Yukon Territory with a shotgun , a fifth of Wild Turkey and a rubber chicken , just to see what happens .

By now most people know that by this weekend there will likely be a hurricane spinning its way somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico .
This open thread outlines the initial analysis by Chuck Watson / KAC / UCF and some resources on GOM oil and gas infrastructure .
( We will try and update this with new graphs and forecasts as long as this storm is considered a threat to energy infrastructure )
( Welcome : we are now on a later and more updated thread , which can be found here : http://www.theoildrum.com/node/4478
NB : you may want to just go the front page ( it will be post # 1 or # 2 ) to get to the most recent thread : http://theoildrum.com ...)

NB : you may want to just go the front page ( it will be post # 1 or # 2 ) to get to the most recent thread : http://theoildrum.com ...)
From KAC / UCF google earth link
From Chuck Watson :
Both GFDL and HWRF ( which will replace GFDL ) are showing fairly explosive amplification in the mid Gulf .
Even the official forecast is now showing damage to the OCS facilities , and GFDL is showing Katrina - like long term disruption .
None of the official tracks are onshore yet , but our in - house runs out to 180 hrs are showing hits to refineries and pipelines , as well as knocking SPR off line for a couple weeks as well .
Of course , estimates beyond 72 hours are more " possible scenarios " than real forecasts , and a little wobble one way or the other makes a big difference in damage , but Gustav is starting to get scary .
The Gulf of Mexico represents about 25 % of overall US production , or represents 10 % of US Oil usage .
(* Ed. Note - I believe Nat Gas is about 13 - 14 % of US production )
Using the 6Z 27 Aug GFDL run , we are showing some facilities off line until early December .
The total loss is 12 % of Gulf oil production between now and the end of the year ( 126 days ) .
Interestingly , NG is n't so much of a hit - only a 5 % loss of the remainder of the year 's production .
I asked Chuck Watson what the odds were that this storm would n't even make it to the Gulf as a strong hurricane this was his reply :
20 % chance it stays as a high TS / low Cat1 due to interactions with Cuba , crosses the northern Yucatan , then across the southern Gulf as a week system .
20 % chance it tracks across eastern Cuba , never really gets it together and stays weak cat1 or lower up the west coast of FL ( Fay like track ) .( this is my current favorite scenario for some reason ) 30 % chance it follows the current guidance and stays below cat 3 . 30 % chance it follows current guidance , amplifies , and is cat 3 or higher .
100 % chance we 're probably wrong . . .;-)
We are still 4 - 5 days out from a potential US landfall so uncertainty is high , though given the stakes , Gustav is becoming kind of a binary event .
Chuck has put together a dynamically updating page that will reflect the latest damage models / forecasts at this link : KAC / UCF models .
On current track , which the weather geeks ( and I use the term " geek " in kinship ... ) at http://easternuswx.com and Jeff Masters at WU say is too early to say for sure , but this could do a lot of damage .
PRODUCTION /INFRASTRUCTURE
MAPS AND REFINERY INFORMATION
We have accumulated resources from previous hurricans below , but we'd like to find updated materials if you know of them .
Recent refinery maps , recent rig maps in the gulf , recent gas fields , SPR facilities , the Intercoastal Canal , pipeline stations and transfer points , etc. , etc . Leave links in the comments please .
Also , here 's the EIA 's Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , and Texas Resources pages .
They will also likely come in handy .
Also , here 's a link to the national page .
Here 's another good resource for infrastructure maps and such .
( scroll down a bit )
Here 's a map from CNN with large and small refineries laid out .
( though it is an old storm track )
Very detailed piece by RIGZONE on rigs and other infrastructure in the area .
( thanks mw )
Here 's a flash graphic of the oil refineries and rig maps , emphasizing Beaumont and Galveston 's importance .
Click on oil production .
Note the many rigs on the east side of the storm that will get the brunt of the damage from the NE quad of the storm ... hence the high long - term GOMEX oil production damage estimates below .

Although I seldom share Rush Limbaugh ’s viewpoints , I listen to his radio talk show when I want to know what those on the right of the political spectrum are thinking .
Yesterday , Limbaugh dissected Barack Obama ’s new “ Plan for Change ” ad with especially virulent rhetoric .
( I was pleased with this , because it suggests that he ’s worried about it . )
But I was dumbfounded when Limbaugh concluded his point by point critique with a thinly veiled threat of political violence :
OBAMA : I approve this message because bitter partisan fights and outworn ideas of the left and the right wo n’t solve the problems we face today , but a new spirit of unity and shared responsibility will .
RUSH : Unity and shared responsibility ?
That sounds like socialism to me .
And , by the way , sir , Senator Obama , could you give us an example of unity that you have brought about ?
Is your campaign team unified ?
The Democrat Party unified ?
Still got a lot of women out there that do n’t like you .
Have you unified the Republicans to vote for you ?
How come your preacher is so damn mad ?
Your wife ’s mad all the time .
All these people you hang around with , you got these wacko terrorists you hang around with , you ’ve got these flake priests you hang around with .
They ’re all mad as hell .
Everybody around you is mad as they could be .
What unity ?
What shared responsibility ?
By the way , outworn ideas of the left and right , your ideas are outworn , sir .
They absolutely are .
Ours are n’t .
Ours are built on the foundation of individual freedom , individual liberty , and guess what ?
Individual liberty and individual freedom are not outworn .
They never go out of style , Senator Obama .
There are people in this country who will pay whatever price is necessary to hold on to their freedom and their individual liberty , even if the enemy that seeks to take it away is people like you .
The show at that point went to a commercial break , leaving those last vitriolic words ringing in my ears .
( CNN ) -- Oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp. plans to sell its company - owned gas stations , saying they are n't profitable enough even with gasoline selling at $ 4 per gallon .
The 2,220 stations make up about 1/5 of the Exxon and Mobil stations in the United States .
The nation 's largest oil company , which earned nearly $ 41 billion last year , says it will sell more than 2,000 stations over the next few years .
" The fuels marketing sector is a very challenging market , " ExxonMobil spokesperson Prem Nair said , adding that the company is feeling particular pressure from hypermarkets like Wal - Mart that sell gasoline .
ExxonMobil plans to sell 820 owned and operated stations as well as 1,400 stations leased to dealers .
The 2,220 stations make up about 1/5 of the Exxon and Mobil stations in the United States .
The company says the stations to be sold will continue to sell ExxonMobil product .
" As the highly competitive fuels marketing business in the U.S. continues to evolve , we believe this transition is the best way for ExxonMobil to compete and grow in the future , " said Ben Soraci , U.S. director of retail sales for ExxonMobil .
The states with the largest number of ExxonMobil - owned stations are California and New York , each with more than 200 .
ExxonMobil also has a large concentration of stations in Texas , Florida , Maryland , Tennessee and Virginia .

We ’re still working on this .
There ’s been a bunch of helpful feedback .
We appreciate this .
We think we ’ve integrated the feedback into something that ’s a good solution ; different from out last version in both its essence and its presentation and content .
We ’ve come to understand that anything EULA - like is disturbing , even if the content is FLOSS based .
So we ’re eliminating that .
We still feel that something about the web services integrated into the browser is needed ; these services can be turned off and not interrupt the flow of using the browser .
We also want to tell
people about the FLOSS license — as a notice , not as as EULA or use restriction .
Again , this wo n’t block the flow or provide the unwelcoming feeling that one comment to my previous post described so eloquently .
We expect to have the materials that show this plan posted tomorrow morning .
Along with the feedback , there have also been some responses that go beyond anger to nasty , personal attacks .
This is unfortunate .
I think we ’ve gotten past the vitriol to absorb the underlying issues .
It ’s possible that we ’ve missed something .
Sometimes the vitriol masks what would otherwise be a point we might understand and agree with .
If that ’s the case , we ’ll keep working on things .
The end result will be better for all of us .
Because of a recent death in the family and prolonged illness , somehow I missed it when on the 26th of June , 2008 , George W. Bush signed an Executive Order stating that the United States is in a State of National Emergency …
Some may not grasp the significance of this event , however , as I and many others understand NSPD - 51 , declaring a National Emergency places this directive in place , and as outlined in Freedom Is Not Free – And Americans Are Poised To Lose Everything , Part 1 , I quoted how this directive gives President Bush the full powers of a dictator .
( This Op - Ed is effectively Part II of that article . )
This is an excerpt and is only one ( 1 ) of the many references and substantiation for the above article :
NSPD -51 and the Potential for a Coup d’Etat by National Emergency
By William H. White
October 30 , 2007
Can you think of anyone better than George W. Bush with whom to entrust the dictatorial powers hinted at in NSPD - 51 ?
Or perhaps you are unwilling to trust anyone with such powers , even Bush .
That is not a option in NATIONAL SECURITY PRESIDENTIAL DIRECTIVE 51 ( NSPD - 51 ) , signed by Bush and released without comment by the White House on May 9 , 2007 .
To quote from NSPD - 51 : “ This policy establishes ‘ National Essential Functions , ’ prescribes continuity requirements for all executive departments and agencies , and provides guidance for State , local , territorial , and tribal governments , and private sector organizations in order to ensure a comprehensive and integrated national continuity program that will enhance the credibility of our national security posture and enable a more rapid and effective response to and recovery from a national emergency . ”
What one would expect , but for some additional details .
Under NSPD - 51 , only limited ‘ National Essential Functions ’ of government will continue , which may or may not include Congress and the courts .
NSPD - 51 assures us : “ Enduring Constitutional Government means a cooperative effort among the executive , legislative , and judicial branches of the Federal Government , coordinated by the President , as a matter of comity with respect to the legislative and judicial branches … ”
This “ matter of comity , ” which usually refers to the informal and voluntary recognition of jurisdiction among courts , is a troublesomely ambiguous phrase in this context wherein the president determines this as he “ coordinates . ”
Unfortunately , NSPD - 51 provides limited “ guidance ” to state and local governments , because it revoked the then existing Presidential Decision Directive 67 of October 21 , 1998 ( ” Enduring Constitutional Government and Continuity of Government Operations ” ) , including “ all Annexes thereto . ”
And replaced them with NSPD - 51 , along with : “ Annex A and the classified Continuity Annexes , attached hereto . ”
But then the rabbit disappears as NSPD - 51 soldiers on : “ This directive and the information contained herein shall be protected from unauthorized disclosure , provided that , except for Annex A , the Annexes attached to this directive are classified and shall be accorded appropriate handling , consistent with applicable Executive Orders . ”
In other words , all the details are secret and even the non secret “ Annex A ” remains undisclosed by the White House .
MUCH MORE
If you do n’t read another word of this editorial , above all , please follow the above link and read the article in its entirety , as it is the foremost threat to our way of life and the very essence of freedom as we know it in the United States !
Also , it vividly offers an extremely valid assumption / speculation / hypothesis on why Congress may be actually afraid to instigate actual impeachment proceeding ’s against President Bush and Vice - President Dick Cheney .
In fact , there is one more paragraph which must be reproduced to urge anyone reading this article to keep reading to understand the extreme jeopardy this unholy directive places our entire society in jeopardy - and could end freedom as we know it and allow President Bush to become nothing less than a dictator with the sole power to rule our country with the iron fist of tyranny - effectively destroying our democracy , probably irreparably , and for that reason , this is a must - read paragraph :
This almost entirely secret directive can be invoked when the president decides “ any incident , regardless of location , that results in extraordinary levels of mass casualties , damage , or disruption severely affecting the U.S. population , infrastructure , environment , economy , or government functions ” occurred .
Bush alone will decide when he must assume this burden , though surely only upon prayerful contemplation during the time saved not having to consult Congress .
In addition , because of a change to the Insurrection Act of 1807 , enacted as part of the 439 - page 2007 Defense Authorization Bill signed into law in October 2006 , Bush need no longer obtain a governor ’s consent to take control of a state ’s national guard units .
This same bill overturns the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878 , which limited the use of US military forces within the United States for law enforcement .
In addition , Bush issued an executive order on July 17 , 2007 authorizing the government to seize the assets of anyone “ undermining efforts to promote economic reconstruction and political reform in Iraq ” under provisions of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act .
Could this include critics of the Iraq war , whom Bush has repeatedly accused of undermining the war effort ?

It discusses ENDGAME , which I now believe we are in the final approach to a program that virtually threatens the health , safety , and most importantly , the freedom of millions of Americans that have disagreed with this President .
Please read :
Now We Know Why There ’s A Press Blackout On S 1959 - It ’s Called “ ENDGAME ” By DHS - Updated 7/20/08
If you follow all of the above links and read the articles in their entirety , all of which are well substantiated , you will clearly see the eminent danger that our constitution , Bill of Rights , and the rule of law is in - not to mention the freedom of so many innocent Americans .
It is unconscionable to believe that millions of patriotic Americans could face imprisonment in a FEMA Internment Camp only because they stood up for the constitution and exercised their constitutional right of free speech .
If you Google the RNC Convention , you can vividly see for yourself how the Police , under orders from the FBI and Secret Service , worked to stifle legal protests and actually arrested people who were attending a non-violent concert in support of liberty and freedom .
In Bush ’s twisted world of fascism , standing up for the constitution and the rule of law now appears to be a crime - and somehow , patriots are now equated with terrorism , an insult to those of us that believe in this country that our forefathers fought and died to create and preserve for generations to come .
Further , if you examine NSPD - 51 , my reading of that Executive order gives Bush some , but not all , of the powers that are listed below : ( The declaration of Martial Law is little more than a technicality once the President has declared a National Emergency - which would effectively grant him unfettered power over ALL aspects of our lives that are contained in recent revisions to the martial law doctrine . )
Bush can , without probable cause or even review by Habeas Corpus , begin interring those that he believes are a risk to National Security ( Sic ) .
Bush can legally suspend the 2008 Presidential elections .
Bush can seize any manner of public or private property , including but not limited to food , housing , public utilities , and all of the airways in the United States .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Senate lawmakers remained deadlocked on Tuesday over legislation to rein in excessive energy speculation , as they haggled over adding amendments to the bill .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday gave Republicans a chance to offer four amendments to the bill , including a measure expanding offshore oil drilling .
A spokesman for Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said the deal was not rejected , but that lawmakers are still working on a deal .
Calling Reid ’s offer “ good progress , ” he said they hope to have a deal by the end of this week .
As fuel prices have reached record levels , energy has become a major issue in the November presidential elections .
Republicans have been pushing to lift bans on drilling offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve .
President George W. Bush called again on Tuesday for Congress to allow drilling off U.S. coasts to increase the U.S. energy supply .
“ If we got a problem with not having enough oil , let ’s go after some oil right here in the United States of America in environmentally friendly ways , ” Bush said in a speech in Cleveland , Ohio .
Democrats have rejected these calls , saying they want the oil industry to use land already available for drilling .
They also want to sell oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve .
Before tackling any of these issues , however , Reid said the Senate must pass legislation this week extending renewable energy and energy efficiency tax credits .
“ The number one issue for the American people is to do something about energy , ” Reid told reporters .
“ And the number one thing we can do about energy that is meaningful , that will create lots of jobs , improve the economy and help the environment , is to do something with the renewables . ”
A vote is expected on the tax package on Wednesday .
Reid said he is willing to work with Republicans on passing the speculation bill , but he wants to pass the tax package first .
If Republicans block a vote on that bill , Reid said he will not agree to a deal on adding amendments to the speculation bill .
Oil prices fell more than $ 2 to $ 122.19 a barrel on Tuesday , after hitting record levels above $ 147 earlier this month .
How can it be that some people still pretend that Sarah Palin is suited for high office ?
This country has never seen someone so comprehensively unprepared for the vice presidency ; Dan Quayle was Metternich by comparison .
I 've watched Sarah Palin 's interview with Katie Couric three times , and my astonishment does not diminish .
Her nonsensical answer about Russia has deservedly been highlighted , but let me focus on another question , this one concerning the export of democracy .
Couric asked , " What happens if the goal of democracy does n't produce the desired outcome ?
In Gaza , the U.S. pushed hard for elections and Hamas won . "
Palin's answer , in full , was this : " Yeah , well especially in that region , though , we have to protect those who do seek democracy and support those who seek protections for the people who live there .
What we 're seeing in the last couple of days here in New York is a President of Iran , Ahmadinejad , who would come on our soil and express such disdain for one of our closest allies and friends , Israel ... and we 're hearing the evil that he speaks and if hearing him does n't allow Americans to commit more solidly to protecting the friends and allies that we need , especially there in the Mideast , then nothing will . "
The issue here is not that Palin did n't know the answer .
There are many possible answers to this question , some of which are right and some of which are wrong .
The issue here is that she did n't know the question .
Because she was apparently ignorant of the subject , she endorsed Hamas ' victory , and , in essence , called for the U.S. to " protect " Islamists who seek to use democratic elections to lever themselves into power .
And , of course , Ahmadinejad came to power in a more - or - less democratic election .
Palin 's answer was truly remarkable .
A person who could be President of the United States has shown herself to be completely ignorant of one of the most vexing and important foreign policy questions of the day .
Freshman congressmen know how to answer this question .
Here 's one possible Republican response :
Their faces told the story of misery and despair .
The young couple emerged for the last time from the London offices of Lehman Brothers , sharing the news that they and 4,000 others were unemployed .
They were surrounded by colleagues carrying potted plants , documents , cases of wine , stationery and personal belongings .
Someone came out carrying two squash rackets and a football .
Human cost : Workers embrace outside the British headquarters of Lehman Brothers in London as they contemplate their future
By the time they had finished clearing their desks the office must have looked like a wasteland .
This was the human cost of the Canary Wharf Crash .
Young women stood around in small huddles throughout the building , many of them in tears .
Men in smart suits hugged each other and said goodbye with a handshake , maybe for ever .
It has been the Lehman 's culture that employees were expected to plough their handsome bonuses back into company shares .
And now those are worthless , so they have lost twice over .
What was the atmosphere like inside ?
' Terrible , ' said Kirsty McCluskey , a 32 - year - old trading floor worker .
' Like death .
Like a massive earthquake . '
She added that staff were busy filling in expenses forms before clearing their desks for the last time .
Another worker described it as ' like a bomb going off ... everyone just walking around in shock . '
Jobless : Bankers leaves Lehman 's offices in London with their belongings
Headhunters set up makeshift recruitment offices in coffee shops as hundreds of bankers began the search for work .
Alexandra Andreae - Jones , associate director at Finance Professionals , said : ' We have been inundated with CVs . '
The news everyone dreaded was heralded by an e-mail yesterday calling them in to work at 7 am .
Some had not even got there on time before it became clear they had lost their jobs .
Frenchman Edouard D'Archimbaud , 24 , had not even started his job before he lost it .
He had struggled in on the stricken Eurostar service from his home in Paris to begin Day One of his employment as a £ 45,000 - a- year trader for Lehmans to be told it had folded .
' I never even made it to my desk , ' he said .
All around him , in scenes that echoed the final days of some Eastern European regime , people were grabbing whatever they could carry and walking out .
Some were escorted from the building by security guards .
In the canteen , queues formed as workers used up the last credit on their cashless vending cards .
The other company credit cards had already been cancelled and invalidated , right down to the dry - cleaning cards issued for use in local outlets .
Distraught : Bankers comfort each other after losing their jobs
Outside the waterside HQ , the bizarre figure of one Sphinx Patterson , a 35 - year - old personal trainer who helps Lehman staff with their gym workouts and ' chill sessions ' , revealed that a large group had gathered in the bar to down lager and red wine .
It was still only 11 am .
Mr Patterson , sporting a zebra - pattern leotard and impossibly tight Lycra shorts , said : ' Nobody knows what to do .
They 're all in shock .
But it 's not just the bigtime traders .
It 's an avalanche effect .
' There are a lot of admin staff and secretaries affected too .
I saw some cleaners just slumped in a corridor .
I just saw one of the receptionists and she was in tears , collecting up all her pens . '
Time for a drink :
Another employee drowns his sorrows in a nearby bar
Police and Canary Wharf security guards were called at one stage to separate the exodus of staff from the attentions of TV cameras and journalists , as well as from the occasional heckler .
Investment bankers in their Porsches and Aston Martins are not universally admired on the Isle of Dogs and a couple of locals turned up to revel in their misery .
Investing in the U.S. housing market must once have seemed like a stroke of genius .
Not yesterday though .
The East End lads hugged each other and shed mock tears as the workers came out to an uncertain future .
In nearby restaurants and bars , however , the tears were real .
One young woman from the trading section said she had taken 15 phone calls from friends in other banks , all offering commiseration .
In the current climate , none was able to offer a job .
' I'm really touched that people are thinking of me , ' she said .
' But underneath , you know everyone is wondering who 's next . '
Bankers immediately started contacting headhunters to find other work
Angry employees take their money 's worth from New York headquarters
Angry Lehman Brothers traders in New York were last night determined to get what they could out of the collapsing investment bank as they ripped works of art from the walls and carried them off .
At least three traders were seen taking down paintings and other framed pictures from the Lehmans HQ near New York ’s Times Square .
' They do not know if they are going to get paid this month so they are saying , hell , let ’s take what we can while we can take it , ' said one observer , who works at rival Goldman Sachs but is a close friend of one of the art - thief traders .
A spokesman for Lehman Brothers would not confirm which , if any , works of art had been stolen from Lehman ’s offices , but urged employees to leave office furnishings and decorations in place .
' They are pretty stupid people if that ’s what they are doing , ' he said .
Meanwhile , tourists were flocking to Lehman ’s offices on 7th Avenue between 49th and 50th Streets to have their picture taken before the HQ of one of Wall Street ’s oldest banks closes .
' I do n't know if it 's still going to be Lehman in a couple months , ' said Dulles Wang , a fuels analyst at power company NRG Energy who lives near Madison Square Garden .
' It took a hundred years to build up a firm like this and it 's sad if it goes away .
I wish I 'd taken a photo of Bear Stearns too . '
LATE last month , three Israelis who know something of what is on the mind of Ariel Sharon , the prime minister , seemed to say publicly what many others are thinking privately .
Since the “ disengagement ” of settlers and troops from Gaza and part of the northern West Bank this summer , Mr Sharon has maintained that Israel 's next territorial withdrawal will be not unilateral , as that one was , but agreed by both sides under the “ road map ” peace plan , which calls , eventually , for joint talks on creating a Palestinian state .
But Eyal Arad , a public - relations adviser to Mr Sharon , Tzachi Hanegbi , one of his ministers , and Aharon Ze'evi - Farkash , the head of military intelligence , were all quoted as suggesting that if peace talks make no progress , Israel might stage another unilateral pullout from some of the West Bank .
Their remarks might have been trial balloons , or merely soap bubbles , but they caused instant fuss .
Such a move would anger both Palestinians , who do not want Israel always setting the agenda , and many Israelis , who resent surrendering land without security promises from the Palestinians in return .
Mr Sharon was quick to pooh - pooh the “ rumours ” .
Mr Arad , for one , says he was misquoted .
But , say various sources , in high - level backroom discussions the subject is coming up time and again .
“ When I speak to Israelis of virtually all political stripes , they all believe it 's the next thing that 's going to happen , ” says Robert Malley , a Washington - based analyst for the International Crisis Group , a peace - making lobby with headquarters in Brussels .
There may well be no plan to do it .
Yet events could inexorably lead to it .
This week 's murders of three Israelis by Palestinian gunmen , and Israel 's response , gave a foretaste of how .
The shootings were in two different places on Route 60 , the main north - south highway through the West Bank .
Views vary as to which militant faction ( or factions ) really did it , but they may have been timed to embarrass Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian president , who was drumming up support on a foreign tour due to end this week in Washington .
Palestinian vehicles , which bear different - coloured licence plates from Israeli ones , are subject to ever - changing restrictions on which roads they may use .
Since the start of the Palestinians ' second intifada ( uprising ) five years ago some of the main West Bank highways , as well as the by - pass roads that Israel has built over the years to connect its West Bank settlements to one another and to Israel proper , have become Israeli - only .
Some , among them Route 60 , are usually open to at least some Palestinian vehicles , such as trucks and public transport .
But after the shootings , Israel responded by banning all Palestinian traffic from several roads , including part of Route 60 .
Maariv , a daily newspaper , reports that the army has been told to start implementing a plan to make such bans permanent , though government spokesmen say there has been no final decision .
Israel is at work ( slowly , after foreign donors last year refused a request for funding ) on building and upgrading roads , bridges and tunnels to let Palestinians travel between their towns without ever turning on to a road used by Israelis .
That will complete the division of the West Bank into two road networks ( see map ) .
Israel says this will make Palestinians ' lives easier : there will be less need for checkpoints and roadblocks .
Perhaps so ; but the Palestinian highways will be narrower , more winding and more hilly , so trips will take longer and cost more .
They also tend to go through towns instead of by - passing them , which will mean huge snarl - ups of trucks and public transport .
All this will hurt the Palestinian economy .
Signs of the creeping separation have been there for a while .
The UN's Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs has found that the number of fixed checkpoints and roadblocks in the West Bank has dropped by at least a third this year , in line with an Israeli promise in February to ease restrictions .
However , that has mostly helped movement between small Palestinian villages and their nearby urban centres .
The highways between the main towns , on the other hand , are increasingly lined with fences and barriers to prevent access , and there are now three times as many “ flying checkpoints ” , which pop up and turn back Palestinian cars at random , discouraging them from using roads that may one day become Israeli - only .
What does all this mean for the future ?
For two years Israel has been building a barrier through the West Bank — for security , say the Israelis .
It mostly hugs the pre-1967 border ( the Green Line ) , but bites off the areas with the biggest settlements too , taking about 10 % of the Palestinians ' West Bank territory .
The ugly barrier , reminiscent in places of the Berlin Wall ( about 7 % of it so far consists of nine - metre high concrete slabs ) , has attracted international condemnation .
But the common assumption is that it is intended to be an eventual international border and that the Jewish settlements on the Palestinian side , with some 70,000 residents , will be evacuated in a peace deal , along the lines apparently on offer by Israel at Camp David in 2000 .
Yet Israel need be in no hurry .
Though less visible , and almost ignored amid the international outrage , the dual road system is much like the barrier .
It cuts settlers off from Palestinians , making them safer from attack and securing settlements deep inside the West Bank , not just those close to the Green Line .
As with the barrier , each terrorist attack will not only further postpone the peace process — Israel says there can be no progress until the Palestinian Authority ( PA ) meets its road - map obligation to disarm militants — but will reinforce the argument for keeping the system in place .
Meanwhile , if the peace process remains stuck , it is not hard to see how Israel might stage another unilateral pullout .
Since the success of the Gaza disengagement , Israeli support for another such move , though still in the minority , has increased , according to Tel Aviv University 's monthly Peace Index poll .
An early draft of the disengagement plan included about a dozen more settlements in the middle of the West Bank , which in the end were left intact .
A few other isolated settlements are now lobbying the government to be relocated into Israel .
Any of these could , in time , become the focus of Israel 's next unilateral withdrawal .
And that , argues Mr Malley , could serve both Israeli and PA interests .
Israel would give up strategically inconvenient outposts while saying , once again , that it is making concessions to the Palestinians .
The PA would , once again , make political capital out of Israel 's withdrawal , without the humiliation of having given its consent to an unfair deal .
But terrorist attacks would continue to kill Israelis .
The West Bank 's balkanisation would continue to impoverish Palestinians .
Israeli settlement - building would make a viable Palestinian state ever harder to achieve : this summer Israel , ignoring its own road - map obligations , announced plans to increase the number of settlers in the Jordan Valley , in the east of the West Bank , by 50 % in one year .
It is still building hundreds of dwellings a year in other settlements too .
Israeli strategists these days tend to see the Jordan Valley not as an essential “ security buffer ” , but as a large bargaining chip .
Populating settlements will give them more weight in any future negotiations .
There are already nine times as many settlers east of the barrier as the number evacuated from Gaza , and they include the most hardline ideologues .
If enough time goes by , the Palestinians may have little choice but to accept a Swiss - cheese state , comprising most of the West Bank but riddled with settlements , in which travel is severely hampered .
And in the worst case , if there are no peace talks , the dual road network lets Israel contemplate pulling out from up to 40 % or 50 % of the West Bank 's territory unilaterally , while keeping most of its settlements .
What might stem this grim onward march ?
The PA 's most effective weapon would be incontrovertible signs that it is bringing violence under control .
Mr Abbas 's slow progress on this score has been hampered by PA infighting , his own weakness as a leader ( though polls show he is growing more popular ) , and the fact that the PA forces still cannot operate in Israeli - controlled areas of the West Bank .
And since Israel , not surprisingly , responds to attacks by clamping down , as it did this week , each attack makes the job harder — and strengthens Israel 's determination to keep its systems of separation .
