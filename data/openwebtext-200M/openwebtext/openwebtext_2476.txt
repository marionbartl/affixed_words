Jodie Marsh celebrates her 30th birthday in the most ridiculous outfit ever ( even by her standards ! )
Jodie Marsh may have turned 30 but the exhibitionist is showing no signs of maturing any time soon .
The glamour model celebrated her milestone birthday by donning one of the most ridiculous outfits ever , which consisted of a leopard print tie , a top hat , nipple covers , knickers and thigh - high kinky boots .
Jodie made sure all eyes were on her as she arrived at the Rock ' n '
Roll themed bash at Sugar Hut nightclub in Essex on the arm of her lesbian lover Nina – who was dressed as ex Guns N ' Roses guitarist Slash .

Roll themed bash on the arm of her lesbian lover Nina who was dressed as ex Guns N ' Roses guitarist Slash
Guests at the Z list bash included former Big Brother winner Brian Belo who arrived with Shipwrecked star Naomi Millbank - Smith .
Jodie went public with her romance with female hairdresser Nina in August after they were pictured kissing .
' I 've had loads of shit men , ' she said at the time .
' I can see why women turn lesbian , because you get to the point where you 're sick of hearing so much f*** ing bullshit , so you start to look elsewhere .
' Nina 's really sexy .
She asked me out and we 've been on a few dates .
I think she 's a cool girl .
Stocking up on cash :
The glamour model certainly turned heads , but not necssarily for the right reasons
' I love the way she kisses and she does n't f*** me about .
I feel comfortable with her .
Nina 's as sexy as any man . '
Jodie showed off her numerous tattoo’s at the event which include the faces of Michael Jackson , Buddy Holly and Chuck Berry .
She appeared to have scrawled an extra design on her arm with a black marker which ironically read ‘ Jodie Marsh – only sane person left . ’
Jodie also has a rosary and cross around her right wrist and the mottos My Crazy Life , Life ’s Too Short and Only God Can Judge Me on her arms .

Last year , Jodie offered up her skin to readers of lads ' magazine Bizarre when she asked readers to send in suggestions for her latest etching .
Eventually , Jodie plumped for a devil 's tail coming out of her bottom up her back .
Jodie also has the word Porn and a star in the small of her back , the mottos plus the names of her best friend Kim who died some years ago and dead pet dog Pixie intertwined on the back of her neck .
Last year , she sought a husband on a reality TV show but the marriage to Matt Peacock lasted only three months .
Adobe has taken its Linux version of AIR out of beta with an official 1.5 release for popular Linux distros , which puts Air for Linux on par with its Windows and Mac counterparts .
Adobe AIR allows you to seamlessly run Flash and Javascript - based applications on the desktop .
Like regular desktop apps , AIR applications are downloaded and installed on your hard drive and can take advantage of desktop tools like drag and drop support and more .
But , unlike traditional desktop applications , AIR apps are powered by web technologies , so they can handle rich media like video and audio much better .
They also feature more " web- like " user interfaces with customized scroll bars , buttons and controls .
AIR 1.5 was released for both the Mac and Windows platforms last month and offers some nice new additions that Linux fans have been clamoring for — like a faster Javascript engine and encrypted database support .
To see how AIR for Linux stacked up with the Windows and Mac versions I took the new app for a spin .
The first thing that becomes readily apparent about AIR for Linux is that the installer hell many have complained about with Adobe Creative Suite 4 is not limited to CS4 .
The Adobe AIR installer downloads as a .bin file , which Adobe suggests you double - click to install .
Unfortunately , double clicking the installer icon will just get you an error message in both Ubuntu and Fedora .
In fact , you need to make the file executable before it will open ( something Adobe does point out in the fine print of the release notes , but not on the download page ) .
To fix that problem , open a terminal window and type :
chmod u+x AdobeAIRInstaller.bin
Once the file is actually executable you should be able to double click it and install .
According to Adobe anyway .
In our experience that did n't work either , so we went back to the terminal and used this line :
./AdobeAIRInstaller.bin
After that , the Adobe AIR installer ran without issue .
Well , except for the fact that we needed to also upgrade our Flash player , which meant uninstalling the version from the Ubuntu repositories and then downloading and installing the new one from Adobe .
We know what you 're thinking , it 's Linux , everything is more complex .
But making application installation easy is actually something Linux excels at and , if you give up on AIR long before heading to the terminal , we can't say we blame you .
There 's just no excuse for that kind of convoluted installation process , and , were we not obligated to install AIR and report our experiences here , we would never have bothered jumping through Adobe 's hideously awkward install process .
Linux 's package management systems ( like automated application installers basically ) offer the simplest application install process around .
Why did n't Adobe just package AIR in .deb , .rpm and others like it does for the Linux version of Flash ?
While it 's nice that Adobe is supporting AIR for Linux , the installer is a disservice to Linux users .
In contrast , the Flash for Linux installer is quite slick , why Adobe decided to mangle the AIR installer is anyone 's guess .
It would seem that Adobe is married to its custom installers .
Once you 've jumped through all the hoops , Adobe AIR 1.5 for Linux does run much better than its beta predecessor .
There were some issues with screen blinking / flickering when AIR applications launched , but that happens on our Mac as well , and otherwise there were no crashes or missing features .
Our favorite AIR apps , TweetDeck , Twirl and Kuler , all worked without issue and performance was on par with both the Mac and Windows versions of AIR .
Adobe AIR for Linux works out of the box with Ubuntu 7.10 + , Fedora 8.0 + and openSuSE 10.3 +.
Because the .bin installer includes both .rpm and .deb installers it should also work on other Linux distros ( like Debian , Mandriva and more ) , however , Adobe will only be formally supporting the first three .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A top U.S. business group stepped up efforts on Friday to kill a “ Buy American ” provision that has angered U.S. trading partners , and the White House said it was reviewing its position on the measure .
A street sign is seen in front of an American flag hanging on the front of the New York Stock Exchange August 9 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Lucas Jackson
“ Some have slammed the U.S. Chamber for opposing ‘ Buy American ’ provisions , calling our position ‘ economic treason , ’ ” Thomas Donohue , president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said in a statement .
“ Try ‘ economic patriotism ’ , ” he said .
“ Such provisions would cost American jobs , trigger retaliation from our trading partners , slow economic recovery by delaying shovel - ready infrastructure projects and cede our leadership role as a long - standing proponent of free and fair trade and global engagement . ”
The House of Representatives approved the measure this week as part of an $ 825 billion bill to kick - start the U.S. economy .
In the House bill , the “ Buy American ” measure would require all public works projects funded by the stimulus package to use only U.S. - made iron and steel .
European steelmakers object , saying that would violate U.S. commitments under the World Trade Organization ’s government procurement pact .
Other critics say that is less than clear cut and could depend on how the measure was implemented .
Several leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland this week warned that national moves to counter the economic crisis might lead to protectionism .
British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and Indian Trade Minister Kamal Nath all warned of the risks of protectionism during this week ’s World Economic Forum in Davos , Switzerland .
U.S. Vice President Joe Biden told CNBC on Thursday he believed it was “ legitimate to have some portions of Buy American ” in the stimulus plan and disagreed with those who said it was a harbinger of protectionism .
But White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on Friday the Obama administration was examining the measure to see if it violated U.S. trade obligations .
“ The administration will review that particular provision and will make a determination of it ...
It understands all of the concerns , ” Gibbs said .
‘ NOT A GOOD WAY TO BEGIN ’
Early in his first term , former President George W. Bush angered trading partners by imposing steep “ safeguard ” tariffs on steel imports to help U.S. producers climb out of a slump .
The Senate is expected to begin debate on its version of the stimulus bill next week .
It includes a provision passed by the Senate Appropriations Committee that expands the House language of “ Buy American ” to include all manufactured goods .
“ When you include all manufactured goods in these projects , you ’re talking about every shovel , every crane , ” said Chris Braddock , the U.S. Chamber of Commerce director of procurement policy .
“ It ’s not just the steel going into bridges .
Now it ’s the truck that is involved in building the bridge or the road . ”
Senator Charles Grassley , an Iowa Republican , “ is looking into this situation to ensure that any ‘ Buy American ’ provisions in the stimulus bill are administered in a manner consistent with U.S. trade obligations , ” a spokeswoman said .
That might not offer much comfort to major U.S. trading partners such as China , which have not yet joined the WTO ’s government procurement accord .
A man has been attacked by a panda at a park in southern China , after he climbed into its enclosure hoping to cuddle the creature .
The 20 - year - old student had ignored warning signs and scaled a two - metre ( 6.5 ft ) barrier to get into the pen .
State media say the panda bit him on his arms and legs , and he had to be rescued by the animal 's keepers .
Speaking from his hospital bed , the injured man said the panda had looked so cute he had just wanted to hug it .
The incident happened on Friday at Qixing Park in Guilin , a popular tourist attraction in the southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region , which houses a small zoo and panda exhibit .
A worker at the park , quoted by the official Xinhua news agency , said there are clear signs warning visitors not to go beyond the fences for their own safety , " but the young man ignored them " .
The panda , Yang Yang , was apparently scared by the intruder and bit the man 's arms and legs , he said .
Two foreign visitors who saw the incident alerted keepers who rushed to the student 's rescue and calmed the panda .
The man - named only as Liu - was taken to hospital .
He underwent an operation and doctors said he would stay in hospital for a few days , although his life was not in danger .
Liu , who is studying at a university in Guilin , said he had been visiting the park with fellow students .
" Yang Yang was so cute and I just wanted to cuddle him , " he told Xinhua from his hospital bed .
" I did n't expect he would attack ... I do n't remember how many bites I got . "
Yang Yang - whose name means sun - is seven years old and weighs 80kg ( 176lb ) .
Keepers said he had recovered from the incident and was eating and playing as normal .

Still , some local residents are skeptical .
Giles
Thelen , a plant ecologist at the University of Montana in Missoula , said that results of the sheep grazing program were anecdotal and that plots should be used to measure how effective the sheep were .
Mr. Thelen also worries about the sheep worsening the problem by picking up invasive seeds in their wool and dropping them in new areas , as well as causing erosion with their hooves .
“ There ’s no data to show if the sheep are making the situation worse or better , ” he said .
Some herbicides may be more effective , he said , “ but people do n’t like poison on their public lands . ”

The owner of the sheep , John Stahl , helped lead them back to his ranch .

Each year , the city contracts with John Stahl , a fourth - generation rancher who drives his flock to the infested hills from his Missoula County ranch nine miles away .
The city pays Mr. Stahl about $ 1,300 a month , including a modest stipend for Mr. Marquez .
The rancher provides Mr. Marquez ’s food , equipment , camp wagon and bus fare from his home in Chihuahua , Mexico .
Mr. Stahl said access to the forage on public lands allowed him to continue raising sheep and other livestock instead of selling the ranch to developers .
“ I could n’t make a living on the sheep without access to the city land , ” Mr. Stahl said .
“ And Enrique really knows the sheep and all the places they can hide .
He has an instinct for animals . ”

With all the euphoria and optimism due to the newly appointed US President , Barack Obama , the US economy is still haunted by nightmares .
This time – the unemployment rate .
President Barack Obama made busy early in his work at White House with the raving news about the US unemployment rate that is now 14 - year high at 6.5 per cent in October 2008 , surpassing the forecast of 6.3 per cent .
According to the article from Financial Times , the total of US job losses this year has now reached 1.2 million , which lead to Goldman Sachs saying that the US labour market today is in “ full recession mode . ”
What worsen the nightmare is the outlook – Goldman Sachs further predicted that the unemployment rate would hit 8.5 per cent next year .
What you and I can do about this news
Perhaps you are already aware that what happens to the US will affect globally – a sign that the global economic barometer is still lead by the US , not the much hyped China .
I have written about how to make a difference in today ’s recession , and I will stress the importance again and again :
Did you aware that the recession today is caused by you and I ?
Yes – you and I , despite any personal finance issues we face , affect the people around us .
We affect our family , our family affects the community , the community affect the region , and so on , ultimately you and I affect the global economy .
Change is needed , and it better start from you and I .
I expect Money and Minds readers to be the agent of change in today ’s negative sentiment about the global economy .
I am an unemployment myself – what can I do to change things ?
Any situations you are in , you can make a difference .
People were talking about doing this and doing that to change the economy direction , but only a few really do change things .
I recommend that we start from our personal finance .
The main idea is – if you ca n’t save your personal finance , you ca n’t contribute positive changes to the economy .
Do n’t expect the government or authorities to do things for you – they have their tasks , you have yours to .
Your tasks :
Stop whining – if you are made redundant , get yourself a job again – never linger in depression .
Or better yet , start a business .
Do n’t give me “ I do n’t have money to start a business ” – you can actually start one without any amount of money required , only if you want to look for it .
Stop preaching bad economy to others – you are not only destroying yourself , you are destroying others , too .
Turn off your TV , start digging business or job opportunities – the bad news are always on TV , but good news are hidden – ready to be found .
Learn how to get out of debt and run your personal finance efficiently – there are resources on the Net for free – look for them !
Never fall to get rich quick scheme – there are none of it .
Work diligently , and riches will come to you eventually .
The question – Are you resilient ?
Do you have all the guts to bring out all you have ?
Your answer will affect the global economy .
Save your personal finance , save the world .

TO SEE the geography of the technology industry , crack open an Apple iPhone .
Although the firm that sells it is American , it provides none of the physical innards .
The components are almost entirely Asian : the screen is mostly from Japan , the flash memory from South Korea , and it was assembled in China .
Apple 's contribution is the design and software — and , importantly , integrating the innovations of others .
As goes the iPhone , so goes the broader technology industry .
The biggest and most technically clever firms are American and European , but their predominance in research , innovation and production is being challenged by Asian companies .
A new report by the OECD puts hard figures on the extent of this steady shift .
Every year around $ 1 trillion is spent on research and development ( R&D ) in computing , telecoms and electronics ; America accounts for over one - third .
But while corporate R&D in America and Europe grew by 1 - 2 % between 2001 and 2006 , in China it soared 23 % .
China is now close to surpassing Japan in total research spending , from almost nothing a decade ago .
And as a percentage of GDP , China 's corporate R&D spending is almost on a par with the European Union 's ( around 1 % ) .
The OECD 's numbers show that Taiwan now has more high - tech researchers than Britain .
And a list of the world 's 250 biggest technology firms shows that Taiwanese companies spend more on R&D than British and Canadian ones .
That said , the types of job are different : the Taiwanese generally do lower - end work like making semiconductors .
More sophisticated tasks , such as designing the chips ' circuitry , are still mostly done in the West .
The most impressive growth has been in South Korea .
In 2007 Samsung spent more on R&D than IBM .
The company has jumped to second place in the number of patents granted by America 's patent office ( just behind IBM ) ; a decade earlier it was not even in the top ten .
South Korean firms spend more on R&D as a percentage of sales ( 6.5 % ) than European and Japanese firms ( around 5 % ) , and are catching up with American ones ( about 8 % ) .
South Korea now has more high - tech researchers than Britain and Germany .
The numbers highlight the rivalry between “ new Asia ” and “ old Asia ” , says Sacha Wunsch - Vincent of the OECD , one of the report 's authors .
Regional stalwarts such as Japan and Taiwan are being challenged by China , India and South Korea .
R&D spending relative to sales for the leading technology companies in America , Europe and Japan was either flat or falling between 2002 and 2006 , but increased in the three “ new ” Asian countries .
The starkest shifts are in computer services and manufacturing , where the roles of America and East Asia have diverged dramatically .
The amount that American firms spend on research in computer services as much as trebled over the past decade .
Japanese and South Korean firms , meanwhile , spend hardly anything developing services , and prefer to concentrate on more tangible , if less lucrative , hardware .
In computers and office equipment such as copiers , America and Japan actually traded places : America 's R&D expenditure on such items fell by one - third between 1996 and 2005 , while Japan 's more than doubled , to around $ 13 billion , the amount America used to spend .
( India , meanwhile , has concentrated on services , in part because stifling bureaucracy makes it easier to move bytes around than atoms . )
Even the topology of the internet itself is looking less American .
In 1999 around 90 % of Asia 's international internet traffic passed through America ; in 2008 the share dropped to 54 % , according to TeleGeography , a telecoms - research firm .
It is yet another example of how the technology industry , once dominated by America , is becoming truly global in nature .
Whether it 's kirpans in a Montreal schoolyard , turbans on a Milton job site , polygamists in a B.C. town or lesbians in a Winnipeg doctor 's waiting room , opposing cultural and religious rights are giving a rough ride to Canada 's cherished multiculturalism .
" The groups are clashing like never before , " says Robert Mundle , chaplain at Toronto 's Rehabilitation Centre .
Mundle , an expert on the ethics of religion in medicine , says Canada can expect to see many more faith - based confrontations .
The latest involves a lesbian couple in Winnipeg who complained to Manitoba 's human rights commission and College of Physicians and Surgeons that family doctor Karmeila Elias refused to accept them as patients because of their sexual orientation .
" It was like a kick in the stomach , " says Andrea Markowski , who recently moved to the city from the Northwest Territories with her spouse of 18 years , Ginette .
" I have a really hard time understanding how her religion affects her ability to care for me as a human being . "
Thor Hansell , lawyer for Egyptian - born Elias , denies she refused care , saying the doctor felt she had a responsibility to explain her " personal religious views " so the couple could decide for themselves whether to become her patient .
Canada 's doctor shortage means such confrontations will occur more often , says Dr. Bill Pope , head of Manitoba 's College of Physicians and Surgeons , as doctors recruited from abroad bring their cultural and religious beliefs with them .
" Often their basic knowledge is good , but it 's all in the way in which you operationalize it for a culture that might be quite different . "
That 's why the college requires a four - week orientation course before foreign - trained doctors can practise in Manitoba .
Pope made a special visit to the course this week , where 25 doctors from the Middle East and Asia were wrapping up .
" Needless to say , I spent some time with them to explain this issue to them .
A lot of them were terrified , " he says .
" They will be beginning practice very soon . "
This is n't the first time religion and medicine have clashed in Winnipeg .
Last year , doctors at Grace Hospital resigned rather than accept a court order to keep a patient on life support after a brain injury .
The family of 84 - year - old Samuel Golubchuk said removing life support would constitute a sin under their Orthodox Jewish beliefs because it would hasten his death .
Golubchuk died before his case could be resolved in the courts .
Mundle says the ongoing challenge facing Canada is to balance opposing rights .
In both the Golubchuk and Markowski cases , the issue was complicated by the expenditure of public money .
Golubchuk 's doctors argued it was a waste of resources to keep him on life support when there was no chance of survival .
Andrea Markowski says Elias has a responsibility to care for her and Ginette , whatever her personal feelings .
" She is a doctor who is paid with public funds , " Markowski says .
It 's the sort of case the Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons had in mind last year when it passed a policy paper warning doctors they could face human rights complaints if they refuse care to a patient on the basis of their personal religious beliefs .
" In our society , we all pay taxes for this medical system to receive services " said then college president Preston Zuliani .
Both the Ontario and Manitoba colleges say doctors should help patients in such cases find another physician .
Beyond medicine , the issue of clashing rights is also playing out in construction sites , small towns and schoolyards :
Sikh security guard Deepinder Loomba was before the Ontario Human Rights Tribunal complaining he was discriminated against when ordered to remove his turban and don a hard hat at a Home Depot store construction site , saying his job patrolling the outside of the site made the hard hat unnecessary .
In Bountiful , B.C. , leaders of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints face charges of polygamy .
In a controversial decision two years ago , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled Montreal teenager Gurbaj Singh Multani could take his ceremonial dagger to school .
With files from the Star 's wire services
When Thomas Jefferson was inaugurated , he sought to dismantle the evolving Federalist tradition of pomp and circumstance .
In a ceremonial sense , royalism seemed to have been restored , or so it appeared to him .
As this blogger put it , “ Dressed in simple attire , Jefferson walked over to the Capitol with a phalanx of riflemen , friends , and fellow citizens from his home state of Virginia . ”
In these last days of the American Empire , such austere republicanism would be considered impossibly quaint .
Having long ago morphed into Jefferson ’s worst nightmare , the closer we get to the end , the more glamorous our inaugurals become .
The poorer we are , the more millions we ’ll throw at a ceremony that is really the crowning of a monarch — and not just any old king , but an emperor bestriding the globe .
Appearances must be kept up .
Like a bankrupt living on a palatial estate — one step away from foreclosure — we bask in imperial splendor even as the repo man comes knocking at the door .
At a time such as ours , the spectacle of jeweled and gowned courtiers feasting on inaugural canaps is beyond tacky .
The Bourbons partied , too , right up to the eve of the French Revolution .
Amid all the sounding of trumpets and the hailing of the chief , however , there is something hollow about all this unseemly extravagance .
The Obama cult has imbued our new president with superhuman powers : they expect and enjoy the spectacle .
Yet the relentless lionizing of this messianic figure is ironic , because here is an American chief executive who will doubtless become aware of his own limitations rather quickly .
America is a bankrupt empire engaged in two overseas wars , with troops on every continent and bases ringing the globe .
It ’s unsustainable , and our ruling elites know it .

The Best of Justin Raimondo
Following up on our post yesterday about skaters transforming swimming pools at foreclosed homes into impromptu skate bowls , Boing Boing reader Dan Rosen points us to a related story .
The short version : " underground housing activists " in one neighborhood are moving homeless folks into the homes of folks who 've lost their homes .
Man , that 's complicated and sad all around .
Snip :
" We 're matching homeless people with peopleless homes , " he said with a grin .
[ Max ] Rameau and a group of like - minded advocates formed Take Back the Land , which also helps the new " tenants " with secondhand furniture , cleaning supplies and yard upkeep .
So far , he has moved six families into foreclosed homes and has nine on a waiting list .
" I think everyone deserves a home , " said Rameau , who said he takes no money from his work with the homeless .
" Homeless people across the country are squatting in empty homes .
The question is : Is this going to be done out of desperation or with direction ? "
Rameau , who makes his living as a computer consultant , said he is doing the owners a favor , saving the properties from drug dealers , vandals and thieves .
He said he is not scared of getting arrested .
" There 's a real need here , and there 's a disconnect between the need and the law , " he said .
" Being arrested is just one of the potential factors in doing this . "
A few of cindik 's points about the treatment of gays apply to my question without much modification .
For example ,
There would be no tax benefits extended to churches .
Some judges would use a parent 's Christian beliefs as a reason to deny custody , questioning their moral character .
Christian groups on college campuses would routinely have their signs ripped down and receive threats from other students .
Christians would be regarded as morally deficient , evil people , lacking in even basic human goodness .
Atheists might regularly go door - to - door proselytizing to Christians .
Raising children to be Christian would be viewed as a serious abrogation of parental responsibility .
Persons convicted of criminal offenses would receive shorter sentences and be eligible for early release if they rejected their Christian beliefs .
Christians would be under tremendous pressure to keep their Christianity hidden for fear of being ostracized by their families and assaulted by strangers .
Christians could be fired from their jobs simply for being Christian and would have little legal recourse .
Virtually every negative event would be blamed on Christians .
Others I would add :
Pam 's House Blend ( update : link no longer active ) is one of a handful of non-atheist - related blogs I read regularly .
In a recent post , cindik asks an intriguing question : " What might it look like if someone wanted to treat Christians the way gay people are treated ? "
The post was an interesting read , and I could n't help noticing many parallels to how Christians treat atheists .
So with cindik 's post as an inspiring point of departure , what might it look like if someone wanted to treat Christians the way they treat atheists ?
Valknut : A Norse Viking Symbol
The word valknut is a neologism : it is formed in modern times through combination of ON valr , ‘ the dead ’ or ‘ the slain ’ and knut , ‘ knot ’ .
Valknut is a Viking symbol of three interconnected triangles .
The triangles may be joined in two ways : either as Borromean :
or unicursal :
Note that other types of valknuts , such as closed three - link chain , never occur in the original Viking ornaments .
One should keep that in mind when using the valknut in Viking tattoos or runic tattoos , since only the above two designs are genuine Viking valknuts .
Consider the Borromean triangles type , which occurs on the Stora Hammar rune stone .
Here above the valknut we see a raven , Odin ’s symbol .
Below the valknut is probably a burial mound .
A dead warrior is put there by someone with a spear and accompanied by another raven .
The spear is probably Gungnir , Odin ’s weapon .
The other sign of Odin ’s presence is a warrior hanged on a tree to the left of the mound .
All the symbols around the valknut , which is in the central position here , point to death and to Odin as a god of slain warriors .
The unicursal type of valknut ( which can be drawn with one stroke ) appears on Tängelgarda stone :
Other instances of the valknut in Viking ornaments are Lärbro stone , River Nene ring and a bedpost found on the Oseberg ship .
However , knot of the slain is not the only possible interpretation of the valknut .
It is also called Hrungnir ’s heart .
This name is based on a description found in the Prose Edda :
“ Hrungnir had a heart that was famous .
It was made of hard stone with three sharp - pointed corners just like the carved symbol Hrungnir ’s Heart ( hrungnishjarta ) . ”
The original meaning and function of the valknut is not wholly clear .
The number three is a very common magic symbol in many cultures .
However , in Scandinavian context three multiplied by three might designate the nine worlds , which are united by the Yggdrasil tree .
In modern times Valknut , like Triquetra and Horn Triskelion , is often interpreted as a symbol pointing to heathen convictions .

Though Verizon says the Storm is its fastest selling handset yet , the touchscreen phone is also generating more negative buzz than any BlackBerry before .
Consumers and journalists are beating the Storm to a bloody pulp , with very few defending Research In Motion 's response to the popular iPhone .
The most vicious review on the Storm comes from New York Times columnist David Pogue .
He ripped the Storm to oblivion last week , calling it the " BlackBerry Dud . "
And on Thursday he published some reader responses that could n't agree with him more .
" Having tried the Storm on two different days to make sure it was really as bad as it seemed the first time , I too find it unbelievable that these are for sale , " a reader wrote to Pogue .
" Verizon should just box all these Storms up and send them to Toys R Us , who can sell them in the Brainteaser section , right next to the Rubik 's Cubes . "
Verizon and RIM unleashed the Storm on Nov. 21 .
Sporting a 4 - inch touchscreen , the handset is Verizon 's attempt to compete with Apple 's phenomenally successful iPhone .
The resonating complaints about the Storm suggest the handset is not going to pose a threat to Steve Jobs ' revolutionary phone .
Wired.com 's Danny Dumas was n't too pleased with the Storm , either :
His major complaint was the operating system is a piece of garbage that does n't do justice to " a piece of hardware this gorgeous . "
And a quick Twitter search does n't display much love for the Storm .
" Coworker just got a new Blackberry Storm , " tweets Jeff Casemier .
" It is a wonky P.O.S. Just F.Y.I . "
The complaints are likely only to get worse and more widespread :
The phone 's only two weeks old , and Verizon says the Storm is selling as fast as bacon - wrapped hot dogs outside a bar .
We 're eager to hear what Gadget Lab readers have to say .
Any of you out there with a Storm ?
How 's it treating you ?

Comment A colourful Australian IT engineer and airpower zealot has published a stinging attack on the F - 35 stealth jet fighter , which is to be purchased by military forces worldwide including those of the US and UK .
Dr Carlo Kopp - to quiet applause from many in the aerospace world - says the F - 35 " is demonstrably not a true stealth aircraft " , and contends that it will be easily defeated by Russian - made radars and missiles .
Now you see me ...
Dr Kopp 's report , Assessing Joint Strike Fighter Defence Penetration Capabilities , is published at his Air Power Australia website , where he campaigns against Australia 's stated policy of purchasing F - 35s .
Kopp believes that the land down under should instead keep on operating its 1970s - era F - 111 swingwing bombers , and ask the US to buy the latest Raptor super stealth fighters as well - though these are n't on offer for export at present .
The F - 35 , also known as the Joint Strike Fighter and as " Lightning II " , is mainly built in America .
However , the programme has many overseas industrial partners - particularly including the UK - and unlike the Raptor it is intended for wide export to US allies from the outset .
Within the US armed forces , it is intended to be an " affordably stealthy " and numerous supplement to small numbers of dedicated air superiority planes like the Raptor and the US Navy 's Super Hornet .
F - 35s are supposed to focus mainly on air - to - surface strike missions , but also to offer a solid performance in air - to - air combat , especially at long ranges using advanced missiles and low radar signature to good effect .
The F - 35 , unlike the Raptor , is also to be available in vertical - landing jumpjet ( F - 35B ) and catapult / tailhook aircraft carrier ( F - 35C ) versions .
Carlo Kopp , however , reckons the F - 35 is terrible :
As with claims made for Joint Strike Fighter air combat capability , claims made for the Joint Strike Fighter concerning the penetration of [ enemy air defence networks ] equipped with modern radars and SAMs are not analytically robust , and can not be taken seriously .
He goes on to analyse the shape of the F - 35 prototypes now flying , using openly - available photos , and says that the aircraft is basically only stealthy at all ( that is , difficult to see on radar ) from dead ahead and , somewhat less so , from dead astern .
According to Kopp , any enemy radar to one side of the aircraft will be able to see it as though it had no stealth features at all .
He also reckons that the latest Russian defence radars , nowadays operating on longer wavelengths as a countermeasure against US stealth planes , will be able to see an F - 35 from any direction - completely invalidating its low - observable design .
This will mean that countries with modern air defence networks supplied by Russian exporters will find it a simple matter to stand off air forces equipped with F - 35s .
Kopp sums up by saying :
The Joint Strike Fighter is demonstrably not a true stealth aircraft in the sense of designs like the F - 117A [ the original US " Nighthawk " stealth fighter , now retired ] , B - 2A [ US stealth bomber ] and F - 22A [ Raptor ] , as its stealth performance varies much more strongly with aspect and threat radar operating frequency band ...
The operational economics of a fighter force using the Joint Strike Fighter will be much inferior to a force using a true all aspect stealth aircraft such as the F - 22A Raptor .

“ I had no contact with the governor or his office , and so we were not  I was not aware of what was happening , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ And as I said , it ’s a sad day for Illinois .
Beyond that , I do n’t think it ’s appropriate to comment . ”

Throughout his career , Mr. Obama has adroitly straddled the state ’s bruising politics , forming alliances with some old - style politicians even as he pressed for ethics reform .
But Mr. Obama had long been estranged from the governor , even though some in his political circle have had relationships with both of them , including Rahm Emanuel , his chief of staff , and Emil Jones Jr. , the retiring State Senate president and a longtime mentor .
The federal accusations against Mr. Blagojevich go beyond the Senate question into what the authorities here described as a “ political corruption crime spree . ”
The governor is accused of racing to solicit millions of dollars in donations from people with state business before an ethics law bars such behavior in January , and threatening to rescind state money this fall from businesses , including a Chicago hospital for children , whose executives refused to give him money .
He is also accused of putting pressure on The Chicago Tribune to fire members of its editorial board who had criticized him or lose the governor ’s help on the possible sale of Wrigley Field , which is owned by the Tribune Company and is home to the Chicago Cubs .
Mr. Blagojevich , who looked somber during an afternoon appearance in federal court , was released from custody on a $ 4,500 recognizance bond after surrendering his passport .
A hearing in federal court will be held in January to determine whether there is probable cause to go forward with the charges .
Sheldon Sorosky , his lawyer , later told reporters that the governor was “ very surprised and certainly feels that he did not do anything wrong . ”
According to the affidavit , in more than a month of recorded phone calls at his home and campaign office , Mr. Blagojevich considered numerous ways that he might personally and politically gain from the various Senate candidates , none of whom were identified by name in the court filing .
One possible choice might be able to help him secure a post with the new administration as secretary of health and human services or energy ; a “ three way ” deal involving a union and a candidate might win him a union leadership post ; or perhaps , he could secure the high - paying helm of a nonprofit organization that could be created for him .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
To some it signals the end of the American empire , to others it ’s just part of the vicious capitalist cycle .
Either way , the litany of bad economic news in America has many pondering where it all goes from here .

Millions of U.S. jobs have been lost and more layoffs are expected .
Banks have reined in lending after a credit crisis and a housing collapse that has sent foreclosures surging .
On Wall Street , several investment banks have collapsed .
The U.S. stock market has lost more than 40 percent of its value .
Behemoths like Citigroup C.N have struggled to survive .
Tough times also threaten the once - mighty U.S. auto industry , with General Motors GM.N and Chrysler LLC seeking billions in aid from Washington and warning of potential collapse if they do not get a bailout .
“ We are seeing the beginning of the end of the American empire , ” said Howard Zinn , author of “ A People ’s History of the United States . ”
On the right , former International Monetary Fund chief economist Simon Johnson sums up the view this way : “ Capitalism is not dead , there is no alternative to capitalism .
“ The myth of wonderful capitalism is dead but not capitalism , just the nice warm fuzziness . ”
Every week , there is more hard - to - believe news ; a Wall Street trader arrested on charges of a $ 50 billion investor fraud , and the governor of Illinois accused of trying to sell the U.S. Senate seat vacated by President - elect Barack Obama .
There is now so little respect for President George W. Bush that an Iraqi journalist threw his shoes at him on Sunday , a grievous insult in Iraqi culture .
Bush prepares to leave office next month with a presidential legacy battered by the grim economy and the unpopular war in Iraq .
Everyone agrees the situation in America , now officially in recession , is certainly bleak .
“ Everyone wants to save and no one wants to spend .
That makes it very hard to get growth , ” said Johnson , likening the U.S. economic predicament to having fallen into a bathtub and struggling to get traction to climb up the slippery wall .
THE COMING GLOOM
Experts are uncertain how long the American economic malaise will linger .
Some predict a year or two , others fear a slowdown of as long as a decade , reminiscent of Japan ’s lost decade of the 1990s .
“ Things are bad , ” said Alan Ruskin , chief international strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital .
“ This is not a typical recession , but it is still not like the Great Depression . ”
While there has been much talk about the misery of the 1930s , economists say this slump will not be so dramatic .
Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Johnson noted , “ If you had gone to Tokyo ( in the 1990s ) , you would have seen that it looked quite respectable and people looked reasonably happy , but there was no growth . ”
Likewise , he said Americans should brace for “ low growth not fast enough to create meaningful jobs for people ” for the next five to 10 years .
A poll released by Marist College Institute for Public Opinion on Monday showed 24 percent of Americans thought it likely they would be laid off or see their working hours cut in the coming year .
Andre Myrtil , who owns a small technology outsourcing business in New York , sums up the business environment for many , saying he is getting less work and companies are being slower in paying him .
“ There ’s no work .
My phone ’s not ringing . ”
“ I ’m not throwing in the towel yet , ” he said .
“ It can only get better , but time will tell . ”
Many believe the only way out of the mess is the government spending huge amounts of money .
But how much exactly is needed ?
“ There is the capacity to literally have helicopter drops of cash , ” Ruskin said .
Most expect Obama will approve a fiscal stimulus package worth hundreds of billions of dollars soon after his inauguration on January 20 .
“ American economic dominance has diminished and it is going to take some time for our economy to grow again .
We are in for an extensive period of slowdown or decline , ” said Howard Chernick , an economics professor at New York ’s Hunter College .
“ There is really only the willpower of the government to get us out of this , ” he said .
As well as spending huge amounts of money as happened during President Franklin Roosevelt ’s New Deal to confront the Depression , Chernick said Obama must deliver on another of his campaign themes -- “ hope . ”
“ Confidence will be a big issue and there , you can only hope , ” said Chernick .
“ One of the lessons historians took away from the New Deal was that Roosevelt had some potency , not just in fiscal decisions , but in instilling confidence . ”
HOPE AND CONFIDENCE
But Zinn said , “ Unless bold measures are taken to change the course of the nation , we are heading for trouble . ”
“ Obama has not shown signs of being the right person for this .
He has not shown the right boldness of vision . ”
For Zinn , Americans could push Obama to do what is needed with actions like those last week when workers in a Chicago factory staged a successful sit-in , demanding severance pay and vacation time they earned before being laid off .
“ That is a glimpse of what would be needed on a very large scale -- civil disobedience and direct action to dramatize what problems people have ... to push Obama to being the kind of president he could be , ” Zinn said .
For others , America must keep faith with capitalism .
“ There is still some faith in markets even if there is now acceptance that financial sectors need considerably oversight , ” said Ruskin .
“ The problem is , the horse has shot out of the barn and is well over the horizon . ”
Ladies , gentlemen , start your engines .
But only after you 've loaded them up with sausages , chicken , crabs , Cajun shrimp and plenty of vegetables .
Car engine cooking will change the way you take road trips , forever .
As I 've stated in the past , I love to get extra use out of the products I buy .
Around 15 years ago , I saw a documentary on British television about a guy who had wrapped some sausages in foil , placed them on a strategic part of his engine , and then took a 40 minute drive to his friend 's house .
When he got there , the sausages were perfectly cooked and a great end to a small journey .
How cool , I remember thinking .
But as I could n't drive at the time , I forgot all about it .
Until last week .
For some reason , sitting in my car at a red light smelling the grilling chicken of a nearby Chipotle reminded me of that story .
And now I 'm pleased and proud to present you with Car Engine Cooking , brought to you by the one and only source I could find on the subject ... a wonderful book called Manifold Destiny .
MANIFOLD DESTINY - The One ! The Only ! Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine !
Chris Maynard and Bill Scheller have a serious affinity with cars .
Both experienced rally drivers , they must have worked up an appetite on the courses they drove .
And as they are also both accomplished cooks , it seems only natural that a book on car engine cooking would be born .
The book is witty , concise and well - written .
Well worth a read on any day .
It also goes into more detail than I can recount here , covering everything from types of cars , food placement on engines , international VS domestic models and so on .
What I can give you is enough to whet your appetite , followed by the most important part of the story - my FIVE favorite car engine cooking recipes from the many delicacies listed in the book .
You can purchase the book direct from Amazon by clicking the link below .
Manifold Destiny : The One ! The Only ! Guide to Cooking on Your Car Engine !
The basics - remember , it 's not an exact science .
Chris and Bill advise that although car engines are all different , the principles are the same .
So , how do you find the best places on your car engine to place your chicken , your veggies or your succulent piece of rainbow trout ?
Well , it all comes down to ... your finger .
Get your car up to operating speed , or better yet take it for a drive around the block for five minutes , and then bring it back to the garage and lift the hood .
Now , finger at the ready , you start quickly touching various parts of the engine ( nothing plastic ... that will never get hot enough to cook anything ) .
And by quickly touching , it 's the kind of swift stab that means your finger feels the heat but you do n't give yourself a third degree burn .
( If you 're feeling really wussy , try an infrared thermometer ) .
Usually , the hottest part of the engine will be the exhaust manifold .
On older cars , the top of the engine block will be a good , sizzling place .
You 're not just looking for the hottest parts of the engine .
Like any kind of cooking , different foods require different temperatures .
A very hot part of the engine will be great for thick meat , a cooler part good for veggies or fish .
Or , if you 're traveling many hundreds of miles , you may want to use the cooler part to slow - cook your meat .
Mmmm .
As always , this is trial and error .
NEVER let the food interfere with the engine 's moving parts
We want a great meal here , not a wrecked engine .
And who would want to explain to the local mechanic why there 's a piece of rump roast stuck in the timing belt ?
Always choose places that are static , and ensure they are not going to move .
The boys have put together this handy list of things to avoid .
Car engine cooking no - nos ...
1 - Give the accelerator linkage a WIDE berth .
It connects the gas pedal to carburetor or fuel - injection system and regulates the flow of fuel to the cylinders .
Jam this and either your car wo n't start , or worse , it wo n't stop !
2 - Do n't block the airflow .
You 'll suffocate the engine .
3 - Avoid yanking wires .
Or pulling wires .
Or forcing a food - package to fit .
Basic rule of thumb ... if you have to force it , you should n't put it in .
4 - Place food with the engine OFF .
Seems like an obvious rule , but if you do n't want a nasty injury , follow this advice .
5 - Avoid foods with lots of liquid .
Foil - wrapping a meal with lots of liquid could results in unwanted goop all over your engine .
And that 's not good for it .
The FOIL CONE test
This is done to give you a good idea of how much room you have in your new ' oven ' , and can not be skipped .
Simply make a cone of aluminum foil about 5 inches high , place it on the injector housing , then shut the hood .
Now , when you open it , how much of that cone has been crushed ?
If it 's a lot , your car engine will only be good for cooking slimmer meals , like fish and strip steak .
If it has n't been touched , you 'll need extra foil to stop your packages from moving around .
Preparing your meal
Foil is about to become your new best friend .
Grab a sheet of foil large enough to comfortably cover the food / ingredients .
You do n't want to be cheap on foil here , more is better .
Wrap the foil around , creating a package , and crimp the foil tightly .
You want a seal all around the food .
And then do it again .
And then again .
Triple - wrapping in foil is the only way to ensure a tight , sealed , safe package .
Finally ... my FIVE favorite recipes from Manifold Destiny
Cruise - Control Pork Tenderloin - Cooking distance : 250 miles
I like this one because it 's soft and tender , and is a great treat for the end of a long journey ( hey , I 'm a Brit ...250 miles is along way to me ) .
Ingredients :
1 large pork tenderloin , butterflied
3 tbsp Dijon mustard
2 tbsp dry white wine
1/2 cup red onion , minced
2 tsp rosemary ( fresh ) , crushed
Salt & pepper Blend together all of the ingredients ( except the pork ) and spread across the inside of the pork tenderloin .
Close up the pork , triple - wrap in foil and place on a medium - hot part of the engine .
Turn once ( 125 miles ) during cooking .
Any-city Chicken Wings ( sweet ) - Cooking distance : 140-200 miles
Is there a better snack food than buffalo chicken wings ?
I can't think of one , personally .
So imagine my delight when I discovered a car - engine recipe .
Feel free to swap out ingredients according to how hot / spicy / tangy you like your wings .
This is my take on the recipe ( the optional ingredients ) .
Ingredients :
18 chicken wings
1/2 cup ketchup
1 tbsp molasses ( optional )
1 cup red wine vinegar
1 - 2 tsp red pepper flakes
4 - 6 minced jalapenos
3 cloves garlic
1 tbsp honey ( optional )
1 tbsp oregano
1 tsp brown sugar ( optional )
Pinch of salt
Fresh black pepper ( optional )
Splash of Tabasco Chipotle sauce ( optional )
Splash of Worcestershire sauce ( optional )
Blend together all of the ingredients ( except wings ) and pour over chicken wings .
Cover tightly in the fridge for at least 24 hours .
Drain wings ( save the marinade ) and divide into three foil packages .
Brush with marinade , then triple - wrap each package tightly and place on medium - hot part of the engine .
I like my chicken well done so I do the 200 miles , or around 3 1/2 hours .
Good & simple Cajun Shrimp / Crayfish - Cooking distance : 35 miles
I love shrimp , and this is a quick journey .
For most , it 's an average morning 's commute .
What a way to start the day ... Cajun Shrimp for breakfast .
Ingredients :
1 pound large shrimp or crayfish tails , in shells .
6 small green hot peppers
2 cloves garlic
1 medium onion , finely chopped
Butter or spread
Salt & pepper Remove seeds from peppers ( ouch , they are hot ) and mince with the onion and garlic .
Butter your foil , add the shrimp and cover with your spicy mixture .
Sprinkle a little salt and pepper , then triple - wrap and place in a medium part of the engine .
Delicious , seasoned , spicy shrimp or crayfish await .
Eggs On Cheese Pie - Cooking distance : 55 miles
Another good breakfast food , or anytime food .
Legend has it that the recipe ( minus the cooking method ) originated in medieval monasteries .
A holy treat .
Ingredients :
Breadcrumbs ( Italian or fresh homemade )
1/2 pound mozzarella cheese , cubed
6 eggs ( free range folks .... be good )
Diced Canadian bacon ( optional )
6 empty tuna - fish cans for cooking
Pinch of cayenne and paprika ( optional )
Butter or spread .
Salt & pepper .
Wash 6 empty tuna cans and butter the insides .
Sprinkle a few tablespoons of breadcrumbs into each can and shake to cover the base evenly .
Dump out excess .
Now cover with mozzarella ( and bacon if desired ) then crack an egg on top of each , add seasonings and spices on top , then cover with mozzarella .
Wrap cans tightly in foil , place on a hot part of the engine with good contact for the base of each can , and after 55 miles they should be good .
If not , keep driving till the cheese has melted .
Pat 's Provolone Porsche Potatoes - Cooking distance : 55 miles
Good for vegetarians and a great side dish , this is simple , tasty car engine cooking .
Ingredients :
1/2 pound new potatoes
1 cup milk
1 cup water
2 ounces grated aged provolone ( or my favorite , aged cheddar )
Butter
Salt & pepper Peel and slice potatoes to 1.4 inch thick .
Place in a saucepan with the milk and water and simmer 10 mins .
Drain , then spread onto heavily buttered foil .
Sprinkle with your cheese ( or cheeses , experiment with flavors ) and seasonings .
Sprinkle with butter , triple - wrap and place around medium - hot parts of the engine .
Delicious .
And finally , practice makes perfect .
You are n't going to get all of this right first time .
Experiment with different ingredients , different parts of the engine and different cooking time .
As I say , the book is an essential resource for all budding car - engine chefs , so please pick up a copy or at the very least see if you can find one in your local library .
Soon , you 'll be driving and cooking in perfect harmony .
Happy times .

I ’m always impressed when CEO ’s demonstrate Deming - like behavior as they lead ; it ’s rare , but there ’s almost a magical , mobilizing , and inspiring force that happens when CEO ’s or corporate leaders behave in a respectful , inspiring , common - sense , and thoughtful way .
Today , I ’m reminded of an experience back in 2004 while I worked for Amazon.com — something Jeff Bezos did that I still carry with me to this day .
Jeff Bezos Demonstrates 5 Whys
During Q4 , Bezos and his leadership team have a tradition of visiting the Amazon.com Fulfillment Centers , spends time with the associates , and also physically works on the floor alongside everyone else .
During one visit , there had just been a safety incident where an associate had damaged his finger .
When Jeff learned of this during a meeting , he was very disturbed and got very emotional — angry at first , then felt very bad for this associate and his family .
Then , he did something remarkable .
He got up , walked to the whiteboard and began to ask the 5 - why ’s ( I quote the below from memory ) :
Why did the associate damage his thumb ?
Because his thumb got caught in the conveyor .
Why did his thumb get caught in the conveyor ?
Because he was chasing his bag , which was on a running conveyor belt .
Why did he chase his bag ?
Because he placed his bag on the conveyor , but it then turned - on by surprise
Why was his bag on the conveyor ?
Because he used the conveyor as a table
So , the likely root cause of the associate ’s damaged thumb is that he simply needed a table , there was n’t one around , so he used a conveyor as a table .
To eliminate further safety incidences , we need to provide tables at the appropriate stations or provide portable , light tables for the associates to use and also update and a greater focus on safety training .
Also , look into preventative maintenance standard work .
Jeff Bezos on Lean and Lessons Learned
There are several things amazing about this experience :
Jeff Bezos cared enough about an hourly associate and his family to spend time discussing his situation .
Jeff properly facilitated the 5 - why exercise to arrive at a root cause : he did not blame people or groups — no finger pointing .
He involved a large group of stakeholders , demonstrated by example , and arrived at a root cause and he did n’t focus on symptoms of the problem .
He is the founder and CEO of Amazon.com , yet he got involved in the dirt and sweat of his employees ’ situation .
In that simple moment , he taught all of us to focus on root causes — quickly — not heavily relying on data or overanalysis of the situation , and yet he was spot - on in identifying the root causes of the safety incident .
Every company has its warts and zits , but , make no mistake — Jeff Bezos is a Lean and Six Sigma fanatic and , in my opinion , makes a strong effort to run his company in a very Deming - like way .
How will you apply the 5 - why ’s today ?
Will you focus on the root causes of your challenges and not just on the symptoms ?
Celebrities are pretty synonymous to partying and having a good time .
So what ’s better than putting the two together by ...
You could make a case that the best candidate to vote for is the one you trust .
Personally , I think it ’s a better rationale than :
The one you ’d want to have a beer with
The one with the most experience
The one with the most moral clarity .
Of course , trust is a personal thing .
Then again , so is voting .
So I ’ve given you a little checklist below to assess your level of trust in each candidate in that little election they ’re having tomorrow in the US .
It is based on the trust equation , originally printed in The Trusted Advisor in 2000 .
It suggests trust is a combination of Credibility , Reliability , Intimacy , and low Self - Orientation .
( Not a US citizen ?

Or not ?
University of California President Mark G. Yudof on Thursday proposed boosting the university ’s financial aid program to cover all academic fees for students from families with incomes of less than $ 60,000 a year .
Most low - income UC students already receive such aid , and officials said the plan would make only about 1,100 additional students eligible to have all fees covered .
But the main purpose , Yudof said , would be to simplify UC ’s confusing aid policies and encourage more needy students to attend one of the system ’s nine undergraduate campuses .
“ The fact is we need to demonstrate to low - income students that they can afford to attend the University of California , ” Yudof said in a conference call with reporters .
Current procedures , he said , are “ too vague , too ambiguous . ”
Outside experts generally praised the proposal , which they say could help ease recession worries for parents of college students .

The plan , which must be approved by UC ’s regents , relies on federal and state programs such as Pell Grants and Cal Grants to remain the foundation of student aid .
But for families with annual incomes below the state median of $ 60,000 , UC would cover the rest of the basic fees , which next year are expected to total $ 7,800 annually for California resident undergraduates .
Currently , about 47,000 of UC ’s 173,000 undergraduates receive about that amount in financial aid , and officials estimated that about 1,100 more students would be added next year under what Yudof calls the “ Blue and Gold Opportunity Plan . ”
Students with greater need would be eligible for additional grants for housing , food and books and other expenses , which can amount to an additional $ 15,000 a year .
UC officials said the plan would not reduce the aid currently available for families with incomes of $ 60,000 to $ 100,000 .
Half of those middle - income students now receive some help , averaging about $ 5,800 a year in UC or outside grants , they said .

UC campuses enroll student populations from economically diverse households , with about 40 % earning more than $ 89,000 and about 35 % earning less than $ 45,000 , UC statistics show .
Yudof ’s proposal , coming at a time when the state Legislature is preparing to cut funding for UC , would not require additional state money , officials said .
UC typically sets aside one - third of the income generated by student fee hikes for increased financial aid for needy students .
Yudof said the anticipated $ 3.1 - million annual cost of the proposed reform would come from increasing the portion rolled back into financial aid from 33 % to 36 % .
However , the plan could face some trouble if the final state budget includes deep cuts to Cal Grants .
UC leaders are considering raising basic fees for California undergraduates by 9.4 % , or about $ 662 , for the school year starting in fall .

Yudof said he hoped his proposal might ease many families ’ fears about rising costs of college education nationwide .
The regents are expected to review and vote on the aid plan at a meeting Feb. 4 - 5 in San Francisco .
Daniel J. Hurley , director of state relations and policy analysis for the American Assn. of State Colleges & Universities , praised Yudof for taking the action at a time of national economic uncertainty .
Hurley also said that making the financial aid process more understandable sends “ a very powerful message to low - income families ” not to be afraid of applying for grants , he said .
At the Institute for College Access and Success , an independent think tank in Berkeley , program director Deborah Cochrane said it was unclear how the Yudof idea differed from what she described as UC ’s already fairly generous aid policy , other than in declaring a clear promise to students .
She urged eligible families to pay close attention to additional costs , such as housing and books , that are not guaranteed under the plan .

In related news , UCLA on Thursday announced a drive to raise $ 500 million for graduate student fellowships and undergraduate scholarships by mid-2013 .
UCLA Chancellor Gene Block and his wife , Carol , pledged $ 100,000 of their own , to be paid over the next five years , to help launch the campaign .

Astronomers studying white dwarfs have found the remains of “ shredded ” asteroids around some of these dead stars .
This finding suggests that the same materials that make up Earth and our solar system ’s other rocky bodies could be common in the universe .
If the materials are common , then rocky planets could be , too .
“ If you ground up our asteroids and rocky planets , you would get the same type of dust we are seeing in these star systems , ” said Michael Jura of the University of California , Los Angeles , who presented the results today at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , Calif .
“ This tells us that the stars have asteroids like ours — and therefore could also have rocky planets . ”
But most surprising , astronomers have been able to use the rocky debris to study the evolution of planets .
Observations with NASA ’s Spitzer Space Telescope reveal six dead “ white dwarf ” stars littered with the remains of shredded asteroids .
Asteroids and planets form out of dusty material that swirls around young stars .
The dust sticks together , forming clumps and eventually full - grown planets .
Asteroids are the leftover debris .
When a star like our sun nears the end of its life , it puffs up into a red giant that consumes its innermost planets , while jostling the orbits of remaining asteroids and outer planets .
As the star continues to die , it blows off its outer layers and shrinks down into a skeleton of its former self — a white dwarf .
Sometimes , a jostled asteroid wanders too close to a white dwarf and meets its demise — the gravity of the white dwarf shreds the asteroid to pieces .
A similar thing happened to Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 when Jupiter ’s gravity tore it up , before the comet ultimately smashed into the planet in 1994 .
Spitzer observed shredded asteroid pieces around white dwarfs with its infrared spectrograph , an instrument that breaks light apart into a rainbow of wavelengths , revealing imprints of chemicals .
“ While no one yet has the ability to directly see the smashed up debris and measure its composition , we have the tools to measure the potential capacity for planets , ” said Jura at today ’s press conference .
Spitzer analyzed the asteroid dust around two so - called polluted white dwarfs ; the new observations bring the total to eight .
Jura said only 1 % of white dwarfs observed have broken up asteroids in their vicinity .
“ Now , we ’ve got a bigger sample of these polluted white dwarfs , so we know these types of events are not extremely rare , ” said Jura .
In all eight systems observed , Spitzer found that the dust contains a glassy silicate mineral similar to olivine and commonly found on Earth .
“ This is one clue that the rocky material around these stars has evolved very much like our own , ” said Jura .
The Spitzer data also suggest there is no carbon in the rocky debris — again like the asteroids and rocky planets in our solar system , which have relatively little carbon .
A single asteroid is thought to have broken apart within the last million years or so in each of the eight white - dwarf systems .
The biggest of the bunch was once about 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) in diameter , a bit larger than Los Angeles County .
Jura says the real power of observing these white dwarf systems is still to come .
When an asteroid “ bites the dust ” around a dead star , it breaks into very tiny pieces .
Asteroid dust around living stars , by contrast , is made of larger particles .
By continuing to use spectrographs to analyze the visible light from this fine dust , astronomers will be able to see exquisite details — including information about what elements are present and in what abundance .
This will reveal much more about how other star systems sort and process their planetary materials .
“ It ’s as if the white dwarfs separate the dust apart for us , ” said Jura .

Showing once again that whenever a transformational leader like Barack Obama comes along to lead the nation into the future , the Republican party is always there to drag us backwards , Senator Jim DeMint ( R - SC ) tried to delay the grand opening of the new Capitol Visitor Center in Washington because be thinks there just is n't enough mention of God in the facility .
Saying that the $ 621 million historical exhibit is " left - leaning " and leaves out America 's " history of faith , " DeMint tried to use his Senatorial clout to delay the center 's opening on Tuesday and , among other things , wanted the original national motto of " E. Pluribus Unum " -- " from many , one " in Latin -- replaced with " In God We Trust .
"
“ The Capitol Visitor Center is designed to tell the history and purpose of our nation 's Capitol , but it fails to appropriately honor our religious heritage that has been critical to America ’s success , ” said DeMint .
What DeMint 's religious - right stunt leaves out is that the purpose of the center is to provide an " …educational environment for visitors to learn about the unique characteristics of the House and the Senate and the legislative process " and to teach about our system of Government -- to talk about the private religious practices of the nation 's Senators and Representatives .
DeMint , who was joined in his silly protest by Republican Senators Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma , has managed to strong - arm the Visitor Center into plastering over " E. Pluribus Unum , " changing the motto to " In God We Trust " and committing to add the Pledge of Allegiance to the displays .
Of course , you know DeMint probably does n’t care about pledging one 's loyalty to the U.S. as much as he does about the " one nation , under God " part .
And the South Carolina Senator apparentlyobjected to a prominent statement near the facility 's entrance that says " we have built no temple , but the Capitol .
We consult no common oracle but the Constitution , " which is attributed to Representative Rufus Choate , who represented Massachusetts in Congress in the 1830s and 1840s .
" This is an intentional misrepresentation of our nation ’s real history , and an offensive refusal to honor America 's God -given blessings , " said DeMint .
That pretty much wraps it up nicely , does n’t it ?
Given that DeMint and his Republican colleagues have contributed mightily to Bush and Cheney utterly trashing the Constitution and our true national creed for eight years , it 's not at all surprising that a quote heralding the Constitution as our governmental foundation -- and not the bible , I guess -- should make him so angry .
And I guess South Carolina voters must approve of DeMint spending his time and energy on this while we have two wars going on , an economy in deep recession and people losing jobs and homes every day .
I 'm assuming the inclusion of the Flat Earth Society somewhere in the newest D.C. attraction is coming next or a DeMint insistence that the Capitol Visitor Center include a mural of Adam and Eve riding a dinosaur to a church social .
Jorn Utzon , an architect who designed one of the world ’s most recognizable buildings  the Sydney Opera House  but never saw it finished , died in Copenhagen on Saturday .
He was 90 .
He died of heart failure in his sleep , according to his son Kim .
Mr. Utzon left Australia amid controversy seven years before the Opera House was completed .
He lived out most of his final decades on the Spanish island of Majorca while his gull - roofed building came to symbolize Australia , 10,000 miles away .
As a young architect Mr. Utzon worked for Gunnar Asplund in Sweden and Alvar Aalto in Finland before establishing his own practice in Copenhagen in 1950 .
In 1956 he read about the Sydney Opera House competition in a Swedish architecture magazine .
He spent six months designing a building with sail - like roofs , their geometry , he said , derived from the sections of an orange .
Mr. Utzon ’s plan was championed by Eero Saarinen , the Finnish architect who was one of the judges in the competition .

In 1957 , Mr. Utzon  who until then was hardly known outside his native country  was declared the winner , and for the next five years he worked on the project from his office in Denmark .
In 1962 , he moved with his wife , Lis , sons Jan and Kim , and daughter , Lin , to Sydney .

The death of John Ogono , 40 , and the torture of Sehupa Trimek , 25 , outside Goroka in Eastern Highlands province last weekend came to light on Friday .

LOS ANGELES -
The woman who gave birth to octuplets this week conceived all 14 of her children through in vitro fertilization , is not married and has been obsessed with having children since she was a teenager , her mother said .
Angela Suleman told The Associated Press she was not supportive when her daughter , Nadya Suleman , decided to have more embryos implanted last year .
" It ca n't go on any longer , " she said in a phone interview Friday .
" She 's got six children and no husband .
I was brought up the traditional way .
I firmly believe in marriage .
But she did n't want to get married . "
Nadya Suleman , 33 , gave birth Monday in nearby Bellflower .
She was expected to remain in the hospital for at least a few more days , and her newborns for at least a month .
A spokeswoman at Kaiser Permanente Bellflower Medical Center said the babies were were progressing daily , with all eight breathing unassisted and being tube - fed .
While her daughter recovers , Angela Suleman is taking care of the other six children , ages 2 through 7 , at the family home in Whittier , about 15 miles east of downtown Los Angeles .
She said she warned her daughter that when she gets home from the hospital , " I 'm going to be gone . "
Angela Suleman said her daughter always had trouble conceiving and underwent in vitro fertilization treatments because her fallopian tubes are " plugged up . "
There were frozen embryos left over after her previous pregnancies and her daughter did n't want them destroyed , so she decided to have more children .
Her mother and doctors have said the woman was told she had the option to abort some of the embryos and , later , the fetuses .
She refused .
Her mother said she does not believe her daughter will have any more children .
" She does n't have any more ( frozen embryos ) , so it 's over now , " she said .
" It has to be . "
Nadya Suleman wanted to have children since she was a teenager , " but luckily she could n't , " her mother said .
" Instead of becoming a kindergarten teacher or something , she started having them , but not the normal way , " he mother said .
Her daughter 's obsession with children caused Angela Suleman considerable stress , so she sought help from a psychologist , who told her to order her daughter out of the house .
" Maybe she would n't have had so many kids then , but she is a grown woman , " Angela Suleman said .
" I feel responsible and I did n't want to throw her out . "
Little psychological research has been conducted on the reasons some mothers seem hooked on repeated pregnancies .
David Diamond , a co-director for the Center for Reproductive Psychology in San Diego , said mothers can be drawn to repeat pregnancies for a number of reasons , with some finding the experience so satisfying they choose to become surrogates .
Diane G. Sanford , a psychologist and author specializing in women 's reproductive mental health , said while she does n't know much about Nadya Suleman 's background , women that have obsessive - compulsive disorder can become fixated on different obsessions .
" Her obsession centers around children , having children and being a mother , " she said .
" To what degree are her esteem and identity based on being a mom and why has this from a young age been such a preoccupation of hers ? "
Yolanda Garcia , 49 , of Whittier , said she helped care for Nadya Suleman 's autistic son three years ago .
" From what I could tell back then , she was pretty happy with herself , saying she liked having kids and she wanted 12 kids in all , " Garcia told the Long Beach Press - Telegram .
" She told me that all of her kids were through in vitro , and I said Gosh , how can you afford that and go to school at the same time ? " ' she added .
" And she said it 's because she got paid for it . "
Garcia said she did not ask for details .
Nadya Suleman holds a 2006 degree in child and adolescent development from California State University , Fullerton , and as late as last spring she was studying for a master 's degree in counseling , college spokeswoman Paula Selleck told the Press - Telegram .
Her fertility doctor has not been identified .
Her mother told the Los Angeles Times all the children came from the same sperm donor but she declined to identify him .
Birth certificates reviewed by The Associated Press identify a David Solomon as the father for the four oldest children .
Certificates for the other children were not immediately available .
Angela Suleman told reporters Friday that doctors implanted far fewer than eight embryos but they multiplied .
Experts said this could be possible since Nadya Suleman 's system has likely been hyperstimulated for years with fertilization treatments and drugs .
The news that the octuplets ' mother already had six children sparked an ethical debate .
Some medical experts were disturbed to hear that she was offered fertility treatment , and troubled by the possibility that she was implanted with so many embryos .
" You should always shoot for one , " said Dr. Marcelle Cedars , a professor and director of reproductive health at the University of California , San Francisco , Medical Center , who worried about the increased risk of potential health complications for the babies .
Others worried that she would be overwhelmed trying to raise so many children and would end up relying on public support .
" This woman could not comprehend the ramifications of having eight children of the same age at the same time , " said Judith Horowitz , a Parkland , Fla . - based psychologist and author who works with couples on fertility issues .
" After Pampers stops delivering the free diapers , then what ? "
The eight babies - six boys and two girls - were delivered by cesarean section weighing between 1 pound , 8 ounces and 3 pounds , 4 ounces .
Forty - six physicians and staff assisted in the deliveries .
On the day of the big football game between the University of Missouri Tigers and the Cowboys of Oklahoma State , a football scout named Dan Shonka sat in his hotel , in Columbia , Missouri , with a portable DVD player .
Shonka has worked for three National Football League teams .
Before that , he was a football coach , and before that he played linebacker — although , he says , “ that was three knee operations and a hundred pounds ago . ”
Every year , he evaluates somewhere between eight hundred and twelve hundred players around the country , helping professional teams decide whom to choose in the college draft , which means that over the last thirty years he has probably seen as many football games as anyone else in America .
In his DVD player was his homework for the evening ’s big game — an edited video of the Tigers ’ previous contest , against the University of Nebraska Cornhuskers .
Effective teachers have a gift for noticing — what one researcher calls “ withitness . ”
Illustration by Joost Swarte
Shonka methodically made his way through the video , stopping and re-winding whenever he saw something that caught his eye .
He liked Jeremy Maclin and Chase Coffman , two of the Mizzou receivers .
He loved William Moore , the team ’s bruising strong safety .
But , most of all , he was interested in the Tigers ’ quarterback and star , a stocky , strong - armed senior named Chase Daniel .
“ I like to see that the quarterback can hit a receiver in stride , so he does n’t have to slow for the ball , ” Shonka began .
He had a stack of evaluation forms next to him and , as he watched the game , he was charting and grading every throw that Daniel made .
“ Then judgment .
Hey , if it ’s not there , throw it away and play another day .
Will he stand in there and take a hit , with a guy breathing down his face ?
Will he be able to step right in there , throw , and still take that hit ?
Does the guy throw better when he’s in the pocket , or does he throw equally well when he ’s on the move ?
You want a great competitor .
Durability .
Can they hold up , their strength , toughness ?
Can they make big plays ?
Can they lead a team down the field and score late in the game ?
Can they see the field ?
When your team ’s way ahead , that ’s fine .
But when you ’re getting your ass kicked I want to see what you ’re going to do . ”
He pointed to his screen .
Daniel had thrown a dart , and , just as he did , a defensive player had hit him squarely .
“ See how he popped up ? ” Shonka said .
“ He stood right there and threw the ball in the face of that rush .
This kid has got a lot of courage . ”
Daniel was six feet tall and weighed two hundred and twenty - five pounds : thick through the chest and trunk .
He carried himself with a self - assurance that bordered on cockiness .
He threw quickly and in rhythm .
He nimbly evaded defenders .
He made short throws with touch and longer throws with accuracy .
By the game ’s end , he had completed an astonishing seventy - eight per cent of his passes , and handed Nebraska its worst home defeat in fifty - three years .
“ He can zip it , ” Shonka said .
“ He can really gun , when he has to . ” Shonka had seen all the promising college quarterbacks , charted and graded their throws , and to his mind Daniel was special : “ He might be one of the best college quarterbacks in the country . ”
But then Shonka began to talk about when he was on the staff of the Philadelphia Eagles , in 1999 .
Five quarterbacks were taken in the first round of the college draft that year , and each looked as promising as Chase Daniel did now .
But only one of them , Donovan McNabb , ended up fulfilling that promise .
Of the rest , one descended into mediocrity after a decent start .
Two were complete busts , and the last was so awful that after failing out of the N.F.L. he ended up failing out of the Canadian Football League as well .
The year before , the same thing happened with Ryan Leaf , who was the Chase Daniel of 1998 .
The San Diego Chargers made him the second player taken over all in the draft , and gave him an eleven - million - dollar signing bonus .
Leaf turned out to be terrible .
In 2002 , it was Joey Harrington ’s turn .
Harrington was a golden boy out of the University of Oregon , and the third player taken in the draft .
Shonka still ca n’t get over what happened to him .
“ I tell you , I saw Joey live , ” he said .
“ This guy threw lasers , he could throw under tight spots , he had the arm strength , he had the size , he had the intelligence . ”
Shonka got as misty as a two - hundred - and - eighty - pound ex-linebacker in a black tracksuit can get .
“ He ’s a concert pianist , you know ?
I really — I mean , I really — liked Joey . ”
And yet Harrington ’s career consisted of a failed stint with the Detroit Lions and a slide into obscurity .
Shonka looked back at the screen , where the young man he felt might be the best quarterback in the country was marching his team up and down the field .
“ How will that ability translate to the National Football League ? ”
He shook his head slowly .
“ Shoot . ”
This is the quarterback problem .
There are certain jobs where almost nothing you can learn about candidates before they start predicts how they ’ll do once they ’re hired .
So how do we know whom to choose in cases like that ?
In recent years , a number of fields have begun to wrestle with this problem , but none with such profound social consequences as the profession of teaching .
One of the most important tools in contemporary educational research is “ value added ” analysis .
It uses standardized test scores to look at how much the academic performance of students in a given teacher ’s classroom changes between the beginning and the end of the school year .
Suppose that Mrs. Brown and Mr. Smith both teach a classroom of third graders who score at the fiftieth percentile on math and reading tests on the first day of school , in September .
When the students are retested , in June , Mrs. Brown ’s class scores at the seventieth percentile , while Mr. Smith ’s students have fallen to the fortieth percentile .
That change in the students ’ rankings , value - added theory says , is a meaningful indicator of how much more effective Mrs. Brown is as a teacher than Mr. Smith .
It ’s only a crude measure , of course .
A teacher is not solely responsible for how much is learned in a classroom , and not everything of value that a teacher imparts to his or her students can be captured on a standardized test .
Nonetheless , if you follow Brown and Smith for three or four years , their effect on their students ’ test scores starts to become predictable : with enough data , it is possible to identify who the very good teachers are and who the very poor teachers are .
What ’s more — and this is the finding that has galvanized the educational world — the difference between good teachers and poor teachers turns out to be vast .
Eric Hanushek , an economist at Stanford , estimates that the students of a very bad teacher will learn , on average , half a year ’s worth of material in one school year .
The students in the class of a very good teacher will learn a year and a half ’s worth of material .
That difference amounts to a year ’s worth of learning in a single year .
Teacher effects dwarf school effects : your child is actually better off in a “ bad ” school with an excellent teacher than in an excellent school with a bad teacher .
Teacher effects are also much stronger than class - size effects .
You ’d have to cut the average class almost in half to get the same boost that you ’d get if you switched from an average teacher to a teacher in the eighty - fifth percentile .
And remember that a good teacher costs as much as an average one , whereas halving class size would require that you build twice as many classrooms and hire twice as many teachers .
Hanushek recently did a back - of - the - envelope calculation about what even a rudimentary focus on teacher quality could mean for the United States .
If you rank the countries of the world in terms of the academic performance of their schoolchildren , the U.S. is just below average , half a standard deviation below a clump of relatively high - performing countries like Canada and Belgium .
According to Hanushek , the U.S. could close that gap simply by replacing the bottom six per cent to ten per cent of public - school teachers with teachers of average quality .
After years of worrying about issues like school funding levels , class size , and curriculum design , many reformers have come to the conclusion that nothing matters more than finding people with the potential to be great teachers .
But there ’s a hitch : no one knows what a person with the potential to be a great teacher looks like .
The school system has a quarterback problem .
Kickoff time for Missouri ’s game against Oklahoma State was seven o’clock .
It was a perfect evening for football : cloudless skies and a light fall breeze .
For hours , fans had been tailgating in the parking lots around the stadium .
Cars lined the roads leading to the university , many with fuzzy yellow - and - black Tiger tails hanging from their trunks .
It was one of Mizzou ’s biggest games in years .
The Tigers were undefeated , and had a chance to become the No. 1 college football team in the country .
Shonka made his way through the milling crowds and took a seat in the press box .
Below him , the players on the field looked like pieces on a chessboard .
The Tigers held the ball first .
Chase Daniel stood a good seven yards behind his offensive line .
He had five receivers , two to his left and three to his right , spaced from one side of the field to the other .
His linemen were widely spaced as well .
In play after play , Daniel caught the snap from his center , planted his feet , and threw the ball in quick seven - and eight - yard diagonal passes to one of his five receivers .
The style of offense that the Tigers run is called the “ spread , ” and most of the top quarterbacks in college football — the players who will be drafted into the pros—are spread quarterbacks .
By spacing out the offensive linemen and wide receivers , the system makes it easy for the quarterback to figure out the intentions of the opposing defense before the ball is snapped : he can look up and down the line , “ read ” the defense , and decide where to throw the ball before anyone has moved a muscle .
Daniel had been playing in the spread since high school ; he was its master .
“ Look how quickly he gets the ball out , ” Shonka said .
“ You can hardly go a thousand and one , a thousand and two , and it ’s out of his hand .
He knows right where he ’s going .
When everyone is spread out like that , the defense ca n’t disguise its coverage .
Chase knows right away what they are going to do .
The system simplifies the quarterback ’s decisions . ”
But for Shonka this did n’t help matters .
It had always been hard to predict how a college quarterback would fare in the pros .
The professional game was , simply , faster and more complicated .
With the advent of the spread , though , the correspondence between the two levels of play had broken down almost entirely .
N.F.L. teams do n’t run the spread .
They can’t .
The defenders in the pros are so much faster than their college counterparts that they would shoot through those big gaps in the offensive line and flatten the quarterback .
In the N.F.L. , the offensive line is bunched closely together .
Daniel would n’t have five receivers .
Most of the time , he ’d have just three or four .
He would n’t have the luxury of standing seven yards behind the center , planting his feet , and knowing instantly where to throw .
He ’d have to crouch right behind the center , take the snap directly , and run backward before planting his feet to throw .
The onrushing defenders would n’t be seven yards away .
They would be all around him , from the start .
The defense would no longer have to show its hand , because the field would not be so spread out .
It could now disguise its intentions .
Daniel would n’t be able to read the defense before the snap was taken .
He ’d have to read it in the seconds after the play began .

“ In the spread , you see a lot of guys wide open , ” Shonka said .
“ But when a guy like Chase goes to the N.F.L. he ’s never going to see his receivers that open — only in some rare case , like someone slips or there ’s a bust in the coverage .
When that ball ’s leaving your hands in the pros , if you do n’t use your eyes to move the defender a little bit , they ’ll break on the ball and intercept it .
The athletic ability that they ’re playing against in the league is unbelievable . ”
As Shonka talked , Daniel was moving his team down the field .
But he was almost always throwing those quick , diagonal passes .
In the N.F.L. , he would have to do much more than that — he would have to throw long , vertical passes over the top of the defense .
Could he make that kind of throw ?
Shonka did n’t know .
There was also the matter of his height .
Six feet was fine in a spread system , where the big gaps in the offensive line gave Daniel plenty of opportunity to throw the ball and see downfield .
But in the N.F.L. there would n’t be gaps , and the linemen rushing at him would be six - five , not six - one .
“ I wonder , ” Shonka went on .
“ Can he see ?
Can he be productive in a new kind of offense ?
How will he handle that ?
I ’d like to see him set up quickly from center .
I ’d like to see his ability to read coverages that are not in the spread .
I ’d like to see him in the pocket .
I ’d like to see him move his feet .
I ’d like to see him do a deep dig , or deep comeback .
You know , like a throw twenty to twenty - five yards down the field . ”
It was clear that Shonka did n’t feel the same hesitancy in evaluating the other Mizzou stars — the safety Moore , the receivers Maclin and Coffman .
The game that they would play in the pros would also be different from the game they were playing in college , but the difference was merely one of degree .
They had succeeded at Missouri because they were strong and fast and skilled , and these traits translate in kind to professional football .
Liverpool John Lennon Airport Experimenting with Carbon Capture Technology
December 29th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Pretty soon , Liverpool John Lennon Airport will have more than just a cool namesake — it will also have experimental carbon capture technology .
The airport has teamed with UK - based start - up Origo Industries to launch a program that will capture CO2 emissions from the terminal building .
Captured emissions will be recycled through a photo - bioreactor ( PBR ) to create algae - based biofuel that will power the airport ’s ground vehicles .
The process works by taking captured CO2 and filtering it through Origo ’s “ Ecobox ” into the PBR , where it is recycled into biofuel .
Remaining biomass goes through a drying process and is put in a burner to heat the airport and supply hot water .
Origo ’s system will be installed in January and will provide up to 250 liters of biofuel each day .
If the system is successful , the airport may install a larger unit that could generate up to 3,000 liters per day .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
For the second time in 18 months , employment search site Monster.com has lost a wealth of personal data belonging to millions of job seekers after its database was illegally accessed .
The Massachusetts - based website is warning all its customers that their names , birth dates , phone numbers , user IDs and passwords , email addresses , sex , and ethnicity have been pilfered .
It strongly urges users to change their login credentials immediately and to be on the lookout for phishing emails .
The breach prompted this warning from USAJobs , which looks to Monster to run its website .
The company has decided not to email or phone customers to warn them of the breach , spokeswoman Nikki Richardson said .
The only warning is this undated advisory , which users will only know about if they happen to visit the company 's website .
It 's at least the third time Monster.com has put its users at risk after suffering a significant security breach .
In August 2007 , a Trojan - horse program used pilfered employer credentials to siphon resume data belonging to some 1.3 million people .
Within days , many users started receiving targeted phishing attacks that tried to trick them into downloading malicious software or take jobs as money mules for online crime gangs .
The company made much fanfare about plans to improve security , but two months later , it was hit again when attackers hijacked some of its job listings and used them to infect visitors with malware .
" We take this very seriously , " Richardson said of the latest breach .
" We 're devoted to continuing to put significant resources toward the protection of our database , and no company in our business can completely prevent unauthorized access to data .
We believe Monster security measures are as or more robust than other sites in the industry . "
People responsible for the breach were not able to access resumes , social security numbers , or personal financial data , Richardson said .
The spokeswoman declined to say when or how the breach occurred and said it was still being investigated .
She also declined to say how many users Monster has .
Over the past few years , personal information like that stored on Monster have become a hot commodity in the world of cyberfraud .
It can be used in identity theft , phishing attacks , and spam campaigns .
And because so many people ( foolishly ) use a single email address and password for multiple accounts , the data can be used to gain access to online banks and other sites across the internet .
Readers who believe they are being targeted as a result of Monster 's latest monster flub are invited to contact your reporter using this link .
Confidentiality assured ( unlike Monster ) . ®
The Bill of No Rights
The following was written by State Representative Mitchell Kaye from Cobb County , GA
We , the sensible people of the United States , in an attempt to help everyone get along , restore some semblance of justice , avoid any more riots , keep our nation safe , promote positive behavior and secure the blessings of debt - free liberty to ourselves and our great - great - great grandchildren , hereby try one more time to ordain and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally whiny , guilt - ridden delusional and other liberal , commie , pinko bedwetters .
We hold these truths to be self - evident , that a whole lot of people were confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they require a Bill of No Rights .
ARTICLE I : You do not have the right to a new car , big screen TV or any other form of wealth .
More power to you if you can legally acquire them , but no one is guaranteeing anything .
ARTICLE II :
You do not have the right to never be offended .
This country is based on freedom , and that means freedom for everyone - not just you !
You may leave the room , turn the channel , express a different opinion , etc. , but the World is full of idiots , and probably always will be .
ARTICLE III :
You do not have the right to be free from harm .
If you stick a screwdriver in your eye , learn to be more careful , do not expect the tool manufacturer to make you and all your relatives independently wealthy .
ARTICLE IV :
You do not have the right to free food and housing .
Americans are the most charitable people to be found , and will gladly help anyone in need , but we are quickly growing weary of subsidizing generation after generation of professional couch potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another generation of professional couch potatoes .
ARTICLE V : You do not have the right to free health care .
That would be nice , but from the looks of public housing , we 're just not interested in health care .
ARTICLE VI : You do not have the right to physically harm other people .
If you kidnap , rape , intentionally maim or kill someone , do n't be surprised if the rest of us want to see you fry in the electric chair .
ARTICLE VII :
You do not have the right to the possessions of others .
If you rob , cheat or coerce away the goods or services of other citizens , do n't be surprised if the rest of us get together and lock you away in a place where you still wo n't have the right to a big - screen color TV or a life of leisure .
ARTICLE VII :
You do n't have the right to demand that our children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching conscience .
We hate oppressive governments and wo n't lift a finger to stop you from going to fight if you 'd like .
However , we do not enjoy parenting the entire world and do not want to spend so much of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military uniform and a funny hat .
ARTICLE VIII :
You do n't have the right to a job .
All of us sure want all of you to have one , and will gladly help you along in hard times , but we expect you to take advantage of the opportunities of education and vocational training laid before you to make yourself useful .
ARTICLE X : You do not have the right to happiness .
Being an American means that you have the right to pursue happiness - which by the way , is a lot easier if you are unencumbered by an overabundance of idiotic laws created by those of you who were confused by the Bill of Rights .
So what 's the deal with biodynamic wine ?
Demeter , a biodynamic - certifying organization , claims that " it is the highest paradigm of sustainable farming , " and many retailers have reported increased consumer interest in biodynamic beverages .
Critics of the process say that it's a fad rooted in bad science and voodoo .
While biodynamic farmers use many of the same ecofriendly methods as organic farmers , they must also prepare mysterious concoctions in bull horns and cow intestines .
Recently a couple of curious reporters tackled the subject : Joe Eskenazi investigates the industry in SF Weekly , and Joel Stein takes a few good - natured gibes in Sierra .
Share your thoughts :
Have you tried biodynamic wine ?
How does it compare with organic or traditional wine ?
How many ways can you make a simple wooden bench ?
More than you may have thought .
Some of these emphasize artistic execution over functional stability .
Others take ideas of function to the absolute extreme , being designed to seat a specific number in a particular way , to rock , roll , wheel and more .
From artful to artisan , tentacled to transforming , here are fourteen wonderful and weird wooden benches and unique ( post ) modern bench designs .
Have a seat and enjoy !
It has happened to everyone : you walk up to a bench , really want to take a seat , but sure enough it is soaking wet from rain earlier in the day .
There is nothing to be done … right ?
Wrong , if you are dealing with The Rolling Bench – specifically engineered so the simple twist of a handle brings back up the dry side .
A different kind of rolling bench entirely , this outdoor wheelbarrow bench moves with you .
Take it and twist it to face into or away from the sun , move it from your garden to your front lawn , and all without calling a friend to help you with the heavy lifting .
At the other end of the spectrum , this artistic meta - bench may not be the most useful to have around – make up of interlocking chair forms and backless in most places – but it sure is interesting to look at .
The artist even managed to align the wood grains throughout the entire meticulous composition .
Amazing .
Also on the artful end of the bench spectrum , this tentacle bench appears to have a will of its own .
The slats on the otherwise standard - looking wood bench design take on lives of their own at their ends and begin to move out , grow and climb up along an adjacent wall like ivy – a perfect ( ly strange ) entryway or hall bench .
We all know about folding chairs , but few of them fold all the way into a backless bench .
Cushions could help make this smoothly curved bench - and - chair structure a bit more comfortable but they may also detract from the sleek aesthetic that makes this such a lovely product in either of its transformed states .
Not sure if you really want to talk to the person who happens to sit down next to you on a bench ?
No worries : you can just detach your half of this wooden bench and move it a bit to the side .
This bidirectional rocking bench works on so many levels : it rocks back and forth from either side , could likely accommodate a relatively comfortable sleeper if it were padded and could even be at the center of a ( likely very dangerous ) teeter - totter game .
If the break - apart bench does not provide sufficient solitude this one - person bench is sure to fit the bill .
It certainly looks absurd with the extended back that has no seat but is all the more stable for it .
Alternatively , start by yourself and seat more as they come with the FlexibleLove super - bench .
Composed of plywood and structured like an accordion , this remarkable design is transformable and configurable , portible and pragmatic , blending modern elegance with simple style and effective engineering .
One of the classic problems of the fixed outdoor bench is , of course , its very immobility .
One solution is to create benches facing each of two ways but still keep them aligned to the grid .
This solution is only partial , however , and is also not conducive to potentially spontaneous interactions .
The best of all worlds , the twisting artistic bench above transforms along its length to accommodate all kinds of interesting configurations .
This bench does not transform , is not plush and cushioned , curved or adjustable – it is simply a remarkable work of bench design integrating simple materials to create a slick form that also accommodates a planter .
As the renderings show , it can be lined up with others but is almost more elegant alone .
What appears to be a simple interior coffee table clad in wood extends to become a table - and - bench with well - matched colors to seat additional guests while the transformed wings can still play coffee - table roles on the side .
Want to create your own bench ?
These architects took the liberty of simply tacking together a bunch of chairs – tying them together with a long , single wooden board .
Sure , all of the legs in the finished product may or may not reach the ground but that is what old magazines are for , right ?
Even easier : create your own bench with what must be the most straightforward DIY bench design in the world , the log bench : a log , braced with doorstops , that has existing chair backs stuck in as needed along its top .
It creates a statement with relatively few materials but you might want to remove the chair backs to roll / move it .
Stress is a term that causes anxiety and it is usually connected with nervous tension and fatigue .
The workplace is one of the major contributors of stress for all people .
Despite the reasons that can cause stress , there are quick and easy ways to manage stress at work and become more productive .
This article outlines 12 methods you can follow to manage and relief your self from stress those difficult days at work .
12 Ways to manage stress at work
1. Give up your coffee
Coffee flows in your blood , this is the problem .
The caffeine is like wet stress that flows in your veins .
It increases the production of adrenaline and simultaneously it prevents the production of adenosine , a natural sedative for your brain .
«Blocking the caffeine from your daily habits is the most effective strategy to reduce stress as far as I know , ” says David B. Posen , stress expert and author of Always Change a Losing Game .
Posen supports the fact that 75 % of decaffeinated coffee patients feel more relaxed and more active at work , mainly due to better sleep .
For more information about coffee , you can read
The real truth about the myth of coffee .
2. Get Organized
Who is the greatest ally of stress in the office ?
Organization .
« It is what is needed most and there is none » says David Allen , author of Getting Things Done : The Art of Stress - Free Productivity .
Even a very basic organizational habit saves you many hours of practical work in the week – and certainly more time means less stress .
The favourite and most useful habit of Allen is at the end of the week : « It is the outcome of the whole week .
I am looking my messages and the list of my obligations .
It is by far the most fruitful time of the week » .
One hour every Friday and Allen is never tired or stressed the Monday morning .
3. Observe yourself
Did you develop a hunch because of the keyboard and you feel that your shoulders are very tight ?
Probably you will not understand this until you stop for a moment and think about it .
Who has time to stop and think when everybody around you shouts « come on , come on » as the hysterical Cheerleading of hell ?
Researchers in America found that the stress level actually dropped for 54 % of people who followed a two months program on “ how to learn to observe your self ” – i.e. simple observation of the symptoms of stress , such as tense muscles and quick and dispersed thinking .
The good news is that you do not need to get into the program for two months .
« Minor changes offer spectacular results , ” said Kimberley Williams , author of the study .
You should observe whether your thoughts are too fast or if you are not breathing deeply .
4. Stretching in front of your PC
When we are stressed , we tend to lean forward in order to focus our attention on what we do .
This makes the small muscles of the throat and back to work overtime .
For a quick relief , cross your fingers behind your neck and push your shoulders backwards so that they come closer .
Then leave your head to fall forward and your chin to touch your sternum .
Bring your elbows in front and join them .
Push your hands down for a few seconds and then relax .
Repeat the same exercise 6 - 8 times every time you feel tension .
5 . Use multi-vitamins
In a recent study in Britain between males from 18 - 42 years , researchers found that those who took daily multi-vitamins rich in vitamin C and B reduced the stress experienced by 21 % .
Moreover , men who took the multi-vitamin were less tired and more attentive than those who did not .
The survey showed that vitamins B and C help to alleviate the effects of stress .
6 . Take 5 - minute breaks for a good laugh
Humour and laughter play a very important role in reducing and managing stress .
Laughter reduces blood stress hormones such as adrenaline , the cortisone , the epinephrine and dopamine , while increasing the levels of hormones that promote health such as Endorphin and neurotransmitter .
The psychological and physical relaxation that laughter gives us is known .
It takes the attention away from things that cause anger , guilt , stress and other negative emotions .
It allows us to see difficult situations with a fresh perspective , more like a challenge rather than as a threat .
At the social level , laughter and humour , create links and better relations with other people .
Also , because laughter is contagious , when we laugh we are helping others in our environment to laugh more , which can have positive implications on many levels .
Improving the mood of others who are with us through the laughter and humour , not only reduces their stress level but also ours .
7 . Do not forget your successes
Take a note of your successes at work by creating a folder with information to which you can look at any time .
This will help you in the future to avoid the negative reflections of the type « I will not manage to do this and that … ” it will also give you motivation when you are ready to look for another job .
8 . Do not become an “ email slave ”
Do not let e-mails to distract your attention .
When this happens it is difficult to concentrate again and go back to work .
Try to check your e-mail at specified intervals and not all the time .
9 . Free you mind
After an intense concentration let for a moment your mind free .
Allow yourself to dream for a couple of minutes .
Think of parties or where you want to go for holidays .
10 .
Do not eat lunch while working
Take a break for lunch .
Do not eat your lunch while you work .
If you eat under pressure then most likely you will suffer from indigestion or flatulence .
11 . Get some fresh air
Find time for fresh air , even if they choke you , and even if the phones are hitting ceaselessly .
Get a few minutes to get out of the air - conditioned workspace and breath some fresh air .
12 . Sleep is vital for your work performance
Do not stay up late every day .
Lack of sleep reduces your energy and has an impact on your performance at work .
You should get at least 7 hours of sleep every night .
8 Consequences of work stress
Proven research showed that work stress can have the following consequences :
1 . The intense pressure and stressed experienced by workers increases the risk for heart attacks .
2 . Work stress proved an important factor , which favours the occurrence of myocardial infarction .
3 . Men were 80 % more likely to suffer a heart attack if they had conflicts or problems in their work during the 12 months of the investigation .
4 . In women , taking more responsibility at work , especially when these responsibilities are often perceived negatively and causing increased stress have 3 times more changes to experience a cardiac episode .
For men , the situation , have multiplied the risk of a heart attack by 6 times .
5. Approximately 8 % of patients had a significant episode related to their work 24 hours before the onset of a stroke .
6 . The emotional intensity in patients due to the pressure to meet a deadline , deliver a project or work increased by 6 times the risk of having a heart attack in the next 24 hours .
7 . The worsening of the economic situation increased the risk of heart attacks for women by 3 times .
8 . The competitive situation in the workplace increased the risk of a heart attack by 2 times .
Investigations are under way at the Jewish centre and other sites India has summoned Pakistan 's high commissioner to lodge a formal protest over the attacks in Mumbai .
Indian officials have repeatedly said in recent days there is evidence the militants behind attacks that killed nearly 200 people had Pakistani links .
Islamabad has denied involvement and warned against letting " miscreants " inflame tensions in the region .
India 's new home minister has vowed to " respond with determination and resolve " over the crisis .
See a detailed map of the area
At least 188 people were killed - including 22 foreigners - and more than 200 were injured after the attackers opened fire in several locations , including a railway station , a popular restaurant , a hospital , two hotels and a Jewish centre .
The attacks on the two hotels - the once luxurious Taj Mahal Palace and Oberoi - Trident - and the Jewish centre resulted in nearly three days of running battles between elite commandos and the gunmen before the sites were secured .
' Avoid blame game '
India 's foreign ministry said it had summoned Pakistan 's high commissioner .
" He was informed that the recent terrorist attack on Mumbai was carried out by elements from Pakistan , " the ministry said in a statement .
India " expects that strong action would be taken against those elements , whosoever they may be , responsible for this outrage , " the high commissioner was reportedly told .
A spokesman for the Pakistani high commission played down the meeting , saying discussions were held in a " cordial atmosphere " .
But there is no doubt India is slowly turning the heat on Pakistan following the attacks , the BBC's India correspondent Sanjoy Majumder says .
Following the attacks , the focus is on the lone gunman who survived and who is now in police custody .

In pictures : Mumbai aftermath According to Indian media reports , Azam Amir Qasab is from Pakistan and linked to the Pakistan - based Kashmiri militant group , Lashkar - e - Toiba , or Army of the Pure .
The group denies involvement .
India 's Deputy Home Minister , Shakeel Ahmad , told the BBC it was " very clearly established " that all the attackers had been from Pakistan - echoing similar comments from other officials in recent days .
Indian Minister of State of External Affairs Anand Sharma called the attacks a " grave setback " to the normalisation of relations with Pakistan .
Pakistan 's Prime Minister , Syed Yousuf Raza Gilani , has said his country " would itself take action against the miscreants if there is any evidence against a Pakistani national " .
But he cautioned India against making allegations in the media .
" The blame game should be avoided at all costs as ( it ) may affect the state of relations between the two countries , " he said .
The White House says it has heard nothing to suggest the Pakistani government was involved .
" We have been encouraged by the statements by the Pakistanis that they are committed to following this wherever it leads , " spokeswoman Dana Perino said .
" We would expect nothing less of them in this instance . "
' Deep shock ' Indian Home Minister Palaniappan Chidambaram vowed to take action over the attacks .

How Mumbai attacks unfolded Victims from all walks of life " I want to assure the people on behalf of the government that we will respond with determination and resolve to the grave threat posed to the Indian nation , " he told reporters .
" I recognise that there is a sense of anguish and deep shock among the people of India .
This is a threat to the very idea of India , very soul of India . "
The government is facing growing anger over its handling of the attacks and perceived intelligence failures .
Maharashtra state 's chief minister on Monday joined his deputy and Mr Chidambaram 's predecessor in resigning over the attacks .
According to reports , the personal belongings of 15 men were found aboard an abandoned ship from which the attacks were launched .
This has raised questions as to whether all the gunmen have been found .
Only 10 militants have been identified , but , according to a private TV channel , Azam Amir Qasab apparently confirmed there were 15 attackers .

Eyewitness : Mumbai survivors Questions have also been asked about India 's failure to pre-empt the attacks , and the time taken to eliminate the gunmen .
A report in the Hindustani Times newspaper said a militant from Lashkar - e - Toiba arrested and questioned in February told intelligence services he had inspected the five - star Taj Mahal Palace and Oberoi - Trident hotels and several other buildings in December 2007 .
Quoted by his interrogator , the militant said he had passed on information to the group 's operational commander .
Also , Reuters news agency quoted Damodar Tandel , head of Maharashtra 's main fishermen 's union , as saying he had warned the government about attempts to bring RDX explosives to Mumbai by sea but no - one acted on the information .
Unlike other countries that have been the victims of frequent terrorist attacks , India has no discernible or coherent counter - terrorism strategy that focuses both on the causes of the threat and its prevention , the BBC 's defence and security correspondent Rob Watson says .
Prime Minister Manmohan
Singh is reported to have said he plans to increase the size and strength of the country 's anti-terrorist forces .

Cowed by a US congressman and Texas state legislators who warned of funding cut -offs , the El Paso City Council has reversed last week 's unanimous vote to call for a national debate on drug legalization as part of a resolution supporting its sister city , Ciudad Juárez , which has been plagued by prohibition - related violence .
A motion to override Mayor John Cook 's veto of that resolution last week failed Tuesday , with the council voting 4 - 4 .
Six votes were needed to override the veto .
Beto O'Rourke
Last week 's resolution had called on the federal government to take a number of non-controversial steps to aid Ciudad Juárez and Mexico in dealing with violence , such as clamping down on gun-running and money - laundering .
But as the council debated the resolution , South - West Rep. Beto O'Rourke introduced an amendment calling for an " honest , open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics . "
The council then voted unanimously to approve the amended resolution .
And stepped into a firestorm as the vote drew national attention .
O'Rourke appeared on CNN's Lou Dobbs program , only to be pilloried by the pseudo - populist demagogue .
Mayor Cook , meanwhile , was mobilizing support for his veto , and denigrating anyone who supported the resolution as " pot heads . "
The resolution also came under fire from Congressman Silvestre Reyes ( D ) , who represents the city in Washington .
In a Tuesday letter to the council , Reyes warned that the city could lose federal funding if it passed the resolution .
" While this resolution is well - intentioned , I believe its passage would be counterproductive to our efforts to enact an ambitious legislative agenda at the federal level , " wrote the former Border Patrol supervisor .
" As our nation faces one of the worst economic crises since the Great Depression , Congress is currently drafting an economic stimulus package in which El Paso stands to benefit .
This is where our focus must be at this critical time , and it is important that our message reflect priorities that will provide real gains for the community . "
The city 's state legislative delegation also spoke out against the resolution .
In a Monday letter to the council , the five state House members who represent El Paso in Austin issued the same sort of extortionate warning that Reyes did a day later .
" There will be state agencies , state legislators , and others in state government who will see this resolution as the City of El Paso supporting the legalization of drugs , " the letter read .
" Funding for local law enforcement efforts and other important programs to our community are likely being put in jeopardy , especially during a time when state revenues are scarce .
We understand your stated goal is to bring attention to the problems that illegal drugs cause in our community and society .
However , the position to ask the federal government to legalize narcotics does not bring the right attention to El Paso .
It says 'we give up and we do n't care . ' "
The message from Reyes and the state legislators was clear :
Shut up about even thinking about debating drug legalization or it will cost you .
On Tuesday , the El Paso city council showed it could not stand up to that sort of political hardball , but it was quite a session .
( Thanks to El Paso 's Newspaper Tree web site for all quotes below . )
While the council members were careful to be diplomatic toward each other and the mayor , it was clear that some of them mightily resented being blackmailed .
" I personally do n't support the legalization of narcotics , but I also do n't support limiting debate , " city Rep. Eddie Holguin said .
" Debate is healthy , I feel .
I believe that self - censoring ourselves is wrong , and we should n't trample on the Constitution and the people 's right to free speech . "
" I want to commend Rep. O'Rourke for being so courageous , " said city Rep. Rachel Quintana .
" That is the only word that I can think of because the ridicule that you have faced . "
Quintana said that while her constituents appeared split on the matter , the letters from Reyes and the state delegation " absolutely pushed me over . "
" If we had voted yesterday , I would have voted in favor of it , " said Rep. Emma Acosta , who also cited the threatening letters as her reason for changing her vote .
Rep .
Holguin said the threatened price was too high .
" When you receive calls and you have both members of the state and federal level telling you that you might lose funding for projects that are of vital importance for El Paso then you know you have to stop and think , " he said .
But he congratulated O'Rourke for getting national attention and getting the conversation started .
" In that respect , I think you were successful , and I do n't regret supporting the resolution the way that it passed .
It 's just unfortunate the way that it was portrayed , and at this point , I can't jeopardize funding from the state or the federal level . "
Rep . Steve Ortega , who voted to override the veto , was angered by the heavy - handed interventions and said the resolution was necessary .
" We 've had 50 patients at Thomason ( Hospital ) , and had a handful of kidnappings in this past year related to drugs , " he said .
" We 've had local business that have been threatened and extorted for money based on some events in Mexico ...
You have possibility of a failed state and failed city and more death and destruction along this business community .
That to me , you can't put a cost on , whether it is federal funding or state funding .
I ask us to ask ourselves what is the cost of that . "
Turning to the intervention of Reyes and the state legislators , Ortega issued a challenge : " I also want to ask our state legislators and our US congressman to openly name anybody who is threatening the city of El Paso with withholding funding for having dialogue , " Ortega said .
" That is un-American , and that is in contravention to our First Amendment .
So I 'm going to stand with the action that we took last Tuesday .
There is to me nothing wrong with having a debate and a dialogue .
If we are silent on this matter , the prospects for the future of this community are placed in danger .
And I 'm not going to stand here idly and listen to unnamed legislators threaten us for having a dialogue over the future of this community . "
" I think it 's unfortunate how this came about , but that 's life and that 's politics , " said Rep. O'Rourke .
" I will also say that the threat from Congressman Reyes , then articulated again by our House delegation at the state level is unfortunate , but it 's having its desired effect , which is to chill discussion .
And I want to be clear , I have not heard a specific funding amount that is being threatened to be withheld .
I have n't heard a specific congressman or senator who has threatened to withhold that money , just vague , unspecific threats that should we have the courage of our convictions , money will be withheld from this community . "
O'Rourke reminded the council that the city is suing the federal government over its proposed border wall .
" If the federal government had come back and said we 'll withhold funding from your community if you continue with this lawsuit , would this council fold on this lawsuit ? " he said .
" If our very principled position on undocumented immigration and on the Minutemen were challenged by the federal government , and we were told we were going to lose our funding if we continued with our position , would we fold ?
It 's not just this issue .
It sets a precedent that when debate is to be chilled , when positions are to be changed , people higher up will threaten us that we 'll lose our money , and you have to ask yourselves if you can live with that . "
As the council prepared to vote , O'Rourke concluded his remarks .
" All we 're asking for is a conversation , and no important issue in the history of the United States , social , criminal legal or otherwise has ever been harmed by having an open discussion .
That 's all we 're asking for today .
I hope the original resolution and the mayor 's veto is overridden . "
This time it was n't .
But the forces of suppression and intolerance have shown their true colors , and national attention has been drawn to the issue despite them .

Dear Free Software Supporter ,
Our community has made enormous progress in creating tools that enhance communication and freedom — with profound effect on people 's lives .
Free software has become a model for how our society can progress collaboratively , and members of our community are at the forefront in expressing these ideals .
Advocacy , diplomacy , and education are a vital part of the work the Free Software Foundation does for the free software community — but to clear a path for free software adoption , our work has to also reach beyond this community .
We reach a wider audience with important campaigns on related ethical issues , such as Defective By Design — our campaign to eliminate DRM , which has had a profound effect on the way people look at digital restrictions on music , games , electronic books and video .
And as web applications and other network services become increasingly popular and convenient , we are working to ensure that computer users are not asked to give up their freedom in order to use them .
Our release of the GNU Affero General Public License and ongoing discussions with the autonomo.us group represent a solid foundation to tackle this issue and help our community further develop free software alternatives for the benefit of society .
Today , there are many questions that the free software community needs to tackle —
Does your employer or school require you to use Microsoft software ?
Are you required to use proprietary formats to interact with your bank or local government ?
Are your children being trained to use Microsoft or Apple rather than learning how to be in control of the computers they use ?
As advocates for free software , we can challenge the status quo and so - called convenience of using the invasive tools of proprietary software companies , because the opportunities for change have never been better :
The Free Software Foundation through its End Software Patents ( ESP ) campaign filed an amicus brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( CAFC ) in their en banc hearing of in re Bilski — http://endsoftpatents.org/bilski — the Bilski ruling gutted , if not technically overturned , the State Street ruling that in 1998 opened the floodgates to the patenting of business methods and software .
The vast bulk of software patents that have been used to threaten developers writing software for GNU / Linux distributions running on general purpose computers has in theory been swept away .
The Bilski ruling undoubtedly represents a breakthrough for free software and a success for our campaign , and with this ruling we are on the path to lowering the threats that institutions face when considering adopting free software .
Completely free distributions like the FSF - sponsored gNewSense are now viable , something that just a few years ago seemed far out of reach .
Our work with SGI earlier this year means that 3D graphics acceleration can finally be achieved with free software and gNewSense .
The relaunch of our High Priority Projects list highlights that the proprietary software for which there is currently no free alternative and that users feel forced to use is dwindling and being tackled aggressively .
Hardware manufacturers friendly to free software have given us the first free software smartphone , the Neo FreeRunner .
The OLPC project gave us the first free software laptop , the XO , that has quickly established the low - cost subnotebook marketplace — where the economics have made GNU / Linux a popular choice .
And for the past few months , FSF systems administrators have been working on the forthcoming free software friendly Lemote laptop , which Richard Stallman is using and that we hope will be widely commercially available .
The availability of free software friendly hardware has never been greater .
The FSF has been campaigning for free and open formats and standards .
Our free audio and video codecs campaign has been winning hearts and minds , and Mozilla 's Firefox web browser will soon carry native support for Ogg , giving us an unprecedented opportunity to promote free codecs .
Our campaign alongside many partners for OpenDocument Format ( ODF ) and against Microsoft 's OOXML has been successful , with many countries adopting pro-ODF policies .
We celebrated the 25th anniversary of the GNU Project this year with a breakthrough film from the English comedian Stephen Fry , who gave us an important reminder of the alternative vision for the technology we use , a vision where people do n't trade freedom for convenience but instead support development of tools that create a better society .
More than 1 million people have watched the film and it has been translated into 32 languages .
Combined , these breakthroughs are important because they give us an opportunity to put aside the claims of convenience that are used to promote the monopolists ' pervasive tools , and ask important questions of our employer .
Why are we using this proprietary software that locks us to this vendor when we could be using free software that would give us control ?
It gives us the chance to demand open government .
Why is it , that my local government is forcing me to purchase one vendor 's software to access public records , when there are free formats that we can use that work with free software ?
And why does this school accept corporate donations of proprietary software that come with handcuffs on my child 's education , rather than use free software that will give my child the opportunity to be in control of the technology she is learning to use ?
Support us now in our big push to move these questions and more to the forefront in 2009 — become a member or make a donation .
Yours ,

Today we have a very special presentation for you .
ThinkGeek , known far and wide for their wonderful geek gear , has been extremely secretive about their inner workings .
That is … until now .
Geeks
Are Sexy was given exclusive access to the ThinkGeek headquarters in Fairfax , Virginia and sat down with John Frazier , one of the men responsible for procuring everything from lightsabers to high - tech peripherals .
Enough introduction , though , enjoy the show !
This video is actually the tale end of a very long and interesting story .
If you ’d like to know more ( like how we broke through the binary curtain ) , I have a few reflections and recollections on my blog .
Plus , there ’s a bonus lightsaber video — who can resist that ?
I would like to thank John , Shane , and all the other ThinkGeek staff who put up with us as we traipsed through their office with cameras and cables .
Oh and a special shout - out to the ThinkGeek Twitter lady !
You guys are the coolest company I ’ve ever visited !
Lastly , thanks to Natalia , my awesome camera person , and all the future journalists at Connect2 Mason , whose equipment we used to make the film .

I also used Starbucks espresso beans ( lightly ground so that I could sprinkle over the brownies rather than set the beans in rows ) , the instant espresso powder and the Kahlua .
I added some slivered almonds on top just because I like brownies with nuts .
We all found this brownie to be too dry ( even with high altitude adjustment ) , too flat , too heavy and too strong .
I have other brownie recipes that I use Kahlua in that I might incorperate a lesser amount of the espresso and beans into to experiment .
I like the coffee ingredients but found this recipie just too overpowering and the cake not particularly enjoyable .
I hope you liked 2008 .
Because you 're going to get an extra 0.0000031689 % of it today .
That is , on top of the leap day we had on February 29 , there 's a leap second getting added tonight .
2008 is the year that keeps on giving .
We have leap days because the length of the Earth 's day is n't an even fraction of the year , and we add a day in every fours years to help even it out ( though in reality it 's a LOT more complicated than that ) .
But why do we add a single second ?
OK , fair warning : this simple question will lead you down a maze of twisty passages all of which look alike .
But first off , for those impatient readers , here 's the simple answer : the length of the day based on the Earth 's spin changes , but the length of the day based on atomic clocks does n't , so every now and again we have to adjust them to make them match , adding in a second to align them better .
However , that 's no fun .
Jumping into the gory details ; that 's fun .
And you know I love this stuff , so let 's take a closer look .
A much closer look .
There are a zillion ways to measure time .
In our daily lives we have the day , the year , the second .
The first two are based on actual events : the rotation of the Earth , and the time it takes to go around the Sun ( and , of course , the closer you look at them , the more fiercely complicated they get , too ) .
The " second " , though , is arbitrary ; it 's a human - designed length of time .
We made it up .
In general , you can think of a second as being 1/86,400 ^th of a day .
But scientists do n't like to do that ; for one thing , it 's not sciencey enough .
For another , the length of the day changes .
[ UPDATE :
What I wrote below is technically correct , but I decided to be a little more detailed in a followup post .
Please read that when you finish this . ]
If the Earth were a solid body with nothing nearby , it would merrily spin at the same rate forever .
But it 's not alone : the Moon and Sun are breathing down our necks , so to speak .
The gravity of these two guys pulls on the Earth , stretching it and messing with its rotation ( again , it 's complicated , but fascinating ) .
If the Earth were a solid sphere , the slowing caused by the Sun and Moon would be constant .
However , the Earth is layered in solid and liquid and sorta - kinda - liquid sections ( the mantle is more like a thick plastic than a liquid ) , and these change how the Earth spins .
Instead of gradually slowing down , the rate jumps and skips .
Even earthquakes can change the Earth 's rotation ; the huge seismic event in December 2004 that caused the tsunami in Indonesia shortened the length of the Earth 's day by about 3 microseconds .
That ai n't much , sure , but it happened , and was measurable .
Even weather affects the Earth 's rotation !
Obviously , the length of the day is not the best standard of measurement to use for time if you want to be really anal and get out to the tenth decimal place .
That 's why scientists decades ago changed the basic unit from the day to the second , and then decided to base the length of the second on something that wo n't change over time .
What they needed was a cosmic metronome , and light itself is a good one .
It 's a wave , so it has a frequency -- how many wavecrests pass through a point in space every second .
If you 're on the beach , and a wave crashes ashore twice per minute , then it has a frequency of once every 30 seconds , or 1/30 = 0.0333 .
We can flip that definition over , and instead of saying the frequency of some wavelength of light is how many crests pass a point in space every second , we say the unit of time called the second is when a given number of wavecrests pass by that point in space .
There 's nothing magic here ; it 's just a definition .
So let 's do that .
We need a really solidly stable wavelength we can measure .
It turns out that a cesium atom gives us just that .
The outer electron in a normal cesium - 133 atom will sometimes spontaneously flip over , in a sense swapping north and south poles .
This is called the hyperfine transition , for those keeping notes at home .
When the electron does that , it gives off a very specific wavelength of light ( in the microwave region with a wavelength of roughly 3 centimeters ) .
That corresponds to a frequency of 9,192,631,770 wavecrests per second .
Since cesium atom electron spin-flips are so very precise , we can measure them very accurately , and use them as a basis for our clocks ( and when you hear the term " atomic clock " , that 's what it means ) .
All we have to do is invert our measurement , and then say :
One standard second is the length of time corresponding to 9,192,631,770 periods of the radiation emitted by the hyperfine transition of an unionized cesium atom in the ground state .
Woohoo !
OK , sure , that sounds complicated , but it 's actually very precise and measurable and scientists get all charged up about it .
All you have to do is nod your head and accept it .
The bottom line is , we have a very precise definition of what a second is , and it 's not based on the Earth 's messy spin .
This definition was ratified in 1967 during the Thirteenth General Conference on Weights and Measures .
Yes , there 's a meeting for that .
I can imagine all the scientists and engineers sitting around during talks at that conference constantly checking their watches .
That image makes me smile .
So anyway , now we 're finally ready to understand why we have leap seconds !
We have the superprecise scientific definition of a second , and we have the sloppy one we use in everyday life based on the Earth 's spin .
But the Earth 's spin is changing !
On average it 's slowing down , and that difference builds up .
[ Do n't forget to read my followup post ! ]
Eventually , when the difference between the day measured by the Earth 's rotation and the one based on the cesium atom gets to be more than 0.9 seconds , a leap second is added in to the day to match them up better .
Tadaaa !
The last time this was done was in December 2005 , and it 's happening tonight .
That means that officially , we get the following weird sequence of events :
The official clock will be ticking tonight , counting down to the New Year .
Just before midnight it will read 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds .
But instead of clicking over to 00 hours 00 minutes 00 seconds on January 1 , it will first read 11 hours 59 minutes 60 seconds on December 31 !
Weird .
Imagine your bedside alarm clock going from 11:59 to 11:60 for one second before flipping over to 12:00 and you 'll get the idea .
So that 's the tale of the leap second .
Ironically , if you 've read this far , you 've blown several minutes of your life , and the extra second tonight wo n't make up for it .
But now you know why you get that extra second , and you can savor it .
Take an extra sip of champagne , or kiss that Significant Other a moment longer , or just take 9,192,631,770 oscillations of a cesium - 133's atom to ponder what 2009 will be like ... even if the coming year is a wee bit shorter than this one .
My , how time flies .

Whatever emotions or anxiety Mr. Obama feels as his candidacy draws to a close , he displays little of it , either in public appearances or private conversations with his close advisers .
The air of confidence he exudes , which some critics take as arrogance , grew in part out of the primary , when he worked to avoid perceptions that he was weak or not ready .
But now , he is described by friends as feeling as though he has been thoroughly tested and is prepared to take on the job he has spent 22 months fighting for .
Still , it is hard for even those closest to Mr. Obama to fathom what these days are precisely like , even for the unflappable — often inscrutable — senator from Illinois .
His world is awash in powerful , conflicting emotions : the realization , presumably , that he may be about to become president ; the huge optimism that he has unleashed , evident in the crowds he is drawing ( and something he has told aides worries him a bit , given the expectations set for him ) ; the weighty thinking he is gradually giving to how he would staff a government and deal with a transition in such a difficult time .
All of this is taking place as a woman who played a large role in raising him , his grandmother , is approaching death .
“ ‘ What if I disappoint people ? ’ ” Valerie Jarrett , a close friend and adviser , recalled Mr. Obama asking at several points throughout the campaign .
“ That ’s what gives him the energy to keep getting up every day . ”
It has been months since Mr. Obama has ventured with any regularity to the back of his plane where the journalists sit .
( The one time he played the board game “ Taboo ” on a cross-country flight to Oregon is a distant memory . )
A reporter shouted to Mr. Obama on Sunday as he climbed the steps of his airplane here , headed for Ohio , to ask why Mr. Obama had not held a news conference in weeks .
“ I will , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ On Wednesday . ”
On a final weekend pass through electoral battlegrounds that spanned three time zones , the electoral climate and his campaign organization provide him the luxury of focusing on states that favored the Republican ticket four years ago .
But when his Democratic crowds jeer at the mere mention of Senator John McCain , he offers a gentle scolding , “ You do n’t need to boo , you just need to vote . ”

If I proposed a constitutional amendment prohibiting Catholics from marrying in California , would n't it be appropriate to label me a bigot ?
If I helped form a coalition to promote that goal and used my power to urged those who trusted me to vote against Catholic civil marriage , should n't I expect that Catholics would express anger ?
Would it matter to Catholics that many might call me " a loving person " or that I mouthed the values of " tolerance , respect and trust " while denying others equality under the law ?
If my efforts were successful , could I reasonably expect Catholics whose rights were abolished by my actions to " move on " ?
San Francisco Catholic Archbishop George Niederauer is a member of a minority religion which has historically been discriminated against in America .
Now he has used his power and influence to take a basic civil right away from another minority .
He should not be surprised to be labeled a bigot .

We 're to blame
Editor - Voters rightfully lack confidence that the governor and legislators cannot fix California 's growing budget catastrophe , but they unwittingly share much of the blame .
As long as they believe that they need not pay the taxes necessary to support such vital functions as public education , health , safety and transportation , the structural deficit begun by their passage of Proposition 13 in 1978 will only continue to compound .

Pay with pride
Editor -
To the Republican legislators who are adamantly opposed to taxes : California , like all states , municipalities , businesses and families , does not run on air .
Also , it 's patriotic to support your state .
Many of those who think of taxes as a burden , also encourage young people to sacrifice time and comfort , risking life and health , for their country .
Surely , they can encourage the people who have benefited from this great state to enthusiastically support it , especially if they have prospered enough to buy expensive cars and yachts .
They should be proud to be able to do their share .
As for helping the poor , the Bible and all religions and systems of ethics repeat that it is a great virtue to help the less fortunate .
We all know it 's moral and decent .
It is better to give than to receive , and it feels wonderful .

It is becoming increasingly apparent that the main function of the University of California system is not top quality and affordable education , but enrichment of its highest management .
The system 's practices , including double - dipping and hiring without open advertising or a job search , make it not unlike some major corporations with obscene top - level salaries .
The students are forced to pay ever - increasing tuition costs to fund these practices and salaries .
My son once proudly attended the University of California .
Today , I would strongly urge him to look elsewhere .

After reading the recent articles regarding the ludicrous and elitist buyouts that the UC Grand Poobahs have given their amigos and amigas , I hereby challenge each and every recipient , starting with Linda Morris Williams , to donate all the those golden parachutes back to the UC system in the form of scholarships for needy students .
I dare you .

Let in the light
Editor - The Legislative Counsel of California collects important data about bills introduced in California and how our legislators vote , but the public is not allowed access to this data in a database format , which would allow for searching , analysis and more transparency .
This makes no sense .
We , the public , paid to assemble this information , and the California government should make this database public .
MAPLight.org and the California First Amendment Coalition are suing the Legislative Counsel to give the public access to this data in electronic database format .
I hope that the state wakes up to its public responsibility for public access .

The photo of Billy the Asian elephant alone in his miserable enclosure at the Los Angeles Zoo is an absolute tragedy ( " Fight over habitat for elephants heats up , " Dec. 3 ) .
Lonely , aimless , solely there to make money for his owners and to provide entertainment for people .
This situation is cruel in the extreme .
Elephants are group animals , and I 'll wager the ones that have died at early ages at Los Angeles Zoo have done so because they had nothing to live for .
Of course , he should go to a sanctuary - and very soon .
There are many things for people to do in the way of being entertained , other than watching a magnificent creature in a totally unnatural environment dying from depression .

Support for Israel
Editor - Khaled Galal ( Letters , Dec. 4 ) is critical of President - elect Barack Obama 's appointment of Sen.
Hillary Clinton as secretary of state because during her presidential campaign , Clinton gave her unwavering support to Israel .
Galal notes that Clinton said , the United States " will never pressure Israel to make unilateral concessions . "
Well , what 's wrong with that ?
Why should Israel compromise its well - being to a democratically elected Hamas government that has pledged to obliterate it ?
Can you imagine America or European nations making unilateral concessions to a government which has vowed to destroy it ?
Galal is also implicitly critical of Clinton 's statement that the United States " stands with Israel now and forever . "
Does n't that make sense ?
Israel has proven to be the sole consistent friend of our country in the Middle East .

Nothing but a tax

The city that knows how would make a grave mistake considering congestion pricing for San Francisco .
For starters , we do not have the congestion dynamics of London or Singapore , with millions of commuters descending on our fair city each day .
In its simplest terms , congestion pricing is a regressive tax that penalizes middle - and lower - income visitors who need to enter the central business district .
The $ 6 fee is punitive and will cause drivers to steer clear of coming to the central business district , adversely impacting merchants , restaurants and other commercial establishments .
With the country in the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , now is not the time to consider yet another fee ( tax ) that will dissuade people from coming to downtown San Francisco .
And , by the way , who determined there is a congestion problem ?
On almost any given day , a driver can go from 5th and Folsom streets to Fisherman 's Wharf in less than 10 minutes .
Instead of implementing the failed London model , which has not delivered the new transit resources it promised , let 's focus on the SFPark program that will be rolled out shortly by the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency .
The SFPark plan is a well thought out congestion pricing alternative to the controversial London model .
SFPark is based on implementing a new street meter program that will allow the city to raise and lower street parking cost based on the demand in the area .
By raising and lowering meter rates , it will keep cars from circling and circling busy streets and free up the roads for Muni to flow through .
In the meantime , the most effective way to address any vehicle congestion in downtown is through the strict enforcement of trucks and cars double - parking , red zones , yellow zones and bus zones .
Take the increased fines from this enforcement , add it to the new revenues from SFPark and go buy more buses .

ISLAMABAD ( Reuters ) -
One of the suspected planners of last month ’s attack by gunmen on Mumbai was arrested by Pakistani security forces in a raid on a militant camp , an official with a charity linked to the militant group said on Monday .
The Jamaat - ud - Dawa ( JuD ) official , who requested anonymity because of the sensitivity of the subject , said Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi was taken into custody following Sunday ’s raid on a camp used by Lashkar - e - Taiba fighters outside Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistani Kashmir .
“ Yes , Lakhvi is among four or five people arrested in a raid yesterday , ” said the official , whose JuD charity is regarded as front for the feared militant group .
Pakistani intelligence officers said six men have been arrested , but gave no names , and there has been no official confirmation of the raid .
Lakhvi , one of Lashkar ’s operations chiefs , was named as a ringleader in the Mumbai plot by the lone surviving gunman captured in India , according to Indian officials .
He and Yusuf Muzammil , the head of Lashkar ’s anti-India operations , gave orders by telephone to the 10 militants who killed at least 171 people in the attack on Mumbai , Indian officials say .
Pakistan has asked for proof that attackers came from Pakistan , while saying it will cooperate with India in the investigation , but tensions between the two nuclear - armed rivals have risen .
The United States has exerted diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to match words with deeds swiftly to stop the crisis worsening , while asking India to exercise restraint .
“ I think there ’s no doubt that Pakistani territory was used , by probably non-state actors , ” U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told CNN ’s “ Late Edition ” on Sunday .

WHAT NEXT ?
If Lakhvi ’s arrest is officially confirmed , it will raise the question of what the Pakistani authorities will do with him , and whether it will satisfy India .
Slideshow ( 8 images )
President Asif Ali Zardari has said that anyone arrested in Pakistan will be tried there too .
The Pakistani military ’s Inter - Services Intelligence ( ISI ) agency had ties in the past with Lashkar and other jihadi organizations fighting Indian rule in Kashmir , according to analysts , which could reduce the Pakistani authorities ’ readiness to be transparent in its handling of the situation .
Laskhar was officially banned by Pakistan in 2001 , after it was blamed along with Jaish - e - Mohammad , for a raid on the Indian parliament that almost sparked a fourth war between the two countries .
The militants say Lashkar relocated its base to Indian Kashmir , while its founder Hafiz Saeed quit the organization , but remained head of the charity .
Analysts say there is evidence of Lashkar fighters cooperating with al Qaeda , and fears that these jihadi organizations have become uncontrollable .
The JuD charity , which has thousands of followers , was also designated a militant organization by the United States , but Pakistan has only put it on a watchlist .
Yvette Prieto Michael Jordan Wedding ?
Yvette Prieto and Michael Jordan are set to tie the knot next week if you can believe rumors spreading like wildfire on the internet .
Mediatakout.com was the first to report the rumor of the impending nuptials .
Prieto , a Cuban model , was first spotted with Jordan last summer .
Jordan was divorced from Juanita , his wife of 17 years , in 2006 .
Juanita reportedly received a $ 168 million settlement , making it the largest celebrity divorce settlement in history .
Prieto previously dated Julio Iglesias , Jr.
There is currently not much information available about Yvette Prieto , but if this rumor bears fruit , I 'm sure we 'll be seeing a lot more of her .
UPDATE : Michael Jordan announced his engagement to Yvette Prieto December 29 , 2011 .

Only one of these systems ( at the time this article was written ) have reached their final release , that being sidux 2008 - 04 .
But the other two , SimplyMEPIS 8.0 Release Candidate 1 and AntiX M8.0 Public
Test 1 , are every bit as solid and useful as sidux , not to mention even easier to install and use .
We can thank the Debian projects for putting together an extremely robust set of packaging tools , rigorous testing procedures , and an excellent assortment of software .
The result is that there have been a wealth of outstanding distributions created to meet a wide variety of interests .
sidux
The sidux project was started in November 2006 to actively develop the most current collection of software that is capable of running on the latest assortment of hardware .
The sidux kernel is constantly updated to provide the latest driver changes and kernel improvements .
A number of excellent tools have been created to tame the wild and constantly changing " unstable " Debian binary packages , named after the equally unstable character from the Toy Story movies , the boy named " Sid " , who enjoys blowing up toys .
Debian
Sid contains excellent software but it is such a rapidly moving target that packaging instabilities often happen .
The sidux project has taken steps to harness the power of Debian Sid and carefully manage the handling of potentially problematic packages .
The result of their effort is a great desktop system , rapidly changing , that offers the newest software that is available , and the software really works .
sidux 2008 - 04 is the latest in the series of sidux releases , which are produced roughly once a quarter .
The latest release contains a very recent sidux kernel from the Linux 2.26.27 branch .
sidux contains only " free " software but their documentation and optional tools make it easy to obtain " non-free " firmware drivers , particularly for wireless network cards and peripherals .
Their custom tools also ease the process of accessing " non-free " multimedia extensions so that , at your choice , you can use the tools that you want to use .
The result is a very current and useful desktop system .
SimplyMEPIS
The MEPIS project has long been focused on the creation of easy to use desktop software that is above all , stable , easy to use and easy to modify .
Originally conceived in 2002 the first public release was created in May 2003 , and in 2004 the SimplyMEPIS series of releases was made publicly available .
It was also popularized by a book entitled " Point and Click " Linux , by Robin Miller .
The current released version of SimplyMEPIS is Version 7.0 , based on Debian Etch .
The current development release of SimplyMEPIS is Version 8.0 and are now beginning the Release Candidate process with Release Candidate 1 .
The software which has already been through six successful Beta test cycles is an example for other distributions to follow .
It is a model of stability , simplicity and function .
Already it works better than many released software distributions and puts to shame many commercial software applications .
SimplyMEPIS 8.0 is also based on the Linux 2.6.27 kernel .
It has undergone considerable testing already by the developer Warren Woodford and the active MEPIS community at the MEPIS Lovers Forum .
Whether the final release is approved before the end of the year or not , SimplyMEPIS 8.0 , Release Candidate 1 is one of the top desktop systems of 2008 .
It is very clean , stable , easy to install and of course easy to use .
You can run it as a Live CD to evaluate , you can install it to disk or you can also use it as a recovery and system management CD .
AntiX Another project in the MEPIS family is the lightweight AntiX , which replaces the desktop environment with a choice of two window managers , IceWM and Fluxbox .
It also replaces the display manager with SLIM and uses several smaller , lighter applications to reduce memory consumption and the size of the system footprint .
The AntiX project is also in a testing cycle at the present time .
There have already been three successful internal test versions which the AntiX testing community has evaluated , and now the public testing period has begun .
Like its parent SimplyMEPIS , each AntiX test release is solid and intended to work .
The test releases are intended to identify and resolve any inconsistencies and remove all glaring defects .
What is so nice about both MEPIS projects is that even the test releases are very usable , and even with the testing limitations they provide extremely useful software .
These three distributions are all worthy of the Yuletide season and they all make a great present for your favorite Linux geek and to the Linux desktop community in general .
You never know , they may well remain on your systems once you try them out .
All of them are upgradeable as further improvements and updates become available .
I was delighted to notice this evening that the drug czar ’s blog , Pushingback.com seems to have removed every post written prior to Obama ’s inauguration .
What was formerly one of the web ’s greatest collections of unhinged drug war propaganda now houses only 3 posts .
It ’s an epic massacre of wretched crap that should never have been written in the first place .
Classic embarrassments such as the fake map of San Francisco , the crazy ' burrito taster ' poster , and the time they lied about their web traffic are gone forever , along with every other annoying artifact of former drug czar John Walters ’s tragic flirtations with new media .
I ’m sure it ’s all archived somewhere , but it ’s probably best left to rot unless you ’re making a documentary called Worst Drug Czar Ever .
The archives of Pushingback.com are basically a map of everything ONDCP has been up to for the last couple years .
It was the single best source for following the drug czar ’s speeches , photo - ops , programs and propaganda .
Suddenly , all of John Walters horrible accomplishments are erased and the bloggers who ’ve been picking away at him for years are left with a bunch of dead links .
The big question is how this came about .
I ’d really love to know whose executive decision it was to take out John Walters ’s garbage .
I spot - checked a couple other government blogs and found Bush administration posts still available , even on divisive topics such as foreign policy .
For now , it looks like the purge at Pushingback.com is n’t just a matter of out with the old , in with the new .
If someone in the new administration thinks we do n’t need this crap anymore , they ’re damn right .

As the job market continues to sour , it is important to take advantage of all available tools to keep up with your personal and professional network .
So if you ’ve been joining social networking sites and never taking the time to complete your profile — or if you ’ve been hitting the delete button when friends and colleagues invite you to connect on a new online platform , now is a good time to start paying more attention .
Here are a few things to think about as you take the plunge or take your social networking to the next level .
LinkedIn has taken hold as the standard for most professionals , but also consider spending time on sites catering to your own industry or profession .
Keep up with the trade press in your field to figure out where your peers are congregating online .
Specialized communities exist for just about any industry or interest group — like NurseLinkup.com ( for nursing professionals ) , Model Mayhem ( for models and photographers ) , Mediabistro.com ( for media professionals ) or Lawyrs.net ( for lawyers ) .
Have a look at this excellent list of other niche social networking sites .
Though online social networking sites are newish , the same rules of old - fashioned in - person networking apply .
Build your reputation as a giver , rather than as someone who is always asking for favors .
If people in your network , for example , ask for help or introductions , check in periodically and respond when appropriate .
If you ’ve shown that you are a giver , people will rally to help you when you have a need to tap your network .
Use these sites to showcase your experience and achievements .
If you or someone in your organization has recently given or heard a terrific presentation , won a case , published an article or appeared on television , post something about it .
If you do this in the spirit of sharing good information with others — like this video about the current economic situation that Ramit Sethi , a personal finance blogger , distributed via Twitter and other tools — you ’ll have the perfect marriage of self - promotion and sharing good information with your online colleagues and fans .
Build your presence on these networks when you ’re not looking for a job .
Make sure that your profile is up to date .
Periodically check to see if there are people you know that you could be connecting with .
Be responsive to requests from your network .
Should you then need to look for a new opportunity , your network will be well tended and it wo n’t be awkward to connect with people who can be of help .
Finally , a few words of caution to keep in mind :
When you create a presence on a social networking site , take the time to learn how to use it properly .
If the site offers an online tutorial , do it .
If possible , find a friend or colleague who is already part of the community to give you a primer on the site ’s etiquette .
Do not join every social networking site that hits your radar — there ’s a reason the phrase “ social networking overload ” has been cropping up a lot on blogs lately .
As with professional organizations or clubs , it is hard to be a real contributor when you are involved with too many groups .
That said , you might find it helpful to join a handful of sites and then choose one or two on which you will be more active .
Social networking sites make it easy to contact people , but be mindful of your online manners .
Do not try to connect with people you do n’t know personally .
Do not use these tools to stalk or send spam to people who have n’t been otherwise responsive to you .
And make sure to review and follow the guidelines of any community that you join .
Note : I have cited Linkedin here and in a few other recent posts without mentioning that The New York Times has a strategic partnership with Linked In .
I have been using LinkedIn for quite a while now , well before I knew about its relationship with The Times , so I do n’t believe that relationship has made me more or less likely to write about the site .
Nonetheless readers should know about the relationship .
Trevor Griffiths and David Walsh discuss “ The Writer and Revolution ”
By our reporter
13 November 2008
The University of Manchester was the venue for a unique discussion Wednesday on the relationship between the writer and revolution .
Acclaimed playwright Trevor Griffiths was in conversation with David Walsh , the arts editor of the World Socialist Web Site .
Griffiths has been writing for the theatre , television and cinema since the late 1960s .
His work has been seen throughout the world and he has won numerous awards , including for his film Reds , written with Warren Beatty , for which he received the WGA Best Screenplay Award and an Oscar nomination .
Focusing on Griffiths ' career , spanning almost half a century , the two explored the complex interaction between art and society .
In particular , given Griffiths ' wide - ranging body of work , it was possible to examine the impact of key historical moments on both the artist and in the development of social revolution .
David Walsh , in Britain for a series of talks on " Art and Socialism , " introduced Griffiths .
He stressed that the discussion reflected the coming together of a number of social and cultural processes .
The descent of world capitalism into a historic economic crisis had dealt a shattering blow to the hegemony enjoyed by the ideologues of the free market and its stifling effect on artistic creation , Walsh explained .
This development threw into sharp relief the significance of Griffiths ' own work .
Walsh described the playwright as " one of the most historically acute writers of our time . "
This was true in several senses , he continued .
Griffiths " has treated a remarkable number of critical historical moments : the American Revolution , the French Revolution , pre-revolutionary Russia , the formation of the Bolshevik Party , the rise of Stalinism , the Italian revolutionary strike wave of 1920 , the Spanish Civil War , the transport workers strike of 1911 in this country , the Labour Party from various sides , the Conservative Party , the experience of Thatcherism , neo -Nazism , the Gulf War , and our own party in Britain at an earlier stage of development , " Walsh said .
He had dealt with other questions as well , " about more intimate matters , family , husbands and wives , the consequences of illness , the death of love and relationships , " grappling with human emotion and behavior , Walsh explained .
What is common to all his works is that they are all " informed by a historical approach , " he stressed .
Griffiths spoke extensively on the life of Thomas Paine , the subject of his screenplay " These are the Times , " which follows Paine from obscurity in England , to the American War of Independence , to Revolutionary France .
He discussed what had attracted him to Paine as a historical figure , his connection to the Enlightenment and described the difficulties he faced in realizing this project as well as several others since the 1980s .
Griffiths pointed out to a predominantly youthful audience how the fate of his work was bound up with the decline of the revolutionary fervor and socialist views associated with the 1960s and stretching into the early 1970s .
Discussing his play " The Party , " a fictionalized account of discussions between several artists and a number of left figures , he noted that this was put on in 1973 at the National Theatre in London , directed by Kenneth Tynan and starred Sir Laurence Olivier in the leading role based on Trotskyist leader Gerry Healy .
He read a number of quotes from the accompanying programme to paint a picture of a society in which " Marxism was commonplace , " that a play featuring a 22 - minute speech outlining the significance of a revolutionary party could attract audiences of 900 people over a number of weeks .
" This was the society we were building , " Griffiths said , " and that was the society that the Conservatives and Labour had to rip up . "
He explained how the 1970s had witnessed a sustained attempt to destroy the radical and socialist traditions associated with this period — a " kulturkampf " waged first by the Conservatives under Margaret Thatcher , and then deepened and extended under Tony Blair 's Labour government .
Two of the most effective moments in the discussion were when Griffiths read John Tagg 's ( Healy's ) speech from " The Party " and his closing the meeting with the final scenes of " These are the Times . "
Griffiths also showed a clip from his last television play " Food for Ravens , " dealing with the last days of Aneurin Bevan , the Labour leader credited with founding Britain 's National Health Service .
In it , Bevan speaks movingly of not allowing the rich fruits of culture to be the exclusive preserve of the " toffs " and to recognize them as the birthright of humanity .
Griffiths said that the next period could be the dawn of a new artistic and political awakening .
For this , certain basic truths had to be understood , he said : " Namely , who creates the wealth , and who spends it . "
Walsh stressed that there was a social impulse for the renunciation of their previous left views by many of Griffiths ' contemporaries .
He insisted that Griffiths ' ability to resist these pressures was rooted in his own historical approach and a sense of historical perspective this provided .
This underlined the necessity for writers and artists today to familiarize themselves with history , in particular the multifaceted struggle to develop socialist consciousness amongst broad layers of society .
The World Socialist Web Site places particular emphasis on the need to raise the cultural level of the working class , to develop sensitivity , a sense of solidarity and an empathy with others as a precondition for such a development , Walsh said .
Numerous questions were asked by members of the audience on these themes and the contributions of both speakers were warmly applauded .
I thought it would be obvious , but I am currently cleaning up an application that has mixed them in a very annoying way .
I decided to track the reason for this coupling and I found this on the sample controller in ASP .
Net MVC :
I am pretty sure that setting the page title is a presentation concern , as such , I do n't want to see this in the controller , and I certainly do n't want to see it in the base sample from which everyone is going to start .
As we learned in the section on debt , our nation has a historic , never - before - seen level of debt and a historic failure to save .
Now some would say that it ’s not reasonable to look only at debt and savings ; one also has to consider assets .
After all , does it really matter if you have no savings and a million dollars of debt if you have assets worth $ 10 million ?
That ’s a great point , and so we ’re going to take a look at assets here .
All right , so what is an asset ?
One definition is items of ownership convertible into cash : total resources of a person or business , as cash , notes and accounts receivable , securities , inventories , goodwill , fixtures , machinery , or real estate .
So an asset is something of value that can be converted to cash or provides access to , or enhances , a flow of cash .
If we simply said assets are deposits , real estate , a stock or a bond , and the stuff we own , we ’d pretty much cover the vast majority of what we consider to be our assets .
We ’re only going to look at the assets of households , because , as we saw earlier , the liabilities and assets of the US and state governments are really the liabilities of its citizens .
But do remember , as we noted in Chapter 13 , the US government has a total net worth of negative $ 50 to $ 85 trillion .
In fact , that mismatch between assets and liabilities does not belong to the US government , it belongs to you and me and everybody else .
Our national debts and liabilities are , well , ours .
On the private side , the assets of companies belong entirely to the bondholders and shareholders of the company , not the company itself .
And who holds those ?
Ultimately , private citizens do .
Since we can pool citizens into households , we could examine household assets , deduct some relevant liabilities , and get a decent view of where things stand .
And we do this because the Federal Reserve tracks net worth at the household level , and this data is routinely and widely reported in the media .
In fact , according to the Federal Reserve , household net worth has exploded by nearly $ 20 trillion in only five years – an astonishing feat – and it represents more ‘ wealth ’ than our country managed to amass from its inception until the late 1980s .
And these are net assets , so the Federal Reserve , and many in the media , take the position that , with just under $ 60 trillion in net worth , Americans are doing just fine and our rapidly climbing debt levels are no cause for concern .
But before we get too excited about the astonishing wealth indicated here , there are two key oversights and a fallacy hidden in this report of which you should be aware .
As always , the devil is in the details .
Before I address those , I want you to observe this period here , spanning from 2000 to 2003 .
That dip in the net worth of households was due to the stock market collapse that ran from 2000 to 2003 and caused such great panic at the Fed that Greenspan lowered interest rates to the emergency rate of 1 % , thereby igniting the greatest of housing and credit bubbles in all of history .
And this decline in total net worth leads to this observation : Debt is fixed .
When you take on a debt , there it placidly sits , growing larger , until you make payments on it .
Debts do not vary with general economic conditions , or whether you get a raise or lose your job .
Assets , on the other hand , are variable , sometimes gaining and sometimes losing value .
And so this leads to the 8th Key Concept of the Crash Course : Debts are fixed , while assets are variable .
Okay .
Where did that $ 19.8 trillion in new wealth come from ?
About 80 % of that growth came from a rise in financial assets and the remaining 20 % came from growth in real estate and other ‘ tangible ’ assets .
When we look at how much of each type there are , we see that 72 % of the total net worth consists of financial assets totaling about $ 41 trillion , while the tangible assets are the remaining 28 % and total around $ 16 trillion .
If we examine these assets a little more closely , we see that the $ 41 trillion dollars worth of financial assets consist of things like pension funds , the assets of privately held businesses , deposits , stocks , and bonds , which we can roughly recompose into these four main classes : stocks , bonds , cash or deposits , and the assets of privately held businesses .
The other bucket of $ 16 trillion in tangible assets consists primarily of real estate , which is 75 % of this bucket , and consumer durables , which would be your car , your dryer , and your snow blower , if you have one .
For every single one of these assets except cash , in order to liberate the wealth from these assets you ’d have to sell them first .
One general rule of asset markets goes like this :
Things go UP in price when there are more buyers than sellers , AND things go DOWN in price when there are more sellers than buyers .
Hold onto that thought for when we get to demographics .
Now let me expose a great fallacy of the household wealth report .
I ’ll use real estate to make the point .
Suppose you have a house that you bought for $ 250,000 , and over time , say the last five years , it went up in assessed value to $ 500,000 .
The Fed would record this as a $ 250,000 increase in your net wealth .
But there ’s really no way for you to easily get to that wealth .
Sure , you could borrow against that , but that does not liberate the wealth , it only exchanges an amount of it for debt .
But suppose that you sold your house .
Well , if you wanted to move into an equivalent house , guess what ?
They ’ve all gone up in price along with yours , and so you have to spend $ 500,000 for an equivalent house , so nope , no wealth was liberated there .
In fact , the only way to liberate the wealth in your house is to downsize and buy a smaller one ( or rent ) .
So here ’s the rhetorical question of the day : How can everyone downsize ?
You might be able to , but , on balance , everyone can’t .
At least not without creating a massive glut of large homes and a desperate shortage of smaller ones .
And if everyone can’t do this , then it means that it is impossible to ever release the full value , or embodied wealth , of all the houses .
So the wealth number is fun to look at individually , but it is more or less meaningless as a whole .
This same dynamic is true for other assets as well : Sufficient buyers are essential , or the wealth is as good as stranded .
I mentioned that there are also two big oversights in the household wealth report , and the first is that the Fed mysteriously does not include the general liabilities of the government when calculating the household net wealth .
Would n’t it make sense for the Fed to offset these against household wealth ?
After all , who else besides taxpayers living in households are going to pay off those liabilities ?
Nobody , that ’s who .
If the Fed did perform this offset , household net worth would plunge below zero , so I can guess why this comparison is never made .
But I would argue that a careful steward of a nation ’s monetary policy would be interested in representing the true situation as accurately as possible .
The second oversight is that the data is presented as if it applied to our entire country in a fairly even and useful manner .
It does not .
The top 1 % owns 35 % of ALL net household wealth AND , looking at stocks , only owns 56 % of ALL stock ( by value ) .
If you ca n’t see it , I apologize ; the top 1 % is represented by a very thin red smear at the top of the column there .
So it ’s great that our stock market keeps powering higher , but for every trillion dollars it goes up , $ 560 billion of that goes to only one out of a hundred households .
The top 20 % , which includes the top 1 % , owns 85 % of ALL net household wealth and 80 % of ALL stock ( by value ) .
This means the bottom 80 % of the citizens of this country , represented in yellow , holds only 15 % of the total wealth of this country , and even there the distribution of wealth is weighted to the top .
Remember , an imbalance between rich and poor is the oldest and most fatal ailment of all republics .
More immediately , this tells us that our credit crisis is going to be worse than advertised .
Just as was true of the wealth gap in the late 1920s before the onset of the Great Depression , the severity of the crisis will not depend on average wealth but the distribution of the wealth .
If a large swath of the population lacks the means to weather the storm , then the storm will be longer and harsher than otherwise would be the case .
So what does it mean that 80 % of our population possesses a meager 15 % of the total wealth ?
For one thing , it means that the recent efforts by the Fed to provide massive amounts of liquidity support to the biggest and wealthiest banks at the inflationary expense of the lower classes were not only misguided , but they were cruel and unusual .
This leads to an easy prediction to make :
The wealth gap in the US will hamper our recovery and deepen the downturn .
In order to really understand why I have been harping on this notion of assets being variable and their value being dependent on the ratio of buyers to sellers , we ’ll need to take a quick trip into demographics .
Recall that the US government has not saved in any of its entitlement programs , and that it has a massive shortfall in them , measuring in the tens of trillions of dollars .
That situation comes about because the entitlement programs are wealth transfer programs , not savings accounts , and they depend on a significant surplus of current workers to retirees .
The shortfalls in these programs are being exacerbated by a troubling trend .
In 1950 there were seven workers per retiree and the system was balanced .
By 2005 , that ratio had dropped to only 5 to 1 , and the system was already exhibiting signs of distress .
By 2030 , that ratio will have plummeted to a thoroughly unworkable value of less than 3 to 1 .
And this trend comes about as a feature of the so - called Baby Boom .
This is a demographic chart of the United States .
Each bar represents a clustering of all the people who are within a five - year - wide ‘ age window , ’ as seen on the left axis , and shows how many millions of them there are along the bottom axis .
The baby boomers number around 75 million strong and roughly occupy these four bands .
While it may not seem like much , the ‘ hole ’ that exists in the population behind the baby boomers represents an enormous challenge , and even threat , to our entitlement programs , and will greatly complicate our efforts to resolve our levels of debt and our national failure to save .
A more ‘ normal ’ population distribution , and the kind that humans evolved with over countless millennia , looks like this .
A pyramid .
Again , this shows five - year - wide age brackets , with men in red and women in yellow .
This distribution is capable of supporting an entitlement program such as the one in the US that is based on transferring wealth directly from workers to retirees .
But when we cast this chart forward to 2000 , the baby boomer bulge is quite apparent .
Besides the challenge that this demographic profile offers to the entitlement programs , an even larger challenge is presented to both the debt and savings issues I painted in previous chapters and even to the value of our assets .
Here ’s what I mean .
The boomers are the wealthiest generation ever , they hold nearly all of the assets , and they will need to dispose of those assets to fund their retirements .
Who exactly are the boomers planning on selling their assets to ?
This guy ?
Even if his generation somehow could afford to buy all these assets , there simply are n’t enough people in his generation to buy them .
In order to fund their retirement dreams , boomers are going to have to sell off their assets .
And again we might wonder , to whom , exactly ?
And lastly , if the massive accumulation of debt over the past 23 years was predicated on the assumption that the future will be much larger than the present , we might also question how exactly that will come to pass if boomers are retiring en masse and there are fewer behind them to take their place ?
Man …the next generation better be prepared to work really , really hard !
Too bad they are graduating with the highest levels of college debt ever recorded .
This sort of demographic profile will be with us for decades and cannot be wished away or fixed by some clever policy .
It is simply a fact of life , and one that we ’d do well to recognize and plan for rather than ignore .
Boomer retirement has already begun , and the pace of this will accelerate rapidly over the next 15 years , which will make the twenty - teens quite interesting and leads me to conclude that the next twenty years are going to be completely unlike the last twenty years .
Next time we ’re going to discuss asset bubbles .
Understanding the destructive dynamics of bubbles is critical if you want to know what ’s coming next and why the Federal Reserve is panicking right now .

Están en riesgo empleos Pasivos de corto plazo crecieron en promedio 23 %
Según Arnulfo Rodríguez , analista de Banamex Accival , del 30 de junio al 10 de octubre , la deuda de corto plazo en moneda extranjera aumentó en promedio 23 % para las compañías mexicanas .
América Móvil , Cemex , FEMSA , Telmex , Elektra y Bimbo son algunas firmas afectadas por la depreciación del tipo de cambio .
Otras empresas perjudicadas son Controladora Comercial Mexicana y Corporación Durango , las cuales incluso informaron en días pasados que entrarían a concurso mercantil para tratar de renegociar sus deudas con sus respectivos acreedores .
Esta situación repercutirá no sólo en la creación de empleos , sino en posibles despidos que podrían darse en las compañías que presentan serios problemas de endeudamiento .
Para Rodríguez resulta común que muchas tesorerías de importantes compañías no financieras desarrollen pasivos en dólares , ya sea para obtener fondos directos y beneficiarse de tasas más bajas en dólares o por la compra de productos financieros para transformar su fondeo de pesos a dólares .
En contraparte , Grupo Alsea , operador de Starbucks , Chillis , Domino ’s Pizza y Burguer King , señaló que no tiene problemas para el pago de sus deudas .
En tanto , el gobierno dará créditos con tasas competitivas a las pequeñas y medianas empresas para que enfrenten problemas de liquidez a raíz de la volatilidad en los mercados , según Nacional Financiera .

Barack Obama embarked on the wholesale deconstruction of George Bush 's war on terror , shutting down the CIA 's secret prison network , banning torture and rendition , and calling for a new set of rules for detainees .
The repudiation of Bush 's thinking on national security yesterday also saw the appointment of a high - powered envoy to the Middle East .
Obama 's decision to permanently shut down the CIA 's clandestine interrogation centres went far beyond the widely anticipated move to wind down the Guantánamo Bay detention centre within a year .
He cast his scrapping of the legal apparatus set up by Bush as a way for America to reclaim the moral high ground in the fight against al - Qaida .
" We are not , as I said during the inauguration , going to continue with the false choice between our safety and our ideals , " Obama said at the signing ceremony .
" We intend to win this fight .
We are going to win it on our own terms . "
In a sign of the sweeping rejection of the legal standards set by Bush , officials briefing reporters at the White House yesterday said the new administration would not be guided by any of the opinions on torture and detainees issued by the justice department after 11 September 2001 .
Instead , Obama , in three executive orders , renewed the US commitment to the Geneva convention on the treatment of detainees .
All detainees will be registered by the International Committee for the Red Cross , in another departure of past practice under the Bush administration .
A group of 16 retired admirals and generals , in a meeting organised by Human Rights First , said the move would restore America 's moral authority in the world , and strengthen its national security .
" President Obama has rejected the false choice between national security and our ideals , " they said .
As expected , Obama made good on his campaign promise to shut down Guantánamo , issuing an executive order to close the camp within a year .
He also ordered a taskforce , led by the attorney general and the secretaries of defence , state and homeland security , to review the intelligence and information on each detainee and to determine whether they can be released or put on trial .
He called for a review on the treatment of prisoners at Guantánamo to be completed within 30 days .
Another order directs the CIA to follow the US army field manual on interrogations , which bars such techniques as waterboarding .
Obama also directed a taskforce to study and report back within 180 days on whether new guidelines were required for intelligence officials , beyond those set down by the military .
Administration officials were adamant that the review was not intended as a back door to reinstate torture .
" There is not a secret annexe that allows us to bring enhanced interrogation techniques back , " said one .
The final order mandates a review of the case of Ali Saleh Khalah al - Marri , a Qatari , the last enemy combatant on US soil , who is being held in a naval brig in Charleston , South Carolina .
Obama followed up the burst of activity on detention policy by announcing that his administration would put resolution of the Israeli - Palestinian conflict at the top of his agenda , " actively and aggressively " seeking a comprehensive peace deal .
As a sign of that intent , he confirmed that former senator George Mitchell , a veteran US mediator , would be his Middle East envoy .
Obama , who had been criticised for his silence during the Israeli bombardment of Gaza , set out a new position that , while still leaning towards Israel , was more even - handed than that under Bush .
He called for Hamas to stop firing rockets at Israel , but also said that Israel must " complete the withdrawal of its forces from Gaza " .
Contaminated bacon bits may have made their way into breakfast burritos and chicken sandwiches sold at Colorado convenience stores .
A Wisconsin company is recalling 3,600 pounds of bacon bits because of possible contamination with listeria bacteria .
No illnesses have been reported .
The bits — inside individually wrapped burritos and sandwiches — were distributed to 7 - Eleven convenience stores and small , independent grocery stores in Colorado , state health officials said today .
The snacks have been removed from store shelves , said the distribution company , Home Fresh Sandwich Distributors .
They were labeled “ Burritos with potatoes , bacon , eggs and Monterey Jack cheese ” and “ Chicken club on cracked wheat bread . ”
They were sold under the 7 - Eleven label or in grocery stores under the Home Fresh Sandwich Distributors brand .
Those who ate the snacks should contact their doctor if they become ill , said Lori Maldonado , spokeswoman for the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment .
Eating food contaminated with listeria can cause listeriosis , a potentially fatal disease .
Symptoms are high fever , severe headache , neck stiffness and nausea .

As many of you know , I am an amateur photographer .
I have another blog where I post one picture every day and these next ten shots are my favorites from this year .
I ’ll go into a little more depth than normal on these because I like them so much .
10 .
This is a sculpture that my mom got for some holiday ( I think ) .
It was taken towards the beginning of the year .
I really like what goes on with the shadow and the character looking out of the frame .
I think the grayscale works , too .
9 .
Taken at the Hartford Auto show a month or two ago , this color was great .
The black stripes just add to the awesome , I think .
I ’m really happy with the focus that I got on this one .
8 .
This is from Horsebarn
Hill at the very highest open point on the UConn campus .
It was a kind of crappy rainy day earlier and I thought I would take the chance to go up to the hill and see if I could get some wide shots of the campus .
As the light was fading I saw this line of clouds move in and then I realized that the sun would be setting right as they were passing over me .
I only touched this up to recreate the colors that I saw that afternoon .
7 .
I love the depth of focus on this one .
It really captures the crunchiness of the leaves .
Also , it looks cool .
This was taken on one of my many photowalks around campus .
6 .
From this Sunday , this is the only picture on the list that was taken with my new Canon XSi .
It is also my new desktop background .
I love it so much .
5 .
From the same day as the cloud picture above .
I had recently watched The Assassination of Jesse James By The Coward Robert Ford and I wanted to see if I could recreate the look of that film .
I think I got pretty close .
I also love the focus on this one .
4 .
I think this one was taken towards the end of fall , even though it looks a lot like a spring picture .
This is perhaps the best color I have gotten in a picture .
I think it is beautiful .
3 .
This is n’t the technically best shot but I think the beauty of it balances the so - so technical work .
It was raining one afternoon after work at my summer job .
We had just pulled into the driveway and I saw the sun shining while the rain was still falling .
I crouched pretty low to the ground ( I did n’t want to lay down for obvious reasons ) to get as much sky as I could .
I wish the background trees and house were n’t there , but I think the reflection works just as well even though the top half could have been better .
2 .
Two days before my birthday I captured this on my way back from one of my classes .
I enjoy shadows and how they are a version but not exactly the same as the real thing .
I thought getting the very bottom of the actual tree and having the rest be in shadows was pretty great .
I think I did it by accident , though .
Which is lucky for me .
1 .
As you can see , I like pictures of trees and nature and stuff .
This is about two weeks after the previous shot and I think it is kind of amazing .
I feel weird talking about my pictures like this , but there it is .
Fromt this picture you would never be able to tell that the lake was actually a gross , duck crap filled pond .
It looks like something out of Lord of the Rings , I think .
All of these pictures are even better in a bigger size which you can see if you click on the pictures .
So that ’s it .
See you later for other Top Ten lists !

Massive London demonstration opposes Israel 's Gaza attacks online only
By Simon Assaf
Socialist Worker -- January 12 , 2009 --
Up to 150,000 people took to the streets of London on Saturday in a mass show of solidarity with Palestinians caught under Israeli bombs in the Gaza Strip .
The London demonstration was part of a wave of outrage at Israel .
More than 10,000 marched in Edinburgh .
At least 30,000 protested in Paris and 100,000 in Barcelona .
There were further marches in the US , Norway , Greece , Malaysia , Sweden , Bosnia , Lebanon , Thailand , South Korea and India .
The London demonstration drew families , young people and trade unionists .
As the march assembled Hyde Park had a thick covering of frost .
Demonstrators braved freezing temperatures to march from Speakers Corner in Hyde Park , through Notting Hill Gate , up Kensington High Street by the Israeli embassy to a rally filling the road by Kensington Gardens .
The good natured and determined march spilled across barriers to block whole roads , bringing parts of West London to a standstill .
Towards the end of the rally marchers were still passing Queensway right across Hyde Park .
Police initially claimed that only 12,000 people marched ( the same figure they chose for a sizable , but far smaller march last Saturday ) , though they later increased this to 20,000 .
Many protesters stopped outside the gates to the road containing the embassy , to throw shoes .
As the numbers grew after the rally , witnesses said riot police defending the gate sprayed white clouds of gas at a section of the crowd .
Some fainted as they were overcome by the gas .
Those who attempted to escape the confrontation found their way blocked by increasingly aggressive police .
Baton wielding riot police then stormed in from a side street to split the demonstration in two .
In the panic many demonstrators became crushed against a double line of police barriers that blocked off the pavement .
Police pushed back people who were attempted to cross the barriers to safety .
The pressure of bodies eventually caused the barriers to give way .
Furious demonstrators then succeeded in forcing the riot police back down the side street to release those caught in the crush .
Hours of confrontations followed with police eventually driving vans into the back of the crowd , as mounted police , supported by more police reinforcements , made several charges into the demonstration .
Many of the protesters took refuge in buildings to escape the ensuing police riot .
Others were chased down side streets .
As they stumbled away a number of these were set on by gangs of police .
They beat several people with batons and kicked them , as they lay helpless on the ground .
A section of the crowd then set up a series makeshift barricades to stop the police charges .
This action allowed people to retreat safely .
The police riot continued into the evening .
One teenager , who found refuge in a building near the embassy gates , told Socialist Worker that they were eventually allowed to leave after being searched and photographed .
This latest violent action by police follows an incident on the demonstration on Saturday of last week when police charged protesters who had been blocked in an underpass .
It marks a new phase of violent police behaviour against anti-war demonstrations that have always passed off peacefully .
The demonstration was called by the Stop The War Coalition , the British Muslim Initiative and the Palestine Solidarity Campaign .
250,000 Spaniards denounce Israel 's bloodshed
Press TV -- January 12 , 2009 --
In the largest pro-Palestinian demonstration in Europe so far , over 250,000 Spaniards denounce Israel 's bloodshed in Gaza and call for ceasefire .
Protesters in Spain 's capital Madrid and in other cities , including Seville , Malaga , Oviedo , Las Palmas de Gran Canaria and Ourense , carried banners saying ``Peace '' , ``SOS Gaza ' ' and placards with the word ``Gaza ' ' above a red- stained hand and mock blood - spattered bodies of children .
Police declined to give a figure but the organisers , which included the Socialist Party and trade unions , estimated the Sunday turnout at 250,000 .
" It is my duty to call on Israel to implement an immediate ceasefire , " Spanish Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero , who had attended the rally , told protesters in Ourense .
Oscar - winning actor Javier Bardem 's mother Pilar , also an actress , was among the speakers who addressed the crowd .
" The Spanish government has to do something .
The Gaza Strip is now practically a concentration camp , " AP quoted her as saying .
Sunday 's protests are a follow - up of Barcelona 's mass demonstration the previous day , where police estimated the crowd around 30,000 but according to organisers accounts , 100,000 people took to the streets .
The demonstration was organised by an alliance of groups , which in the past had organised mass protests against the US - led invasion of Iraq .
Spain has a Muslim community of around 800,000 out of a 46.1 million population .
Meanwhile , 30,000 people protested in Brussels on Sunday denouncing the Israeli carnage in Gaza .
Children carrying effigies of dead and bloodied babies were at the head of the procession .
Also in the Italian cities of Rome , Naples and Verona , thousands of people marched in pro-Palestinian rallies .
Protesters take part in a rally in central Athens .
In Athens , Greece , dozens of children and their parents , carrying effigies and photos of bloodied children , marched to protest Israel 's incursion and bloodshed in Gaza .
100,000 demonstrate in Paris
January 10 , 2009 -- Middle East Online --
French protesters marched through Paris , other French cities to denounce Israeli 's offensive in Gaza .
Tens of thousands of protesters marched through central Paris and other French cities Saturday to denounce Israeli 's offensive in Gaza and express support for the Palestinian cause .
Thousands of French men and women carried Palestinian banners , amid cries of " Israel murderer " .
As the various groups gathered , portraits of slain Hamas chief Sheikh Ahmed Yassin and Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah were carried behind those of revolutionary Che Guevara and Venezuela 's President Hugo Chavez .
A banner strung along a truck carrying a sound system declared : " Support for Hamas " , as all the chants laid the blame for the fighting at Israel 's door .
" We are all Palestinians .
We are all children of Gaza , " the cortege chanted as it set off down a treelined boulevard separating eastern Paris ' districts from the Marais , the city 's oldest Jewish quarter .
" I have no problem marching with Hamas .
Hamas has been victim of a campaign of disinformation , " Mark Cramer , a 62 - year - old a former journalist from New York and founder member of Paris group " Americans Against the War . "
Cramer put the blame for the collapse of the Middle East ceasefire on Israel .
" There was a mediaeval siege against Gaza .
That siege was violent .
People were starving , " he said .
Some 3800 police were deployed , equipped with riot shields and body armour , but remained discreetly in side streets as the crowd marched on under a sea of Palestinian and Hezbollah flags .
Despite the biting winter chill , organisers claimed a turnout of 100,000 .
" We want to point to the hypocrisy of an international community which votes for tons of resolutions that it never enforces " , declared Olivier Besancenot , the well - known leader of France 's Revolutionary Communist League .
While the groups organising the demonstration focused their slogans on the suffering of Palestinian civilians , many homemade banners declared " Zionism equals Nazism " and depicted Israeli flags emblazoned with Swastikas .
Elsewhere in France , smaller crowds gathered for similar demonstrations in several cities .
In Nice , on the Mediterranean Riviera , protesters smashed the windows of a McDonald 's restaurant and threw stones at the Ruhl casino .
" McDonald 's because they 're American , they 're the paymasters , " one marcher said .
In the northern industrial city of Lille around 10,000 protesters gathered , according to both police and organisers .
Other protests took place in Toulouse in the southwest and Mulhoise in the east .
Tens of thousands protest across the United States
20,000 marched in Washington DC .

ANSWER -- January 11 , 2009 -- On Saturday , January 10 , hundreds of cities , and hundreds of thousands of people , responded to the call for an International Day of Emergency Action to support the people of Gaza .
Outside the United States , marches took place in London , Edinburgh , Cairo , Athens , Kuala Lumpur , Beirut , Seoul , Mexico City , Jakarta , Montreal , Paris , Barcelona , Marseilles , Lyon , Oslo , Berlin , Bern , Karachi , Nablus , New Delhi , Amman , Sarajevo , Ramallah , Stockholm and Tokyo .
The protests continue to grow -- today , another 250,000 took to the streets in Spain and more than 100,000 in Algeria .
In the US , the Day of Action was initiated on just one week 's notice by a call from the ANSWER Coalition , Muslim American Society Freedom , Free Palestine Alliance , National Council of Arab Americans , and Al - Awda - International Palestine Right to Return Coalition .
In Washington DC , over 20,000 took to the streets in the freezing rain to demand , " Let Gaza Live ! " .
The streets were so backed up that thousands of people in buses and cars were still arriving after the march had left Lafayette Park .
The demonstration began with a rally at the White House .
Featured speakers included former Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney , who was just on a humanitarian relief mission attempting to bring supplies to Gaza when the boat she was on was intentionally struck by an Israeli military vessel ; Mahdi Bray , Executive Director , Muslim American Society Freedom ; Rev. Graylan Hagler , National President of Ministers for Racial , Social and Economic Justice ; Mounzer Sleiman , Vice Chairman , National Council of Arab Americans ; Ralph Nader ; Paul Zulkowitz , Jews Against the Occupation ; Brian Becker , National Coordinator , ANSWER Coalition ; Mara Verheyden - Hilliard , attorney and co-founder , Partnership for Civil Justice ; and others .
The spirited march then led to the Washington Post , where demonstrators denounced the paper for its biased pro-Israeli coverage of the massacre and its complete blackout of protest activities in the United States .
In San Francisco , 10,000 took part in the march and rally .
The rally included a huge outpouring from the local Arab community , and energetic participation from Bay Area youth .
A crowd of 2000 demonstrators confronted a heavy police presence in downtown Orlando for the " Let Gaza Live : Florida Statewide March for Palestine " called by Act Now to Stop War and End Racism Coalition / Florida — just six days prior .
The demonstration is the largest anti-war demonstration in Florida in more than a decade and certainly the largest ever protest in Florida calling for a free Palestine .
Police tried to intimidate marchers by initially searching all bags , forcing protesters to remove sticks from signs , and denying the use of amplified sound .
Organizers and protesters challenged and pushed back their unwarranted scare tactics , and the protest turned out to be a powerful success .
In Los Angeles , 10,000 people participated in a regional mass march and rally to “ Let Gaza Live ” at the Westwood Federal Building .
Hundreds of Palestinian flags and signs reading “ Stop bombing Gaza ! ” and “ The real terrorists : US / Israel war machine ! ” lined all sides of the street and the lawn in front of the federal government headquarters .
It was the largest protest and the first major march in Southern California since the Israeli bombing campaign and invasion began .
A funeral procession led the march with makeshift coffins draped with Palestinian flags , representing the hundreds of people killed by Israel ’s genocidal attack on Gaza .
Hundreds of children followed , along with a huge , hand - made Palestinian flag , in a contingent organized by the Palestinian American Women ’s Association .
The worldwide movement is continuing to grow with more protests today , January 11 .
There will be countless other actions in the days to come .
Today in New York City , the police carried out a violent assault against those marching in mid-town Manhattan in support of the people of Palestine .
A number of people were injured and arrested .
With the support of the United States , the Israeli military machine has expanded its invasion into urban areas of Gaza .
The death toll among Palestinians is now nearly 900 , with many thousands wounded .
The injured and hungry of Gaza have no relief .
We must do everything in our power to deepen and broaden this movement in the coming days .
Malaysian police detain anti-war protesters
Malaysiakini -- January 10 , 2009 --
The police have arrested 21 people , including member of parliament for Klang MP Charles Santiago and several top leaders of the Socialist Party of Malaysia ( Parti Sosialis Malaysia -- PSM , at an anti-war vigil at Dataran Merdeka , Kuala Lumpur .
The vigil was organised by Anti-War Coalition to show support to the victims of war and aggression in Palestine and Sri Lanka .
About 200 people had gathered at about 8 pm for the vigil , which was declared illegal by the police who were also present at the venue .
About 100 light strike force personnel were on hand to control and disperse the crowd .
The crowd was ordered to disperse and the 21 were arrested for their failure to leave the area .
They were then taken to the Dang Wangi district police headquarters .
They are still being held at the police station .
Among those held were Parti Sosialis Malaysia leaders Dr Nasir Hashim and S. Arutchelvan , PKR ’s Kuala Langat MP Abdullah Sani and several activists from Suaram and Jerit .
Nasir is also the Kota Damansara state assemblyperson .
Abolish ISA Movement activist Norlaila Othman was also among those arrested .
They are believed to be investigated for illegal assembly .
Small crowd at police station
Eye - witnesses told Malaysiakini that the anti-war protesters had first gathered at the Bar Council building before beginning to march towards Dataran Merdeka -- some 300 metres away .
Upon reaching the historic field , they then begun to lit their candle lights and unfurl their anti-war banners .
These were stopped by the police .
Attempts by Charles and Nasir to negotiate with the police to seek permission for a quick vigil were also turned down .
A small crowd had already gathered at the police station to show support for those arrested .
They are being watched by the Federal Reserve Unit .
This is the first time the police have acted against an anti-war vigil in recent days .
Yesterday thousands had marched to the US embassy to object the Israeli aggression in Gaza without any police intervention .
Similarly another group of protesters in Kampung Baru was also allowed to burn the US and Israeli flags in the middle of the road yesterday afternoon without any police interference .
A police mockery
Meanwhile an activist narrated to AFP on the arrests .
“ We were holding a candlelight vigil to demand the end to the killing of innocent lives in Gaza , ” said E Parameswari , 30 , an activist with Jerit , a group championing the rights of marginalised people in the country .
“ Police used force to break up the gathering and arrested the 21 people including opposition lawmakers Charles , Abdullah Sani and Nasir , ” she told AFP .
“ Police said our gathering was illegal , ” she said .
Parameswari condemned the police action , adding that the demonstrators did not provoke the police .
“ The police action is an abuse of power , ” she added .
Arutchelvan , the secretary - general of the PSM , told AFP they were being held in a police lockup .
“ Our arrest makes a mockery of the position taken by Malaysia to condemn Israel .
The way the police acted against us is no difference from the way the Israelis are treating the Palestinian people , ” he said from the police station .
Thousands protest across South Africa for a free Gaza , call for sanctions and cutting diplomatic ties
By Palestine Solidarity Committee ( South Africa )
January 9 , 2009 --
In Tshwane , Durban and Port Elizabeth , thousands of people protested today ( Friday ) against the massacre of Palestinians in Gaza by Israel .
Some 2000 people laid siege to the Egyptian Embassy in Tshwane , while thousands marched in Durban , Port Elizabeth witnessed a placard demonstration , and a huge rally was held in Cape Town .
Today 's actions follow a week of energetic activity by Palestine solidarity organisations throughout the country .
Yesterday , 15,000 people marched in Cape Town and the city also saw placard demonstrations throughout the week .
The messages emerging from the protests and from the spokespersons of the various organisations have been :
A demand that Israel ceases its ``genocidal campaign '' and withdraws its troops from Gaza ;
Calls on the South African government to recall the South African ambassador from Tel Aviv , expel the Israeli ambassador from South Africa , and sever all diplomatic ties with Israel ;
Calls on the South African government to impose sanctions against Israel -- as has been called for by more than 200 Palestinian political , social and other organizations representing the vast majority of Palestinian society ; and
A commitment to a sustained campaign of boycotts , divestment and sanctions .
In addition , speakers at yesterday 's march and at today 's protests emphasised the right of the Palestinian people to resist the occupation of their lands .
Janet Cherry , in Port Elizabeth , spoke about the ``appalling humanitarian crisis '' in Gaza and called on the international community urgently to address the crisis and to force Israel to abide by international humanitarian law .
Speaking in an overflowing Mowbray Town Hall in Cape Town , Rivonia Treason trialist Dennis Goldberg attacked Israeli actions in Gaza , likened Israel to apartheid and supported the call for boycotts , divestment and sanctions .
His call was followed by the adopting a set of resolutions , including a call on the South African government to expel the Israeli ambassador and a call for a South African academic boycott of Israeli institutions .
In Tshwane , today , people from across the province protested against the involvement of the Egyptian government in the current massacres in Gaza .
Salim Vally , of the Palestine Solidarity Committee , said that in the past 18 months , while the people of Gaza were under siege and no food , fuel or medicines were allowed freely to enter the territory , Egypt had ensured that it kept its border with Gaza -- the Rafah Crossing -- sealed as well .
`` This resulted in untold suffering for the civilian population of Gaza ' ' , he said .
`` While the Gazan population has been starving , freezing and unable to receive medical treatment , Egypt collaborated with Israel to keep Gaza blockaded . ''
He added that since this massacre began 14 days ago , Egypt has prevented ``the refugees of genocide '' from seeking refuge , and continues to prevent doctors from entering Gaza .
Some 100 doctors are currently waiting at the Rafah Crossing , hoping that Egyptian authorities will allow them in .
Another speaker , Melissa Hoole , said Egypt was complicit with the Israelis and the United States in the oppression of the Palestinian people .
She also debunked the myth peddled by Israel and its apologists that Hamas had ``broken the ceasefire ' ' .
`` The first projectiles that Hamas fired '' , Hoole said , were after the ceasefire had ended and , despite Hamas ' request , the Israelis refused to renew it .
In fact ' ' , Hoole emphasised , ``it was Israel which repeatedly violated the ceasefire .
On the 4th November , Israel killed six Palestinians in Gaza , in violation of the ceasefire .
For the rest of November , Gazans experienced numerous incursions and attacks by Israel . ''
Vally added that Israel had , in fact , contravened the ceasefire from the first week because the agreement had stipulated that Israel would open all six borders between Israel and Gaza but Israel maintained its blockade .
` Viva Chavez '
The South African Communist Party 's Richard Mamobolo expressed his party 's support for a campaign of boycotts , divestments and sanctions against Israel .
Mamobolo echoed the call by the Congres of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) -- issued in media releases and repeated at last week 's protest in Johannesburg , yesterday 's march in Cape Town and today 's march in Durban -- for the South African government to expel the Israeli ambassador and implements sanctions against Israel .
The repeated calls for the severing of diplomatic relations with Israel were accompanied by chants of ``Viva Chavez , Viva ' ' , in reference to the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador from Venezuela by that country 's president , Hugo Chavez .
Other slogans at the protest included : `` Free , free Palestine '' , ``Phansi ( down with ) Mubarak , phansi ' ' , and ``Long live the Palestinian resistance ' ' .
A memorandum was handed over to embassy staff , addressed to Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak :
Memorandum
To President Hosni Mubarak , president of the Arab Republic of Egypt
9 January 2009
We who have gathered today outside the Egyptian Embassy in Pretoria , South Africa , declare our belief that your government is complicit in the starvation and massacre of Palestinian people in Gaza .
We share the pain of Palestinians and people of conscience around the globe when we realise that , while the Israeli Occupation Forces continue to butcher Palestinians , your regime refuses fully to open the Rafah crossing .
While Israeli bombs devastate schools , mosques and homes , and while Israeli forces have murdered almost 800 Palestinians and maimed about 3,500 in the past two weeks , you refuse to do the one thing that can bring a great deal of succour to an oppressed population .
Some 1.5 million people in Gaza are without food , electricity , water or medicines .
It is impossible for you not to know that they are being massacred with tank shells , missiles and bombs night and day , that illegal weaponry such as white phosphorous and cluster bombs is being used against civilians .
It is a human catastrophe .
The atrocities include the killing of 42 women and children sheltering at a UN school .
Despite the scale of suffering , you remain resolute in your collaboration with Israel and your determination to prevent Palestinian refugees from crossing into Egypt .
To people of conscience , it looks like support for nothing less than state terrorism .
Your regime has fully cooperated with Israel 's siege of Gaza , which has prevented goods , fuel , food and medicine from reaching the people .
Palestinians built tunnels as lifelines .
We again salute the Egyptians who helped them do this .
We cannot understand why , in a callous fashion , your government prevents even Egyptian doctors from entering Gaza .
It shamefully prevents Egyptians from demonstrating against the carnage ; it has arrested hundreds of Egyptian protestors .
Despite this repression , tens of thousands of Egyptians have taken to the streets .
We salute them .
Mr President , we know and remember that :
On the 25th December 2008 , two days before the bombing of Gaza began , the Egyptian foreign minister Ahmed Abul Gheit held hands with Tzipi Livni .
To most of us in the rest of the world , this was a signal of your government 's quiescence of the planned massacre of Palestinians .
The murderous plan was hatched six months ago - even while Israel was negotiating a ceasefire with Hamas , with your assistance .
The heads of Israeli and Egyptian intelligence met four days after the bombing .
What did it mean what your security chief asked his Israeli counterpart why the campaign had not ended in three days as had been promised ?
What did it mean when the Israeli security chief responded that your security services had not provided sufficient information ?
Could we read anything into this but the blatant collaboration between your security forces and those of the Zionist state ?
Could this mean anything other than that your people assisted the Israeli Occupation Forces in their murderous plans ?
You said you will not open the Rafah border unless Mahmoud Abbas ' Palestinian Authority takes control .
In this statement are echoes of the Israeli , US and EU governments .
But , have you forgotten that it was Hamas that was democratically elected in an election universally regarded as free and fair - an honour that neither you nor Abbas can claim ?
You have ensured that , in Egypt , emergency laws have been in operation since 1981 and there have been no real elections .
You do not even allow your people legally to demonstrate or strike .
Human rights abuses by your security forces , including torture , are rife .
Under the brokerage of the US government , you signed a trade pact with Israel , providing cheap Arab labour for Israeli bosses .
The pact makes Egyptian access to US markets conditional on collaboration with Israel .
Workers in your country have protested against this economic blackmail , and have been brutally suppressed by your security forces .
We note , also , the current attempt by your government to broker a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel .
While any attempts that will help stop the carnage and the genocide against Palestinians is welcome , we are concerned that this latest move seems also to aim to disarm Hamas , and , thus , depriving the Palestinian people of their right , under international law , to resist occupation by whatever means are necessary .
Neither we , nor the Palestinian people , nor justice - loving people around the world can view as just a ' ceasefire ' which disarms those who resist occupation and the genocide of their people while placing no restrictions on the arming of the murderous occupying forces .
We join with people of conscience around the world - including the majority of Egyptians -- in calling on you to :
1. Open the Rafah Crossing immediately and permanently ;
2. Facilitate the movement of medical personnel , medical supplies and food into Gaza ;
3 . Recognise the democratic will of the Palestinian people and recognise Hamas as the elected authority for the Palestinian people ;
4 . End all collaboration with the Apartheid state of Israel ;
5. Invalidate all trade and other cooperation with Israel ;
6 . Rally the rest of the Arab world to support the just cause of the Palestinian people , to end all relations with Israel and to implement sanctions against Israel ; and
7 . Release all those detained by your security forces for their protests against Israel .

Combine air and natural gas over an iron oxide catalyst under high pressure and intense heat and what do you get ?
The answer , surprisingly , is plant food : ammonia , the chemical precursor to nitrogen fertilizers .
Ammonia gets converted into nitrites and nitrates , which when sprinkled onto plants , allow them to grow larger .
This is the basic idea behind the huge increases in agricultural yields , doubling between 1950 and 1990 , seen in the 20th century .
( Caveats about the " quality " of this growth and the environmental impacts of nitrogen are noted , but left aside for a later post in this continuing series ) .
Back around 1915 , the world produced almost no nitrogen fertilizer , largely because there was no usable nitrogen supply .
Now , the world produces about 87 million tons of N - based fertilizers .
This increase is primarily due to the Haber - Bosch process for pulling nitrogen out of the air .
( The development of new plant varieties that are able to soak in excess nitrogen will also be the subject of a separate post ) .
Clearly , the Haber - Bosch process has been successful .
As we 've noted before , at least one professor has estimated that 40 percent of the world 's food can be traced back to the process .
But the process is encountering major problems in the increasingly resource - constrained world .
Here 's why : the main reaction in the process is cooking N 2 and H 2 together at 500 degrees Celsius and 200 atmospheres of pressure .
You need all that heat and pressure because breaking apart an N 2
molecule turns out to be incredibly difficult .
A nitrogen atom has five electrons in its outer shell ( valence electrons ) , so it has a tendency to share three electrons with another nitrogen atom to reach its stable ( octet rule ) state .
That 's what generates dinitrogen 's triple covalent bond , one of the strongest in nature .
The energy required to break the bond is 946 kilojoules of energy per mole of nitrogen , or twice the energy required to bust an O 2 molecule .
Luckily , or so we thought , fossil fuels were cheap , widely available , and incredibly energy dense : 1 cubic foot of natural gas contains 1.055 gigajoules of energy .
That 's enough energy to convert a lot of moles of nitrogen into ammonia .
So , once the Haber - Bosch process established it could be done , chemists across the world began to burn a lot of natural gas to get dinitrogen to react with hydrogen .
And where do we get the hydrogen ?
Why , we use the natural gas for that too , naturally : it is CH 4 after all .
Taken together , there 's a lot of natural gas going into the production of nitrogen fertilizer .
So much so that when I tweeted about my fertilizer investigation , my friend Celeste LeCompte , managing editor at the
Sustainable Industries Journal , tweeted back , " Think : natural gas . "
In effect , we 've been pumping fossil energy into our food supply , and eating it .
While diminishing fossil fuel supplies and climate concerns have given us perfect hindsight into why this could be a dubious path for the future , at the time , it must have seemed like an excellent idea , given that the alternative –not producing enough food –was both real and horrific .
Until relatively recently , the price of natural gas , which tracks the price of oil very closely , was relatively low .
Now , with oil over
$ 120 a barrel and natural gas prices having doubled since the mid-90s to over $ 11 per thousand cubic feet of the stuff , the cost of ammonia has tripled .
As in biofuels or alternative energy , the rising cost of oil is driving innovation .
As we 've noted before , legumes developed symbiotic relationships with bacteria who can pull nitrogen out of the air at room temperature and standard atmospheric pressure .
They use a specialized enzyme known as a nitrogenase that consists of iron and the metal molybdenum .
In fact , scientists estimate that 200 million tons of nitrogen are fixed via natural processes , or more than twice human production .
Now teams of scientists across the world from Richard Schrock at MIT to
David Tyler at the University of Oregon are racing to find just the right catalyst to recreate the natural nitrogen fixation process .
While they would n't eliminate the use of natural gas as a feedstock , they would reduce the amount of energy used in the creation of ammonia .
How much ?
Eliminating the Haber - Bosch process , which uses an estimated one percent of the world 's total 15 terawatts of energy consumption ( xls ) would mean 150 gigawatts of energy savings for the world .
That 's about as much coal generating capacity as the US is planning to add between now and 2030 .
In the next post in this continuing series dedicated to exploring new fertilizer technologies that could reduce their environmental impact and energy usage while increasing food security * , we 'll explore these scientists ' biomimetic work . *

The National Institute of Standards and Technology ( NIST ) today released its final report on the Sept. 11 , 2001 , collapse of the 47 - story World Trade Center building 7 ( WTC 7 ) in New York City .
The final report is strengthened by clarifications and supplemental text suggested by organizations and individuals worldwide in response to the draft WTC 7 report , released for public comment on Aug. 21 , but the revisions did not alter the investigation team ’s major findings and recommendations , which include identification of fire as the primary cause for the building ’s failure .
The extensive three - year scientific and technical building and fire safety investigation found that the fires on multiple floors in WTC 7 , which were uncontrolled but otherwise similar to fires experienced in other tall buildings , caused an extraordinary event .
Heating of floor beams and girders caused a critical support column to fail , initiating a fire - induced progressive collapse that brought the building down .
In response to comments from the building community , NIST conducted an additional computer analysis .
The goal was to see if the loss of WTC 7 ’s Column 79 — the structural component identified as the one whose failure on 9/11 started the progressive collapse — would still have led to a complete loss of the building if fire or damage from the falling debris of the nearby WTC 1 tower were not factors .
The investigation team concluded that the column ’s failure under any circumstance would have initiated the destructive sequence of events .
Other revisions to the final WTC 7 report included :
Expanding the discussion of firestopping , the material placed between floors to prevent floor - to - floor fire spread ;
Clarifying the description of thermal expansion as it related to WTC 7 ’s shear studs and floor beams ; and
Explaining in greater detail the computer modeling approach used to define where and when the fire in WTC 7 started and the extent of window breakage as a result of fire .
With the release of the final WTC 7 report , NIST has completed its federal building and fire safety investigation of the WTC disaster that began in August 2002 .
A three - year study of the collapses of the WTC towers ( WTC 1 and 2 ) was completed in October 2005 .
More than 20 changes in the U.S. model building and fire codes have already been adopted based on the findings and recommendations from the investigation .
NIST will now work with various public and private groups toward implementing additional changes to the U.S. model building and fire codes including those based on the 13 recommendations from the WTC 7 report ( one new and 12 reiterated from the towers investigation ) .
The complete text of the final WTC 7 report , and a video describing the WTC 7 investigation findings are available on the NIST website .

The five billion euros man , Jérôme Kerviel , stepped involuntarily out of the shadows yesterday , 12 months after he became the most talked about , and sought after , man on the planet .
In a lengthy newspaper interview – which he later contested – the alleged rogue trader gave his first extensive public explanation of how he came to lose almost €5bn for the French bank , Société Générale .
M. Kerviel , 32 , was quoted as saying that he had taken " orgasmic pleasure " in making " astronomic " bets on financial markets .
He said that he had lost " all sense of reality " but that his initial , enormous trading successes had been approved by bank chiefs .
His superiors had , he said , called him " the cash machine " .
They only started to challenge the " crazy risks " he was taking when he began to lose money early last year .
M. Kerviel admitted that he had been briefly racked by guilt when he hit the trading " jackpot " on the day that terrorist bombs exploded in London in July 2005 .
" I made € 500,000 in a few seconds ... I was jubilant .
Suddenly I realised that I was having fun because people had been hurt by bombs .
I ran to the toilet and vomited . "

Something similar happened on the day of the 9/11 attacks in New York , he said .
On that day , Soc Gen had made " colossal " trading gains – the highest in its history .
Despite his " moment of weakness " in July 2005 , the young trader went on to bet huge , unauthorised sums on the ups and downs of European stock markets – mostly the downs – for another two and a half years .
In a radio interview yesterday morning , M. Kerviel claimed that he had given no formal interview to the newspaper Le Parisien .
He said that the remarks published in the newspaper had been made in private and that the published extracts had been " shoved together " and " taken out of context " .
One of his four - strong team of lawyers admitted later , however , that the interview – actually based on six interviews – was genuine and accurate .
He said that M. Kerviel had reacted angrily because the article had been published , without prior agreement , on the day that he was to be questioned for a final time by investigating magistrates .
The former trader 's fury may have been fuelled by the fact that the newspaper quoted him as making an attack on the magistrates themselves .
M. Kerviel accused them of consistently rejecting his side of the story and accepting the bank 's argument that it was merely the innocent victim of a malicious act of financial " terrorism " .
" I have the impression that this has been an investigation sponsored by Société Générale , " M. Kerviel said .
Under French law , investigating magistrates are required to examine the evidence both " for and against " the guilt of a suspect .
The magistrates investigating the Kerviel case are expected to recommend in the next couple of weeks that he should be prosecuted for breach of trust , falsifying documents and hacking into the bank 's computers to cover his tracks .
A possible charge of fraud was dropped last January because the magistrates accepted that M. Kerviel had never attempted to embezzle a centime of the billions of euros that passed across his computer screen .

The trial is , however , not expected to take place before the end of this year or early in 2010 .
M. Kerviel has become something of a cult hero since his activities were revealed 12 months ago tomorrow .
He has a fan club .
He been the protagonist of a comic book .
His story is to be made into a film .
His heroic stature has , if anything , been enhanced since the risky and complex investments of most financial institutions worldwide plunged the globe into recession .
M. Kerviel is being portrayed by his fans – and by his legal team – as a mere ant or foot - soldier in a much larger frenzy of banking speculation which was encouraged from the highest level .
One of his four lawyers , Maître Eric Dupond - Moretti , said after yesterday 's interrogation by magistrates that M. Kerviel had been abandoned by his bosses like " rats leaving a sinking ship " .
" Kerviel is not a victim .
He admits a certain number of things , " Maître Dupond - Moretti said .
" But the mechanism of control did not function at Société Générale " because the bank also " knew a certain number of things " .
" It 's a bit rich to leave Kerviel all alone as the sole person responsible for the losses of Société Générale , for the global credit crisis , for the sub - prime problem – for everything that we now know about , " the lawyer said .
On 24 January last year , Société Générale stunned the world when it announced that it had lost about € 4.9bn because of what it insisted were unauthorised trades by M. Kerviel on the futures market for European share prices .
The young trader immediately admitted to investigators that he had made enormous bets on the downward movement of shares but insisted that his superiors knew and had turned a blind eye – so long as he was winning .
In the remarks attributed to him by Le Parisien yesterday , the ex-trader told essentially the same story but in much more detail than ever before .
He admitted taking " crazy risks " and becoming obsessed with winning , as if he was " playing a computer game " .
He had , he said , " obstinately " refused to grasp that the trend of the market had turned against him in early 2008 .
" For a normal trader , a gain of € 30,000 to € 40,000 was a good day ...
For me , € 1 m was a rubbish day ...
I made astronomical gains which gave me , sometimes , an orgasmic pleasure , " he said .
By the end of 2007 , he said , he had made a € 1.7bn profit , which , he claimed , the bank had used to cover the losses of some of his colleagues .
" Everyone came and got stuck in [ to his earnings ] to refinance themselves , " he said .
" When I hear them say today that they knew nothing , I really think I am at the hypocrites ' ball . "
Of the day of the London bombings , in July 2005 , he said that he had made huge bets on a fall in the shares of insurance companies , especially the big German company Allianz .
When news came in of the terrorist attacks in London , the stock markets fell and " everyone began to lose money except me " .
Realising that he was profiting from death and injury , he said , he fled to the toilet to throw up .
" But this attack of weakness did n't last long and I went back to the trading floor and started working again . "
He told a superior what had happened to him .
The boss made a macabre revelation .
He told M. Kerviel that 9/11 – the day of the terror attacks on New York in 2002 – had been " the best day 's trading in the history of Société Générale .
That day , it seems , their gains were colossal . "
M. Kerviel said his superiors would not query his positions but they would come to him and say : " Hey , cash - machine , how much did you earn today ? "
M. Kerviel said it was " absurd " for Société Générale to claim that they were kept in the dark .
" In 2007 , when I made a trade from a collegue 's work station and made € 500,000 , I gave them a completely stupid explanation .
Something surreal .
They should never have believed me .
They said nothing ...
It was as if I was driving a jet - powered Ferrari .
For 365 laps , I overtake everyone else at 3,000 kph .
And they saw nothing .
They said nothing is that credible ? "
M. Kerviel is now living in a suburb of Paris and works for a computer company which belongs to a friend .
He said that he had received several job offers from investment funds and still had a hankering to go back to the trading floor .
" I look at what 's happening in the stock markets and I say ' that 's what everyone should be doing ' . "
M. Kerviel said that his dearest wish now was to return to obscurity .
He said that his obsessive behaviour as a banker had destroyed his relationship with a girl - friend and distanced him from his mother .
But he said that he and his mother had become " much closer again " since he was arrested last year .
" If I had a bit of money , " he said , " I would go off with my mum for a holiday so she could calm down a bit . "

On the Failure of the Church to Educate
Finally , the 21st century Apologist needs to take Apologetics far more seriously .
He needs to incorporate Apologetics into every aspect of his or her ministry : every sermon , every class , every evangelistic activity .
We have woefully neglected our responsibility to train our young people in the solid case for Christianity , and then we wonder why they depart from the faith under the influence of secular university instruction .
We give our parishioners and our missionaries no foundation in the defence of the faith , and then wonder why our evangelistic efforts show so little fruit in a world where people have long moved beyond accepting something just because someone else believes it .
-- John Warwick Montgomery
Even with the proliferation of Bibles today , Christians are reading their Bibles less and less .
I believe the evangelical church has only 50 years of life left ... because of marginalization of the Word of God .
We need another Reformation !
The enemy of the gospel now is not religious hierarchy but moral anarchy , not tradition but entertainment .
The enemy of the gospel is Protestantism run amuck ; it is an anti-intellectual , anti-knowledge , feel - good faith that has no content and no convictions .
Part of the communal repentance that is needed is a repentance about the text .
And even more importantly , there must be a repentance with regard to Christ our Lord .
Just as the Bible has been marginalized , Jesus Christ has been ‘ buddy - ized . ’
His transcendence and majesty are only winked at , as we turn him into the genie in the bottle , beseeching God for more conveniences , more luxury , less hassle , and a life without worries or lack of comfort .
He no longer wears the face that the apostles recognized .
...
The God we worship today no longer resembles the God of the Bible .
Unless we return to him through a reading and digesting of the scriptures — through a commitment to the text , the evangelical church will become irrelevant , useless , dead .
-- Dr. Daniel Wallace
This is an article about how the church at large has failed us .
The following is not meant to imply that there are not exceptions to the rules to be discussed , and you may well be part of a local church body without these failings , and if you are , you should be glad of it ; however , let 's be honest , most churches ARE failing when it comes to these matters we will herein discuss .
The problem that I see reoccurring time and time again is :
Our churches do not educate people in the basics of their faith .
We seldom , if ever , hear about things like textual criticism , the authenticity of the Gospels , alleged " copycat " savior gods or even basic doctrine .
Churches , instead , have fallen for the postmodernist indulgence of self , concentrating more on entertainment value ministry ( i.e. , skateboard demonstrations ) .
Such churches would rarely consider inviting a teacher , whether an apologist , Biblical scholar or a seminary professor , for rather unclear reasons .
I suspect it is because many pastors feel threatened by having someone around who might " correct " them , but I am sure simple ignorance of what is out there plays a role too .
Because our people are not educated in these matters , they are caught " flat footed " when confronted with them .
Some people are unaffected and simply go on their merry way .
Good for them , maybe , though such people also often stand in the way when someone tries to up the intellectual ante a bit , while others start having questions .
Their pastors cannot answer their questions because they too are generally lacking in such knowledge .
Their degrees are more geared towards counseling or some form of preaching technique , similar to Sunday School teachers and other figures of authority , who generally have even less relevant education .
Persons with questions are told such things as questioning is evil or they should have faith , etc .
None of which is satisfactory .
The lack of education also extends to the public sector , where people are not taught to think critically , nor to evaluate credibility of sources but rather that everyone 's opinion is as good as anyone else 's .
The church often teaches this as well , explicity or implicitly .
Persons with questions come across skeptical literature in print or online that is mostly written by persons with no better education in the relevant areas .
However , because the reader also lacks the necessary education and thinking skills , the base level of what is called " common sense " ( as it would often be , if indeed the facts were as the literature says ) becomes persuasive precisely because of their lack of knowledge .
For example , ignorance of the process and science of textual criticism could lead to the erroneous " common sense " conclusion that there is some problem in that we have " only copies of copies of copies " of the New Testament …and , by this time it is often too late to even provide such people with sound material by credible authorities .
They are not able to comprehend even the simplest defense at times ( and indeed , certain things simply can NOT be simplified so much , for otherwise they lose power and credibility as defenses ) , because they have not been given the adequate foundation to understand what someone like e.g. , a Bruce Metzger says about textual criticism .
Because it violates what they have taken to be a sound , " common sense " approach by a non-authority who is equally in the dark , it is simple for them to simply dismiss answering material as some sort of desperate effort to resolve what is really a very serious problem ( though in reality it is n't ) .
In May 2008 , an item at the Reclaiming the Mind blog ( link now dead ) wrote of the " epidemic " of defections from the church which mirrored these very kinds of thoughts rooted in inadequate education of textual criticism , etc. , :
Over 31 million Americans are saying " check please " to the church and are off to find answers elsewhere .
Jeff Schadt , coordinator of Youth Transition Network , says thousands of youth fall away from the church when transitioning from high school to college .
He and other youth leaders estimate that 65 to 94 percent of high school students stop attending church after graduating .
From my studies and experience I find that leaving church is many times the first visible step in one ’s pilgrimage away from Christ .
The question that we must ask ourselves is a very simple one - Why ?
Why are people leaving the faith and at this epidemic and alarming rate ?
In my studies , I have found that the two primary reasons people leave the faith are 1 ) intellectual challenges and 2 ) bad theology or misplaced beliefs .
First , I want to explain this transition process , focusing on the first : intellectual challenges .
You might even find yourself somewhere on this journey .
Step One : Doubt --
Here is where the person begins to examine his or her faith more critically by asking questions , expressing concerns and becoming transparent with their doubt , not a wholesale doubt but one that expresses an inner longing to have questions answered and the intellect satisfied to a greater degree .
Very often , such persons will inquire of mentors in the faith , requesting an audience for their doubt .
Step Two : Discouragement --
This is where the person becomes frustrated because they are not finding the answers .
They ask questions but the answers ( or lack thereof ) cause them discouragement .
Their church may even tell them that such questions are “ unchristian . ”
Their Sunday school teacher says , " I do n’t know .
You just have to believe . "
Others simply say , " That ’s a good question , I have never thought of it before , " and then go on their way …on their own leap - of - faith journey .
Step Three : Disillusionment --
Now the person begins to become disillusioned with Christianity in general and proceeds to doubt much more deeply .
They feel betrayed by those who made them believe about Christ , very often feeling that much of their former faith was naïve , since not even their most trusted mentors could ( or would ) answer basic questions about the Bible , history , or faith .
In their thinking , the intellect has become illegitimized and the church is therefore an illegitimate contender for their mind .
Step Four : Apathy --
At this point in the journey , the disillusioned Christian becomes apathetic to finding the answers , believing that the answers do n’t exist .
They are firmly on their way to atheism , agnosticism or pure skepticism , but do n’t have the courage to admit it to themselves or others .
Many times , those in this stage live as closet unbelievers , believing it is not worth it to come clean about their departure from the faith .
They want a peaceful existence in their unbelief without creating controversy .
Therefore , they are content to remain closet unbelievers .
Step Five : Departure --
At this stage the fact that they have left the faith has become real to them and they are willing to announce it to the world , and because of their sense of betrayal , they feel as if it is their duty to become evangelists for the cause of unbelief .
Their goal and mission becomes to unconvert the converted .
What can or needs to be done about this unnecessary dilemma ?
Taking your church through " Purpose Driven Life " wo n't solve this .
Reading " Left Behind " novels wo n't solve this .
More contemporary music programs , " extreme " skateboard demonstrations and " seeker - friendly " techniques wo n't solve this .
Joel Osteen will DEFINITELY not solve this by his pandering to what are perceived as " needs " , which is really a part of the problem , not the solution .
There is a broad failure to distinguish between " needs " and " wants " .
Your average Sunday School materials , which strain mightily to make passages like Is. 42 somehow relevant to the average working person , wo n't solve this .
Building a new church gymnasium wo n't solve this .
Youth programs involving gimmicks and games wo n't solve this .
Passing out tracts wo n't solve this .
Simplifying the sermons even more and not mentioning sin wo n't solve this .
Of course , I 'm being facetious .
The only way to solve this is with a solid educational program , which is exactly what we lack in so many of our churches .
It 's time for fewer prefab sermons , with their rampant de-contextualizations and time for more demonstrations ( teachings ) on textual criticism , the authenticity of the Gospels and so on .
It 's time to make such efforts a priority and not a “ catch up ” step we take after the damage is already done .
It 's time to be proactive instead of reactive .
It 's time to make these things something that is discussed from the pulpit on Sunday morning , not hidden away in Sunday night church training classes or a weeknight Bible study .
It 's also time to make this part of our evangelism , throwing away or at least de-prioritizing all the gimmicks like the " Evangecubes " and the tracts .
Recently ( 10/07 ) , a reader pointed me to an article here by Bob Burney , which serves to emphasize the failure of the " here I am , entertain me " seeker - sensitive model most of which is worth using here :
... For most of a generation evangelicals have been romanced by the " seeker sensitive " movement spawned by Willow Creek Community Church in Chicago ...
Perhaps inadvertently , with this " new wave " of ministry , came a de-emphasis on taking personal responsibility for Bible study combined with an emphasis on felt - needs based " programs " and slick marketing .
The size of the crowd , rather than the depth of the heart , determined success .
If the crowd was large , then surely God was blessing the ministry .
Churches were built by demographic studies , professional strategists , marketing research , meeting " felt needs " and sermons consistent with these techniques .
We were told that preaching was out , relevance was in .
Doctrine did n't matter nearly as much as innovation .
If it was n't " cutting edge " and consumer friendly it was doomed .
The mention of sin , salvation and sanctification were taboo and replaced by Starbucks , strategy and sensitivity .
Thousands of pastors hung on every word that emanated from the lips of the church growth experts .
Satellite seminars were packed with hungry church leaders learning the latest way to " do church . "
The promise was clear … thousands of people and millions of dollars could n't be wrong .
Forget what people need , give them what they want .
How can you argue with the numbers ?
If you dared to challenge the " experts " you were immediately labeled as a " traditionalist , " a throwback to the 50s , a stubborn dinosaur unwilling to change with the times .
All that changed recently .
Willow Creek has released the results of a multi- year study on the effectiveness of their programs and philosophy of ministry .
The study 's findings are in a new book titled Reveal : Where Are You ? , co-authored by Cally Parkinson and Greg Hawkins , executive pastor of Willow Creek Community Church .
Hybels himself called the findings " earth shaking … ground breaking … mind blowing " , and no wonder , because it seems that the " experts " were wrong .
The report reveals that most of what they have been doing for these many years and what they have taught millions of others to do is not producing solid disciples of Jesus Christ .
Numbers yes , but not disciples .
It gets worse .
Hybels laments : " Some of the stuff that we have put millions of dollars into thinking it would really help our people grow and develop spiritually , when the data actually came back it was n't helping people that much .
Other things that we did n't put that much money into and did n't put much staff against is stuff our people are crying out for . "
If you simply want a crowd , the " seeker sensitive " model produces results .
If you want solid , sincere , mature followers of Christ , it 's a bust .
In a shocking confession , Hybels states : " We made a mistake .
What we should have done when people crossed the line of faith and became Christians , we should have started telling people and teaching people that they have to take responsibility to become ' self feeders . '
We should have gotten people , taught people , how to read their bible between services , how to do the spiritual practices much more aggressively on their own . "
The error of the seeker sensitive movement is monumental in its scope .
The foundation of thousands of American churches is now discovered to be mere sand .
The one individual who has had perhaps the greatest influence on the American church in our generation has now admitted his philosophy of ministry , in large part , was a " mistake . "
The extent of this error defies measurement .
What we should find encouraging , at least , in this " confession " coming from the highest ranks of the Willow Creek Association , is that they are coming to realize that their existing " model " does not help people grow into mature followers of Jesus Christ .
Given the massive influence this organization has had on the American church today , let us pray that God would be pleased to put structures in place at Willow Creek that foster not mere numeric growth , but growth in grace .
Here 's a more personal account that verifies Burney 's points .
I recently received this testimony from a reader ( names have been deleted or altered so as to protect the reader 's identity ) .
You 'll recall that I 've been in touch with you in the past and even got your site linked on our ( name and location of church ) high school ministry website some time ago .
I 'm writing you because of the distress I 'm feeling after many weeks and months of observation of changes taking place in our church of approximately #000 members , and conversations with a few fellow believers concerning those changes .
I sat under the teaching of _____ ______ at _______ Church in ______ , a member of the ( denominational group ) ... for nearly 20 years .
( The pastor ) is a graduate of BIOLA and founded in sound doctrine , preaching the need for repentance and forgiveness .
Two years ago he accepted a position in _____________ which , of course , necessitated the search for a new head pastor .
That search resulted in the hiring of one ____ __________ , a disciple of the " seeker format " promulgated by Rick Warren and used in the mega - church from which he came , Willow Creek in Illinois .
Our services have changed over the last year since he began teaching .
There 's been a gradual shift in the appearance of the " primary " service held in the sanctuary ... including an increased use of media and visual arts to convey messages .
I do n't object to this in particular ... but the saturation , even for one of my preferences , has just about worn out it 's novelty and , therefore , impact in conveying the message it 's intended to communicate .
The seminal moment of my recognizing a need to begin a process of seeking to address other issues that are reflected in the seeker style of service came today , Resurrection Sunday .
Throughout the entire service this morning , the name of Jesus was lifted up .
Praises were sung , the difference between all other religions and Christianity was pointed out ( in general ) .
The cross that bridged the gap between man and God was demonstrated in the words spoken and the set that was constructed for the service .
So what was missing ?
Not once during the service , either in words sung or spoken , was the single most important reason for Christ 's sacrifice spoken of .
Sin .
Yes , Jesus ' death on the cross was the bridge , but only as a means to a " fuller life " , a " life of service " , a " life after death " , the " life you 've always wanted " .
As I write this and contemplate the words about to be typed , I 've literally begun to cry .
Not once was it mentioned that Jesus died on the Cross for my sin .
Yes , it was said he died for me , but FOR WHAT ??
So I can have a happier life here in this world ?
Of course that 's true !
So I can spend eternity with Him and with the Father and the Holy Spirit in His heaven ?
Yes !!
Emphatically !
Yes !!
That is the end result of his sacrifice .
But the question stands ?
Why did He NEED to die for me ?
And that single thought , the basis of salvation , the reason
He suffered on the cross on my behalf , was never mentioned .
Not once .
I grew up in the United Methodist Church .
I heard the same message there for the first 17 years of my life .
" Jesus loves you and died for you . "
But no one ever confronted me with my personal responsibility in that death and the cause of it .
I remember distinctly that my salvation experience was the result of being convinced of my need for the Savior because I was a sinner .
Not because I would spend eternity in darkness separated from the Creator .
Not because I needed more " things " .
Not because my life was a horrible experience .
Heck , I was making decent money , enjoying the company of numerous women , and getting high on a daily basis , so in my limited view of a __ year old white male I was doing great !
Again it was that the word was preached .
I heard that I was a sinner ( and why what I was doing was a sin ) , I heard that Christ loved me and died for me , and that the solution to the terrible conviction I was under was a relationship with Him .
Today , of all days , I expected to be able to go to the church I 've attended for __ years and hear the glorious message of Christ 's salvation preached .
I was immensely disappointed , as you can tell .
Michael Patton at Reclaiming the Mind concurs :
Everyone will go through the doubt phase .
Everyone should ask questions about the faith .
If you have not asked the " How do you know . . . " questions about the message of the Gospel , this is not a good thing .
We should be challenged to think through these questions early in the faith .
The Church needs to rethink its education program .
Expositional preaching , while important , is not enough .
Did you hear that ?
Expositional preaching is not enough .
It does not provide the discipleship venue that is vital for us to prevent and overcome this epidemic .
We should not fool ourselves into thinking that it does .
The church has been on an intellectual diet for the last century and we are suffering from theological atrophy .
What else do you expect when we have replaced theological discipleship with a gluttonous promotion of entertainment , numbers , and fast - food Christianity that can produce nothing more than a veneer of faith seasoned for departure ?
The solution : to reform our educational program in the church .
To lay theological foundations through critical thinking .
To understand that the great commission is to make disciples , not simply converts .
And most importantly , we must pray that God will grant a revival of the mind knowing that without the power of the Holy Spirit , no amount of intellectual persuasion can change an antagonistic heart .
Right now there is little or nothing being done to stop our churches turning down the wrong path as the one above did .
That needs to be stopped .
Evangelical atheism ( embodied by the likes of Harris , Dawkins and Dennett ) is an intellectual wasteland , but we can't expect people to know this .
Your church needs to be ready for challenges , and we need to test our churches to see how ready they are , and be willing to either reform one that is n't ready , or leave one that refuses to reform , and do what we can to encourage others not to attend .
What 's a good way to test your church ?
Did your church do anything about The Da Vinci Code ?
What , and when ( Sunday morning when so many people were there , or on some obscure night when they know only a handful will show up ) ?
?
What , and when ( Sunday morning when so many people were there , or on some obscure night when they know only a handful will show up ) ?
How about the Gospel of Judas ?
Was anything said about it ?
Is the youth ministry getting the youth ready for when they will go to college and have stuff like The Christ Conspiracy put to them ?
put to them ?
Any word on Bart Ehrman 's best - selling book Misquoting Jesus ?
?
If you try to discuss things like Deuteronomy in terms of an ancient suzerainty treaty ( which is very important to understanding its role and application today ) , or the argument stricture of 1 Cor. 14 ( key to understanding the " women keep silent " passage ) is there anyone on church staff you can discuss this intelligently with , or who shows interest , or do their eyes just glaze over ?
Are they more concerned with entertaining than with teaching ?
I am not talking about use of media ( like PowerPoint ) ; there is nothing wrong with this , because people have different learning styles .
I am talking about substance lacking while stimulation takes the fore .
There are some answers to this that are no good :
" This kind of approach will intimidate people . "
Does it occur to someone who says this , that the Gospel was a very intimidating message in its time , one that upended all of the social values of its day ?
Let 's not water down the facts or the message behind them for the sake of making yet more converts without an adequate foundation .
I have noted in my own teaching experience that many , many people , once they start listening to educational material , are very interested and pay close attention , and that they are not always in want of titillating entertaiments , as some churches seem to think .
To use a common metaphor , the reason they eat Hostess Ding Dongs is because that is all you 're serving them .
Indeed , one gentleman said of my teaching that while he did n't understand it all the time , it got him " fired up " to learn more so that he could , and that 's the kind of attitude we need to instill .
" The Holy Spirit will move people . "
Then you do n't need to preach watered - down sermons either , do you ?
Obviously , no one practices this idea consistently except for the sort of person who a century or so back would not send a missionary to India under the reasoning that the Spirit would do all the work without missionaries .
At least they were consistent in their approach .
" We need to stick with our program . "
No , you do n't because it 's not working , and that is the very point .
Too many pastors and church leaders seem to find it threatening to depart from the scheduled Sunday School lesson , such that you 'd think the Lifeway series was itself inerrant and infallible .
Some are also afraid of something being taught that they can't understand themselves ( that was what you went to seminary for -- or were supposed to ) , or of some influential / wealthy leader in the congregation getting upset when someone teaches a varied yet orthodox belief ( such as orthodox preterism ) that they personally find offensive .
It 's the Body of Christ , and it is supposed to have a spine , too .
And , here are some good questions from a reader with similar concerns :
How can I find a church in my area that stays abreast of " hot topics " that attempt to falsify the Christian faith ?
What other questions can I ask my current church that would help me to get a sense of their direction ?
I 'm putting these two questions together because the answers to both of them are much the same .
We had a good chance here provided by The Da Vinci Code .
Ask for a copy of whatever teachings they had on it from the pulpit .
If they had none , you have an answer .
If they did have some , listen to it and see how they deal with it -- with facts ?
With appeal to " just believe " ?
Also , simply ask about some of the hot topics and how those have been handled .
Someone who answers your question about the Gospel of Judas with a " huh ? " is not doing a good job .
Another thing I like to do is ask a pastor who their favorite Biblical scholar is .
I did this once and got the answer , " Warren Wiersbe " -- who is a pastor , not a scholar .
See if they know of certain people like Wright or Witherington .
If their knowledge of apologetics is limited to a copy of ETDAV , that is a bad sign .
And , see if they have a staff position for education pastor ( if it is a large enough church ) .
As bad as it is , you might just be able to ask if they know what " apologetics " is and get an answer that tells you all you need to know .
If my church does n't see the need for stronger apologetics how can I convince them otherwise ?
One of the most powerful things you can do is show them the results of the neglect .
I have gathered a small notebook of powerful " anti-testimonies " from people like Dan Barker ; if you want a copy , ask me and I 'll send it .
These anti-testimonies show that there is a strong desire to " anti-evangelize " .
You might also be able to raise awareness by bringing copies of material like Losing Faith in Faith and asking staff how they 'd deal with someone who got hold of it and started thinking it was valid .
This may be like hitting an anthill with a firehose , but if that 's what it takes , so be it .
Things are in such a state now that it is time to leave those who will not grow , behind .
It 's to the point where such churches and leaders are a cancer to the Body of Christ , and that means its time for some spiritual chemotherapy .
Another thing you might be able to do is talk to some members about these issues and see if they have been looking for answers .
As noted , I have found that yes , people DO want answers ; and many will say that they have had questions all their life .
If they have been looking for answers , provide some and use that as a point in favor of change :
The need obviously exists .
But if this does n't wake them up , be warned :
It will just make them hide deeper in their shell .
But that 's a good thing , because again , as serious as the problem is , the method is like the bumper sticker that says , " Lead , follow , or get out of the way . "
The ones who hide in their shell or who continue to neglect the problem can and need to get out of the way .
What do you see as the role or duty of the average churchgoer in this regard ?
This is an excellent question that came from a reader who is rather sympathetic to what I have expressed above .
In essence , what do I think the " ideal " Joe in the pew should know ( or not know ) ?
How about deacons , pastors , leaders ?
There 's no " pat " answer on this , given the complexity of lives and needs out there , but let me set out some general guidelines in terms of how I 'd answer this .
The Mandatory Foundation :
The only things I place in this category -- which is what I think every Christian should know , even if they just serve soup at the homeless kitchen -- are core doctrines of Christianity and how they work and are defended .
What 's in here ?
Definitely the atonement , salvation , the Trinity , the nature of God in general .
I 'd also put a basic defense of the resurrection ( without which , our faith is in vain ! ) in this category .
Not stuff like copycat saviors myths , Calvin vs. Arminius , Greco - Roman rhetoric or Gnostic cults .
Everyone should also be aware of at least where to look for or find answers on things like copycat savior gods and the Christ myth , even if they do n't want to master any of these subjects .
I do n't think this is at all unreasonable , given that it would place us on a level , in the first century , with people like Peter and John .
What must be remembered is that for Peter and John , things like client - patron relationships ( as it would relate , e.g. , to salvation ) and hypostatic Wisdom ( as it would relate to the Trinity ) were already part of their mental furniture , so to speak , and we 've got a deficiency because we lost it -- dare I say , we 're actually , as a whole , less informed than Peter and John when it comes to certain things that were part of their world .
The fact is that there is no excuse for Christians not to be able to articulate what they believe , and why , and that means being informed where the foundation is concerned .
The Middle Level :
If you 're a teacher , or a deacon , then I 'd like to see a higher level of awareness .
I referred above to knowing where to find answers , if you 're Joe Pew .
If you 're Joe Deacon or Joe Sunday School Teacher , then I think you need to be one of the people that goes out to find answers for ones self and others on things like copycat saviors gods and the Christ myth .
Not master all of it , but at least be articulate and master a couple of areas so that you can be competent to informally judge matters in other subjects on the basis of experience .
People at this level also ought to " network " so that each CAN be free to specialize in some areas and leave the rest to others to whom they can refer .
The Upper Crust :
Things get a little dicey here , as they relate to church offices today , which of course do not mirror that well the original model of the first century based on the synagogue .
Ideally , a church should have a person competent in the very difficult topics like Calvin vs.
Arminius ; or if a church is too small or financially strapped , they can co-op with other churches so that such an expert is available to them .
Perhaps a local seminary professor could be tapped as a consultant in this regard ( and in line with the above , be allowed to do things like preach and teach ) so that a pastor can attend to more personal needs of the flock ( if they do n't want to be the " go to " person themselves ) .
In this regard , I 'd parallel it in the early church to where certain key leaders like Matthew , Paul and Luke were among the most educated in their time .
1 of 12 apostles makes for between 5 and 10 percent , and it'd be nice if we had even that many prepared for the toughest questions , but even that we do n't reach now .
Consider this a call to action .
Despite the common stereotype , intellectual questions are not always merely a smokescreen for spiritual or moral problems .
To be effective in equipping young people and professionals to face the challenges of a highly educated secular society , the church needs to redefine the mission of pastors and youth leaders to include training in apologetics and worldview .
We must refuse to dismiss objections to the faith as mere spiritual subterfuge and instead prepare ourselves to give what Schaeffer called " honest answers to honest questions . "
When America was a young nation , the clergy were often the most highly educated members of the community .
The congregation looked up to them and respected their intellectual expertise .
Today , those sitting in the pews are often as highly educated as the pastor , and among the general population the clergy may even be looked down upon as narrowly trained functionaries .
In this climate , it is imperative for seminaries to broaden the education of pastors to include courses on intellectual history , training future pastors to critique the dominant ideologies of our day .
Pastors must once again provide intellectual leadership for their congregations , teaching apologetics from the pulpit .
Every time a minister introduces a biblical teaching , he should also instruct the congregation in ways to defend it against the major objections they are likely to encounter .
A religion that avoids the intellectual task and retreats to the therapeutic realm of personal relationships and feelings will not survive in today 's spiritual battlefield .

Reader adds this commentary :
With reference to the above , I think the problem in most churches , especially among the youth is more disturbing than we might think .
Since I first began teaching apologetics on Saturday nights at my home , a lot of young people have admitted to me that before they were presented with the evidence , they did not actually believe the Bible , even after attending church , confessing their sins , being baptized , etc .
We have many thousands / millions of people locked into a " seeking " phase , hoping that God exists and that the Bible is true , without ever reaching the " found " stage .
They can agree with the moral framework of christianity , enjoy the warmth of fellowship , appreciate the relief of getting off drugs and drink , and being free from immorality , etc. , yet still not actually KNOW that God exists and that the Gospel is true .
It ’s almost like a hippy / new age movement , with the Bible as the mythological Aesops Fable - like framework that " works " on a certain psychological plane .
Anyway , got to get my iPod loaded with some Hillsong tunes and get radical on my Quad - that 'll win over some youths .
September 2008 -- a reader sent me this account of an experience that I think helps illustrate our problem today :
I 'm currently going to a Christian university majoring in Biblical Text ( of course having to do with exegeting and understanding the Bible ) .
As a freshman , I must take a Life and Teachings of Jesus course ( it 's a required course for everyone ) .
It 's supposed to be more specialized as it is full of Bible majors ( in other words , people wanting to go into Ministry , Youth and Family Ministry , Missions , and the few like me who have the Biblical Text major ) .
Anyway , on our first day , the professor asked a few trivia questions and then proceeded to do a survey of the class .
The options given were roughly like the following : A. I believe in the Resurrection of Jesus because I see God in my life today .
B. I see God in my life today because I believe in the Resurrection of Jesus .
Roughly 30 - 35 % of the class picked A , while roughly 65 - 70 % of the class picked B ( which is the one I picked ) .
The professor then asked an open question of why we picked what we did .
One of those who picked A made an argument that sounded very much like an atheist one .
He acted like it was a problem that the documents we have that attest to the Resurrection are very old and that we were n't there to see it .
For some reason , he favors current " seeing God in his life " as a better testament to the Resurrection than those who actually saw the risen Jesus .
How sad it is that the evidence which is more ancient and greater in quantity and quality is dismissed in favor of subjective experiences that might be interpreted as " not God " in emotional lows .
I wonder if similarly he would reject all of ancient history since the documents are very old and we were n't there to see what the historians are reporting .
On a good note , someone else noted in response that if there was no Resurrection ( and good evidence for it ) , there would be no Christianity today and that it would have died out long ago as a small cult of Jesus ' early disciples if that ( sound familiar ? ) .
Someone responded to this with a rather vague statement that believing in the Resurrection because of the Bible rather than because of present experiences is like reading a novel and thinking that it 's true .
The professor stopped the discussion after that , but needless to say , I was appalled that a Christian aspiring to be a minister , missionary , or perhaps even a professor would say that .
I was also troubled by what the professor told us later .
He said that other times he had done the survey , the opposite result occurred .
He said that probably at least 70 - 75 % of the students picked A .
As JP has been saying for years , we need more education in the Church .
Anyone who disagrees for whatever reason , take a look at the fruit it is bearing amongst those who are attending the universities ( especially amongst those who desire to be ministers , missionaries , or maybe professors ) .
With ministers coming out of seminary thinking this way , is it any wonder we lack education in our churches and that apostasy and indifference are rampant ?

9/11 guilty pleas expose Guantánamo kangaroo court
By Bill Van Auken
10 December 2008
Washington ’s plans to stage a 9/11 show trial at its Guantánamo Bay prison camp were thrown into disarray Monday when it was revealed that the five defendants are seeking to enter immediate guilty pleas and forego any further legal proceedings .
The judge in the so - called military commission convened to hear the case , Army Col .
Stephen Henley , announced in the pretrial hearing that the tribunal had received a letter more than a month ago in which the five defendants had affirmed that they “ had decided that they wished to withdraw all motions ... and wished to enter pleas in what was termed confessions in this case . ”
The US government is seeking the death penalty against all five men , who have been held incommunicado for close to seven years , subjected to torture and denied the basic rights afforded to defendants in either civilian trials or a military court martial .
They are being prosecuted for war crimes in what amounts to a drumhead military tribunal , set up under the Military Commissions Act passed by the US Congress in 2006 .
The legislation set up a kangaroo court system in which defendants can be prosecuted on secret evidence , as well as hearsay evidence and confessions extracted through torture .
The defense attorneys and military officers appointed by the Pentagon are denied access to much of the evidence as well as to witnesses for the prosecution .
A number of the officers assigned to the commissions have resigned in protest , denouncing the system as a travesty of justice designed to rubber stamp the prosecution ’s indictments .
The US government had hoped to use the case against the five as a means of justifying its “ global war on terrorism ” and blunting the international condemnation of its use of torture , extraordinary rendition and detention without trial , methods with which the name Guantánamo has become synonymous .
Instead , the defendants ’ plea has threatened to deprive Washington of its show trial and has underscored the ramshackle character of the military commission system created to try them in which basic questions of legal procedure are being made up as the proceedings go along .
Addressing the court in English Monday , Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , the alleged chief organizer of the terrorist attacks on New York and Washington on September 11 , 2001 , told the judge : “ We do n’t want to waste our time with motions .
All of you are paid by the US government .
I ’m not trusting any American … I do not distinguish between the judge and my attorney and [ US President George W. ]
Bush and the CIA who tortured me . ”
The CIA has acknowledged that after his capture in Pakistan , it subjected Sheikh Mohammed to “ waterboarding , ” an interrogation method in which water is poured through a cloth over the mouth of a restrained prisoner , producing the effects of drowning .
The technique has been prosecuted by the US military as torture and has been deemed a war crime when used against American prisoners of war .
The other defendants — Ramzi Binalshibh , Mustafa Ahmed al - Hawsawi , Tawfiq bin Attash and Ammar al - Baluchi — were also tortured while held by the CIA for years in secret prisons .
A sixth defendant , Mohammed al - Qahtani , dubbed the “ 20th hijacker , ” was dropped from the case last May without explanation .
The Pentagon dismissed the war crimes charges against him in an apparent attempt to sidestep legal challenges based on the interrogation methods to which he was subjected , documented in his case by an 84 - page “ torture log ” that was leaked to the media .
Nonetheless , Pentagon chief military prosecutor for the Guantánamo trials , Col. Lawrence Morris , said last month that he was filing new charges against Qahtani , a Saudi national who was blocked from entering the US at the Orlando , Florida airport in August 2001 .
The attempt by the defendants to enter a guilty plea underscored the farcical character of the military commissions system .
Colonel Henley found himself compelled to acknowledge that it was by no means clear whether the Congressional legislation setting up the commissions allowed defendants facing the death penalty to enter pre-trial guilty pleas without the evidence first being heard by a jury composed of 12 US military officers .
Henley asked for the military prosecutors to prepare a briefing on whether he could accept the guilty pleas without the decision of a jury and for the defense attorneys to file a response by January 4 .
Henley also said that he could not accept guilty pleas from two of the defendants because of outstanding motions about their mental competency to represent themselves in the trial .
Binalshibh , charged with acting as a liaison between the al - Qaeda leadership and the 9/11 hijackers , is being administered psychotropic drugs by his jailers at Guantánamo , while an attorney for Hawsawi had requested a mental competency hearing .
After a break in the proceedings , the other three defendants said that they would withhold their guilty pleas until there was a ruling on the status of Binalshibh and Hawsawi .
Sources close to the defense said that the decision was apparently taken because of concern that their pleas would not result in the death penalty .
In a June 5 hearing , when the defendants were first formally charged before the military commission , Mohammed said that he would welcome “ martyrdom . ”
The decision to file the joint guilty pleas , in an apparent attempt to seek the death penalty , was taken after the military authorities allowed the five men , who are being held at a secret facility within the Guantánamo prison complex , to meet together without their lawyers .
Their letter to the judge announcing their wish to drop all challenges to the military charges and plead guilty was drafted following a meeting held on November 4 , the day of the US election .
Some of the defense attorneys suggested that the other defendants were coerced by Mohammed into entering the plea , a charge that they denied in Monday ’s hearing .
The American Civil Liberties Union , which is observing the trial in Guantánamo , issued a statement denouncing the proceedings as a “ debacle . ”
“ No one should be surprised that a system that allows for serial torture and abuse and holds detainees for years without charging them or granting them access to attorneys has led the defendants to capitulate and seek to plead guilty , ” said the ACLU .
“ It ’s abundantly clear that a coerced guilty plea resulting from years of torture and abuse would never have been accepted in a legitimate court and should not be accepted here .
Anyone who believes that this is a victory for American justice is sadly mistaken .
History will show that any guilty pleas in these proceedings were the result of an inhumane , unjust process designed to achieve a foregone conclusion . ”
Dianne Marie Amann , a professor at University of California at Davis , who is also observing the proceedings on behalf of the National Institute of Military Justice , commented : “ The fact that the judge and the prosecution and the defense clearly do n’t know the consequences of a guilty plea shows the sorry state of these commissions . ”
The timing of the case raises the prospect that either the pleas will not be heard until after Bush has left office , or that an incoming President Barack Obama will be left with making the final decision on executing those sentenced by the military commission .
Tom Durkin , a civilian attorney for Binalshibh , charged that the proceedings were being conducted with definite political motives .
“ This show trial is nothing more than an effort to blackmail ” Obama , he said .
The Democratic president - elect has repeatedly vowed that he would move swiftly to close down the Guantánamo prison camp , thereby removing a source of international condemnation of US lawlessness .
Far from clear , however , is what the incoming administration intends to do with those detained there and what policy it will take in regard to preventive detention ; that is the holding of individuals designated as “ enemy combatants ” without charges or trials .
( See “ Obama and Guantánamo ” )
Time magazine points out that the military is preparing to announce a number of new military commission trials before Obama takes office .
They have already set a January 26 trial date — six days after Obama enters the White House — for Omar Khadr , a Canadian youth who was captured by US military forces in Afghanistan when he was 15 .
He would be the first child to be tried as a war criminal in American history .
“ After years during which prisoners were held without trial , the question is whether this surge in prosecutions and publicity is a case of due process finally starting to work — or a hurried effort designed to tie Obama ’s hands as he tries to shut ” Guantánamo , Time comments .
“ Once they are under way , Obama could find it politically and legally difficult to stop the controversial proceedings or shift them out of Guantánamo . ”
The unstated political premise here is that the Democratic president - elect has , on the one hand , embraced the “ global war on terrorism ” and , on the other , is loathe entering into any political confrontation with either the military or the political right .

It must have been an appalling moment when a Viking realised he had paid two cows for a fake designer sword ; a clash of blade on blade in battle would have led to his sword , still sharp enough to slice through bone , shattering like glass .
" You really did n't want to have that happen , " said Dr Alan Williams , an archaeometallurgist and consultant to the Wallace Collection , the London museum which has one of the best assemblies of ancient weapons in the world .
He and Tony Fry , a senior researcher at the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington , south - west London , have solved a riddle that the Viking swordsmiths may have sensed but did n't quite understand .
Some Viking swords were among the best ever made , still fearsome weapons after a millennium .
The legendary swords found at Viking sites across northern Europe bear the maker 's name , Ulfberht , in raised letters at the hilt end .
Puzzlingly , so do the worst ones , found in fragments on battle sites or in graves .
The Vikings would have found it impossible to tell the difference when they bought a newly forged sword : both would have looked identical , and had razor sharp blades .
The difference would have only emerged in use , often fatally .
Williams began to test the Ulfberht blades when a private collector brought one into the Wallace , and found they varied wildly .
The tests at the NPL have proved that the inferior swords were forged in northern Europe from locally worked iron .
But the genuine ones were made from ingots of crucible steel , which the Vikings brought back from furnaces thousands of miles away in modern Afghanistan and Iran .
The tests at Teddington proved the genuine Ulfberht swords had a phenomenally high carbon content , three times that of the fakes , and half again that of modern carbon steel .
The contemporary fake Ulfberhts used the best northern metal working techniques , which hardened the metal by quenching - plunging the red - hot blade into cold water .
It enabled them to give the blade a keen edge , but made it fatally brittle .
In the 11th century the Russians blocked the trade route , and the supply of crucible steel ended .
Evidence is emerging that the swords from burials are the fakes , or the work of less prestigious makers .
The genuine Ulfberhts have mostly been found in rivers .
" I do n't think these were ritual offerings , " Williams said .
" They are mostly from rivers near settlement sites , and I think what you have almost certainly is some poor chap staggering home drunk , falling into the river and losing his sword .
An expensive mistake . "
Their work has also proved that many of the Ulfberht swords in some of the most famous weapons collections in the world are fakes .
The Wallace 's is the real McCoy , but the one brought in by the private collector which started the hunt turned out to be fake .

ImageGaza / PNN � Losses are huge in the Gaza Strip with many of the devastated population still in tears , some little kids afraid to return to school today .
The environmental effects will continue to be uncovered for years on lands that become less fertile with each invasion and home demolition .
The Agriculture Minister in the Gaza Strip noted today that the Israeli military continues to target farmers on their lands near the boundary lines .
Many people are unable to reach the fields .
He added on Saturday that in the Mediterranean just off the Gaza coast Israeli naval ships continue to open fire on fishermen , preventing them from working .
Financially speaking it is clear that reconstruction costs in the Strip are around two billion .
The Ministry of Agriculture says that another 170 million USD is needed for that sector alone .
Agriculture Minister Mohammad Al Agha told a press conference in Gaza City today that nearly a thousand water wells were destroyed along with 60 percent of the Strip�s total agricultural land .
Included in the 170 million figure needed is the cost for reconstruction to the fishing industry in the Mediterranean Sea .
" Massive destruction [ was ] caused in the agricultural and fishing sector of the Gaza Strip through bulldozing thousands of acres and destroying wells , agriculture and poultry and livestock farms , fishing ports and fishing boats , and canning and packaging plants . "
Al Agha said that the Israeli military use of " white phosphorus and depleted uranium have a direct impact on agriculture and public health as the length of stay of these toxic substances in the soil will continue to create disastrous results . "
He called in this context for assistance in testing collected soil samples .
The equipment in the Gaza Strip is old and in disrepair due to the ban on imports .
Al Agha asked that international and Arab organizations and governments help move the samples for outside testing or break the siege to allow the import of sophisticated lab equipment .
WASHINGTON --
The Bush administration said it would lend $ 17.4 billion to General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC , buying them a few weeks of financial relief but leaving the biggest decisions about the industry 's future to President - elect Barack Obama .
Under the White House plan , the companies are required to extract enough financial concessions from workers , suppliers , dealers and other stakeholders to demonstrate their long - term viability by the end of March .
The deal 's ambitious targets for the companies include replacing two - thirds of their debt with stock ; using more stock instead of cash to fund retiree health - care obligations ; eliminating much - criticized union " jobs banks " that pay laid - off auto workers ; and establishing wage structures and workplace rules that are more competitive with foreign rivals .
But all those targets are nonbinding , and the agreement appeared to be much more porous than legislation that the administration and Democratic congressional leaders failed to pass earlier this month .
The loan package also requires the administration to drain what remains in the first half of the Treasury Department 's $ 700 billion bailout fund , originally intended to aid the financial industry .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said lawmakers should release the final $ 350 billion " to support financial - market stability , " a request likely to set up another battle with Congress .
Why const ?
With judicious use of const you can catch many bugs and improve code documentation and maintenance .
For me the classic example is reading from and writing to files .
Look at these two interfaces in stylized C++:
bool Read ( File & file , char * buffer , unsigned & size ) bool Write ( File & file , char const * buffer , unsigned const & size ) ;
The first one tells me that the buffer may be modified by the function .
In fact , the Read function will most likely write characters into it .
It is also allowed to modify the parameter size , putting the number of characters read into it .
The incorrect call
Read ( " abc " , 3 ) ;
will not compile .
The second declaration promises that the buffer will not be modified and neither will size .
So the following ( correct ) call will compile :
Write ( " abc " , 3 ) ;
What ’s more , when compiling the implementation of Write , the compiler will ensure that the arguments are not modified ( unless the programmer subverts the type system using const_cast ) .
What does const guarantee ?
Not much !
This optimistic picture is marred by a few gotchas .
You ’d think that if you call a function taking a const reference , the object you are passing wo n’t change ( assume there ’s no use of const_cast or mutable members ) .
Think again !
In a multithreaded program , another thread might change the object concurrently .
You may avoid this problem by preventing concurrent access using critical sections .
But even in a single threaded program there is no guarantee the const object wo n’t change .
That ’s because there might be a non-const alias to the argument you ’re passing .
This alias might be accessible to the function either through a global variable , or through another argument .
The classic example is copying elements between overlapping ranges .
The source for the copy is passed as const , the target as non-const , but if they point at overlapping regions , the source may end up modified .
There is a stronger version of constness that might guarantee immutability .
The qualifier is usually called immutable and it ’s available in the D programming language and in some dialects of Java .
I ’ll come back to it later .
On top of those gotchas , even in a single - threaded C++ program with no aliasing of arguments , a const function argument might get mutated .
That ’s because constness is shallow–it does n’t protect indirect data members ( pointers or references ) .
See next section .
Transitivity or “ deep ” const
Consider a list that is defined recursively :
class List { public : List * GetNext ( ) const { return _next ; } void SetNext ( List * next ) { _next = next ; } private : List * _next ; } ; void clip ( List const * list ) {
List * next = list .
GetNext ( ) ; if ( next ) next .
SetNext(0 ) ; }
Function clip takes a const list and blatantly modifies it .
That ’s because the indirect member , _next , of a const List is not const .
C++ constness is not transitive !
This fact is reflected in GetNext being a const method and returning a non-const pointer to _next .
So even if this is const inside GetNext , indirect parts of this are open to modification .
I always found the non-transitive definition of const counter - intuitive , and made sure that in my code constness was always transitive .
For instance , I would implement GetNext to return a const pointer :
List const * GetNext ( ) const { return _next ; }
and maybe provide another non-const method that returns a non-const pointer .
Notice the need for code duplication in this approach .
The depths of immutability
I have an even larger problem with non-transitive immutability ( as opposed to constness ) .
I expect a const method of an immutable object to leave the object unchanged .
In particular I expect such method to behave like a pure function ( not to be confused with pure virtual function ) .
A pure function returns the same value every time it ’s called with the same arguments .
I expect the length of an immutable string to never change .
Every call to size should return the same value .
I would even expect the compiler to eliminate redundant calls to size is such a case .
Here ’s a hypothetical example :
immutable string ( " Hello ! " ) ; doSomething ( string.data( ) , string.size ( ) ) ; doSomethingElse( string.data( ) , string.size ( ) ) ;
A smart compiler could cache the results of data and size from the first set of calls and reuse them when calling doSomethingElse .
However , if immutable is not transitive , such an optimization is incorrect .
Just imagine a bizarre implementation of string that stores the length indirectly :
class string { public : string ( char const * src ) { _length = new unsigned ; * _length = strlen ( src ) ; ... } unsigned size ( ) const { ++* _length ; return * _length ; } private : unsigned * _length ; } ;
The D - language model
Taking all the above arguments into account , we decided to implement both const and immutable as transitive type modifiers in the D programming language .
This enabled a lot of interesting compiler optimizations .
Making const and immutable transitive is essential for D ’s support for functional - style programming .
It ’s important that const methods of an immutable object be pure functions .
It ’s also important to let the compiler optimize functional - style code , which otherwise tends to be less efficient than its imperative - style equivalent .
Functional programming is one of the safest paradigms for concurrency .
Pure functions and immutable objects do n’t require locking .
The price of transitivity
Having said that , transitivity of const imposes some constraints on the programming style .
It enforces the view that anything reachable from an object is part of the object .
When you are given a const linked list , all links in it must necessarily be const .
That makes logical sense –the links are part of the list .
The picture gets muddier when the object contains references to some external services .
Just by calling them “ external , ” I ’m admitting that they are not part of the object .
Can an object that contains a Windows handle be const ?
Is it enough that it does n’t modify the handle itself ?
Or should n’t it also refrain from modifying the window or the file behind the handle ?
Handles are often implemented as opaque pointers so , strictly speaking , constness should propagate through them .
But how do I know which APIs do n’t mutate the state of Windows and which do ?
This is an extreme example , but there are many in - between cases .
In an editor you might have an undo stack that stores editing commands .
When you call the undo method of the command object , you may pass it a reference to the document object on which it is to operate .
In that case undo may be declared as const .
But if you store a reference to the document within each command , the undo method can no longer be const –it modifies the document .
The classic Command Pattern uses the latter approach .
It has n’t been decided yet if and how D will support an escape mechanism from const transitivity ( and constness in general ) .
Following C++ , D could use the mutable type qualifier for that purpose .
This would also solve the problem of memoizing and caching inside a const object .
In the next installment , I ’ll describe more complexities of immutability and discuss a dialect of Java that supports immutability constraints .

General Motors and Chrysler were close to securing a $ 15 bn ( £ 10 bn ) bail - out from Washington last night as the White House and Congressional leaders prepared to appoint a " car tsar " .
Legislation to spare GM and Chrysler from bankruptcy could be unveiled today .
It is understood that loans will be granted to the Detroit - based manufacturers as a stopgap measure until January , when Barack Obama assumes the presidency and Congress reconvenes .
" There is a lot of work going on behind the scenes , " said a source familiar with the talks .
" There will be a single person to oversee this initiative .
This legislation is an interim measure to prevent collapse so that the new president and new Congress can determine a longer term plan . "
However , it was reported yesterday that the White House and Democratic leaders in Congress were at odds over when the tsar should be appointed .
The Bush administration is believed to favour an immediate appointment but Congress prefers to leave the responsibility to Obama 's team .
It is understood that the funding for GM and Chrysler will come from a $ 25 bn energy department fund for developing fuel - efficient vehicles .
The manufacturers appear to have won a short - term reprieve amid fears that the collapse of GM or Chrysler could ravage an already reduced US jobs market .
The strain facing the motor industry was further apparent this weekend when one of Britain 's largest car - parts groups , Wagon Automotive , teetered on the brink of collapse , endangering 4,500 jobs across Europe .
The company , which employs 500 in Britain at plants in Walsall and Coventry and a Birmingham head office , is expected to call in administrators within days .
Wagon 's carmaker clients and its American backer , Wilbur Ross , had agreed to pump tens of millions of euros into the company , but the banks refused to play their part to keep the business afloat .
The White House , which has veto powers , has opposed bailing out Detroit from the $ 700 bn Troubled Asset Relief Program but it signalled over the weekend that a deal could be reached .
House speaker Nancy Pelosi had refused to draw the bail - out cash from the $ 25 bn energy department fund but , according to reports , she relented over the weekend .
A spokeswoman for the Bush administration said " constructive discussions " had been held with Congress members .
" We hope to make progress toward assistance for the automakers , " she said , adding that there must be a guarantee that the money would be repaid .
Chrysler said yesterday that it was " encouraged by the discussions as it appears we are making progress " .
General Motors declined to comment and Ford did not return calls .
Obama backed a Detroit bail - out yesterday as he ruled out letting the motor industry collapse - but warned that it must undergo a comprehensive restructuring .
" I do n't think it is an option to simply allow it to collapse , " Obama said in an interview on NBC .
" What we have to do is to provide them with assistance but that assistance is conditional on them making significant adjustments .
They are going to have to restructure and all of their stakeholders are going to have to restructure . "
In his weekly address to the nation , via radio and YouTube , Obama gave details of the stimulus package that has become his priority after he takes office .
The plan , which economists have argued should pump $ 700bn into the economy , will be the largest public construction programme since the 1950s , when work began on the interstate motorway network , Obama said .
As well as building roads and repairing bridges , the 2.5 million jobs created by the programme will encompass the middle classes with investment targeted at technology and the environment .
" It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the world in broadband adoption .
Here , in the country that invented the internet , every child should have the chance to get online , " Obama said .

( The Independent
prima facie
Let me start with a disclaimer .
I think Donald Rumsfeld is a scumbag .
If I had to scrape his remains off the bottom of my shoe I 'd wear gloves and put a clothespin on my nose .
He is a world - class liar , probably pathologically so , and a war criminal .
So when I say the insinuation that he and is rotten ilk have engineered a bird flu threat so he could make bucks off his investment in the antiviral drug Tamiflu is ridiculous , it is n't because I think they are n't capable of it .
They 've shown themselves capable of far worse .
At issue here is a story in The Independent over the weekend that Rumsfeld mde a bundle in 2004 when he sold stock in Gilead Sciences , the biotech firm that developed and licensed the influenza antiviral Tamiflu , now being frantically bought up and stockpiled by countries all over the world .
When queried , the company made the usual disclaimers that Rumsfeld had recused himself from any decisions involving the drug , etc. , etc. Since Rumsfeld is a liar there is noreason to believe this , except for the fact that the government in which Rumsfeld was a decision maker had turned a blind eye to the looming threat of bird flu until the problem was so huge they could n't ignore it , and even then , have done too little .
They were also late to get in line for the limited production output of Tamiflu , so today we still have little in our stockpile .
If he was supposed to be helping the company from within , he was sure doing a piss poor job of it .
In fact he was doing a piss poor job of everything , including paying attention to the real threat to national security , emerging infectious disease .
If he had acted illegally on behalf of his investment we would probably be better off .
But he is both too stupid ( yes , stupid ; listen to the guy .
He 's a moron ) and too crooked to worry about penny ante stuff that any rich , white male Republican asshole can do with his eyes shut ( make a killing in the stock market ) .
He had bigger fish to fry .
Fucking up the world .
If you read the whole Independent article , it never says he manufactured the bird flu threat .
But it does imply it by its juxtaposition of facts .
This is a bad meme .
It goes along with a companion that says Tamiflu is worthless .
We do n't know at this point what its value will be when the time comes .
Data show it is effective prophylactically and may help on the margin therapeutically if given in a timely fashion .
What our experience will be in a pandemic situation no one knows and should n't be prejudged .
It is not a panacea and probably wo n't turn out to be very important overall but may be very useful for certain special situations ( prophylaxis of health care workers , family members and others with known or high risk of exposure ) .
Maybe .
And maybe tagging Rumsfeld with deliberate bird flu profiteering is good politics .
I do n't know .
But we have some responsibility not to mislead , even when misleading serves what seems a politically useful purpose .
It is always hard to think clearly in a crisis .
Let 's not make it harder .
That 's what it means to be part of a Reality Based Community .
Editor 's Note : John Kerry , a Democrat , is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the junior senator from Massachusetts .
John Kerry says Barack Obama sent a message that fight against terror will respect America 's values .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Thursday was an important day for the rule of law in the United States of America .
With a handful of signatures to executive orders , President Obama ordered the eventual closure of Guantanamo Bay prison and CIA " black site " prisons , and placed interrogation in all American facilities by all U.S. personnel under the guidelines of the Army Field Manual .
In a season of transformational changes , these are among the most meaningful , because they send a powerful message that America 's struggle against terrorism will once against honor some of the most cherished ideals of our republic : respect for the rule of law , individual rights , and America 's moral leadership .
The president understands all too well that the threat our nation faces from terrorism is all too real .
And we should all agree that sometimes , in the name of national security , it is necessary to make difficult ethical decisions to protect the American people .
However , I and many others believe that the use of torture and indefinite detention have not only tarnished our honor but also diminished our security .
In this global counterinsurgency effort against al Qaeda and its allies , too often our means have undercut our efforts by wasting one of our best weapons : the legitimacy that comes from our moral authority .
Torture plays directly into a central tenet of al Qaeda 's recruiting pitch : that everyday Muslims across the world have something to fear from the United States of America .
From Morocco to Malaysia , people regularly hear stories of torture and suicide at Abu Ghraib , Guantanamo , and other overseas prisons .
The result has been a major blow to our credibility worldwide , particularly where we need it most : in the Muslim world .
Once permitted , torture and lawlessness are not easily contained .
Coercive interrogation techniques found their way from high - level terrorists at Guantanamo to low - level detainees at Abu Ghraib .
Years later , images of abuse there remain fixtures across the Arab and Muslim world .
And as John McCain has argued , the use of techniques like waterboarding leaves its scars on a democratic society as well .
Torture elicits lies -- not just from those experiencing it , but from those who seek to conceal it .
After years of Orwellian denials and legalistic parsing , what a relief it was to hear our new attorney general - designee finally acknowledge what we know to be true : that yes , " waterboarding is torture . "
As we move forward , President Obama is wise to " reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals " -- but the American people should know that closing a prison conceived outside the rule of law will not be easy .
Reclaiming Guantanamo and its inhabitants into our legal system from what former Vice President Dick Cheney called " the dark side " will be an enormous challenge and a thicket of thorny legal and policy issues .
However , we are already seeing the international system reorganize itself around an America that is willing to be a moral leader .
Countries such as Portugal and Ireland have made welcome offers to join Albania in resettling detainees who cannot be returned to their home countries .
Already we are seeing the fruits of a good faith effort with our allies .
Still , it will take time and effort to overcome numerous hurdles , many handed over from the previous administration : looming questions about the inadmissibility of evidence improperly coerced ; the difficulty of returning detainees -- including many cleared for departure -- who would face torture or worse in their home countries ; and the fact that we already know some released from Guantanamo have returned to the battlefield .
In some cases we simply lack evidence to charge men we know to be extremely dangerous to the American people .
And even as we embrace long - overdue change , we owe it even to those we believe made grave mistakes to acknowledge the urgency of the moment they inherited , the sacred responsibility to protect American lives which they strove to honor , and the humbling reality that there are no easy answers when it comes to such life - and - death matters .
But the American story is one of perfectibility and striving for ever - greater fidelity to our ideals -- it is a journey from colony to republic , from slavery to freedom , from sexism to suffrage , from stark poverty to shared prosperity .
The president himself famously said , " The union may never be perfect , but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected . "
It is true that today we face unprecedented , unorthodox , and vastly destructive enemies that respect neither borders nor rules of war .
But this is not the first new challenge America has evolved to meet .
Sometimes that evolution requires us to admit mistakes , learn from them and grow as a nation .
The desire to do better has always been a core part of America 's greatness .
Last week Barack Obama and his administration wrote a new chapter in that old story .
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kerry .

The state of Florida is now investigating whether dozens of students were killed and buried at the Dozier School for Boys , a one - time reform school in the city of Marianna .
Dozier School for Boys Investigation
A group of former students who call themselves “ The White House Boys ” came forward this week and claimed guards at the Dozier School for Boys abused students , often to the point of death , during the 1950s and 1960s .
Some of the children , they believe , were buried in shallow graves on the grounds .
Each grave has a small metal cross above it .
Governor Charlie Crist called upon the Florida Department of Law Enforcement to determine if their claims were true .
“ Questions remain unanswered as to the identity of the deceased and the origin of these graves , ” Crist told the agency .
He ordered officers to see what , if anything , was beneath those metal markers .
No official records exist .
The White House Boys
The White House Boys say their moniker comes from a concrete building where they witnessed the torture taking place .
The four recount stories of boys being struck with leather and metal straps , even being placed inside drying machines .
Black students received the worst of the beatings , the four say , and had their own separate room for punishment .
“ I saw one of them murdered , ” Roger Kiser , one of The White House Boys , told a Florida TV station .
“ He was put in the dryer because he got into the face of the counselor .
They had the boys put him in the tumble dryer .
I saw him about 30 minutes later , when he was brought out dead in a white blanket and thrown into the back seat of a car . ”
The White House Boys located each other on the Internet , and — after reliving some of their experiences — decided to bring their story into the spotlight .
The Florida School for Boys Today
The Dozier School for Boys is now a state - run “ high risk residential commitment facility . ”
Young men ages 13 to 21 go there following court orders .
The Dozier School houses 135 young men , more than half of whom are considered sex offenders .

There Is No " Best Sword " :
If there were no firearms , they 'd still be designing new swords By Hank Reinhardt
ARMA Senior Advisor
This new interest in swords is both gratifying and partly frustrating .
It gives me a chance to share an interest and hobby I have had for many years , but now I encounter more and more mistakes , misunderstandings , and just plain stupid ideas .
Frequently , I hear this stuff from people who should know better .
I know a collector of custom knives who is a fanatic in the care of his blades .
He will buy a very find and well - made knife and take superb care of it .
The edge will never be abused .
He was stunned recently to find out that swords will nick when struck edge to edge .
He frankly did n't think I knew what I was talking about , I guess because they do it in the movies all the time .
When I suggested he try it with a couple of his knives , he got the idea .
I once had a guy pick up one of my swords , a schiavona .
I warned him that it was quite sharp , but he assured me that he was quite familiar with swords and actually was quite expert in their use .
He then proceeded to go into some katas designed for the katana .
Before I could say anything he had drawn the back edge of the sword along his shoulder , cutting a 6 - inch gash in his deltoid and arm .
On another occasion I watched a young guy pick up a large two - hand claymore .
He immediately assumed some of the stances made popular by Arnold Schwarzenegger as Conan -- stances also based on katas for the katana .
After manfully trying to whirl the heavy sword one - handed , he handed it back to the owner , said " Nice balance " and strutted off , obviously convinced the people watching were impressed .
Alas , most of them were giggling .
It was obvious he could n't handle the sword ; it was simply too big for the way he was trying to use it .
Because of the popularity of Oriental martial arts and the Japanese sword , what I see the most are people trying to handle one - handed broadswords like katanas .
But I have also had fencers pick up the same sword and tell me it is impossible to fight with , as you can't even hold it in a proper guard position .
There is not just one type of sword , nor is there just one way to use a sword .
A specific technique requires a specific sword , and a specific type of sword requires a specific technique .
Rapiers do not cut near as well as katanas .
Katanas do not penetrate near as well as rapiers .
Neither is very good against plate armor .
At the risk of repeating myself I want to point out that swords are designed with specific uses in mind .
They should be judged this way .
I have heard people argue over which is the better sword , the rapier or a Viking type , for instance .
This is foolish .
What they are actually talking about are fighting styles , not swords .
Any sword should be discussed only in the context of what it was designed to do .
This is not a chicken or egg question .
Sword designs came first , and practical styles evolved around them .
The first sword design was dependent on the skill of the maker , and the material from which it was made -- copper , then bronze .
Then sword and technique in Europe entered into a constantly whirling and evolving dance that did n't end until the development of the repeating firearm .
Swords and technique in many parts of the world evolved very slowly ; in some places they never arrived ; and in some places they took directions that were strange to say the least .
Wooden swords edged with shark 's teeth , draw cuts , pulling cuts , slashes -- all of these are understandable , but there has always been one type of sword and fighting technique that fills me with . . . well , I 'm not sure what .
You decide : The Abyssinian shotel is a long curved double - edged sword .
At first glance , it looks like a Near Eastern scimitar , but on closer inspection you realize that the curve is a full half circle .
And it is , I repeat , double - edged .
The blade , generally , is a flattened , diamond cross section and quite stiff .
The natives fight with these swords from behind large , circular leather shields .
Rather than try to cut through the shield , or feint it out of the way , they reach around it to hook their opponent with the point of the sword .
I think you can image what a strange type of combat it must be .
Many years ago , when the movie theaters had shorts subjects , I saw a travelogue that briefly showed two Abyssinians " fencing " with sword and shield .
They hoped and ducked and bounced all around , with the long curved swords moving in very awkward ways .
Really strange .
When you handle a shotel you realize that it is n't very effective for slicing , nor slashing , and certainly not built for thrusting , but it is pretty good for hooking , and that is how it should be judged .
To get a better idea of function and design , usage and effectiveness , let 's take brief looks at how changes have taken place with some specific types .
The term " rapier " does n't show up until the late 15th century and was used to denote a slender sword worn as part of civilian dress .
But its origins go further back , and it can be argued that it had its beginnings in the estoc of the 14th century .
The estoc was a long sword , with a stiff blade of square or triangular section and no functioning edges .
It was designed to punch through armor , either plate or mail .
Against plate , there was the possibility it could pierce the plate if it struck squarely , and if not , it could slide and wedge in one of the joints of the armor .
It was at about this time that they were learning to put little bars and circles on crossguards to help protect the hand .
The counter argument regarding the ancestry of the rapier points out that earliest rapiers were double - edged -- in essence , merely lighter swords worn with civilian dress .
Such swords were not used in battle and were primarily for self - defense and dueling .
At this time , the blades were generally double - edged , but somewhat slim , and used for both the cut and thrust .
The Art of Fence was quite rudimentary .
The sword had always been considered an offensive weapon ; one blocked or parried only in dire emergencies .
Soon , however , the sword was used as a defensive weapon as well .
Of course , this tore the edges up pretty badly , but they also quickly learned to parry with the flat , and anyway , the point was more deadly .
As this style of combat took over , the sword began to change again .
The hilt began to acquire more elaborate rings in order to protect the hand , and the blade began to lengthen and narrow .
By the middle of the 16th century , the sword had become the swept - hilt rapier .
The blade had gotten quite long , and the edge was no longer important .
Indeed , there was one blade that was square in section and flattened for the last inches , so that it was sharp there .
This point was used for slashing cuts , usually at the face and eyes .
The blade was excessively long , up to 60 inches in some cases .
It was felt , incorrectly , that the longer blade gave advantage .
It must have been awkward walking around with a 60 - inch sword blade banging into things and tripping people .
It got to be such a nuisance in England Queen Elizabeth issued an edict , and every sword over a yard long was broken .
The Art of Fence was getting better and better , and by the turn of the century , the lunge was developed .
This really put an end to excessively long blades , and they rapidly shrank to about 36 - 39 inches .
In the meantime , the hilt had been acquiring a few shells and plates and finally , in the early 17th century , acquired the form known as a cavalier hilt .
It is very similar to the slightly earlier dish hilt , and both are frequently confused with the cup hilt .
It has a tendency to bounce about and proved annoying .
Besides , they did n't think it looked very dressy .
I do , but I also realize that to me it looks romantic as hell .
And so the sword continued to change .
The guard became smaller ; the crossguard , wherein one once looped his fingers for a very secure grip , was now merely decorative .
The blade continued to shrink until at last the final form of the smallsword was reached -- triangular blade , very light and fast , from 30 to 33 inches long .
They look like beautiful and deadly little toys , smallswords do .
They are light and slim and very attractive .
Many consider them the ultimate sword and the most deadly of all the dueling weapons .
Personally , I strongly disagree .
They are quite deadly when used within the limitations now taken for granted .
This is , one is not supposed to grab the blade .
However , grabbing the blade was an honorable and valued tactic , even if it is now illegal in sport fencing .
I can assure you it is not difficult to slap a blade aside with your off hand or even seize it if the missed thrust is even the tiniest bit slow .
This is not a feasible tactic if the blade is well edged , but with a triangular blade it is quite possible .
We have not really studied the development of the rapier here , but it is hoped we have shown something of the dynamics of the design progression from the beginnings to the peak in the 1670s and then to its final and ( my opinion ) degenerate form .
The purpose of this sort of sword at this time was to provide civilian protection .
As more was learned the sword changed to take advantage of this knowledge .
Fashion and changing social conditions worked on the rapier , but even in its final form it never strayed from its intended purpose as a thrusting weapon , designed to be used with one hand , and to provide protection from a similar weapon .
In none of these forms was it intended to be used against armor or in the heavy heat of battle .
Another sword that needs to be looked at is the medieval or knightly cruciform sword that is always incorrectly referred to as a broadsword .
This sword can easily be traced back to the beginning of the Iron Age .
For our purposes , we can start with the Vikings .
The early Viking sword in general use was long -- about 33 - 34 inches -- broad -- 2 -2.5 inches -- with a single fuller .
The blade had parallel sides , with little or no taper .
Steel was quite valuable , and at this time making large quantities was quite difficult .
As a result , the swords were made by a process called pattern welding .
In this process , steel bars containing a good deal of carbon were welded to iron bars , then all were twisted and rewelded to produce the patterns we refer to as Damascus .
A high - carbon edge was then welded on , the sword was filed , ground , tempered and polished .
The end result was a light and fast blade , capable of delivering a terrible shearing cut .
A good Viking sword was flexible , yet had a very hard edge .
This sword was designed to be used in conjunction with a wooden shield .
It would be facing , more than likely , another wooden shield , and a foe wearing an iron helmet and armored with leather .
If that opponent were very rich he would be wearing a mail shirt .
The sword , therefore , had to be flexible .
It needed to take a lot of shock when hitting a shield , and cutting into a torso or even a leg -- the most likely target -- put a lot of strain on the sword .
If it was n't flexible , then it would bend easily .
Of course , the sword could have been made thicker , but then the weight would be too great for combat .
Swords at this time weighed between 2 and 3 pounds , tops .
One wins an encounter with swords by cutting the other fellow first .
In the 14th century , given the state of defensive armor , that meant leg cuts .
Of the hundreds of corpses piled at Visby in 1361 , 70 % had leg wounds , most of them deep enough to be seen in the bones 500 years later .
The edge , we see , had to be hard .
Bone is tough , so is a steel rimmed shield .
And there was always the likelihood of hitting mail .
One tried to avoid this by cutting at the neck , the hands and arms and , particularly , the legs .
Sometimes you got an opening and just had to take a cut .
Mail is tough , composed of iron wire .
It was not tempered and is somewhat soft .
Tempered mail is not a good idea -- under a blow , such mail will break , giving free rein to the edge .
Soft mail will bend and deform , resisting the cut a long way .
Any mail will nick the edge , but if the blow is delivered accurately , at the proper angle and with a great deal of force , this sword can and will cut mail .
That is the sword in general use in Europe at the beginning of the Viking Age .
Around 900 AD , a new sword appeared .
The blade was slightly shorter -- 32 inches average -- but with the same width .
It tapered much more acutely , and ended in a good serviceable point .
The change in blade shape makes this a much faster sword in both the cut and the recovery .
By throwing the weight closer to the hand , the sword becomes easier to maneuver .
Those features were n't the big difference .
The real biggie was that the whole sword was made of steel .
No matter how good the smith , a pattern - welded sword was an expensive and slow production .
With large pieces of steel , the whole process is speeded up , the sword is cheaper , and just as good .
But the new sword had to be better because the armor had also started to improve .
Actually , the armor was pretty much the same , except there was now more of it , and mail was more likely to be encountered because it was accumulating , generation by generation .
The next 200 years saw more changes .
Mail now covered the whole body .
Fighting on foot was left to the peasant .
The knight , fully armored , held a good solid wooden shield and the lance was the main weapon .
The sword became secondary , a back - up , and was used against lightly armored foot soldiers .
The sword had changed again .
Its shape reverted and the two edges were more nearly parallel .
Speed was not quite as important now as the weight of the blow .
The blade had become slightly longer to give greater impetus to the blow , and to give the horseman greater reach .
The next 200 - year jump brings us to 1300 AD , and even more changes .
At this time , armor was beginning to win the eternal fight with arms .
Mail was slightly thicker and stronger , and strengthened with plates and splints of steel .
These changes brought about changes in sword design and new types of swords appeared .
The most prominent of these swords was the Great Sword or War Sword .
This is a long - bladed sword , and blades average about 40 inches in length .
The sword is not particularly heavy , weighing 4 to 5 pounds .
It is light enough to be swung one - handed in conjunction with a shield , but the grip is long enough to accommodate another hand , so that the sword can be used two - handed .
The great length increases velocity and cutting power .
Along with the long - bladed Great Sword , a shorter weapon appears , with a blade shape similar to the later Viking swords , but more exaggerated .
These are big swords , with very wide blades tapering sharply .
The wide blade increases the cutting power of the sword , while the strong taper makes the point a most important part of the sword .
Flexibility is now sacrificed for rigidity to strengthen the thrust .
Even a third sword achieved new use .
The falchion had always been around , but with the increase in protective capability of armor the falchion became a most useful weapon .
With a short very wide blade , single - edged , it is capable of delivering a terrible blow .
Shaped like a modern Shriner 's scimitar , it became popular not only with knights , but with archers and men- at - arms .
From here until the 1650s the changes in arms and armor became more rapid .
Mail , that most ancient and honored form of defense , was discarded in favor of plate .
The skill of the armorer reached heights that have never been , and never will , be equaled .
Plate armor is a light , rigid defense that allows a man to move quite freely , and yet gives great protection .
The only real drawback is that it is extremely hot .
Ventilation is almost nil , and this can cause exhaustion .
Fighting on horseback , when the main body parts used are the arms , is OK .
One can do this for a rather long while .
However , on foot , when the legs are used , much more heat is generated and more oxygen required and plate is less useful .
Swordmakers made one last attempt to overcome the new armor .
Light and flat cutting blades were abandoned .
The sword profile with a blade wide at the top and tapering very sharply , stayed pretty much the same .
However , the cross-section became a thick , flattened diamond , and the sword became quite rigid .
Weight varied a great deal .
Some blades stayed light , weighing 2 to 3 pounds , while others went upwards of 5 pounds .
These heavy swords became nothing but sharpened bars of steel .
Both the heavy and the light versions were attempts to punch through the armor , and it could be done if the blow was heavy and square .
In a slightly off - center blow , there was a chance the sword would slide into a crevice or chink and wound the man .
And the heavy swords also tried to " break " the armor by sheer weight and force .
This was the last attempt of the sword to overcome armor and that fight was abandoned .
There was simply no way that a sword was going to cut through steel plate .
Axes , maces and war hammers became the weapons of armored combat .
The sword was by no means abandoned .
It simply was not used when fighting armored knights .
The sword was too important socially and traditionally to be cast aside .
Civilian swords became important items of dress .
In combat , the flat , light cutting sword came back and was carried to fight men at arms and other lightly armed troops .
This is , of course , a quick and simplified view of the whole thing .
Obviously , the bow and the pike were to render armor almost obsolete , and gunpowder administered the coup de grace .
However , we can see here that swords are all shaped to achieve specific goals while overcoming specific obstacles .
Each new type of sword was a response to a new development in armor or fighting style .
Let 's look at a modern example where sword and style conflict mightily .
Japanese arms and armor were fully developed by the 1200s , and stayed pretty much the same for several hundred years .
The katana is an excellent sword , and quite well designed for the type of fighting for which it is intended .
The fencing techniques are excellent .
Regardless of other styles you may consider superior -- sword and shield , rapier fencing , Turkish and Iranian swordplay -- Japanese fencing and the katana are perfectly matched .
In fighting with a katana , many of the moves are drawcuts , and many of the attacks are designed to be struck with the front 6 inches of the blade .
The katana is well suited for this , as the blade is strong , thick , and well curved .
In a recent movie , the hero uses a wide , straight and heavy sword .
All his moves and posturing , however , are for the katana in attacks that simply would not work with such a sword .
A blow with the front 6 inches would set up vibrations that could jar your teeth .
And it would n't cut very deep .
Now you could stop the vibrations by making the blade extremely thick , but then you also increase the weight and lessen the cutting power even more .
In short , the movie sword was simply wrong for the type of fighting shown .
About the only thing more ludicrous would have been using it like a rapier .
Of course , the movie's hero was the sort of superhero who could handle a heavy sword .
The actor , however , was swinging an aluminum blade .
Do n't ever try those moves with a sharp 6 - pound steel sword , let alone one of those 9 - pounders some guys make .
On the subject of modern swords , I am told some of them are hung on the wall in anticipation of defense against intruders .
The merits of this as an idea should be debated in some other forum ; we can discuss the new swords , however .
Most of them are well - made of good materials .
I believe some of them are a little too hard for the shocks a sword blade must take .
Almost all are far too heavy .
A 6 - pound sword is laughable , and a 4 - pounder is only worth a chuckle .
A sword is not a long knife ; it mush be , for its size , more lightly constructed .
Only a 2 to 3 pound sword should be considered for modern use ; nothing heavier will achieve the velocity needed , nor will a heavier sword maneuver , parry or recover fast enough .
It should be relatively short and quite sharp and straight enough for a serious thrust .
The straight wakizashi sold as a " ninja " sword , the hanger or European hunting sword , and shorter 19th century foot officers swords are all useful models , but 12 - pound knightly swords ?
Never .
One sword that provides quite interesting material for such speculation is the saber .
It can also show the relationships between fighting styles , perceived fighting styles and design .
Most people will tell you that the curved cavalry saber was tired for a number of years , was found wanting , and the final , most efficient cavalry sword was the straight one .
They will point to both the British and U.S. cavalry swords of this century .
Both were straight - bladed thrusting weapons .
They were , however , the last designs only because the machine gun had rendered cavalry obsolete .
The question as to which was the best was never fully answered .
The fight was bitter for a century or more , and the thrusting sword won only by very narrow margins .
Here is some of the argument employed over the efficiency of the two styles :
The curved sword has been the sword of the mounted warrior in many places and for many years .
A curved slashing blow is very damaging , and even if it does not kill , it can render the victim unable to continue the fight .
Against infantry , the curve allows the cavalryman to strike a strong and effective blow that does not imprison the blade and cause it to be wrenched from the hand .
Against other mounted troops it provides effective offense and defense .
Sitting astride a horse , the sword is easier to handle in cutting motions than the unnatural thrusts that a straight blade requires .
Opponents pointed out the many times that soldiers had been struck repeatedly on the head with curved sabers and continued to fight .
They also cited times when swords have been driven deep into the body , and wrenched from the grasp as the horse swept past .
After pointing out the horrors and inadequacies of the curved saber , they launch into the merits of the straight blade .
It can reach an infantry soldier lying flat on the ground .
The horse wo n't willingly step on a man , and you need to lean too far out of the saddle to cut someone lying flat .
However , with a straight blade you can reach the ground with the point , which means you can thrust through .
A most valid point is that when someone is stabbed , he is n't likely to continue to fight .
As for fighting other mounted troops , with proper training you can learn to stab .
As for holding on to the weapon , with the proper wrist motion the sword can be pulled from the body of the enemy , either by the cavalryman himself , or he can let the motion of the horse do it .
And it was claimed the thrust was hard to dodge or parry .
One can see that both swords have their merits , and both have their flaws .
One of the most serious flaws of the curved saber was one that could have most easily been corrected .
You see , most military sabers were never sharpened .
They just had flats and no real edge .
They made nasty surface wounds by splitting the flesh , but did not cut deeply .
Had they been sharpened -- ah , then things would have been quite different .
On the other hand , the thrust of a 40 - inch blade at the end of an outstretched arm , urged along by 800 pounds of moving horse , provides a serious problem and certainly no easy answers .
That , in a nutshell and with different problems and different swords , is the story of sword design .
Most well - made swords did their jobs well , but there never was an all - around sword .
Judge them that way , each in its own context -- there is no best .

AMD has released " the fundamental Linux code " needed to develop open - source 3D - acceleration drivers for its R600 and R700 ATI graphic - processors series .
This is good news not only for those wishing to create drivers for those potent GPU series - known to non-AMD watchers by their marketing names of ATI Radeon HD 2x00 , HD 3x00 ( both R600 ) , and Radeon HD 4x00 ( R700 ) - but also for the legions of non-coding Linux - lovers who are lusting for access to the R600 / 700's 3D powers .
According to a Phoronix , the bulk of the credit goes to AMD engineers John Bridgman and Alex Deucher , who " sanitized " the code of all proprietary non-essentials , then shepherded its approval through the AMD honcho - gauntlet so that it could be released " without any NDAs or other string [ sic ] attached . "
Coupled with AMD 's announcement that it would support the recently released open - source OpenCL 1.0 spec , which enables GPUs to be used for general - purpose computing ( GPGPU ) , it appears that the GPUniverse is moving slowly but steadily towards an Open Source Software ( OSS ) model - although Nvidia , from all reports , is dragging its feet when it comes to open - sourcing its drivers .
The OSS future looks bright for GPUs : Intel is open with its drivers and AMD is catching - has caught ? - up .
Apple introduced OpenCL , and Intel , Nvidia , and AMD / ATI have announced their support .
OSS development should proceed apace , both in 3D acceleration and GPGPU .
As one poster on Slashdot waxed enthusiastically , such power would be " useful for cracking WEP / WPA keys . " ®
Update August , 2013 : Stick Shift is a product that implements this on Windows .
This post teaches you how to set up your computer so that you can generate any keystroke or key combination without taking your hands off home row ( the ‘ asdf ’ row of keys ) .
You can then use the arrow keys , page up / down , shortcuts , and more while in regular typing position .
It works across applications , allowing you to type and move about much faster .
I call it ‘ home row computing ’ and it ’s something I started doing after I learned touch typing .
I ’ll explain the idea and give step - by - step instructions for Windows systems .
The first step is to do what power users have done all along : reclaim the Caps Lock key .
It is a fine piece of keyboard real estate gone completely to waste , like a landfill in the middle of Manhattan .
We must also do some key remapping :
The idea is to change Caps Lock so that it can be combined with other accessible keys to produce all of the faraway keys shown above , plus frequent key combinations and anything else you might want .
When I say “ map to home row ” I mean mapping to keys that can be reached while your hands remain on home row .
Nearby letter keys are fine too .
For example , Caps Lock +j could become the Up arrow and Caps Lock+e could become Alt +F4 .
It is common to turn Caps Lock into Control , but we do n’t actually want that because nearly all Control + X combinations are already taken by various programs , so we would n’t be able to do much remapping .
Some Control + X combinations are very high yield ( e.g. , the copy / paste / cut combos ) so we ’ll remap those onto home row .
I think the best substitute for Caps Lock is the “ Apps Key ” .
Since no software uses it as a shortcut ingredient , we can hijack it without fear .
Also , its normal role is to open a right - click context menu , so that ’s a useful thing to have on home row as it helps you stay clear of the mouse .
So download SharpKeys , run it , and turn Caps Lock into the Application Key as shown below :
OK , then click “ Write to registry ” , log off and back on , and you ’re in business .
The second step is to download the outstanding AutoHotKey to run our remapping script .
AutoHotKey is a must have for Windows power users , featured repeatedly on lifehacker .
Since it is a full - on automation and scripting engine there are many ways to do things .
However its native key remapping syntax ( OldKey : : RemappedKey ) does n’t work for us here since we want to map key combinations into single keys .
But you do n’t have to worry about that , you can just download my ready - made script for either the qwerty ( normal ) keyboard layout or the Dvorak ( freak ) layout .
Put it anywhere in your file system , then create a shortcut to the script in the Programs >
Startup folder so it runs when you log on to Windows .
By inspecting the script you ’ll be able to tweak it for your tastes .
Here ’s what it does out of the box :
Thanks to AutoHotKey ’s eliteness the layout works well in practice .
The timing is not quirky at all and there are zero misfires .
If you hold down Caps Lock , you can press the other keys repeatedly and they ’ll be remapped .
Let go of Caps Lock and they ’re back to normal .
The script also handles modifiers such as Alt and Shift being pressed along with the key combinations .
It ’s pretty transparent .
If you want to actually toggle caps lock , then Windows Key + Caps Lock will do the trick .
It is a joy to have navigation keys on the home row .
It makes browsing , programming and writing much smoother .
You can fly through dialogs .
Having Esc nearby is not bad either .
All in all , I ca n’t imagine going back to a regular keyboard .
Given AutoHotKey ’s power you can write scripts to handle key combinations so there are many possibilities .
I adapted to this thing pretty fast ; the symmetries between page up / up arrow , home / left and so on helped a bit .
Again , it ’s trivial to pick your own bindings , take a look at other ideas for cursor movement and cook up your own scheme if you wish .
Some quick thoughts regarding text editors .
When I first did this I was an Emacs user so having a convenient Control key was crucial , but I still think it ’s better to turn Caps Lock into the Apps Key instead .
Then you can pick and choose your macro bindings between Control and Caps Lock , and given AutoHotKey ’s power you have a lot of leeway .
I have since switched to Vim ( apostasy ! ! ) and never looked back .
Vim users will recognize the beauty of having arrow keys on the home row , but will probably barf at the exact key choices I used since jklh is burned into their brains .
Just edit the script .
You ’ll like navigating without switching modes , and Esc on the home row is great for when you do switch .
In Visual Studio this works seamlessly without interfering with any of the native shortcuts .
I ’ve tried this out on Windows XP , Server 2003 , Vista , and Server 2008 , both 32 - and 64 - bit flavors .
No problems that I know of , but use it at your own risk .
The script works over Putty so the keys are available on the command line and Vim for all of the Unix boxes I use .
If you know of similar approaches in other OSes I ’d love to hear it in the comments .
Hope this is useful !
Update : Amjith pointed me to XKeymacs , a tool that implements the same idea but for emacs keybindings ( you could do a similar thing via AutoHotKey , but this is convenient for sure ) .
Also , you guys in the comments are all in favor of Vim - style HJKL bindings , so if anyone makes a script to do that , I ’d be happy to host it .
Update 2 : Simon Scarfe has posted Vim - like bindings for qwerty here .
See the comments for details .
Thanks !
Update 3 : Paul has posted a Linux implementation of this in a comment below .
Sweet .

Recently a lot of fake iPhones came to life in Russia .
They are often being sold in the manner of a big rush , something like “ Look , bro , I do n’t have enough money for my train / plane tickets or whatever , but I ’ve got a real iPhone , look the battery is dead but when you turn it on pushing the power you can see an apple logo for a while , so just charge it and you have an iphone ! ” .
So people fall on this and then bring such devices to the service centers where they are being disassembled , and what a surprise – inside there is no anything looking like iPhone inner stuff but only two batteries and a light bulb lighting an apple logo shadow when the power button is being pressed , also there is a bar of steel so that the phone can weigh like a real thing .

For years now , the little blue " E " has been gracing the desktops of Windows users around the world ( though many might say it 's doing just the opposite ! ) .
Internet Explorer , notorious for its many security holes and being slow to patch them , continues to be one of the top choices for web browsing .
Recently published Market Share statistics show the browser down almost 7 % from the beginning of last year , continuing to slide down as time goes on .
On the other hand , open source browsers such as Firefox and Google Chrome are constantly increasing .
Firefox 's market share increased by about 4 % in 2008 , and Chrome reached over 1 % in the first few months of its availability .
Opera 's share remained steady around 0.71 percent .
Though web surfers ' usage of Windows decreased to about 89 % in November , desktop Linux users remained steady at around 0.85 % , up 0.02 % from the previous month .
The survey also showed that Mac users were least likely to make the switch , being more loyal to their preinstalled browser , Safari , than those using Windows were to Internet Explorer .
Net Applications , the parent company of Market Share , tracks users visiting sites that use their traffic monitoring service , compiling data on approximately 160 million visitors per month , they say .
The statistics look good , and this appears to be a great time for open source software .
I 'm expecting this trend to continue if not grow even stronger as we close off the decade .

Considering all the bad news about recent elections in Africa - rigging , violence and bogus power - sharing agreements - one may be tempted to expect more of the same from Ghana .
The West African nation is going to the polls on Sunday to elect a new president and 240 members of the parliament .
A mouth - watering windfall of billions of dollars awaits the next administration
Voters ' views in Ghana
Its western neighbour Ivory Coast has yet again postponed its election to 2009 because of difficulties in compiling a national register .
Nigeria , to the east , held one of the continent 's most badly flawed elections in April last year .
Rigging was rife and the legitimacy of President Umaru Yar 'Adua and several governors is still being challenged in court .
Violence ripped through Kenya after the ruling party proclaimed a dubious electoral victory last December .
And Zimbabwe continues to spiral into an abyss of poverty and disease as the ruling party refuses to relinquish its grip on the state in spite of a power - sharing arrangement .
Highly contentious
So why should Ghana be any different ?
The capacity for violence and electoral malpractice exists in Ghana , as it does in any country in the world .
Profiling Ghana 's poll line - up
But democracy is still making progress in Africa and there have been successful elections in Liberia and Sierra Leone , Senegal and Zambia to name a few .
That is not to say the run-up to this election in Ghana has not been contentious .
Ghana has recently discovered oil : a mouth - watering windfall of billions of dollars awaits the next administration .
Though not on the scale of Nigeria or Angola , oil has the potential to transform this nation of 20 million people .
But there is good reason to be cautiously optimistic .
Ghana was sub-Saharan Africa 's first nation to achieve independence , from the UK in 1957 .
In post - independent Ghana , civilian rule was truncated repeatedly by a series of military coups until a return to democracy in 1992 .
For the past 16 years , things seem to have gone well for Ghana 's democracy .
' Skirt and blouse voting '
There are multiple political parties and the two main ones have both held the reins of government .
Both parties have tasted victory and defeat at the feet of the Ghanaian electorate
Q&A Ghana elections
The ruling New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) has been in power for the past eight years under the leadership of President John Kufuor .
The NPP has chosen former Foreign Minister Akufo - Addo for its ticket .
Before he became president in 2000 and won re-election in 2004 , Mr Kufuor 's NPP lost two polls - in 1992 and 1996 - to Flight Lieutenant Jerry Rawling 's National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) which is fielding his former Vice - President John Atta Mills as its flagbearer .
Both parties have tasted victory and defeat at the feet of the Ghanaian electorate .
Unlike the case of Kenya , for example , both parties have considerable support that cuts across ethnic divisions in all 10 regions of the nation .
Though it is true that the ruling NPP dominates in the Ashanti Region of the country and the NDC has massive support in the Volta Region , Ghanaians have been known to vote against candidates who share their ethnicity but do not share their political values .
A phenomenon Ghanaians themselves call " skirt and blouse voting " .
Intermarriage
In fact , one factor attributed to the defeat of Mr Atta Mills in 2000 and 2004 was the refusal of voters from the Central Region , from where he hails , to vote for him .
Ghana has a vibrant press and scores of radio stations Several members of parliament in Ghana have been elected by constituencies who voted for a different party in the presidential race .
Years of intermarriage have lessened the impact of ethnicity , even though it still plays a role in the politics of Ghana .
Another factor that suggests that Ghana democracy is sustainable is the Electoral Commission of Ghana .
It has been under the leadership of Kwadwo Afari - Djan for the past four elections .
He was appointed by the then - incumbent NDC government and oversaw two of their electoral victories .
He was retained by the current NPP administration and has supervised electoral victories and defeats under their incumbency .
Thus the electoral commission has both the appearance and credibility of an organisation that is able to conduct free and fair elections .
Free media Perhaps of equal importance is the media .
Ghana has one of the freest medias in Africa .
People hope that future oil revenue will bring improvements to all There are scores of radio stations dotted around the country .
During elections radio stations like the capital 's JoyFM dispatch staff armed with mobile phones around the country .
The correspondent gives continuous live updates and reports by mobile phone to their media " election headquarters " .
Once results are collated at the constituency , in the presence of party officials and electoral officers , the radio stations rapidly compile the results , broadcast them and a clear picture of the outcome is available within 24 hours .
The process has become too fast for old - fashioned election shenanigans .
JoyFM takes this a step further and publishes the results on the internet , thereby making it virtually impossible for a government to fiddle with results during a deliberate delay in their release by a government - controlled electoral commission as is the case elsewhere in Africa .
Politically aware
The only difference between the coverage on Ghanaian radio stations and those in first - world countries is the technology but in this case a simple mobile phone and basic web publishing software arguably works even better .
Ghanaians have hosted refugees ... do not want to end up as unwanted guests in neighbouring countries
This not to say problems do not exist .
There have been cases of some individuals attempting to register more than once .
And it is clear that both the ruling NPP and NDC exploit any advantage they have to win .
But Ghanaians have clearly become too politically aware to be taken for a ride .
All the presidential candidates participated in a number of nationally telecast debates , fielding questions on healthcare , education and the economy .
The political process is not foolproof and democracies can disintegrate under the pressure of politics but Sunday may be the final consolidation of the basic structures of democracy for Ghana .
Ghanaians have made it clear that they prefer democracy with all its flaws to military rule or anarchy .
Ghana has hosted refugees from civil crises in Liberia and Sierra Leone and Ghanaians do not want to end up as unwanted guests in neighbouring countries .
However more work needs to be done for ordinary citizens to feel the impact of democracy 's dividends where it counts most - in an improvement in their living standards .

Whisper the words " arranged marriage , " and images of women signed over as chattel are likely to rise in the minds of many Westerners .
But , say culture watchers and sociologists , there 's a rising interest in this age - old practice in the West , as shown by at least two books and three upcoming television series on the topic – as well as a growing number of matchmaking sites devoted solely to arranging unions .
More important , couples with no cultural or family tradition of arranged marriages are entering into matrimony with proper strangers in what is being called a " turbo - charged back to the future . "
While the number of nuptials consummated in this way is still small , there 's evidence that some of the principles of these traditional pacts are drawing attention and respect from both scholars and singles who are anxious to move into a married state .
" In this Internet age , we have so many options we want people to narrow them down for us , " says futurist Marian Saltzman , chief marketing officer at Porter Novelli in New York , who calls arranged marriages one of the " developing trends of the moment . "
Internet dating has exhausted many people , she adds , suggesting that if online courtship is the yin of modern relationships , then arranged marriages are the yang .
" People are saying to themselves , ' I 'm tired of a whole bunch of cheap Hershey bars .
I want gourmet chocolate and a connoisseur to tell me which of the top two brands I should choose . ' "
But , she points out , arranged marriages in countries such as the United States are " not the old routine of dads selling daughters for a dowry ; these kids have veto power . "
David Weinlick and his wife , Elizabeth , began their union through what their " marriage arranger , " good friend Steve Fletcher , calls " a piece of whimsy . "
Mr. Fletcher , a political consultant , got together with a group of friends and announced that Mr. Weinlick would be married on a certain date , but needed a bride .
" After we put this out as a press release , we thought nobody would take this seriously , " he says .
Instead , the group received hundreds of responses and more than two dozen women showed up on the appointed date to be " vetted " as potential brides .
Ten years and three children later , Weinlick says , " We love each other more every day . "
He and his wife , who is a nurse , agree that one of the keys to the union 's success has been their shared values .
" We were both committed to commitment , " he adds .
Nick Gilhool , casting director for the impending Lifetime cable show " Arranged Marriage , " in which four couples will take the plunge and allow cameras to film their first year together , says applicants share a frustration with dating and a desire to " be proactive " about their love lives .
" Marriage is being repositioned and reexamined , " he says .
The tradition of arranged marriages and the lessons it has for 21st - century couples interests author Reva Seth , an attorney of Indian heritage whose parents came together in an arranged marriage .
" Everyone I know is questioning the role of marriage today , " says the New Jersey - raised writer who now lives in Toronto with her husband and 4 - year - old son .
She began to interview women from arranged marriages with an eye to discovering lessons for Westerners .
The biggest surprise , says the author of " First Comes Marriage , " is that " most of these women are happy , the main reason being that they have realistic expectations about their partners and always viewed them as a life partner , not a lifesaver . "
One of the cornerstones of traditional arranged marriages is the participation of family members .
In the case of Huriya Manzar , a 30 - something computer programmer from Staten Island , N.Y. , her parents and brothers arranged her marriage when she was 18 .
" For us , marriage is not so much about two people being in love , " says Ms. Manzar .
" It is about a relationship to a larger community , our family , our friends , and our neighbors . "
She says her marriage to a man with whom she had spoken only briefly before they wed has been about " two human beings compromising and realizing that the other is only human , not some perfect being . "
Now pregnant with their second child , she adds that she loves her husband , although she does not feel she was ever " in love " with him .
This notion of romantic love and fulfillment through a soul mate is the cornerstone of much dissatisfaction , says psychologist Stan Tatkin .
He 's not surprised at singles investigating arranged marriage because it fits into one of the basic definitions of happiness .
" People generally find they are more able to find happiness from the things to which they commit themselves , " he says .
Lisa Clampitt , cofounder of the Matchmaking Institute , and her husband of five years barely knew one another when they wed .
" He proposed within 20 minutes of meeting me , I said yes , and a week later we sent out ' evites ' to our friends , " says the former social worker with a laugh , recalling that many of her buddies did n't respond because they considered it a joke .
" But , within two months we 'd gone to Las Vegas and married and begun our life together .
We just found things out after committing to each other , rather than before . "
Still , not all stories have such a happy ending .
Sophia McDonald , a university - educated Russian immigrant , says that she met a suitor from Seattle through an international matchmaker .
He and Ms. McDonald dated for a year before they married and began living in the US .
After the marriage did n’t work out , they divorced , and eventually she became a matchmaker for people in the Washington area .
[ Editor 's note : Sophia McDonald says that she dated her future husband for a year before they married and that they divorced because the marriage did n’t work out , not because there were any misrepresentations or financial failings on her husband ’s part .
She does not deal in international matchmaking . ]
Arranged marriage , as it's practiced traditionally , will never take deep root in the West , says Robert Epstein , visiting scholar at the University of California , San Diego .
" We do n't have the ... most important ingredients " – a strong community support system , either religious or social , and shared values or beliefs .
But , says the author of the upcoming book , " Making Love , " a study of the potential lessons from traditional matrimonial customs , Westerners can absorb the deeper principles , such as that love does n't have to rely on the click of Cupid 's wand ; it can be " made . "
He points to a story about an arranged marriage in a novel by Salman Rushdie .
Day by day , the wife contemplates a small aspect of her husband and resolves to love that single quality .
Bit by bit , she comes to love the whole man .
Just as mainstream culture has absorbed the notion that we can work to improve our physiques and our careers , says Dr. Epstein , we 'll come to accept that we can " work " on marriage and love .

While conducting a routine search for distant supernovae , astronomers observed a bright burst of light that they ca n’t account for .
On Feb. 21 , 2006 , the Hubble Space Telescope first imaged the source of light , which continued to brighten over the next 100 days , peaked , and then finally faded to oblivion over another 100 days .
The time scale of brightening , as well as the particular characteristics of the colors of light seen , do not match any known astronomical phenomena .
“ So far it ’s unlike anything previously observed , ” said Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory astronomer Kyle Barbary during a press briefing Tuesday at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Long Beach , California .
While supernovae normally take three weeks to reach their peak brightness ( or at most 70 days ) , this object , called SCP 06F6 , took significantly longer .
During the span that the light was visible , the team observed it with not only Hubble , but also with the Very Large Telescope in Chile and the Subaru Telescope and W.M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii .
The scientists can tell very little about the source of the flash — not even how far away it is , or how intrinsically bright .
That means it could have come from some event in our own galaxy , or from some distant region of the universe .
There is no visible star or galaxy at the site of flash to offer hints of what caused it .
Since the astronomers first announced the mystery sighting , many experts have offered guesses about what type of phenomenon could be behind it .
Suggestions include a new type of supernova ( such as the collapse and explosion of a unique star ) , a collision between a white dwarf star and a black hole , or even an exotic star made out of hypothetical “ mirror matter . ”
But none of the explanations are completely satisfying , Barbary said .
“ None of these are conclusive .
There are sort of problems with each one that make none of them a sure bet . ”
Some are even joking that it could have been caused by an alien civilization that had just turned on its own version of the Large Hadron Collider and blown itself up .
Since the object has completely faded away from sight by now , options for getting to the bottom of the mystery are slim .
“ I think probably the only way to learn much more is to maybe find more of these things and look for similarities , ” Barbary said .

Here 's a question :
Why has n't the Russian - Ukranian natural - gas spat sparked a frenzy of hand - wringing about energy security in Europe , as it did three years ago ?
Still no pressure ( AP ) In early 2006 , when Russia turned off the taps to natural gas passing through Ukranian pipelines , Europeans got chilly .
And European politicians who theretofore had talked more about climate change started adding " energy security " to their speeches .
It became one of the three official pillars of European energy policy ( alongside promoting greater competition and protecting the environment ) .
This time around , European leaders said the dustup ...
This says so much about the culture in Washington .
You ’d like to think that members of Congress are looking out for the nation ’s good and the well being of their constituents .
The Republicans sure are n’t .
Based on several news reports , it ’s clear the House Republicans are reveling in the united opposition to the economic recovery package .
This must seem bizarre to most people , especially those who are struggling and have lost their jobs or homes ( or both ) .
Everyone seems concerned as the economy continues to tank .
Yet , the Republicans are having a party because they all voted against saving the economy .
Wow .
And , from the wide coverage , its clear the Republicans want the world to know they ’re happy .
New York Times :
Republicans profess to be unconcerned .
House Republicans on Thursday headed off to a retreat at The Homestead , a Virginia resort , still celebrating their unanimous stand — despite Mr. Obama ’s visit to the Capitol to seek their support — against a package that in their view has too much big - government spending and too few tax cuts .
Their unsuccessful substitute was entirely of tax cuts .
The Hill :
House Republicans still elated from their unanimous vote againt the Democratic stimulus package think they will be able to work with President Obama on future bills despite the partisan vote
Washington Post :
The bill passed easily despite the opposition of all 177 Republican House members , but party leaders delighted in what they considered a victory after two straight electoral drubbings and much soul - searching about what the party stands for .
It ’s all fun and games for the GOP .
Sometimes he makes her wear an eye patch and call him “ The Old Man . ”
Is n’t it about time these two frakked ?
Or do you believe , as I do , that Adama and Roslin have been knocking space boots since New Caprica ?
Or are you of the opinion , as so many unfortunately are , that you have no idea what this comic is about because you do n’t watch Battlestar Galactica ( shame on you , bad geek , BAD GEEK ! ) ?
I know ultraspecificSPLODE comics like these are bound to alienate a vast number of you Fancy Bastards , but BSG has nearly run its course and I have to get this stuff out of my system while it ’s still relevant .
Even if you do n’t know the specifics of the Roslin / Adama relationship dynamic , you can still enjoy the fact that two old people are banging in space .
That ’s Grade - A Hotness right there .
To make it even nastier , the lady involved is bald and dying of cancer ( queue the “ bow - chicka - wow - wow ” music ) !
I know , right ?
If you are too turned on to continue reading this , feel free to stop here and go have some sex .

Did I mention the dude portion of this futuristic elderly sexcapade has a face so leathery and scarred with pock marks , craters , cracks and crevaces that it looks like the Moon and an old couch bad a baby ?
This pairing is oozing with sexual intercourse appeal … and probably some BenGay .

Roland Emmerich , the man behind Stargate , Godzilla ( the crappy U.S. version ) , Independence Day , last year 's 10,000 B.C. and much , much more will be directing film versions of Isaac Asimov 's Foundation trilogy , Variety is reporting .
A beloved and highly influential series set in the far - future , Asimov 's series is driven by complex ideas of the kind Emmerich — whose Columbia - backed bid trumped offers by Sony and an Alex Proyas - attached bid from Warner Bros . —has proven himself completely unwilling or unable to bring to the screen .
Of course , it could be fantastic .
Who knows ?
“ Since I do not want my private conversations looked at by those out to embarrass , the only course of action is not to correspond in cyberspace , ” Mr. Bush wrote from his old address , G94B@aol.com .
“ This saddens me .
I have enjoyed conversing with each of you . ”
But in the interceding eight years , as BlackBerrys have become ubiquitous  and often less intrusive than a telephone , the volume of e-mail has multiplied and the role of technology has matured .
Mr. Obama used e-mail to stay in constant touch with friends from the lonely confines of the road , often sending messages like “ Sox ! ” when the Chicago White Sox won a game .
He also relied on e-mail to keep abreast of the rapid whirl of events on a given campaign day .
Mr. Obama ’s memorandums and briefing books were seldom printed out and delivered to his house or hotel room , aides said .
They were simply sent to his BlackBerry for his review .
If a document was too long , he would read and respond from his laptop computer , often putting his editing changes in red type .
His messages to advisers and friends , they say , are generally crisp , properly spelled and free of symbols or emoticons .
The time stamps provided a window into how much he was sleeping on a given night , with messages often being sent to staff members at 1 a .m. or as late as 3 a .m. if he was working on an important speech .
He received a scaled - down list of news clippings , with his advisers wanting to keep him from reading blogs and news updates all day long , yet aides said he still seemed to hear about nearly everything in real time .
A network of friends  some from college , others from Chicago and various chapters in his life  promised to keep him plugged in .
Not having such a ready line to that network , staff members who spent countless hours with him say , is likely to be a challenge .
“ Given how important it is for him to get unfiltered information from as many sources as possible , I can imagine he will miss that freedom , ” said Linda Douglass , a senior adviser who traveled with the campaign .
I ran into a student from a class I taught last summer .
He ’s a really sharp guy , and when I first met him , I was impressed with just how much Perl he could stuff into his brain ’s cache .
He would write what he called ‘ one - liners ’ in Perl that , in reality , took up 5 - 10 lines in his terminal .
Still , he ’d type furiously , without skipping a beat .
But he told me when we met that he no longer does this , because I covered awk in my class .
His one - liners were mostly for data munging .
The data he needed to munge was mostly data that was pretty predictable .
It had a fixed number of fields , a consistent delimiter — in short , it was perfect for munging in awk without using any kind of esoteric awk - ness .
One thing I cover in the learning module I ’ve developed on Awk is aggregation of data using pretty simple awk one - liners .
For example , here ’s a pretty typical /etc / passwd file ( we need some data to munge ) :
root : x:0:0: root:/root:/bin/bash bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/sbin/nologin daemon:x:2:2:daemon:/sbin:/sbin/nologin adm:x:3:4:adm:/var/adm:/sbin/nologin lp:x:4:7:lp:/var/spool/lpd:/sbin/nologin sync:x:5:0:sync:/sbin:/bin/sync

It ’s not exotic , cool data that we ’re going to infer a lot of interesting things from , but it ’ll do for pedagogical purposes .
Now , let ’s write a super - simple awk aggregation routine that ’ll count the number of users whose UID is > 100 .
It ’ll look something like this :
awk - F : '$ 3 > 100 { x+=1} END { print x} '
/etc / passwd
The important thing to remember is that awk will initialize your variables to 0 for you , which cuts down on some clutter .
Let ’s abuse awk a bit further .
What if we want to know how many users use each shell in /etc / passwd , whatever those shells may be ?
Here ’s a one - liner that ’ll take care of this for you :
awk - F : '{x [ $ 7 ] + =1} END { for(z in x ) { print z , x[ z ] } }'
/etc / passwd
While awk does n’t technically support multi-dimensional arrays , it also does n’t have to be numerically indexed .
So here , we tell awk to increment x [ $ 7 ] .
$ 7 is the field that holds the shell for each user , so if $ 7 on the current line is / bin / bash , then we ’ve told awk to increment the value in the array indexed at x [ / bin / bash ] .
So , if there ’s only one line containing / bin / bash up to the current record , then x [ / bin / bash ] =1
There ’s a lot of great things you can move onto from here .
You can do things that others use Excel for right in awk .
If you have checkbook information in a flat file , you can add up purchases only in a given category , or , using the technique above , in every category .
If you store your stock purchase price on a line with the current price , you can use simple math to get the spread on each line and tell you whether your portfolio is up or down .
Let ’s have a look at something like that .
Here ’s some completely made up , hypothetical data representing a fictitious user ’s stock portfolio :
ABC,100,12.14,19.12 FOO,100,24.01,17.45 BAR,50,88.90,94.33 BA
Z,50,75.65,66.20 NI,23,33.12,43.32
Save that in a file called “ stocks.txt ” .
The columns are stock symbol , number of shares , purchase price , and current price , in that order .
This awk one - liner indexes the ‘ x ’ array using the stock symbol , and the value at that index is set to the amount gained or lost :
awk - F , '{x [ $ 1 ] = ( $ 2*$ 4 ) - ( $ 2*$ 3 ) } END { for(z in x ) { print z , x[ z ] }} ' stocks.
txt
Hm .
Actually , that ’s kind of inefficient .
I realized while previewing this post that I can shorten it up a bit like this :
awk - F , '{x [ $ 1 ] =
( $ 2*( $ 4 - $ 3 ) ) } END { for(z in x ) { print z , x[ z ] }} ' stocks.txt
Glad I caught that before the nitpickers flamed me to a crisp .
Always preview your posts ! ;-P
Ah , but of course , that ’s not enough .
This spits out the gain and loss for each stock , but what about the net gain or loss across all of them ?
You only need to tweak a little bit :
awk - F , '{x [ $ 1 ] = ( $ 2*( $ 4 - $ 3 ) ) ; y+=x [ $ 1 ] } END { for(z in x ) { print z , x [ z ] } ; print " Net : " y} ' stocks.
txt
We just added the assignment of the ‘y ’ variable before the “ END ” , and then added a print statement after the “ END ” .
I hope this helps some folks out there .
Also , if your team needs to know stuff like this , I do on - site training !
“ A gay couple in California have won a federal court ruling that orders Louisiana to put the names of both men on their adopted son ’s birth certificate despite state law against unmarried adoption .
The facts are so clear that no trial is needed , wrote U.S. District Judge Jay Zainey .
Louisiana ’s Office of Vital Records must give full faith and credit to the New York state court in which Oren Adar and Mickey Ray Smith adopted the boy , the judge ruled last week .
The two gay men lived in New York at the time of the 2006 adoption , but have since moved to San Diego .
The boy was born in Louisiana .
The Louisiana office had refused to issue a birth certificate listing both as the boy ’s legal parents .
Louisiana law does not let two unmarried people adopt a child together , regardless of sex , wrote Carol L. Haynes , representing the state health department and registrar Darlene W. Smith .

Hackers broke into the computer systems of the Barack Obama and John McCain campaign teams during the US presidential race and stole a ' ' serious amount of files " in an operation that US government cyber experts believe originated from China .
The Secret Service and FBI warned Obama and McCain earlier this year that their computer networks had been infiltrated by foreign hackers who downloaded large quantities of information from the campaign networks .
" You have been compromised , and a serious amount of files have been loaded off your system , " an FBI agent said , according to a report in Newsweek magazine .
The report went on to say that technical experts speculated the hackers were Russian or Chinese .
The FBI apparently told Obama the attack had not been carried out by political opponents .
US officials said they discovered that the cyber attacks originated in China but do not yet know if they were government - sponsored or from an unaffiliated source .
The incident was first revealed in a Newsweek report that said the FBI and Secret Service told the Obama team of the attack in the summer .
According to the article , Josh Bolten , the White House chief of staff , called David Plouffe , who was Obama 's campaign manager , saying : " You have a real problem … you have to deal with it . "
It is understood the campaigns then hired private cyber security companies to look into the breaches .
The Secret Service and the McCain and Obama campaign teams have made no comment on the alleged attacks .
Hi , my name is Karen and I am a mature student .
I am twenty years older than some of the people in my classes but , surprisingly , I 'm also more than 20 years younger than some of them as well .
Going back to school as an adult is becoming increasingly popular , and not just for those of us experiencing a mid-life , mid-career crisis , but also , admirably in my opinion , for many who have finished their career but are n’t quite ready to finish their quest for new knowledge .
Reasons to go back to school later in life are many and varied .
You may not have had the time or money at a younger age .
You may not have had the relevant qualifications ( most schools have different entry requirements for mature students that take into account life experience as well as , or instead of , formal qualifications ) .
You may not have needed college level qualifications for your job and now you do .
You may want to change career , or you may have retired and want to study purely for personal interest and stimulation .
Whatever your reasons , you ’re unlikely to be alone .
You may be amazed how many other retraining middle executives / returning to work moms / over 65 year olds there are in your classes .
Certainly some of the 18 year old recent high school graduates are often surprised by how many “ wrinklies ” there are in their classes and sometimes staggered by how well some of us tend to do with our studies ( perhaps they think that anyone in their 30s , 40s or above is too much of an old dog to learn any new tricks , and boy are we determined to prove them wrong ) .
Mature students , you see , tend to do well .
This may be because we have more relevant life experience to lend complexity and examples to the theory we ’re learning .
It may be because juggling work and family life has helped us develop good organisational and time management skills .
It may be because funding our degrees ourselves gives us focus and motivation .
It may be because we ’ve learnt the hard way that things worth having usually have to be worked hard at .
It may even be that after spending years lecturing our kids about the importance of doing well at school , we do n’t want the embarrassment of having to admit to them that Mom got a C - .
And it does n’t hurt that most of us do n’t spend lectures hiding behind our laptops facebooking because , well , let ’s face it , once you hit 30 your social life somehow becomes just another part of your life rather than the driving force behind your will to live .
So if you are planning a late - in - life return to education what are some of the things you should consider ?
How to fund it .
Presumably your parents are n’t going to want to pay for your education once you ’ve left home , had a few jobs , a few kids and maybe one or more spouses .
You will have to pay your fees and support yourself this time around , but do n’t despair .
Student loans are available for mature students and if you are a parent or senior you may find you ’re eligible for extra financial help and / or tax breaks .
Also ask about scholarships , bursaries and work on campus – work you may be far more qualified for than many younger students .
Do n’t rule out your employer as a source of funding .
If you study part - time and stay in full time employment some employers may be willing to pay part of your fees if your course is related to your job .
Most mature students do work part - time , but then so do most younger students .
The recession is biting and many parents can’t provide the support they used to for their college bound offspring .
If you ’re changing careers , now might be a good time to get some part - time experience on the bottom rung of the ladder you ’re hoping to climb .
Where to study .
Some schools have a lot more age diversity than others .
Check out the campus you want to attend to see if you think you would feel comfortable there and see if you can talk to other mature students already attending .
Some schools have a requirement that mature students start off studying part - time ( depending on their educational background ) .
This can be a good thing as it lets you " try on " a new life and decide whether you can commit to it full time .
Many mature students do n’t have much of a choice .
We tend to go to school where our life is .
It ’s hard to pick up and move somewhere else if we have kids in school , a house with a mortgage , a spouse with a job or maybe an ex-spouse who we still co-parent with who has a life in a certain area .
Do n’t be put off going back to school because you do n’t have the choices you may have had at 18 .
Research the options , and make the best of what ’s available .
If some courses you want to take are n’t available at your local school look into online courses ( make sure your school will accept the credits you earn online ) or find out if you can travel a bit further one day a week to take a certain course elsewhere and use those credits towards your final qualification .
One quick warning .
Studying online often seems like a great option for a mature student but some qualifications are n’t accepted by employers the same way campus based qualifications are , especially when it comes to degrees .
Be very careful to thoroughly research online degrees and make sure they are legitimate and widely accepted in your industry before parting with any money .
What to study
Mature students tend to put a lot of thought into what to study .
We tend to have a plan in going back to school and be very focussed on an end goal .
You rarely find older students pursuing undeclared ( and undecided ) majors because they just wanted to go to college .
If you have a career plan in mind going back to school make sure you meet with an advisor early on to make sure you have all the pre-requisites you ’re going to need , especially if your degree , for example , is one step in a bigger plan to go on to graduate school or obtain other professional qualifications .
One area some mature students really enjoy can be optional courses .
If you have to complete a certain amount of electives and you have complete free choice , do n’t be afraid to pick things that really interest you .
By now you probably know your own mind better than you did as a teenager and this can be a great opportunity to pursue your true passions , whether it ’s art , astronomy or gender studies .
Take advantage of the fact that you ’re not an 18 year old who has no idea what he wants to do ( which may lead him to pick elective courses based solely on the fact that they do n’t start at 8.00 am Monday morning ) .

The Asahi Shimbun had an article this morning about the introduction of non-alphabet internet domain extensions .
In response to demands from countries where the roman alphabet is not used , ICANN decided in November last year on a policy allowing non-alphabetic extensions .
The example given in the article was kanji : from 2009 it will be possible to have a URL which looks like this :
http://OOOOOOO.日本
Since 2001 it has been possible to use non-alphabetic characters for domains , eg :
http://日本.com
So from 2009 this will be possible :
http://日本.日本
The details of the policy will be hammered out this year .
Though the article focused on Japanese , naturally these changes will also allow the use of Arabic , Devanagari etc .
NB According to the TV news , Japanese seniors will find the changes helpful , as they have n't really taken to those newfangled roman letters .
On a recent morning , a 27 - year - old skateboarder who goes by the name Josh Peacock peered into a swimming pool in Fresno , Calif. , emptied by his own hands  and the foreclosure crisis  and flashed a smile as wide as a half - pipe .
“ We have more pools than we know what to do with , ” said Mr. Peacock , who lives in Fresno , the Central Valley city where thousands of homes , many with pools behind them , are in foreclosure .
“ I ca n’t even keep track of them all anymore . ”
Across the nation , the ultimate symbol of suburban success has become one more reminder of the economic meltdown , with builders going under , pools going to seed and skaters finding a surplus of deserted pools in which to perfect their acrobatic aerials .
In these boom times for skaters , Mr. Peacock travels with a gas - powered pump , five - gallon buckets , shovels and a push broom , risking trespassing charges in the pursuit of emptying forlorn pools and turning them into de facto skate parks .
LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Guns N' Roses became Guns N' Roses N' Lawyers this week .
Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose finally released " Chinese Democracy " in November .
The band , which released its first album in 17 years last week , has found itself in a legal tussle with soft drink giant Dr Pepper over a promotion turned awry .
Dr Pepper rolled out a marketing campaign in March promising a " free soda " to " everyone in America " on one condition -- Axl Rose , lead singer and frontman for Guns N' Roses , had to " finally release his 17 - year - in - the - making belabored masterpiece , ' Chinese Democracy , ' in 2008 . "
Guns N' Roses , often called GN 'R by its fans , released the album last week .
And Dr Pepper followed through , posting a coupon on its Web site for a can of soda .
There was one catch : fans had 24 hours to go the Web site and print out the coupon .
That 's when the Pepper hit the fan .
Watch why GN'R is so angry »
So many GN 'R fans -- and , no doubt , fans of free stuff in general -- tried to get the coupon that they choked the site and it crashed .
Disgruntled and downright ticked off , some blamed the band .
" When you go on the blogs and you read the responses from the fans , they associated Axl with this promotion ... and blame him for the fact that they did n't get their free soda , " said GN 'R lawyer Laurie Soriano .
That 's when GN 'R became GN'RN'L. Soriano fired off a letter to Dr P .
No one is LOL .
Her letter asked the soft drink company to make good on its offer .
She has yet to hear back , Soriano said this week .
" We 've gone public with the fact that we are not involved but are trying to clean up the mess , " Soriano told CNN .
Dr Pepper told CNN it had " taken great steps " to keep up its end of the bargain .
It said it extended the window for the giveaway from 24 to 42 hours , added a toll - free line to handle consumer requests for the coupons and set up an interactive voice recorder to accept coupon requests .
None of those measures are still in effect .
" Additionally , " the company said in a written statement , " for those who contacted us in the week after the giveaway about difficulties requesting the coupon , we continued to offer free coupons to address any problems they may have encountered . "
That may be so , but the band still wants an apology .
" The door to a lawsuit being filed is always open until the fans are taken care of and Dr Pepper has done the right thing , " Soriano told CNN .
The band may have other concerns .
" Chinese Democracy " received mixed notices upon its release , and some bloggers are blaming Axl Rose for the new album 's reception .
" The album was beaten to the top of the UK charts by The Killers ' ' Day And Age ' on Sunday , " the British music news site NME.com said Tuesday in a segment labeled Today 's Top Gossip .
" Sources have said that record bosses are fuming because Rose has been AWOL for the last two months -- meaning he has n't done any promotional work for the album . "
And an official Chinese Communist Party newspaper was widely reported as describing " Chinese Democracy " as a " venomous attack " on China , accusing the band of turning " its spear point on China . "
As Rose once sang , " Welcome to the jungle .
It gets worse here every day . "
In an interview this week with the Christian Broadcasting Network , Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska , the Republican vice - presidential candidate , was asked to “ clear up exactly what you believe in ” about her religious faith , including her involvement with Pentecostalism .
Ms. Palin responded by speaking generally , but extensively , about how she counts on God for strength , guidance and wisdom .
“ My faith has always been pretty personal , ” she said .
But she did not talk more specifically about her church affiliation or her beliefs .
Ms. Palin ’s faith has come under scrutiny after two videos taken in her former church surfaced on YouTube and became immediate sensations .
The first showed a visiting preacher from Kenya praying fervently over Ms. Palin in a gravelly voice and asking God to favor her campaign for governor and protect her from “ every form of witchcraft . ”
The second showed Ms. Palin at an event in June praising the African preacher ’s prayer as “ awesome ” and “ very , very powerful . ”
She is also seen nodding as her former pastor from Wasilla prays over her and declares that Alaska is “ one of the refuge states in the Last Days , ” a piece of prophecy popular in some prayer networks that predicts that as the “ end times ” approach , people will flock to Alaska for its abundant open space and natural resources .
IMAGINE a technology that lets you pay for products just by waving your cellphone over a reader .
The technology exists , and , in fact , people in Japan have been using it for the last five years to pay for everything from train tickets to groceries to candy in vending machines .
And in small - scale trials around the world , including in Atlanta , New York and the San Francisco Bay Area , nearly everyone has liked using this form of payment .
But consumers in the United States wo n’t be able to wave and pay with their cellphones anytime soon :
The myriad companies that must work together to give the technology to the masses have yet to agree on how to split the resulting revenue .
“ In Japan it was easier , ” explains Gerhard Romen , director for corporate business development at Nokia .
“ It was just the major guys saying , ‘ This is how it will be . ’ ” A single carrier , NTT DoCoMo , accounted for more than half the Japanese market at the time the system was rolled out and thus had significant leverage with financial institutions and handset manufacturers .
This is not the case in the United States .
For such payments to work here , cellphone manufacturers , carriers , financial institutions and retailers must all play roles .
There also must be some sort of intermediary that is trusted by both the financial institutions and the carriers to activate the virtual credit cards inside the phone .

Dear EarthTalk : I ’ve noticed that bamboo is very trendy right now , apparently — in part — for environmental reasons .
Can you enlighten ?
-- Eric M. , via e-mail
Bamboo has a long history of economic and cultural significance , primarily in East Asia and South East Asia where it has been used for centuries for everything from building material to food to medicine .
There are some 1,000 different species of bamboo growing in very diverse climates throughout the world , including the southeastern United States .
Bamboo ’s environmental benefits arise largely out of its ability to grow quickly — in some cases three to four feet per day — without the need for fertilizers , pesticides or much water .
Bamboo also spreads easily with little or no care .
In addition , a bamboo grove releases some 35 percent more oxygen into the air than a similar - sized stand of trees , and it matures ( and can be replanted ) within seven years ( compared to 30 - 50 years for a stand of trees ) , helping to improve soil conditions and prevent erosion along the way .
Bamboo is so fast - growing that it can yield 20 times more timber than trees on the same area .
Today , heightened consumer environmental awareness has given sales of bamboo flooring , clothing , building materials and other items a huge boost .
As an attractive and sturdy alternative to hardwood flooring , bamboo is tough to beat .
According to Pacific Northwest green building supplier Ecohaus , bamboo — one of the firm ’s top selling flooring options — is harder , more moisture resistant and more stable than even oak hardwoods .
Ecohaus carries both the EcoTimber and Teragren brands of bamboo , and ships worldwide .
Bamboo is also making waves in the clothing industry as an eco-chic and functional new fabric .
Softer than cotton and with a texture more akin to silk or cashmere , bamboo clothes naturally draw moisture away from the skin , so it ’s great for hot weather or for sweaty workouts .
It also dries in about half the time as cotton clothing .
Some critics point out that the process of converting bamboo to fabric can take a heavy environmental toll , with the most cost - effective and widespread method involving a harsh chemical - based hydrolysis- alkalization process followed by multi-phase bleaching .
The Green Guide counters , though , that bamboo still has a much lower environmental impact than pesticide - laden conventional cotton and petroleum - derived nylon and polyester fabrics .
Consumers interested in trying out bamboo clothing should look for the Bamboosa and EcoDesignz labels , two of the leaders in the fast - growing sector of green fashion .
Bamboo is also making inroads into the paper industry , though there are fears that too fast a transition there would threaten ecologically diverse bamboo forests across Southeast Asia and elsewhere .
The Earth Island Institute , among other groups concerned about forest loss due to paper consumption , would instead like to see more research into using agricultural waste to make paper instead of wood pulp or bamboo .
Regardless , bamboo in all its forms might one day soon be one of the most important plants in the world .

OTTAWA , Dec 3 ( Reuters ) - Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper will address the nation on Wednesday night as speculation heightens that he will ask for a temporary suspension of Parliament to try to prevent the opposition from taking power .
Governor General Michaelle Jean , who will play a key role in the political crisis gripping the country , is due back from a foreign trip several hours before the prime minister speaks .
Harper , whose Conservatives were reelected with a minority government on Oct. 14 , is expected to say that a plan by the three opposition parties to bring down the government and install a coalition government is illegitimate .
A leading option he is considering is asking Jean to suspend Parliament at least until his government can present a budget with new measures to stimulate the economy in late January .
Jean is the representative in Canada of Queen Elizabeth , the country ’s head of state , and must weigh competing constitutional arguments on whether to grant such a request or a possible later Conservative request to call a new election .
She is returning to Ottawa at 3 p.m. ( 2000 GMT ) from Europe , and Harper ’s televised address is set for 7 p.m .
Harper aides would not say whether he would meet Jean this afternoon .
The main opposition Liberal Party , the separatist Bloc Quebecois and the left - leaning New Democratic Party signed an agreement on Monday to try to replace the Conservatives with a Liberal - NDP government supported by the Bloc .
To do so they would first have to defeat the government in a confidence vote in Parliament scheduled for next Monday evening .
That would be prevented for now if Parliament is suspended .

Leviticus Trivia Question :
The Book of Leviticus CHAPTER 11
All creatures clean and unclean
1 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron , saying unto them , 2 Speak unto the children of Israel , saying , These are the beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the earth .
3
Whatsoever parteth the hoof , and is clovenfooted , and cheweth the cud , among the beasts , that shall ye eat .
Say these words to the Israelites , These are the beasts that you may eat : [ 1 ]
Whatever parts the hoof , is clovenfooted , and chews the cud .
God said to Moses and Aaron ,
4 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud , or of them that divide the hoof : as the camel , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
Do n't eat animals that do n't chew the cud and divide the hoof .
Like the camel .
Do n't eat it since it chews the cud but does n't divide the hoof .
It is unclean to you .
5 And the coney , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
6
And the hare , because he cheweth the cud , but divideth not the hoof ; he is unclean unto you .
Do n't eat coneys or hares since they chew the cud [ 2 ] , but do n't divide the hoof .
They are unclean to you .
7 And the swine , though he divide the hoof , and be clovenfooted , yet he cheweth not the cud ; he is unclean to you .
8
Of their flesh shall ye not eat , and their carcase shall ye not touch ; they are unclean to you .
Pigs divide the hoof and are clovenfooted , but they do n't chew the cud .
So they are unlcean to you .
Do n't eat them or touch their dead bodies .
9 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters : whatsoever hath fins and scales in the waters , in the seas , and in the rivers , them shall ye eat .
You may eat whatever lives in water and has fins and scales .
10 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas , and in the rivers , of all that move in the waters , and of any living thing which is in the waters , they shall be an abomination unto you : 11 They shall be even an abomination unto you ; ye shall not eat of their flesh , but ye shall have their carcases in abomination .
12 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters , that shall be an abomination unto you .
But every animal that lives in water and does n't have both fins and scales is an abomination to you .
Do n't eat them or touch their dead bodies . [ 3 ]
13 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among the fowls ; they shall not be eaten , they are an abomination : the eagle , and the ossifrage , and the ospray , 14 And the vulture , and the kite after his kind ; 15 Every raven after his kind ; 16 And the owl , and the night hawk , and the cuckow , and the hawk after his kind , 17 And the little owl , and the cormorant , and the great owl , 18 And the swan , and the pelican , and the gier eagle , 19 And the stork , the heron after her kind , and the lapwing , and the bat .
The following birds are abominations : the eagle , ossifage , osprey , vulture , kite , raven , owl , nighthawk , cuckow , hawk , cormorant , swan , pelican , stork , heron , lapwing , and bat [ 4 ] .
20 All fowls that creep , going upon all four , shall be an abomination unto you .
All birds that creep , going on all four , shall be an abomination unto you .
21 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth upon all four , which have legs above their feet , to leap withal upon the earth ; 22 Even these of them ye may eat ; the locust after his kind , and the bald locust after his kind , and the beetle after his kind , and the grasshopper after his kind .
But you may eat any flying creeping thing that goes on all four , with legs above their feet . [ 5 ]
23 But all other flying creeping things , which have four feet , shall be an abomination unto you .
But all other four - footed , flying , creeping things shall be an abomination to you . [ 6 ]
24 And for these ye shall be unclean : whosoever toucheth the carcase of them shall be unclean until the even .
25 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
26
The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof , and is not clovenfooted , nor cheweth the cud , are unclean unto you : every one that toucheth them shall be unclean .
27 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws , among all manner of beasts that go on all four , those are unclean unto you : whoso toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even .
28 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : they are unclean unto you .
Whoever touches the carcass of a dead unclean thing is unclean until the evening . [ 7 ]
29 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things that creep upon the earth ; the weasel , and the mouse , and the tortoise after his kind , 30 And the ferret , and the chameleon , and the lizard , and the snail , and the mole .
31 These are unclean to you among all that creep : whosoever doth touch them , when they be dead , shall be unclean until the even .
Weasels [ 8 ] , mice , tortoises , ferrets , chamelions , lizards , snails , and moles are also unclean creeping things .
32 And upon whatsoever any of them , when they are dead , doth fall , it shall be unclean ; whether it be any vessel of wood , or raiment , or skin , or sack , whatsoever vessel it be , wherein any work is done , it must be put into water , and it shall be unclean until the even ; so it shall be cleansed .
Whoever or whatever touches a dead unclean beast will also be unlcean , including vessels , wood , clothing , skin , sack , oven , and pots .
The unclean thing must be washed with water and will be unclean until the evening .
33 And every earthen vessel , whereinto any of them falleth , whatsoever is in it shall be unclean ; and ye shall break it .
34 Of all meat which may be eaten , that on which such water cometh shall be unclean : and all drink that may be drunk in every such vessel shall be unclean .
36 Nevertheless a fountain or pit , wherein there is plenty of water , shall be clean : but that which toucheth their carcase shall be unclean .
37 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed which is to be sown , it shall be clean .
38 But if any water be put upon the seed , and any part of their carcase fall thereon , it shall be unclean unto you .
An unclean eathen vessel must be broken .
39 And if any beast , of which ye may eat , die ; he that toucheth the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even .
40
And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even : he also that beareth the carcase of it shall wash his clothes , and be unclean until the even .
If you touch the body of a beast that dies of natural causes , then you will be unclean until the evening .
And if you eat its carcass , you must wash your clothes and be unclean until the evening .
41 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be an abomination ; it shall not be eaten .
Every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth is an abomination .
Do n't eat them .
42 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly , and whatsoever goeth upon all four , or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things that creep upon the earth , them ye shall not eat ; for they are an abomination .
43 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping thing that creepeth , neither shall ye make yourselves unclean with them , that ye should be defiled thereby .
Do n't make yourself abominable with any creeping thing that creeps .
44 For I am the LORD your God : ye shall therefore sanctify yourselves , and ye shall be holy ; for I am holy : neither shall ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth .
Be holy , because I am holy .
Do n't defile yourself with any creeping things that creep on the earth .
45 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of Egypt , to be your God : ye shall therefore be holy , for I am holy .
Be holy , because I am holy . [ 9 ]
46 This is the law of the beasts , and of the fowl , and of every living creature that moveth in the waters , and of every creature that creepeth upon the earth : 47 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean , and between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not be eaten .

BRUSSELS / LONDON ( Reuters ) -
As the financial crisis hit a climax in Belgium with the split - up of its largest bank Fortis in October , new clients were rushing to a small , “ ecologically correct ” bank .
An employee walks inside ethical bank Triodos in Brussels , October 31 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Thierry Roge
Triodos -- investing not in derivatives but in tangible products such as wind turbines which the general public can understand and even applaud -- was not the only alternative institution to benefit in Europe .
Around the world , the mainstream financial sector and its banks are facing flak for having crafted the mind - numbingly complex financial products that helped set off the worst financial crisis in 80 years .
Besides Triodos , Britain ’s Ecology Building Society and the Co-operative Bank say they are net beneficiaries , with some analysts arguing they are building a more trustworthy franchise even though the returns they offer depositors are modest .
“ The big banks speculate on money which , at the end of the day , I do n’t know whether they have or not but it ’s got nothing to do with reality , ” said 58 - year - old Michele Bellay .
Interviewed outside a Fortis branch in central Brussels , she said she would be willing to switch to an “ ethical bank ” rather than a High Street one : “ It corresponds to the real economy , ... to what people live every day . ”
An average of 60 new accounts a day were opened in the Belgian branch of Triodos in October -- five times the usual figure , its managing director Oliver Marquet said .
The bank , with headquarters in the Netherlands and branches in Spain and Britain , says it invests only in green , social and cultural projects , such as wind turbines and medical centers .
“ We started seeing something unusual in July ... it accelerated in September , and accelerated even further in October with the crisis at Fortis and Dexia , ” said Marquet , of the increased business .
Credit rating agency Moody ’s analyst Irakli Pipia said “ ethical banks ” were benefiting to an extent from a trend for people to spread their money around to benefit from capped state guarantees for deposits in each institution .

TRANSPARENCY
The ethically focused groups say they are transparent and invest in tangible projects , and that this explains an increase in deposits and clients at a time of financial turmoil .
“ We invest in the real economy -- ecological buildings , wind turbines , cultural projects .
We do n’t invest ... ( in ) purely virtual products , ” Marquet said .
“ Transparency is absolutely key and explains why we hold on well in crisis , ” he said .
Paul Ellis , Chief Executive of the Ecology Building Society said that communicating with clients was key : “ Ourselves , Co-Operative and Triodos , we make a point of telling people what we do with their money , ” he said in an interview .
Fortis was carved up by Benelux authorities in October after a cash injection failed to calm investor nerves .
Dexia also received state help .
The Belgian branch of Triodos , which now has some 28,000 clients , does not borrow on the inter - bank lending market .
It saw a 10 percent increase in the value of deposits in the first half of the year and a further 10 percent in July and August , to reach about a 30 percent boost by end -October , Marquet said .
In Britain , the Ecology Building Society had inflows of 2.4-2.5 million pounds in October -- a drop in the ocean compared with the usual inflows of a High Street bank but double its April inflow , which the society said was already a record .
“ The overall net inflow for 2008 has already exceeded inflow for the whole of 2007 .
In fact we are currently seeing a year - on - year growth of over 65 percent , ” Jack Taylor , a marketing executive at the firm , told Reuters .
The society , which says it assesses the environmental impact of any project before agreeing finance , is one of the smallest building societies in Britain with group assets of 75 million pounds .
Britain ’s Co-operative Bank -- whose
Web site details its stance on ethics , climate change and human rights -- said retail savings had grown by 11 per cent and term savings ( for one to three years ) by 0.4 billion pounds or 87 per cent over the first six months of this year .
“ Investors wo n’t ignore climate change when going through a financial crisis , ” added Stephen Hine of International Relations at Ethical Investment Research Service ( EIRIS ) , which researches companies ’ social , environmental and ethical performance .
TRUST
Returns from these institutions may not be attractive in purely financial terms .
For example , Triodos Belgium offers a 2 percent interest rate for a savings account , plus a premium of 2 percent for new cash which stays in the account for six months , and 0.5 percent for money which has stayed on the account for 11 months .
That compares with Fortis ’s rate of 4.25 percent plus 1 percent premium for money deposited in the last three months of 2008 , and is of course much lower than the return that some high - risk financial products can offer .
Both rates lag inflation .
In Belgium , that peaked at 5.9 percent in July with the European Commission forecasting earlier this month the overall rate would be 4.7 percent for the country in 2008 .
Despite this , some experts say clients seemed to be more loyal to ethical banks .
“ There is a growing recognition that you do have to dig a bit deeper , you do n’t just chase the higher rates , you need to look at what are you actually doing with your money , ” the Ecology Building Society ’s Ellis said .
Michael Lafferty , from Lafferty Group , which advises retail banking and personal financial services industry , said he believed the crisis showed a deeper problem of lack of trust in banks , rather than an interest in ethical banks .
“ The big concern to people is : Can they trust their bank ?
That ’s the ultimate ethical issue , I ’ve been testing people .... not one of them would trust their bank at the moment , ” he said .
“ It will merge with something more serious which is the severe damage that has occurred to trust in banking in general ... out of all of that eventually in some 6 - 12 months will come ideas about how people expect banks to behave in the future . ”

A recession is possibly the best time to launch a new business or to expand an existing one .
It ’s also a great time to get ahead in your career .
I know this sounds counter - intuitive , so let me ‘ splain .
First , the media goes nuts during a recession .
They turn a little bit of negativity into a mountain of pessimism .
This makes a lot of people financially paranoid .
People become socially conditioned to expect the worst .
If you buy into this social hysteria , you become a victim too .
But if you tune out such stupidity ( not watching TV helps a lot ) and maintain a grip on rational thought , you ’ll see some amazing opportunities popping up everywhere you look .
During such times people get scared and start cutting back on expenses .
They cut some of the fluff from their lives .
They stop buying so much stuff they do n’t need .
This causes some businesses to do poorly , especially businesses that do n’t provide stuff we really need .
We can live without new credit cards and gas - guzzling SUVs for a while .
Those non-essentials can be put off .
We also become more sensitive to receiving genuine value .
When we spend money , we want to make sure we ’re getting a fair deal .
Consequently , businesses that provide genuine value can actually do better during a recession .
More people will flock to those businesses in tough times , while the fluff businesses will become more and more paranoid .
In the USA there are a lot of fluff businesses .
Many are based on the moocher mindset , trying to extract money without providing fair value in exchange .
A lot of the dead or dying financial companies are like that .
The American auto industry has been contracting as well , at least in part because they ’ve been creating inferior products that people do n’t really need .
( Erin and I own a Honda , despite the fact that we could have gotten a significant discount on GM cars because two of my family members used to work for GM .
We looked at some GM cars and quickly concluded they sucked .
Other family members were n’t so lucky . )
A lot of people have been learning that job security does n’t mean much these days .
More than 500,000 Americans learned this lesson last month when they lost their “ safe and secure ” jobs .
The Stupid Approach to Making Money
Lately I ’ve seen a lot of people , some of them friends , do some really dumb things in an attempt to earn more money .
They buy into lame money - making programs , join and promote useless MLM schemes , and fall prey to scammers .
The common pattern is always the same — they ’re focused on trying to make more money .
They make it their top priority .
They think about it constantly .
But they keep getting sucked into trying to make money without providing any real value , and it ’s unsustainable .
In the end this sort of thing eventually self - destructs .
The only way to succeed with it in the long run is to find lots of suckers and basically rip them off in order to enrich yourself .
Most people have a strong enough moral resistance to this sort of thing that they ’ll sabotage themselves from going too far with it .
This is n’t a path of long - term abundance .
It ’s a path of scarcity .
As a general rule , the people I know who are most focused on trying to make more money this year are doing worse , not better .
In some cases they ’re doing much worse .
A few have lost or are in the process of losing their homes .
The exceptions are those that are able to sufficiently kill their conscience , so they can remove any incongruencies about ripping people off .
But again , this is a pretty rare exception .
Most people would rather deal with scarcity than knowingly rip people off to get ahead , so they just make the bare minimum to meet their needs and avoid getting ahead .
The Smart Approach to Making Money
There is a smarter approach , however .
Instead of focusing on trying to make more money , put your time and energy into CREATING and DELIVERING real value .
Find a way to give people what they want and / or need .
Take note that the keywords here are CREATE and DELIVER .
Creating value means expressing your unique talents and skills in a way that can potentially benefit others .
Delivering value means ensuring that other people are actually receiving and benefiting from the value you ’ve created .
If you do n’t do both in some fashion , then it ’s going to be hard for you to generate sustainable income , especially during a recession .
I ’ll explain why .
If you only create value but do n’t deliver it , then your value is n’t being received by anyone .
So how can you receive value ( such as money ) in return ?
I see this problem a lot with creative types such as would - be artists , musicians , and writers .
They may spend lots of time honing their craft , but if they do n’t actually get that value into the hands of sufficient numbers of people , they struggle financially , and this hurts them creatively too .
A goodly number of these people are currently seeing their homes in foreclosure now .
The sad thing is that some of these people work very hard .
But they spend too much time creating and not nearly enough time delivering .
They watch people they consider hacks pull ahead of them .
The hacks may not be as good on the creative side , but at least they ’re getting their value into people ’s hands , and on some level people are appreciating their work .
I went down that road myself .
In the late 90s , I went bankrupt , even though I was working very long hours and creating a lot of potential value in the form of a computer game my company was developing .
My problem was that I did n’t do a good job of getting that value delivered .
I relied on publishers to do that , and for various reasons the game was never released .
That resulted in years of wasted effort , aside from the valuable learning experience that is .
So I know where this road leads because I traveled it .
On the other hand , if you only deliver value but do n’t create it , then you ’re delivering someone else ’s value .
This is n’t a terrible approach in the short run , but it ’s a short - sighted long - term strategy if this is all you do .
There ’s nothing particularly special about delivering other people ’s value .
Anyone can do it .
Anyone can sign up for affiliate programs or join an MLM program or become a reseller .
If this is your primary means of generating income , your long - term outlook is weak .
The better this works for you , the more it will draw competitors into your field .
Eventually everyone will be working harder and harder for scraps .
This happens all the time .
This strategy can be especially weak during a recession , as more people turn to less expensive sources for the same value you deliver , squeezing your profit margins thinner and thinner .
Bloggers fall into this trap when they rehash other people ’s content and do n’t really have anything unique or compelling to say .
A year later their niche is flooded with competitors doing the same thing .
And hardly anyone is earning decent income from it .
The most viable long - term strategy is to create AND deliver value .
You can mix and match other strategies with it , but this should be your primary method of income generation .
If you get good at creating and delivering value , you can basically write your own ticket and enjoy lots of abundance .
A Choice of Mindset
I know a lot of people are dealing with financial challenges these days .
Las Vegas is basically the foreclosure capital of the USA right now .
I know people who ’ve lost their homes .
I see “ bank owned ” signs all over the place .
If you ’re going through something like this right now , I totally empathize with you .
However , I have to point out that the pattern of what causes this is so clear , it ’s getting a bit ridiculous to see it play out over and over again .
Generally speaking , people who CREATE and DELIVER value are doing just fine .
In fact , I ’d say most are doing better , not worse .
Many of these people are seeing their incomes go up during this time .
People who do n’t CREATE and DELIVER value are seeing their finances grow progressively worse .
This leads many of them to panic , so they head even further away from creating and delivering value ( such as by chasing lame money - making schemes ) , which only quickens the decline to insolvency .
I know it seems logical that if you ’re seeing your finances decline , then you should focus single - mindedly on trying to make more money as quickly as possible .
People fall into this trap all the time .
I used to fall for it too .
This is absolutely the wrong strategy though .
I know that must sound counter - intuitive .
The correct strategy is that when you see your finances decline and you want to increase your income , then you need to focus on CREATING and DELIVERING more value .
If you do that , then you ’re doing the very thing that will generate a sustainable income increase .
What is money ?
Money is simply a medium for exchanging value .
Money is what you receive in exchange for the value you create and deliver .
If you can increase your outflow of value creation and delivery , you can increase your inflow of money received .
If , however , you try to increase the inflow of money without increasing the outflow of value , you ’re trying to get something for nothing .
This approach is untenable and will ultimately collapse .
Please do n’t waste your time on it .
I actually figured this out right around the time I was declaring bankruptcy .
I was totally broke , yet I found a way to focus my energy on creating and delivering value instead of on trying to scrape together more money .
Within about six months , I was back on my feet financially , and year after year my financial situation just kept getting better .
I started on this path about 9 years ago , and I ’ve maintained a nice positive cash flow every year since then .
I know that when you ’re in a financial crunch situation , six months may seem like a long time .
But it does n’t matter if it takes you several months or several years to get in the habit of creating and delivering value .
The time is going to pass anyway , and this habit will serve you well for life .
Be patient and get started .
It does n’t matter what happens to the economy — if you keep creating and delivering value , you ’ll do just fine .
A Record Year
Financially , 2008 was the best year ever for Erin and me .
I expect that 2009 will be an even better year for us , regardless of what happens to the economy .
How do I know ?
Because it ’s another year we can create and deliver value , adding to what we ’ve already created .
Why are we enjoying increases while others are experiencing decline ?
First , it helps that we do n’t have jobs .
I have n’t been employed by someone in more than 16 years .
Many people mistakenly assume that being jobless is the riskier route , but that ’s nonsense .
It ’s much less risky to control your own means of creating and delivering value than to be a pawn of some larger entity .
No matter how bad the economy gets , Erin and I ca n’t get fired or laid off .
So our career paths enjoy much more stability .
Secondly , while others are tightening up and cutting costs , Erin and I focus our attention on creating and delivering more value to people .
The way we go about this may seem a bit counter - intuitive at first glance .
For example , I wrote a lot about diet and health this year , such as by sharing my experiences with the raw food diet .
That may not appear to be a very sexy topic .
Some people find it totally uninteresting and would prefer that I write about other things .
My health articles never make it big on social bookmarking sites , so they do n’t generally yield a major traffic boost either .
However , such articles can provide a lot of value to people who are interested in those topics .
Many people have made significant lifestyle changes after reading those articles , improving their health and / or enjoying significant weight loss .
For some people the benefits have been amazing .
So even though these articles might not seem too exciting at first glance , they make a difference in people ’s lives .
Obviously they do n’t affect everyone equally , but that ’s okay .
They certainly do a lot of good .
They deliver value .
Many bloggers post content with the intention of getting something , such as links , attention , or sales .
I ’ve done some of that too , but I generally avoid creating that style of content .
Instead I remind myself to stay focused on creating and delivering value .
I know that when I keep my focus on that side , the rest takes care of itself .
This is an example of such an article .
I did n’t write this piece to get something from you .
I do n’t expect it will become a huge hit .
I know that because of the length , many people wo n’t even bother to read it .
But I also know that for many of the people who take the time to read it , this article has the potential to create some subtle yet helpful shifts .
It may give someone the extra insight needed to get moving in a new direction .
Someone , somewhere will receive positive value from it .
That ’s all I intend with this article .
Just provide some kind of benefit to someone who could use a little encouragement in the right direction .
It ’s not that complicated .
This sort of focus inspires me to share what I ’ve learned openly and honestly , even if it runs contrary to the way most people think .
I know this approach sounds overly simplistic , but if you get this — if you really get it — then it ’s really not that hard to generate plenty of income .
Turning Value Into Income
So how does one generate income from creating and delivering value ?
Ca n’t you run into a problem of creating and delivering lots of value and making no money from it ?
As it turns out , making money is the easy part .
If you can create and deliver value to people , the income opportunities will literally come to you .
People will practically line up with ways for you to make money .
I ’m serious .
Here ’s how this works .
If you get good at creating value , you can connect with other people who are good at delivering value .
They deliver your value , such as by selling it , and they pay you a royalty , commission , or licensing fee .
For example , Hay House offered me a book deal last year , so I wrote a book called Personal Development for Smart People , and it was published in September .
I received an advance for the book , and I ’ll also receive ongoing royalties based on sales .
I might even receive royalties from this book for the rest of my life , especially since the content is timeless .
Also , writing a book has lead to other opportunities , such as paid speaking engagements .
So in this case I created the value ( the book ) , but others deliver it .
Now suppose you get good at delivering value .
In this case you can generate income by plugging other people ’s value into your delivery system .
For example , my blog is great at delivering value .
It ’s a very efficient medium for that .
But since I give my value away for free , it does n’t generate income directly .
However , I can generate plenty of income by promoting other people ’s products that I like .
Then I split the profits from sales with the publisher .
I earn six figures a year just from doing that .
The product publishers come to me .
I get way more offers for this sort of thing than I can handle .
It does n’t require a lot of work to do this .
Once you have a system for delivering value , you can plug other people ’s value into it and generate lots of extra income .
If you have the means to create AND deliver strong value , you ’ll have so many opportunities it will be totally ridiculous .
First , you can plug the value you create into other people ’s delivery systems , so you can earn ongoing royalties and such .
This is easy residual income .
I ’m still getting checks every month for deals I entered years ago .
Secondly , you can plug other people ’s creative value into your own delivery system .
You pay them a royalty on the sales , or they pay you as an affiliate .
Once again you generate ongoing residual income .
As long as you ’re selective about the products you promote , doing your best to ensure that they provide strong value , everyone is happy , and everyone wins .
Thirdly , you can plug your value into your own delivery system .
Strangely , this is something I have n’t done yet with my blog , although I used to do it all the time with my computer games business .
This is something I intend to explore in 2009 .
It simply means that I could create and sell my own products direct .
Many other bloggers have already done this with great success , releasing e-books , audio programs , DVDs , etc .
They create the value and sell it directly to their visitors .
A big chunk of the income I received in 2008 was from work I did in previous years .
I could do no work for all of 2009 and just live off the residual income I know is coming .
That ’s a nice situation to be in .
It ’s no accident though .
Years ago I decided that this is how I wanted to set up my financial life , and then I focused on creating and delivering value to make it work .
There ’s no reason you ca n’t use the same strategy .
It is n’t trademarked . 🙂
Avoiding Distraction
Once you develop the habit of creating and delivering value , it ’s pretty hard to fail .
However , it ’s very easy to get distracted along the way .
Distraction is perhaps your biggest obstacle .
You ca n’t get sucked into every money - making scheme that crosses your plate .
Getting sucked into a job , where you have to trade hours for dollars , is just as bad .
These are dead ends you should avoid by any means .
You have to stay focused on creating and delivering value .
Everything that detracts from this focus should be viewed as an expense , obstacle , or just plain evil .
This is so important , but most people just do n’t get how important it is .
Getting a job is such a bad idea if you want to enjoy long - term financial abundance .
The odds of success on that path are so low , it ’s not even worth considering .
Seriously , you are better off being broke and homeless , so you can focus on creating and delivering value from that place .
You ’re much worse off if you have to waste day after day showing up to work for someone else .
That wo n’t move you closer to financial abundance .
It will only distract you further .
If I had to choose between being homeless and getting a full - time job , I ’d go the homeless route .
Having a job would be 10 x worse .
As a homeless person , I could stay hungry and focused on creating and delivering value .
I might not have the means to produce much value at first , but at least I could get out there in front of people and deliver something .
It would be a good start on the right path .
A job is just a monstrous distraction .
In many ways it ’s a modernized form of slavery .
Homelessness is a huge upgrade from traditional employment .
Have you ever talked to a homeless person ?
Some of them find the idea of having a job insulting — it represents a loss of freedom .
Sure you smell better and can get a nicer place to live , but you lose your humanity in the process .
Perhaps such people realize something you do n’t .
Employment is the ultimate form of destitution .
Fortunately , employment is an easy problem to fix .
If you have a job , just stop showing up .
The rest will take care of itself .
Pretty soon you ’ll feel some motivation and drive to start creating and delivering value , especially if you happen to like eating .
Genuine opportunities are based on creating and / or delivering value .
If you see something that looks like a new opportunity , and it does n’t require you to create value , and it does n’t require you to deliver value , then it is n’t an opportunity .
It ’s a total waste of your time .
Is creating and delivering value harder than getting a job ?
I would say no , not at all .
Having a job is a lot harder .
With a job you still have to provide some form of value usually , but all the residual benefits you produce turn into residual income for someone else .
So you ’re already doing most of what needs to be done , but you are n’t enjoying any of the benefits .
In the long run , you ’ll probably have to work much harder if you have a job , but the bulk of the rewards will go to someone else .
On the one hand , that ’s generous , but on the other hand , it ’s quite dumb .
I could get a job as a writer and get paid a certain amount for each word I write .
But then someone else owns my work , and all the residuals from that work go to them .
Alternatively , I could write articles for my own website and retain the freedom to republish them as books someday , use them to generate traffic ( and thereby income ) , license them for various publications , use them to promote my book , etc .
The correct strategy is a no - brainer really .
Trying to make money is itself a distraction .
When you focus on making money , too many things will catch your eye .
You ’ll run around like a chicken with its head cut off , chasing down all sorts of things that look like opportunities .
You ’ll waste a lot of time and energy if you chase dollars .
Creating and delivering value is simpler .
This focus is well - aligned with truth , love , and power .
When you create and deliver value , you can be open and honest about what you ’re doing .
You get to spend most of your time doing stuff you ’d naturally enjoy .
It ’s pleasurable to hone a craft you ’re passionate about , whether it be writing articles , composing music , or planting gardens .
It ’s much harder to do boring , non-creative work day after day .
It ’s also very empowering to share your value with others and to see that you ’re making a positive difference in people ’s lives .
Once you make a habit of creating and delivering value as your primary career focus , you wo n’t want to go back .
There ’s More to Life Than Money
Of all the things I do as part of my “ work , ” making money plays only a small role .
Despite having written some popular articles on the subject , I spend little time thinking about money these days .
I do n’t even bother to set financial goals anymore .
That seems totally pointless to me .
Sometimes months go by , and I do n’t even know how much money I ’m currently making .
I just know there ’s always plenty and that I ’m earning more than I ’m spending .
The gap is wide enough that I do n’t need to do any special budgeting or fussing with figures .
The reason this works for me is that I focus on creating and delivering value .
I know that as long as I keep doing that , I do n’t have to do anything special to try to make money .
New opportunities just keep showing up .
It ’s not that difficult to maintain .
I remember when I was at a conference in 2004 where Dr. Wayne Dyer was speaking .
He said that people would come up and say , “ You know , Dr. Dyer .
Some people say you ’ve made a LOT of money . ”
Dr. Dyer ’s response was , “ They would be right . ” 🙂
He went on to say something along these lines : “ It ’s not my fault !
I just keep doing what I ’m doing , and there ’s always plenty of abundance there . ”
At the time it was hard for me to relate to this mindset .
It seems a bit too unrealistic and exceptional .
But still …
I wondered what it would be like to live at that level , where you could just assume abundance and it would be there for you .
No striving or struggling .
It took a few years , but I ’m finally grasping what that sort of mindset feels like .
I ’d say it ’s not really a complete mindset by itself though .
I doubt very much that Dr. Dyer focuses a lot of attention on trying to make money .
I think most of his attention is elsewhere , wrapped up in the material he writes about .
And that ’s exactly where it should be .
Having written about two dozen books , it ’s safe to say that Dr. Dyer has internalized the concept of creating and delivering value .
I have it on good authority that his books sell quite well too .
( We share the same publisher . )
Incidentally , Erin and I finally had the chance to meet Dr. Dyer in October at the speakers ’ dinner for the I Can Do It !
Conference .
We only spoke with him for a few minutes .
He was very warm and friendly .
This whole abundance mindset might sound really annoying if you ’re dealing with financial scarcity right now .
I can totally relate .
I ’ve been there , and I ’m sure I ’d have been equally annoyed if someone said this sort of stuff to me back then .
I ’d have been vehement that making money was NOT easy because I tried very hard to do that and failed big at it .
Ironically the real problem was that by focusing on making money , I was making a huge mistake .
The key is where you focus your attention .
If you focus your attention on making money , I can virtually guarantee that you ’ll have a long and difficult road ahead of you , filled with setbacks and disappointments .
If money is really what you seek , good luck with that .
All you ’ll do is give more and more of your power away , and you ’ll end up living a pretty empty and shallow life .
Another corrupt form of thinking is to focus your attention on attracting financial abundance .
Law of Attraction promoters often present this as a good idea .
I once thought it was a good idea too .
Now I realize it ’s a dead end .
It will just run you in circles .
The irony is that in order to enjoy real financial abundance , you want to be thinking about money as little as possible .
I know it sounds like focusing on money is the right idea .
I assure you that it ’s a mistake .
If you need to take several years to figure that out the hard way like I did , be my guest .
But you ’ll be really pissed that you could have saved yourself all that trouble if you simply let these ideas sink in a bit deeper .
I hope that on some level what I ’m saying strikes you as common sense .
But I know I ’ll be getting emails five years from now from a few people who went the other route .
I hope you are n’t one of them .
Try to recognize the truth that focusing on CREATING and DELIVERING value is the smarter , more sane approach to long - term financial abundance .
You may start out a bit slow at first , but eventually you ’ll learn how to get good at both pieces of this puzzle .
Once you have both aspects working reasonably well , it ’s awesome .
Just plain wonderful .
And it leads to a really fun and exciting life too .
Lots of freedom .
Lots of joy .
Plenty of cash .
And yet the cash does n’t even matter .
The nice thing about having plenty of money is that you can largely ignore it .
You can focus your attention on doing more important , more interesting , and more enjoyable things .
The funny thing is that it ’s this sort of focus that creates financial abundance in the first place .
Then you come full circle and realize that you never needed money at all .
You just needed the courage to go after your dreams full steam ahead , even when you were dead broke .
You needed to stop hiding behind a lack of money as an excuse not to live your best life .
If I could learn and apply this lesson while going bankrupt and having less than $ 100 in the bank , surely you can apply it today .
I learned that I could create and deliver value even when I had no money and few resources .
It was n’t the greatest value in the world mind you , but at least it was something .
I focused on creating something people would like and enjoy .
Then I got it into their hands and made sure they enjoyed it .
Back then it was a simple computer game .
Today I do pretty much the same thing with blogging .
The content is different , but the overall strategy is the same .
The DELIVERING part need n’t be complicated .
If you just create something and share it online , other people will spread it around if they like it .
If you ’ve been putting your value out there for months and months , and you have n’t been able to generate much interest from others , that should tell you that your mistakes are on the creative side .
The feedback is that people do n’t care for what you ’re producing .
You think you ’re creating value , but the world is saying , “ Not good enough ; we do n’t need or want this . ”
So you need to adapt to that feedback and use it to improve .
Let it encourage you to go deeper within yourself , so you can be more genuine and authentic .
Become more real and less phony .
Keep working at becoming a more expressive creator until people start to take notice .
Then you ’re golden .
What About the Economy ?
Personally I think that economic recessions , including the current one , are a good thing .
Recessions help to weed out the crappy companies that are n’t creating and delivering value people want .
Many of those companies were doing a good job at one time , but they failed to keep pace .
As our values change , our companies need to adapt .
Companies that ca n’t do that deserve to die off , and the jobs they created should be eliminated .
They ’ll eventually be replaced by new companies that have a better sense of people ’s current needs and desires .
Companies that just do n’t “ get it ” will be replaced by companies that do .
Consider the notion of bailing out the failing U.S. auto companies by having the taxpayers fund them .
Is this a good idea ?
It ’s okay except for one small problem — it ’s STUPID !
It ’s one of the dumbest things our political reps could possibly do with our tax dollars .
An auto company bailout is definitely not in the best interests of our country , nor is it in the best interests of the auto workers themselves .
It ’s totally short - sighted .
And FWIW I think the whole financial bailout was just as dumb .
I have family members who used to work for GM for years ( not in the automobile division of the company though ) .
If they were still working for GM today , I ’d sooner see them lose their jobs and have to find new work elsewhere than encourage them to live under the illusion that their company should continue doing business as usual .
As I mentioned previously , Erin and I bought a Japanese car in 2006 even though we could have gotten a great price break on a GM model with the family discount .
We just did n’t like any GM cars .
During a recession some companies are going to die off .
That ’s a good thing .
To artificially prop up the proven market losers is just dumb .
Sure , it will have some rippling consequences .
But those ripples are necessary .
We need that sort of self - correction to prevent bigger problems down the road .
We need to send a message that if you fail to create and deliver value people genuinely want , your business will ultimately fail , and no amount of political lobbying will save you .
Of course we get the opposite result when too many people think that the point of life is to chase dollars , especially our politicians .
Can you blame them though ?
Have you ever been known to fall into the same trap ?
It ’s better — and much more compassionate — for millions of auto workers to lose their jobs and be re-integrated back into society , where they can start doing socially useful work again instead of wasting their time doing work that simply is n’t needed anymore .
If it takes years , it takes years .
There are other companies that are doing a better job of providing what people want and adapting to the planet ’s changing transportation needs .
Giving more money to the losers is a stupid strategy .
Similarly , if you work for a company that is falling out of sync with creating and delivering value that people want , you should indeed lose your job .
It ’s better to retrain yourself to do more meaningful work elsewhere than to waste your time doing work that is n’t needed .
Becoming obsolete is a trap that can be avoided .
Even if you ’re an employee , you still need to make sure you ’re contributing to the creation and delivery of real value .
If you fall away from that , it ’s only a matter of time before you get the axe , so do n’t be too surprised when it happens .
A Value - Centered Career
How do you know if you ’re creating and delivering real value ?
Ask yourself these questions :
If you stopped doing what you do , who would care ?
Who would object loudly ?
Who would revolt ?
If you ’re creating and delivering genuine value , and you suddenly stop , people will notice .
People will definitely care .
Your contribution will be seriously missed .
There will practically be rioting in the streets .
Such people may not even credit the value to you directly , especially if your contribution remains somewhat anonymous , but they ’ll soon detect that something important is missing from their lives .
Even if they do n’t know your name , the removal of your ongoing value creation and delivery will have a definite effect .
If , however , hardly anyone cares that you stopped , that should tell you something .
It means that people just did n’t value your creative output … not really .
What you were doing was either unnecessary or easily replaced .
You were n’t yet living as a conscious , self - actualized human being .
You held back from shining as brightly as you could have .
You have a choice of whether or not you want this to be your fate .
You may have been conditioned from a young age to view your life path in terms of getting a job and making money .
Go ahead and live that way for a few years if you think it ’s intelligent .
You ’ll soon see what a pointless , soulless dead - end it really is .
When you finally begin to hear that subtle inner voice screaming at you , “ This is just so wrong , ” realize that it ’s still possible to live a life of fun , freedom , and fulfillment — and still make plenty of money and not starve .
But in order to get there , you have to focus on doing what really matters .
You must clear your head of all that socially conditioned nonsense and stop doing what everyone else is doing .
Start living as a conscious human being , not a mindless minion .
Focus on expressing your child - like creativity on a daily basis .
Stop thinking so much about making money , and focus on connecting with people and sharing your creations with them instead .
Create and deliver .
Create and deliver .
The correct focus for financial abundance is so simple it ’s ridiculous .
You learned it in kindergarten .
You : “ Hey , look at this picture I made ! ” ( Value created )
Adult : “ Wow .
That ’s awesome !
You made my day ! ” 🙂 ( Value received )
My five - year - old son and eight - year - old daughter pretty much have it figured out .
If they just keep doing what they naturally like to do , they ’ll be able to enjoy financial abundance as adults too .
My job as a parent is n’t so much to teach them something new in this area — it ’s to prevent them from being brainwashed into thinking like everyone else .
It took me about 5 hours to write and edit this 6,000 - word article .
I was n’t even planning to write an article today .
But I got inspired by an idea , so I sat down and wrote the whole thing in a single sitting .
My investment of time and energy on the creative side was fixed .
But this article will keep delivering value to people for many years to come .
That ’s a good investment then , is n’t it ?
It does n’t matter whether or not this article generates income for me .
I do n’t think about it like that .
I just know that if I keep creating and delivering value , I ’ll continue to enjoy financial abundance , and I ’ll feel really good too .
Money is basically a non-entity .
It does n’t motivate action , nor does it serve as a reward .
It ’s just something that recedes into the background while real life is unfolding .
I ’d love for you to be able to enjoy similar benefits if this is something that appeals to you .
It all starts with the choice of where you focus your attention .
The more you pursue your own creative self - expression , the less you ’ll have to fuss over money .
The irony is that this is probably what you tell yourself you ’ll do when you finally have enough money , but that sort of thinking is a trap that will only keep you stuck .
The way you would live if / when you ’re enjoying financial abundance , start living that way now , for that ’s the very strategy that will produce the abundance you seek .
And when you begin to experience financial abundance , you ’ll realize that you never needed it to begin with .
You just needed the courage to start expressing the real you under the conditions you find yourself in this very moment .
This article has taken so many twists and turns , I think I ’ve left the original title far behind by now .
But somehow I think it still fits . 🙂

When it comes to spouting hatred and bile , Michelle Malkin just cannot stop herself .
In her recent diatribe on TownHall.com , Malkin has taken up the Right 's favorite fight about ' enhanced interrogation techniques ' ( or torture , as normal people put it ) , arguing its merits and belittling anyone who disagrees with her :
The human rights crowd is right : Life is hard for a Guantanamo Bay
detainee .
The deprivation is unspeakable .
According to the facility 's
" cultural adviser , " their brains have not been " stimulated " enough .
So

this Thanksgiving , America is drawing up plans to provide the 250 or so
suspected jihadists at the " notoriously Spartan " detention camp with
basic sustenance including , as reported by the Miami Herald , movie
nights , art classes , English language lessons and " Game Boy - like "
electronic devices .
Treating people held in illegal prisons like human beings is a step too far for Malkin , and she would like to see everyone get on board with her tough love program for suspected terrorists ( proof of guilt is not required ) .
Malkin does correctly point out that the Democrats and Obama are beginning to soften their rhetoric about closing Gitmo , claiming that :
Nothing clarifies the mind like a jihadi boomerang .
Never before have

an administration and its followers matured so quickly in office -- and
they have n't even taken office yet .
Anyone with a heartbeat should be horrified that Obama would be reconsidering his stance on closing Guantanamo , but Malkin is positively giddy that a Democratic White House would continue abusing prisoners without oversight or due process :
Now , at long last , some liberals have realized that the sacred goal of
" regaining America 's moral stature in the world , " as Obama put it , may
be less important than ensuring that al - Qaida killers do n't strike on
American ground again .
Reading Malkin is always a delight .
Her relentless drive to be as mean spirited , controversial and blunt as possible makes it almost fun to hate her .
One suspects Malkin has another , sweeter side to her acid personality , but as yet , there is more evidence of the existence of the Loch Ness Monster .
It would be nice if Malkin would change the tune and direct her considerable rage to a subject worth discussing intelligently , ( like the economic crisis ) but it 's unlikely her readers / viewers would want to hear it .
Hate , prejudice and belligerence seem to be working well for her , and as long as that is the case , she deserves as much ridicule as possible .
Amen to that .
So there I was , 30,000 feet without a parachute .
I was flying to North Manchester , Indiana to speak at Manchester College , where I gave my introductory talk on critical thinking called Here Be Dragons and had a smashing good time .
The fellow sitting next to me on the plane was a friendly family man , with his entire family in tow , including at least three kids ( it was a bit hard to keep count ) .
We got to talking , and he learned all about my podcast Skeptoid and the subject of my talk .
His name was Bill Morgan , and I found him to be personable , intelligent , well read and with a good general knowledge level .
By trade he is a mechanical engineer for the Navy .
And then he asked it : “ What are your thoughts on the creation of the Earth ? ”
Now I ’d already noticed that his wife was reading and marking a well - used Bible , occasionally sharing passages with him and the kids , so I knew right away to take my own advice and not have this conversation at all .
As much as you ’d like to hear me tell the tale of a great creation debate , I do n’t think it ’s ever appropriate to argue a man ’s religious beliefs in front of his children , so I told him straight out I do not have religious beliefs but would not discuss it further .
He got out a crowbar and tried harder , but that did n’t work either .
Then he used an air drill and charges , but I kept my secrets buried deep .
Finally he gave up , and drifted instead into telling me more of his own background .
“ Have you ever heard of a Randi … Bob Randi , Jim Randi , something like that ? ”
“ Oh sure , ” I told him , “ James Randi , I know him well .
He wrote the foreword to one of my books . ”
And we talked a little bit about the Million Dollar Challenge and one or two other things .
“ How about Shermer , ” he asked .
“ Bill Shermer , Steve Shermer , one of those .
You might not have heard of him . ”
“ Michael Shermer , ” I corrected .
“ I know him well too .
He wrote the foreword to another of my books . ”
By now his wife was paying close attention , and I very much had the feeling of a gazelle being circled by lions asking probing questions .
“ I once moderated a debate between Michael Shermer and Kent Hovind , ” he said , “ at UC Irvine in 2004 . ”
Really !
Well , what are the chances , me of all people being seated next to him of all people .
He gave me his 17 - page tract , one page of which I ’ve reproduced here for you , full of the most staggering scientific ignorance one can imagine .
It was the worst of the tired old arguments so poorly framed that even most Young Earthers do n’t try to make them any more : Piltdown Man , the Peppered Moths , “ no transitional fossils ” , the second law of thermodynamics , science requires starting assumptions based on faith .
Nothing we have n’t heard before .
I marvel that he gave me this document .
Obviously , in Bill ’s experience , he knows the scientific answers to all the claims in his document .
He ’s heard them a hundred times and he ’s smart enough to understand them .
He simply believes differently .
There would be no point in having a conversation with me ; he would hear the same answers from me that he ’s heard a hundred times before .
I ’ve heard his claims a hundred times .
Does he suppose that if I ’m told one more time that seashells on top of Mt. Everest are proof of Noah ’s flood , that I ’ll suddenly abandon all reason and seek only superstitious explanations for our world ?
Bill and I had a pleasant conversation about all sorts of skeptical topics ( religion aside ) .
Apart from the obvious , his skeptical credentials are impeccable .
Bill is the opposite of a raving lunatic , or a paranoid delusional conspiracy theorist .
He ’s the perfect example of how a smart person can believe weird things .
But his beliefs are not entirely harmless .
Thumbing through his document , I think of all the career opportunities closed to people with his beliefs .
I think of all the contributions that cannot be .
When you deny cosmology , by extension you must deny relativity and mathematics .
When you deny biology , you have to deny organic chemistry , and thus mathematics again .
You ca n’t contribute to nuclear physics if you deny radiometric dating .
It ’s hard to make contributions to economics if you deny its foundational premises like game theory and number theory that also describe processes in natural selection .
You ca n’t contribute to geology or chemistry if you think fossilization happens in less than 6,000 years .
You ca n’t contribute to the emerging power of genetic algorithms in computing if you refuse to accept its guiding principle of biological evolution .
Sciences may be distinct , but they are all interlinked and cross dependent at some level .
How is it possible to agree that some people occasionally do win the lottery even though the chances of any given win are practically zero , but disagree that the occasional rare mutation will be beneficial ?
You have to be able to say that sometimes 2 + 2 = 4 , except for those times when I think it should be 5 .
Bill ’s web site is FishDontWalk.com .
Feel free to check it out .
A pretty staggering poll reveals that even Alaskans believe , by 43 to 37 percent , that Joe Biden has the better background and experience to be vice - president , and by 44 to 32 percent , that Biden is better prepared to handle an unexpected international crisis .
They prefer Palin on energy and Wall Street reform .
But not by much .
If this is how Alaskans feel , what about the rest of the country ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Dear Ms. Gerberding ,
Last year I was contacted by a woman named Jennifer Lee of Hartford University .
She was doing â€œresearchâ€ for national Domestic Violence research paper which was to be published .
The criterion of the survey was that the group I am President of , The New York Civil Rights Council had to be representing only women .
The notice came with a warning not to spread this questionnaire to â€œmenâ€ ™sâ€ groups or groups that also represented men .
I was among four groups that got this survey .
The other three groups were : The National Organization for Women ; The Battered Mothers Custody Conference and ; Stop The Violence â€ “ another â€œbattered womenâ€™s groupâ€ .
The intro to this questionnaire was that Ms. Lee knew that courts often award custody of children over to men who are domestically terrorizing women and children .
Several of the questioned poised were :
Were you a victim of domestic violence ?
Have you ever lost custody of your children to your ex ?
Where you treated fairly in Family Court ?
Did you seek help ?
Where you able to get help ?
Do you feel that you were treated badly because you are female ?
I contacted Ms. Lee about the study .
She immediately turned me over to her â€œsupervising Professorâ€ .
This woman came at me with vengeance .
She was what you all call â€œabusiveâ€ .
She called me names , she attacked my credentials , and she attacked my group and me personally .
I forwarded her email to several of the Deans .
The response I got was a favorable one , they all apologized for Ms. Kathy McCloskey , Ph.D. , Psy.D. , ABPPâ€™s actions but that didnâ€™t stop the research .
Several other â€ œProfessorsâ€ from reputable Universities have done the same kind of research and published their works .
One of the most damaging â€ “ to a blind public â€ “ is called the â€œTruth Commissionâ€  - Dr. Mo Theresa Hannah .
Ms Hannah asked 25 women from across the United States that were all attending the â€œBattered Mothers Custody Conferenceâ€ in Loudonville , New York the same questions Ms. Lee was asking other victim based groups .
To no surprise the â€œreportâ€ that came from this group was grossly inaccurate and a complete misrepresentation of reality .
One may ask , why ?
One theory here is that over the last generation that a few but determined women were willing to put the nation on the whole in danger to reach their full potential â€ “ control and revenge .
Public outcries were working but not fast enough .
They had to enter the souls of the next generation , they had to enter our schools , and they did .
â€ œWomenâ€ studies appeared overnight and everywhere .
Statistics like â€ œOne in Four females will be sexually molested by the time their 21â€  or â€ œSuper bowl Sunday incidences of domestic violence raise by a factor of fourâ€ started to appear .
They were repeated so much they did become the truth .
But when true and factual reports came out to counter balance the manipulated reports they had to come up with another way of getting their message of hatred and prejudices across .
They infiltrated the Governments .
They had to manipulate the questions to fulfill their data .
Henceforth â€ “ Propaganda was again born .
Why some may say ; â€ œWhat difference does it make ?
If it helps one abused woman ?â€ 
The difference is that there millions of abuse victims every year being turned down for that help .
There is a national movement to vilify 50 % of the victims based upon nothing less then the gender they were born .
Where else have we seen this ?
In the 1960â€™s with Segregation and anyone that supported the â€œNegroâ€ .
In the 1940â€™s with the attempt to eliminate the Jewish population and anyone that supported the Jews .
Ms. Gerberding , I also have a dream .
I too want to see man and women walking hand in hand .
I too want to see the day where a person is respected based upon the content of their character and not the color of their skin or the gender they were born ( or now a days â€ “ the gender they may become ) I too would like to know my grandson is as safe as my granddaughter but today I worry about him .
I worry that because of the chromosomes his mother and father gave to him he is being hunted down like some kind of crazed animal .
I go to my Stateâ€™s capitol and I am continually bombarded by bill boards that show a representation of my grandson and the headline reads : â€ œTeach your son to respect womenâ€ 
I drive a little further and see another .
This one reads : â€ œViolence against Women is never OKâ€ .
I turn on my radio and the messages are the same and on every channel .
But where are the signs and commercials that say : â€ œRespect each otherâ€ or â€ œViolence against humanity is never OKâ€ ?
If you read deeper into this campaign they justify it on a 1999 New York State report that states 85 % of all domestic violence victims are women .
If you look closer they received that data from interviewing federally / state funded domestic violence shelters that only helped women .
If you read the 2005 report the data is severely different .
Domestic violence fell by 37 % and 48 % of all domestic violence victims are male .
If you dig deeper into this Federally and Stated funded program , it states that when a male witnesses domestic violence against a female that they are encouraged to use necessary force to put an end to the violence .
Violence begets Violence â€ “ but only if itâ€™s males against males .
When I was a child I witnessed boy after boy being molested by trusted people in authority .
I can clearly remember when one teenage boy told his mother and father that he was molested by his clergyman he was slapped across the face and punished .
I remember when these â€œboysâ€ became men and they began to gather as groups and tried to get help , they were ignored and punished by our government and the public .
It was not until they found a few female victims did the stories start to be published .
But only the stories of the little girls .
Last year , in Albany New York , a Judge hearing a molestation case actually called the perpetrator the â€œvictimâ€  stating that â€œsheâ€ was seduced by the 13 and 14 year old boys she had repeated sexual contact with .
I have witnessed man after man be hit , forced to turn over their paychecks , work second and third jobs so their wives can have Botox injections and carry designer bags to lunch , be humiliated , told what to wear and what to think .
But we donâ€™t think twice about this as abuse .
I have seen parents buy their little girls shirts that say : â€ œGirls Rule ; Boys suckâ€  or â€ œBoys are Stupid ; Throw rocks at themâ€ .
I stopped watching prime time television because that is all you see .
A few weeks ago I was channel surfing and caught a glimpse of Kelsey Grammar so I paused .
The woman from â€ œEveryone Loves Raymondâ€ was co-starring .
She backed , what appeared to be a ten or twelve year old boy into the corner and then physically and verbally attacked him .
The canned laughter exploded .
I was so appalled I cried .
I would like to ask â€ œPleaseâ€ stop the line of questioning you are putting forth but the time for â€œpleasesâ€ have long passed .
This MUST stop .
The line of questioning you are using is being used specifically to manipulate reality .
And reality is that we are seeing a society bless the violence against men is now blessing the violence and castration of little boys .
When we teach males that being hit , humiliated or financially controlled is not abuse and then ask them if they are victims of abuse , what do you expect to get ?
If we tell females that if they volunteered to get drunk and have sex yet years later she regrets it , she was the victim of abuse and asks her if she is the victim of abuse , what do you expect to get ?
Our Government must stay neutral to all citizens or it is no longer and effective Democratic government .
My grandfather fought in World War II , by brothers in Vietnam , my classmates in Desert Storm and now my own children in Iraq .
What for ?
Freedom and the right to be free of preconceived prejudices .
This county must raise higher then those we have fought and set the example for them .
If itâ€™s OK in our nation to base hatred upon color or gender or religious beliefs , then why isnâ€™t it OK for them ?
This propaganda against males of all color and age and religious beliefs must stop .
Please do you part , Iâ€™m doing mine .

So the question would be if Michael Jackson could build a time machine would he repair all the damage he has done to his career and children or would he bugger himself silly ?

Lab Safety
Researcher Dies After Lab Fire
UCLA research assistant burned in incident with tert - butyl lithium
A research assistant in the University of California , Los Angeles , department of chemistry and biochemistry died on Jan. 16 from injuries sustained in a laboratory fire that occurred in December , the university has confirmed .

UCLA officials declined to provide C&EN with specific details of the incident , pending an investigation .
But according to a Dec. 30 , 2008 , e-mail to C&EN from department chair Albert J. Courey , university investigators believe that on Dec. 29 , Sheharbano Sangji , 23 , was drawing tert - butyl lithium ( t - BuLi ) from a bottle into a syringe when the plunger came out of the syringe barrel .
The chemical , which ignites spontaneously in air , splashed onto Sangji 's clothes and set them on fire .
Sangji was burned on her hands , arms , and upper torso , for a total of 40 % of her body .
After initial treatment at Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center , she was transferred to the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks , Calif. , where she died .
An unconfirmed description of the accident was posted on Jan. 7 to the ACS Division of Chemical Health & Safety e-mail list by Debbie M. Decker , a member of the division and a UC Davis chemical safety officer .
It says that Sangji was wearing safety glasses , a sweater made of synthetic material , nitrile gloves , and no lab coat and that the t- BuLi ignited her sweater and gloves .
Synthetic materials such as polyester are " analogous to solid gasoline , " says Neal Langerman , the founder of the company Advanced Chemical Safety and a consultant to the ACS Committee on Chemical Safety .
" Once it ignites , it burns just like a hydrocarbon , so it really is inappropriate lab apparel by itself . "
A lab coat might have prevented the sweater from igniting and reduced the extent of Sangji 's injuries , he says , although he emphasizes that he is speculating .
Fire - resistant gloves are also available , Langerman says , although they are bulky and reduce dexterity , which can also lead to accidents .
" That problem has n't been adequately solved , " he adds .
Sangji graduated from Pomona College in May 2008 .
She was working at UCLA while applying to law school , says her former adviser at Pomona , chemistry professor Daniel J. O'Leary , who is now at Bowdoin College .
Sangji spent three years working on peptide chemistry in O'Leary 's lab .
" She was just a wonderful person , " O'Leary says .
" Many , many people are mourning her loss . "
When asked whether he is reconsidering safety procedures in his lab at Bowdoin , O'Leary says , " Just about every organic chemist works with hazardous and dangerous things .
This can only serve as a wake - up call to redouble efforts to be safe . "
The incident remains under investigation by the California Division of Occupational Safety & Health and the Office of the State Fire Marshal , says James Gibson , director of UCLA 's Office of Environment , Health & Safety .
HEBRON , West Bank ( CNN ) --
Jewish settlers are on a " terror " rampage in the West Bank city of Hebron , angry over the Israeli military 's seizure of a disputed home , the city 's mayor said Thursday .
Israeli police struggle to remove Jewish settlers from a disputed house in Hebron on Thursday .
" What 's happening in Hebron is terror by the settlers , " the mayor , Khaled Osaily , told CNN .
" They are attacking houses , setting fire to property and injuring people . "
Some of the settlers opened fire on Palestinians , critically injuring one , Palestinian sources told CNN .
Five other Palestinians have been wounded in the rioting , the sources said .
The latest round of violence comes hours after Israeli police and military forcibly removed a group of settlers from a disputed home in Hebron .
The settlers inside the residence had ignored court orders to vacate the house , which a Palestinian man claims belongs to him .
The situation has led to recent clashes between Jewish settlers and Palestinian residents .
Osaily called on the international community to pressure Israel to remove all settlers from Hebron , one of the most contested cities in the West Bank , with a Palestinian section and a Jewish settler enclave .
It is home to about 160,000 Palestinians and 500 Israelis .
" We warned the Israelis about this , " the mayor said .
" They did n't do enough to stop the settlers from their aggression . "
Shortly after seizing control of the disputed home , the Israeli military declared the southern part of the West Bank , including the entire city of Hebron , a closed military zone .
Israeli media reported that the settlers are vandalizing Palestinian residences in the Hebron area , including setting fire to some homes .
Israeli daily Haaretz reported that police used stun grenades and tear gas to subdue the rioting settlers .
Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told CNN the rioting was not widespread .
" There have been sporadic incidents , " he said .
" We have stepped up police patrols in the West Bank to increase security . "
A line of Israeli forces stood outside the disputed home on Thursday , as specially trained Israeli police pulled the settlers out of the home , according to Israeli military spokesman Maj .
Avital Leibovitch .
A banner castigating Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and the president of Israel 's Supreme Court , Dorit Beinisch , hung above the home 's entrance .
Some of the settlers walked out unassisted , while others were physically escorted by the security forces .
One settler , who was on the ground in tears , was carried away .
The entire operation took just over an hour , Leibovitch said .
" The events today in Hebron demonstrate clearly that in Israel the rule of law will prevail and not the vigilante extremist , " said Mark Regev , a spokesman for outgoing Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert .
Do n't Miss Hebron on edge after recent clashes
Ambulance services reported 20 people -- settlers and Israeli security forces -- were injured in the struggle , none seriously .
The Israeli military dispatched two helicopters in case of a medical emergency , Leibovitch said .
Earlier this week , the Israeli army established a closed military zone around the disputed house .
Israeli security forces moved in to remove the settlers a short time after Barak and the Settler Council failed to agree to resolve the situation peacefully .
Barak told the council leaders that " all citizens must accept the authority of the state . "
The settler leaders agreed but called on Barak not to forcibly remove the settlers from the house , council spokesman Yishai Hollander told CNN .
The council leaders offered to Barak several non-violent solutions to end the confrontation .
Hollander noted that there is a small group of settler extremists who do not abide by Israeli law nor the council 's demands .
Barak vowed that Israel " will not allow extremist elements to undermine the authority of the state and its foundation . "
" The people who are residing in the disputed house must vacate the house and follow the instructions by the state organizations and the courts , " Barak told the council , according to his spokesman .
" Only after the house is vacated will it be possible to clarify the disagreements . "
Israeli settlers moved into the so - called " house of contention " last year , claiming they bought it from the Palestinian man .
That man , however , says no deal was ever made .
A court ruled two weeks ago that the settlers living in the house must evacuate .
It said they would be evicted within 30 days if they did not leave voluntarily , but the settlers ignored the court 's orders .
Violence flared Monday over rumors that the contested house would be evacuated .
Eleven people were wounded .
Settlers and Palestinians threw stones at each other and settlers rioted elsewhere in the West Bank .
Hebron also is the location of the Cave of the Patriarch , a religious site holy to Jews , Christians and Muslims , and has been the site of high - profile violence between Palestinians and Israelis .
All About Hebron • West Bank
It all started so innocently : I recently purchased an iPod Nano as a Christmas present , and also wanted to include the gift of music .
A casual search on eBay led to attention - alarming auctions shouting at me , tantalizing me with the possibility of getting iTunes gift cards for CHEAP !
How cheap ?
Apparently , if I shelled out US $ 5 - 8 , I could get a " guide " with info telling me where to purchase these cards for up to " 80 % Off !! " , one listing yelled .
Yet another auction cautioned me while hawking its own ware , " How to NOT get scammed w itunes gift card code auctions . "
What was going on here ?
( See also : How to Use Up Remaining Balances on Prepaid Gift Cards )
I had to admit , the in - your - face attitude and numerous typographical errors turned me off — and I 'm too thrifty to plunk down a few bucks to be told what URL to type in .
( Nevermind the fact that some of these discount cards are listed on eBay … duh , how obvious . )
So I did the most natural next thing : a Google search , and soon dove deeper into the dubiousness .
Several minutes later , I collected numerous pages pointing to iOffer , sort of like eBay , but a rockier road in terms of usability .
Searching for " itunes 200 " yielded numerous matches for $ 200 gift cards as low as $ 38 .
Alas , that seller was on vacation , so I had to settle for a $ 47 one .
I placed an offer and watched the screen anxiously , refreshing the page and also checking my email .
I noticed this seller was quite an inconsistent replier , attending to the newest offers bidding on his quantity of 50 + cards while not getting to first - come offers until much later .
At last , I was served up an invoice , and PayPal 'ed it through .
A few minutes later , I received an email with the code .
Terse , cryptic , and from a Chinese email address , it read :
Hi , here is the code .
$ 200
[ CODE REMOVED ]
pls use it asap .
and pls leave me a feedback .
thanks !
Too good to be true ?
I pondered .
Why the urgency to use it ?
Only one way to find out .
After I refreshed the page again and noticed the hotbed of activity piling up , I mused " They must really want their music ! " and booted up the iTunes Store myself .
I plunked in the code , and without hesitation , it was credited .
My account balance now stood at $ 200.00 , and as any music fan would naturally do , I began snapping up tracks .
But is there a darker side to this ?
Some would say yes .
Feeling ethically conflicted , my curiosity got the better of me and I dug deeper .
More info -nuggets were just a google away , such as :
For a brief moment , my pupils dilated as wide as Dramatic Lemur's .
Was I now linked to criminal activity ?
I do n't want to be a knowing participant in the cycle of identity theft and fraud .
Alas , it 's hard to say .
I contacted over a dozen of these gift card bulk sellers .
A few replied with unhelpful or cryptic answers .
I chalked part of it up to their non-native English ( a disproportionate amount claim to be Chinese or Eastern European ) , and the other part up to wanting to keep a tight lid on their profitable secrets .
The most " comprehensive " response I got , after asking " How did you get such a great deal on these iTunes gift cards ? " was :
Hi , I bought it from my friend .
hehe
its price is realy low .
if you like , you can buy from me and then selll it on ebay .
I saw they sell about $ 100 for $ 200 card on ebay
hehe
thanks !
No shortage of " hehe " in the responses I received , that 's for sure .
Like the myths behind virtual gold farming , they add color to the tales , but that 's where my trail went cold .
Wherever there 's riches , you can count on not just greed to be present , but bizarre human behavior .
Returning to eBay , I scoured around some more .
I rummaged through the gift card auctions , and was hard - pressed to find any as popular or as below - expected - price as iTunes .
I even found some big names that went substantially above their value , like this $ 530 winning bid on a $ 500 Amazon.com gift card .
( What 's the point ? )
But iTunes ones can be consistently , suspiciously found for much lower .
Since the majority of these sales are digital codes , not actual cards ( as one seller made sure to remind me he could n't send the card ) , a physical object is n't necessary to use them .
Which makes them harder to trace .
What 's Apple 's gospel word on this ?
None .
Apple 's Gift Card FAQ says nothing about the matter yet , but it 's been happening for years .
This has been bubbling beneath the surface and has n't gotten broader attention .
There 's been articles about iTunes phishing , but that 's not the same as the underground gift card / code phenomenon .
This is especially ambiguous because we can't rule out that there is a legit channel for these cards , or that they 're so affordable for another , non-criminal reason which is n't understood by all parties involved .
True , the factors I mentioned above make them look very shady .
And even if you do n't have a tight budget which strangles luxuries like music , the goal is always to buy low … so how low is too low ?
Branding someone as a crook just because they do n't speak fluent English is unfair , considering that they may 've genuinely gotten the codes from an associate and are genuinely unaware if it 's unlawful .
I 'll understand if Apple gets in touch with me about my account , as they apparently have with some others , and in the meantime , I 'll continue to use my store credit — and ethically , look for better ways to reward the artists directly .
( Which is a discussion for another time . )
The moral of the story : from " it fell off the back of a truck " to gift codes in cyberspace , there can be more than meets the eye when it comes to an unbelievable deal .

In 2006 , …
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Scientists at Harvard University and IBM are hoping to harness the power of a million idle computers to develop a new , cheaper form of solar power that could revolutionize the green energy world .
A technician looks at an array of computers in a file photo .
REUTERS / File
Researchers have launched the project using IBM ’s World Community Grid , which taps into volunteers ’ computers across the globe to run calculations on a myriad of compounds -- potentially shortening a project that could take 22 years to just two years .
Harvard scientists are hoping the project will allow it to discover a combination of organic materials that can be used to manufacture plastic solar cells that are cheaper and more flexible than the silicon - based ones typically used to turn sunlight into electricity .
The technology could be used to coat windows , make backpacks or line blankets to produce electricity from the sun ’s rays .
Technology to make the plastic cells already exists , but they are not yet efficient enough to be rolled out in commercial products .
“ It is not now cost efficient , although the materials are cheap because it ’s plastic , ” said Alan Aspuru - Guzik , a chemistry researcher at Harvard University .
The most efficient silicon - based photovoltaic solar cells convert about 20 percent of the sunlight that strikes them into electricity .
For now , the organic cells can turn only about 5 percent of the sunlight into power -- half the level needed to make the low - cost cells a viable energy source .
The researchers plan to publish results of the work once they have discovered a possible combination of compounds .
TAPPING THE MATRIX
IBM developed its World Community Grid to advance research of humanitarian projects , such as fighting cancer , dengue fever and AIDS .
The grid connects computers in homes or offices via the Internet with program on each machine to run calculations that feed back to the database .
“ It ’s a way for people that have computers to do some good for the world , ” said IBM engineer Joe Jasinski .
With more than a million volunteers currently linked to the World Community Grid , IBM said it had created a network with a massive calculating capability that would rank it among the top 10 most powerful supercomputers in the world .
Members of the grid download software to their personal computers that run the calculations as a screensaver program on the machine when it is turned on but not in use .
IBM includes security software to protect the participants ’ computers .
Such virtual networks are also in place to crunch data for other projects , such as SETI ’s effort to sift through radio telescope signals for signs of extraterrestrial life in the universe .

The international trailer for Body of Lies. Based on Washington Post columnist David Ignatius ’ 2007 novel about a CIA operative , Roger Ferris ( Leonardo DiCaprio ) , who uncovers a lead on a major terrorist leader suspected to be operating out of Jordan .
When Ferris devises a plan to infiltrate his network , he must first win the backing of cunning CIA veteran Ed Hoffman ( Russell Crowe ) and the collegial , but perhaps suspect , head of Jordanian intelligence .
Although ostensibly his allies , Ferris questions how far he can really trust these men without putting his entire operation – and his life – on the line .

Geng Jinping , left , manager of a milk production base , was sentenced to death Thursday .
His brother , Geng Jinzhu , right , was a driver at the base and was also on trial in the tainted milk case .
(( Ding Lixin / Xinhua / Associated Press ) )
A Chinese court on Thursday sentenced two men to execution and gave a former top executive a life sentence for their roles in the country 's deadly tainted milk scandal .
The former boss of Sanlu Group , Tian Wenhua , 66 , was handed a life sentence by the Intermediate People 's Court in Shijiazhuang .
Sanlu was the company at the heart of the scandal .
Tian is the highest - ranking official charged in the probe into milk contaminated by melamine , a chemical used in the manufacturing of plastics that was used to give milk an apparently higher nutrition content in protein tests .
At least six children died , and nearly 300,000 people became ill from consuming the contaminated infant formula and milk products .
Melamine can cause kidney stones and kidney failure when large amounts are ingested .
Tian pleaded guilty to charges of producing and selling fake or substandard products during her trial at the end of December .
Tian Wenhua , Sanlu Group Co.'s former board chairwoman and general manager , is taken by bailiffs into court to stand trial in Shijiazhuang on Dec. 31 , 2008 .
On Thursday she received a life sentence .
(( Ding Lixin / Xinhua / Associated Press ) )
Zhang Yujun , 40 , was sentenced to death for running a workshop that was allegedly China 's largest source of melamine .
Geng Jinping was also given the death penalty for producing and selling toxic food .
They were among 12 defendants sentenced Thursday in connection with the case .
Others were given prison terms of five to 15 years .
Parents remain angry
Families of babies made sick by contaminated milk gathered outside the court to hear the sentences read out .
Dozens of police officers guarded the courthouse and cordoned off the surrounding area , asking victims ' families to keep about 100 metres away .
" Many parents are angry that only middlemen got the death penalty and that some company and government officials faced lesser charges or avoided prosecution , " CBC's Michel Cormier reported from Beijing .
Zheng Shuzhen , from Henan province , said her one - year - old granddaughter died in June after drinking Sanlu milk and was upset by Thursday 's decision , saying Tian 's sentence was too light .
" My granddaughter died .
She [ Tian ] should die , too , she should be shot .
She has brought such harm to the public , to children , " said Shuzhen .
" I 've run out of tears … .
That 's why I came today .
Even if [ Tian ] dies a hundred times over , it wo n't lessen our hate . "
More than 200 families whose children died or were made ill by poisoned milk in China have appealed to the country 's highest court , demanding higher compensation than the amount offered and long - term treatment for their babies .
The 22 Chinese dairies involved in the scandal proposed about $ 200 million in compensation .
The Chinese government has vowed to crack down on food safety crimes in the future , but warns there could be an increase in cases as businesses try to cut corners in times of recession , said Cormier .
Back in August we wrote about new - crop sales of soybeans , corn , sorghum and cotton to China .
In the six weeks since then sales of those crops have continued to turn heads .
Large sales combined with decreased production estimates in the September World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report have put upward pressure on futures prices and increased grower optimism .
It ’s time to look again at 2020 - 2021 crop sales to China in relation to previous years .
Here we compare new - crop outstanding sales plus accumulated exports for the 2020 - 2021 marketing year to the same period from the past five years .
EasyJet ' almost ruined pioneering windpipe transplant operation by refusing to carry stem cells on flight '
They were on the verge of an astonishing breakthrough that promised to transform millions of lives .
British scientists had battled all kinds of medical and technological challenges to help create a windpipe grown from a patient 's own stem cells .
Now they simply had to fly the cells to the patient in Spain in time for the operation .
But their work was almost undone by the most formidable obstacle of all - the blundering officialdom of a budget airline .
Claudia Castillo become the first person in the world to undergo a whole organ transplant grown from her own stem cells
Even though the transport of the cells had been pre-arranged , easyJet staff deemed the cells a security risk because they were carried in a test tube exceeding the 100 ml limit for liquids .
Professor Martin Birchall , the scientist in charge of the cells , pleaded with staff at Bristol airport to allow the package on the flight .
He explained that the 60 million cells could only survive outside laboratory conditions for 14 hours .
Martin Birchall , the scientist in charge of the cells , pleaded with staff at Bristol airport to allow the package on board
But the airline refused to allow them on to the plane - and when Professor Birchall protested , he was almost arrested by armed police .
Eventually he was forced to pay £ 14,000 for a private jet to take the cells to Barcelona , where the operation was a success .
Yesterday , the University of Bristol professor said of easyJet : ' They gave me strict instructions as to how I should present something like a transplant organ , clearly labelled .
' They knew there was liquid and that it was packaged in a way that it would not get out .
On arrival they said it could n't go on because it would be a security risk .
' I almost got arrested by armed police - I was so furious , trying to explain months of work . '
He added : ' The clock was ticking as we'd taken the cells out of their culture media an hour before .
' We thought about driving to Barcelona but that would have taken too long .
' If we had n't been able to get the cells there , we would have wasted years of work and this major breakthrough for surgery and science would n't have taken place . '
EasyJet said it received no documents asking for clearance for an organ to be transported but offered to refund the cost of the flight - thought to be around £ 100 .
EasyJet staff refused to let the stem cells being used for a landmark transplant on the plane
Professor Birchall - who was also reimbursed by Bristol University for the cost of the private plane - and his team played a key part in the operation on Claudia Castillo , 30 , who suffered a collapsed airway caused by TB .
The mother of two became the first person in the world to receive an organ grown from her own stem cells .
From being virtually bedridden after her windpipe became blocked , she is now able to resume the active life she once had .
Within 20 years , the technique could become the normal way of carrying out transplants .

California ’s Democratic leaders were planning a vote today on a brazen proposal to raise gas , sales and income taxes through a series of legal maneuvers that would bypass the Legislature ’s minority Republicans .
The Democratic gambit , announced Wednesday , would raise $ 9.3 billion to ease the state ’s fiscal crisis by increasing sales taxes by three - fourths of a cent and gas taxes by 13 cents a gallon , starting in February .
The plan would add a surcharge of 2.5 % to everyone ’s 2009 state income tax bill .
It would also require businesses to withhold taxes on payments above $ 600 made to independent contractors , as they are now required to do with salaried employees .
In addition , the Democrats said they would cut $ 7.3 billion from schools , healthcare and other programs .
Their package would total $ 18 billion and nearly halve the state ’s budget shortfall , projected to reach $ 41.8 billion in the next 18 months .

Both the Assembly and Senate planned to vote on the package today .
Late Wednesday , Democratic lawmakers were negotiating with Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger over items he wanted included in the proposal before he would support it .
Inside the Capitol , the strategy is considered revolutionary , because it would sideline the GOP .
Though Republicans are a minority in both houses of the Legislature , they have repeatedly blocked tax increases and thwarted budgets they did not like , because California is one of only three states mandating a two - thirds vote for both budgets and tax increases .
Achieving that threshold requires some Republican votes .
“ I still believe in bipartisanship , ” Senate President Pro Tem Darrell Steinberg ( D - Sacramento ) said at a Capitol news conference .
“ But there is an even greater responsibility than practicing bipartisanship , and that is to govern .
And that is what we intend to do here today . ”
Republican legislators and antitax groups promised legal challenges to derail the Democrats ’ plan .

“ Raising taxes on people and playing funny math and calling it fees is not governing , ” said Assembly GOP leader Michael Villines of Clovis .
“ That ’s trickery , is what that is . ”
The plan hinges on a legal distinction made by judges that a tax is imposed broadly and used for general government purposes , while a fee is charged to users of a specific benefit provided by government , such as a road .
The proposal would employ an arcane loophole in state law that lets legislators pass a tax bill with a simple majority vote -- if the bill does not raise more revenue .
The Democrats intend to do two things : eliminate some existing fees , including those on gasoline , and substitute tax increases that would include a 9.9 % levy on oil extraction and the income tax surcharge .

Under the proposal , the Democrats would then reimpose the gas fees at higher levels ; fees can be raised with simple majority votes .
The gas money would go to roads and transportation .
The net effect would be billions of dollars in new revenue for the state .
Similar proposals have been considered in past budget crises but never acted on out of concern that they would unravel in court .
The Democrats said Wednesday the plan had passed muster with the nonpartisan Legislative Counsel ’s office , which provides legal advice to lawmakers .
But the only opinion from that office that Democrats released was from 2003 .
Democrats said this plan was the only way they could see of breaking the current budget impasse , which has stretched on for more than a month since Schwarzenegger called lawmakers back into session .
“ Sen . Steinberg and I are committed to getting this job done with or without our Republican colleagues , ” said Assembly Speaker Karen Bass ( D - Los Angeles ) .

Matt David , a spokesman for Schwarzenegger , said the Republican governor would not sign the measure unless it included cuts to the state ’s workforce , which public employee unions are resisting .
David said Schwarzenegger also is insisting that lawmakers include measures for mortgage relief and provisions allowing private contractors to perform more state construction and even take over some government facilities , such as roads .
“ If it does n’t have these components , then the vote . . . is nothing more than a drill , ” David said in an interview .
Jon Coupal , president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. , said the Democrats ’ bid violates tenets of Proposition 13 , the 1978 initiative that capped property taxes and required that all other tax increases be approved by two - thirds of the Legislature .

“ If they proceed with this proposal to raise taxes with a simple majority vote , they will be sued and they will lose , ” Coupal said .
“ So we ’re very confident this is more of a ploy than anything else . ”
Legal experts said no one can know how the courts would rule .
Judges might be reluctant to take an action that could send the state spiraling into insolvency .
On the other hand , the experts said , judges -- particularly those afraid of recall campaigns -- might be afraid of a populist uprising akin to the revolt that led to Proposition 13 .
“ It is absolutely a shell game , ” said Kirk Stark , a professor at UCLA School of Law .
But “ in the 30 years since Prop. 13 was enacted , the courts have been accommodating of legislative ingenuity . ”
Or , said another UCLA law professor , Jonathan Zasloff : “ The court may just say , ‘ We are not dealing with this ; it is not our job ’ ” to run the state ’s finances .
“ It will be a galvanizing issue that tests the independence of the judiciary . ”

If the plan were to survive legal tests , the state would still face a debilitating budget gap and a cash crisis so severe that California ’s top three financial officials -- the state treasurer , the controller and Schwarzenegger ’s finance director -- voted Wednesday to freeze financing on road , levee , school and housing projects .
State fiscal experts said lawmakers would have to erase the entire budget gap before they would resume issuing the bonds that finance such projects , which number more than 2,000 .
They said state bonds are not selling while financial speculation grows that California may become insolvent .
“ In a market where investors are looking for quality , we do not feel they are going to want to buy the bonds of the state of California ” until the state ’s finances are righted , said Paul Rosenstiel , a deputy treasurer .
“ We do n’t hear from the investment bankers at all these days . ”

Book :
Tenet drunkenly mocked Bush neocons , right - wing Israelis Mike Sheehan
Published : Wednesday December 17 , 2008
Print This Email This Swimming trunks ?
$ 25 .
Bottle of fine scotch ? $ 60 .
The director of the CIA in the pool of a Saudi prince , ranting drunkenly about neocons and Jews ?
Priceless .
In a scene described in the upcoming Patrick Tyler book A World of Trouble , former CIA director George Tenet was visiting the house of Prince Bandar bin Sultan when he allegedly let loose after imbibing on whiskey , reports Jeffrey Goldberg on his blog at The Atlantic .
Tenet ,
Tyler writes , was in Bandar 's swimming pool complaining loudly about Bush administration officials " who were just then trying to pin the Iraq WMD fiasco on him . "
After quickly consuming half of a bottle of scotch given to him by one of Bandar 's servants , Tenet said , " They 're setting me up .
The bastards are setting me up , [ but ] I am not going to take the hit . "
Tyler then writes that , according to one witness , Tenet " mocked the neoconservatives in the Bush administration and their alignment with the right wing of Israel 's political establishment , referring to them with exasperation as , ' the Jews . ' "
Goldberg says that in Tyler 's footnotes , Tenet denied much of the account , including the remarks and a report that he had taken a sleeping pill in addition to alcohol .
It was n't made clear by Goldberg just when the alleged incident occurred according to the book .
Tenet retired from the CIA in 2004 .
Shortly thereafter he was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by George W. Bush , despite criticism from Congressional Democrats that Tenet was responsible for intelligence failures regarding Iraq 's purported weapons of mass destruction .
Goldberg 's blog post can be read in full at this link .
The flawless flautist :
The musical robot that plays Flight Of The Bumblebee perfectly
Classical musicians could have good reason to be worried as scientists have developed a musical robot that makes no mistakes .
Waseda University ’s robotic flautist can play the challenging musical score of the ‘ Flight of the Bumblebee ’ almost flawlessly .
And the robot has been designed with a human - like quality that allows it to engage with the audience , making in a contender for concert performances .
Flute - tastic :
The musical robot plays ' The Flight of the Bumblee ' with virtually no mistakes
The Waseda Flutist No. 4 Refined IV was unveiled at the BioRob 2008 conference in Arizona two weeks ago .
Thanks to a series of technical advances , the latest version makes smoother transitions between notes than the original model built in 2003 .
The robot ’s mouth and lungs have been carefully designed to mimic the expert air control of a professional flautist .
High - speed :
All of the robots fingers can open and close the flute keys in 8 Hz
The scientists created artificial lips with the elasticity of human lips and embedded pins , which control their shape .
The robot ’s tongue has been redesigned to enable the double - tonguing technique – the high - speed playing used throughout the famous ‘ Flight of the Bumblee ’ .
It even has an in - built mechanism to create vibrato , which can take human players years to master , that changes the amplitude and frequency of the robot ’s airflow .
The transition : The WF1 ( left , 1990 ) , WF2 ( 1992 ) and WF3RIX ( 2002 )
The lungs are composed of two air - tight acrylic cases , with a bellow that allows them to breathe in and out .
And the robot's eyes have two cameras that allow it to interact with the audience and other musicians , so we could soon see it playing duets with people .
Research on the musical robot began in 1990 , with the aim that it would eventually rival human musicians .
But the WF - 4RIV is more than just a gimmick .
The makers hope to make it sophisticated enough to achieve better human - computer interaction and then teach music to pupils .

( Mental Floss ) --
Investigators are trying to figure out whether the financial fraud allegedly perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff was , in fact , the largest Ponzi scheme in history .
The alleged scam , which cost investors $ 50 billion , sounds like a classic Ponzi racket .
The New York home of Bernard Madoff , who 's accused in a $ 50 billion Ponzi scheme .
But what is a Ponzi scheme ?
And why does it bear this name ?
First , you need to know a little bit about its namesake , Charles Ponzi .
Anyone can work a simple swindle , but you have to be a special kind of con man to have your name become synonymous with " fraud . "
Ponzi pulled it off , though .
After arriving in the U.S. from Italy in 1903 , Ponzi knocked around in a variety of unskilled jobs that usually ended when he got into trouble for theft or cheating customers .
A few years later , he moved to Canada , where he spent a hitch in prison for passing a forged check .
When he eventually drifted back down to the U.S. , he needed a way to make some quick cash .
Watch how a Ponzi scheme works »
Making money via mail
Ponzi eventually found his way to get rich quick using a vagary of the postal system .
At the time , it was common for letters abroad to include an international reply coupon -- a voucher that could be exchanged for minimum postage back to the country from which the letter was sent .
Thus , if you sent your buddy in France a letter , you could include a coupon so he could respond .
( This practice still exists but is less common . )
As exchange and postal rates fluctuated , though , there was an opportunity to make a profit .
You only had to purchase postal reply coupons cheaply in some foreign country , send them back to the U.S. to swap them out for American stamps of a higher value , then sell these stamps .
This arrangement was perfectly legal ; it was just cleverly gaming the system .
Ponzi started buying and selling postal reply coupons using agents in his native Italy , and he was making a good living doing it .
Unfortunately , whatever defect made Ponzi steal from his employers and pass bad checks prompted him to get greedy here , too .
He started to recruit investors into his system with the promise of 50 percent returns in just a few days .
Investors would pay their cash in , and sure enough , Ponzi would get them the promised return .
Everyone was happy with the results , and word started to spread about this Italian financial wizard .
Within two years , he had employees all over the country recruiting new takers for this foolproof investment strategy .
Ponzi was pocketing millions , and he enjoyed a sumptuous life outside of Boston .
At his peak , Ponzi was raking in $ 250,000 a day , which enabled him to collect such necessities as gold - handled canes .
He became a celebrity investor , almost like the Warren Buffett of his day .
The scheme
Why is it hard to think of Ponzi 's name without affixing " scheme " to the end of it , then ?
Ponzi's underlying " business " -- the arbitrage on the postal coupons -- was n't actually as sound as he claimed .
In fact , there was n't even really a business .
However , since so much money was flowing in from new investors , he could just pay off the returns for the old ones from the new cash .
In fact , Ponzi did n't even need to pay off the old investors , since many of them wanted to reinvest their returns in this wonderful business .
Ponzi's charms made it easy for him to placate any worried customers , and his con looked unstoppable .
Mental Floss : 4 very big paychecks for very little work
Fuzzy math
Eventually , though , smarter financial heads started looking at Ponzi 's business .
Clarence Barron , owner of the Wall Street Journal and founder of the financial magazine that bears his name , realized Ponzi must have been a huckster and went on the offensive .
While Barron conceded that there probably was a way for a person to make a small amount of quick cash on the postal reply coupon scheme , he figured that Ponzi would have to be moving 160 million coupons around to raise the cash he needed to support the business .
Since there were only 27,000 postal reply coupons circulating in the world , Ponzi 's story did n't check out .
( Things only got worse when the Postal Service reported that there was n't a huge flow of the coupons from one country to the other . )
On top of that , Barron noted that Ponzi told newspapers he invested his own cash in real estate , stocks , and bonds like any normal investor .
Barron pointed out the obvious question here : if Ponzi had this failsafe scheme in which he could make a 50 percent profit , why was he putting his own money into plain old investment instruments that would give him ( maybe ) a 5 percent return ?
Those certainly did n't sound like the actions of a financial genius .
Barron 's conclusions ran as front - page news in the Boston Post in July 1920 , which would have been damning for most cons .
Ponzi was such a charismatic force of nature , though , that many people chose not to believe the paper 's report .
Few believed that their hero , the man who had " tripled " their life savings , was anything less than 100 percent legitimate .
In fact , the morning that the Post ran Barron 's report , investors lined up around the block outside of his office in an attempt to give him more money -- even after they 'd been told that they 'd been scammed .
Ponzi later boasted that he'd taken in a million dollars in new investments the day the report ran .

The unraveling
Things were starting to look less rosy for the scammer , though .
Although he 'd largely placated his investors after Barron 's report , Ponzi must have realized his window of opportunity was closing .
He hired a publicist , William McMasters , but the PR man saw through Ponzi 's lies and renounced his client in the press .
James Walsh reprints part of McMasters ' slam of Ponzi in his book , " You Can't Cheat An Honest Man . "
Of Ponzi , McMasters said , " The man is a financial idiot .
He can hardly add ... He sits with his feet on the desk smoking expensive cigars in a diamond holder and talking complete gibberish about postal coupons . "
The next month , regulators raided Ponzi 's office and discovered that he did n't have a huge quantity of postal reply coupons .
Since Ponzi had used the mail to notify his marks of how their " investments " were performing , he faced serious mail fraud charges ; in total , the government brought 86 charges against him in two separate indictments .
Ponzi pled guilty to one of these charges in exchange for a light sentence of five years .
He served around three and a half years , then got his release to face state charges , for which he received a sentence of nine more years .
But before he could go back to jail , he jumped bail and tried to start new scams in Florida and Texas .
( You 'd think the government would have learned their lesson about trusting this guy . )
Eventually , though , his time on the lam ran out , and he served his whole sentence .
Upon his release , Ponzi was deported to Italy and spent the rest of his life in poverty before dying in 1949 in Rio de Janeiro , where he 's buried in a pauper 's grave .

The man accused by the international criminal court of planning , organising and directing an orgy of violence against civilians in Darfur that left up to 200,000 people dead and 2.5 million homeless has angrily protested his innocence , calling the allegations part of a political plot by the western powers to recolonise Sudan .
In an exclusive interview with the Guardian , Ahmad Muhammad Harun , Sudan 's minister of state for humanitarian affairs , said he defied the ICC and the international community to do their worst and vowed never to give himself up to the tribunal .
Harun claimed the evidence against him was concocted and unreliable .
And he described the court 's chief prosecutor , Luis Moreno - Ocampo , as a disgrace to the legal profession who should be sacked .
" My conscience is clear .
I have no regrets , " Harun said .
" What I have done was legal , it was my responsibility , it was my duty .
I am content .
I am at peace with myself . "
The ICC has charged Harun , in his former capacity as Sudan 's minister of state for the interior , with 42 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity allegedly committed in Darfur in the period from August 2003 to March 2004 .
The eight - month period witnessed a peak in fighting between rebel and pro-government forces .
The large - scale civilian casualties , gross human rights abuses and mass displacement later caused the US government to accuse Sudan 's political leadership of genocide and led to UN and EU sanctions against Sudan .
The Darfur carnage caused international outrage that has yet to abate as the violence there continues , albeit at a reduced level .
Numerous efforts to forge a lasting peace agreement during the past five years have foundered while hundreds of thousands of people remain in refugee camps .
Meanwhile , human rights and advocacy groups have added their voices to calls for Harun and other alleged war criminals on both sides to be prosecuted .
But Sudan is not a party to the ICC .
It has so far ignored UN security council demands that it cooperate with the court and surrender Harun and his co-accused , Ali Muhammad Ali Abd- al - Rahman , an alleged Janjaweed leader also known as Ali Kushayb .
ICC judges are currently considering a request by Moreno - Ocampo for an arrest warrant for Sudan 's president , Omar al - Bashir , on charges of genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity also relating to events in Darfur .
Speaking in his ministry 's smart new offices in Khartoum , Harun said the ICC was in effect conducting a political vendetta against Sudan that had little or nothing to do with justice .
Relaxed and confident
Throughout the interview , Harun , a tall 43 - year - old dressed in a smart charcoal suit and open - necked shirt , appeared mostly relaxed and confident .
Occasionally his eyes flashed with anger as he discussed the accusations against him .
" We believe the ICC has digressed from its main objective and become part of the international political conflict .
It is another phase of international colonisation .
It targets mainly the Africans .
It reminds us of the 19th century when the white people were dominating here in Africa .
" The main aim of the white people in Africa at that time , the British and the Europeans , was to disseminate their culture and their traditions .
Under the flag of attractive slogans , so many things happened .
Now there is a new imperial era but this time it is led by the United States and supported by the Europeans . "
Harun , a trained lawyer from the Bargo tribe in western Sudan and a former judge , argued that UN security council resolution 1593 that referred Darfur to the ICC in 2005 was discriminatory because it exempted citizens of the US , which like Sudan is not a party to the ICC 's founding treaty , from action by the court .
For this reason , the ICC prosecutor was ignoring the " first principle " of equality before the law .
" This is a discriminatory prosecution .
It is also discriminatory because the ICC is targeting only African countries , " Harun said .
" Also , any serious investigation should begin on the ground , in theatre , in Darfur .
And witnesses who are part of the problem should not be taken into consideration .
They are not reliable sources . "
Suggesting the ICC investigation was superfluous as well as politically motivated , Harun said a national investigation committee created by Bashir had examined many senior officials over their roles in Darfur .
" I was one of them .
I gave answers to all their questions .
No action was taken .
There was no evidence , so there was no reason to take action . "
Harun added that any future move to indict Bashir , or any backroom deal in which he himself might be handed over to the ICC in return for Bashir being granted immunity , would only prove his contention that the ICC proceedings were political .
In such circumstances , he said , he would never voluntarily surrender himself .
And nor was he prepared to meet Moreno - Ocampo if the latter came to Khartoum .
" The prosecutor has brought his profession into disrespect .
He is not welcome in Sudan ...
He should be replaced .
This is what we are requesting .
I add my voice to the voices of the international society because he is insulting the profession of justice and insulting African countries . "
Asked to explain his actions in Darfur in 2003 - 4 , Harun said he had faced an internal , essentially local conflict between Darfurian tribes that quickly transformed into a political conflict with encouragement from forces outside the province .
Rebel leaders Minni Minnawi , Abd al - Wahid Muhammad Nur , and Abdallah Abbakar initially called themselves the Darfur Liberation Movement , he said .
But this later became the Sudan Liberation Movement as external actors got involved .
The Darfur rebellion , also fuelled by Khalil Ibrahim 's opposition - backed Justice and Equality Movement , threatened the stability of the Sudanese state as a whole , for example by undermining the 2005 North - South comprehensive peace agreement which was then nearing fruition , Harun said .
The government had no choice but to act .
" The policy and tactics of the government , like any other government when things like this are happening , is to begin by mobilising .
" We have a security reserve force - the Popular Defence Forces - to respond to those attacks , a paramilitary force .
Some people call the PDF by different names , some call it militia , others are calling it Janjaweed .
But it is a formal force and it works under the directions of the army . "
Unable to match pro-government forces militarily , the rebels changed tactics and created a humanitarian crisis in Darfur to attract international attention and intervention , he said .
Rebels blamed
" They started putting pressure on civilians to move out of villages , they killed their children , women they abducted , they destroyed the infrastructure and means of people 's livelihood , and caused the mass migration of people into refugee camps . "
In other words , he suggested , it was the rebel groups that were responsible for the civilian massacres , atrocities and mass displacements in 2003 - 4 , not himself or the government .
Sudan 's government in any case disputes the UN 's casualty estimates , claiming only about 10,000 people died .
Reports that he boasted in a 2003 speech that he had " the power and the authority to kill or forgive whoever in Darfur " were fabricated , Harun added .
And he insisted his 2004 description of the rebels as " fish " who needed the " water " of the villages to survive ( thereby allegedly justifying the destruction of villages ) was a distortion of his meaning .
People in Darfur knew the truth , he said , which was why he was still welcome there .
" I move freely in Darfur .
I have strong support .
I am popular in Darfur because they know who protected them . "
Leaning back in a well - padded armchair with a broad smile on his face , Harun said he was a religious man who had done nothing to offend against God .
But he did not claim to have a close relationship with the Almighty .
" I am not like George Bush .
I do not talk to God .
In Islam , we believe Muhammad was the last prophet .
Since Muhammad , no one can talk to God . "
As for the future , he suggested relations between Sudan and the international community would deteriorate further if the ICC persisted with its present course .
A total breach with the UN was not out of the question .
Harun 's openly defiant stance underlines how difficult it may be to bring justice to Darfur while avoiding an open confrontation with Sudan and , at one remove , its African Union and Arab League allies .
If allowed to continue unanswered , it also threatens the credibility of the ICC .
" We do n't expect anything good from the ICC .
But for every action , there will be a response , " Harun said .
" The ICC will do whatever they want .
We will wait and see what they do .
We will defend our country as best we can to the best of our ability , according to our opinions . "
Backstory
The international criminal court was established in 2002 as an independent tribunal to try individuals responsible for genocide , war crimes and crimes against humanity .
It was designed to complement national legal systems , stepping in when a country appeared unable or unwilling to prosecute .
More than 100 countries are members .
Atrocities committed by rebel commanders in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and by the Lord 's Resistance Army in Uganda prompted the opening of the first cases in 2004 .
Investigations into abuses in Sudan 's Darfur region began a year later .
In February 2007 , ICC prosecutor Luis Moreno - Ocampo announced that Sudanese minister Ahmad Harun and Janjaweed militia leader Ali Kushayb were suspected of committing crimes against humanity .
The indictment and warrant for their arrests , dated April 2007 , specifically accuses Harun of targeting the ethnic African Fur , Zaghawa and Masalit tribes by employing elements of the Sudanese armed forces and Popular Defence Forces paramilitaries , and by " recruiting , arming and funding " irregular Arab militias known as Janjaweed
According to the court , pro-government forces over which Harun exercised command launched a campaign of terror that included " murders of civilians , rapes and outrages upon the personal dignity of women and girls ... and destruction of property and pillaging of towns " .
The indictment claims that the campaign was of a " systematic and widespread nature " conducted " over an extensive period of time ... in furtherance of a state or organisational policy consisting in attacking the civilian population " .
It goes on : " Ahmad Harun intentionally contributed to the commission of the above - mentioned crimes ...
In his public speeches , Harun not only demonstrated he knew the militia / Janjaweed were attacking civilians and pillaging towns and villages but also personally encouraged the commission of such illegal acts . "
Microsoft Earnings and Revenues Take a Big Hit ; 5,000 to Be Laid Off ( Plus the Full Press Release )
Microsoft , moving up its second - quarter earnings release from this afternoon to right now , said its financial performance took a major hit , with revenue up only two percent , to $ 16.63 billion , about $ 900 million below earlier guidance .
Net income was even worse for Microsoft ( MSFT ) , off 11 percent to $ 4.17 billion , or 47 cents a share , from year - earlier earnings of $ 4.71 billion , or 50 cents a share .
Microsoft whiffed badly on Wall Street ’s expectations of earnings of 49 cents a share on sales of $ 17.08 billion .
In addition , the software giant said that it would cut 5,000 jobs across many divisions over the next 18 months , starting with 1,400 today , pegging operating cost savings at $ 1.5 billion annually .
It will also make other cuts , including trimming salaries , travel , marketing and even office expansion costs , all over the company .
Perhaps most ominously , Microsoft said it would not give profit and revenue guidance for the rest of the year , because of the economy ’s turmoil .
Apparently , even the smartest of techies have little insight to this very foggy financial situation .
Microsoft blamed “ PC market weakness and a continued shift to lower priced netbooks ” for some of the declines , as well as the economy for lower IT spending .
“ While we are not immune to the effects of the economy , I am confident in the strength of our product portfolio and soundness of our approach , ” said Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer .
“ We will continue to manage expenses and invest in long - term opportunities to deliver value to customers and shareholders , and we will emerge an even stronger industry leader than we are today . ”
Here is Ballmer ’s full memo to Microsoft employees about the layoffs and weak results .
Microsoft will talk to analysts at 8 a.m. PST this morning , which BoomTown will liveblog .
The company was supposed to report after the markets closed , at 2:30 pm .
Here is the full press release below :

is a 35 year old drama teacher at Old Bridge High School in Middlesex County , New Jersey .
She was arrested on Wednesday and is being held at the Middlesex County Adult Correction Center in New Brunswick .
Bail has not yet been set .
Glide , who lives in Howell Township in Monmouth County , faces second - degree charges of sexual assault and child endangerment for a sexual relationship that reportedly occurred between herself and a male student .
Each charge carries the possibility of a 10 year prison sentence .

In a letter sent home to parents today , Superintendent of Schools Dr. Simon Bosco said the district was , " shocked to learn that a member of the high school staff has been accused of this serious crime .
Old Bridge High School is committed to providing a safe environment for all children in our care and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement until the investigation is concluded . "
A determination has not yet been made regarding Glide 's future employment at the school but it would appear her teaching days are numbered .

Hey , we 've got a new president !
That was easy .
But now what ?
If you believe disappointed right - wingers , America is doomed .
Our economy will turn Socialist , abortions will become a recreational habit , and all of those terrorists who have been sharpening their knives for the last eight years will see our rookie president and promptly come - a - calling to test him .
Believe the Left , and hold on to your socks because shit is about to get good .
Racism is over , world peace is around the corner , and on Inauguration Day 2009 Atlantis will rise up from the ocean floor causing a dynamic environmental shift that will cure global warming and cancer .
My guess ?
Things will fall somewhere in the middle .
But that 's the beauty of propaganda :
It 's extremism at its artistic finest .
Put a catchy tune to it and people will believe anything .

What I want to know is , whose job was it to make sure that the film would n't contain so many awesome erotic images that men would be feel compelled to turn the volume off so they could fully concentrate on the naked women ?
Because that guy is awful at his job .

Starting today , Change.org ( not to be confused with the Obama administration ’s website , Change.gov , which is also running a poll ) has begun it ’s final round of voting on public policy questions for the incoming administration .
As many of you know , our issue was the top vote getter in the preliminary voting , so there ’s a very good chance that — with your help — we will finish # 1 .
And it is important that we do .
According to the website :
“ The top 10 rated ideas from the final round will be presented to the Obama administration on January 16th at an event at the National Press Club in Washington , DC , co-hosted by the Case Foundation .
At the event we will also announce the launch of a national advocacy campaign behind each idea in collaboration with our nonprofit partners to turn each idea into actual policy . “
Change.org ’s press conference will no doubt be covered by the mainstream media .
Imagine the splash we will make when the public ’s call to legalize marijuana is presented as the # 1 idea for the new administration .
Well , we wo n’t have to imagine if you get out and vote !
Right now , the public ’s call to “ legalize the medicinal and recreational use of marijuana ” is the most popular issue on the website .
( A related question asking Obama to “ end the war on drugs ” is # 4 . )
However , several other important issues are just a few votes behind , so it is vital that those of you reading this post take the time to log on to the Ideas for Change website and vote to make cannabis legalization the # 1 issue in America !

Karen Salmansohn publishes a “ Be Happy Dammit Tips ” Newsletter .
She quotes some fascinating statistics about the value of business friendships .
For example :
– People with a best friend at work are seven times more likely to be engaged in their work .
– Close friendships at work boost employee satisfaction by nearly 50 % .
– People with at least three close friends at work are 46 % more likely to be extremely satisfied their job – and 88 % more likely to be satisfied with their lives .
– Employees who are good friends with their bosses are more than twice as likely to be happy with their work .
The relevance of friendship is not new to the world of professional services .
David Maister writes about friendship in his article titled Young Professionals : Cultivate the Habits of Friendship .
He asserts , “ The way most clients choose among professionals is essentially identical to the way people choose their friends .
At the point of selecting a professional to work with , clients go with providers who can :
( a ) make them feel at ease ;
( b ) make them feel comfortable sharing their fears and concerns ;
( c ) can be trusted to look after them as well as their transaction and ( d ) are dependably on their side . ”
It seems logical to infer that clients who view you , their business advisor , as a friend are at least doubly more likely to be engaged in the work you do and be satisfied with the results you produce .
Take stock : how many clients can you call “ friend ” ?
Man cleared of sex assault on young girl after experts tell court he was sleepwalking
Alan Ball was acquitted of sexual assault after medical experts said he was sleepwalking
A lorry driver who climbed into bed with a young girl and kissed her on the lips has been cleared of sexual assault after experts said he was sleepwalking at the time .
Alan Ball , 35 , had fallen asleep on a sofa after drinking heavily at a house party but during the night he got into bed with the girl who was sleeping upstairs .
He was charged with sexual assault but experts who examined his history of sleepwalking concluded he had not known what he was doing and he was cleared by a judge .
Mr Ball , who has a daughter aged five , said the year - long ordeal had destroyed his life and told of his relief at being absolved of blame .
' I knew I was innocent but not a day went by when it went through my head , " What if I end up in jail for something I have not done ? " ' he said .
' Even when I went round to friends ' houses where there were young kids , you wonder whether it goes through their minds . '
Mr Ball was arrested following the house party last New Year 's Eve after he was accused of getting into bed with the girl , who was under 13 , and kissing her on the lips .
He insisted he had no memory of what had happened , but he was charged with sexual assault .
But Preston Crown Court was told his history of sleepwalking meant the allegation was being dropped .
Fiorella Brereton , prosecuting , said that because of the seriousness of the alleged offence , two experts had been commissioned to examine him .
' Both experts were of the opinion the defendant would not have known what he was doing , ' she said .
' He has a history of sleepwalking typical of that type of behaviour of not knowing what he was doing .
Sleepwalking is also within the family .
Mr Ball was cleared at Preston Crown Court
' The experts consider because he did not carry out more activity when he got into bed with her , it is more concurrent with sleepwalking , and the evidence leads both experts to the opinion he had no intention of abuse . '
The Crown Prosecution Service and the girl 's family did not offer evidence against Mr Ball , and Judge Stuart Baker delivered a not guilty verdict .
Afterwards Mr Ball , of Ormskirk , Lancashire , said the past year had been ' hell ' .
He said he had lost his job , become a social outcast and had been allowed to see his own daughter only during supervised visits .
' Sometimes I had to ignore her phone calls , ' he said .
' Not being able to have my child - that was like a 12 - month sentence , and it is over now . '
Several defendants have been acquitted of offences including rape and even murder on the basis that they were sleepwalking .
The defence is known as automatism , with those who commit indecent acts said to be suffering from ' sexsomnia ' .
Last year Jane McKenna , 33 , from Hampshire , claimed she had been raped by a friend 's husband , Jason Jeal , only for him to be cleared on the basis that he was sleepwalking - even though he had no medical history of the condition .
After the case , the Solicitor General said such arguments should be allowed in court only when backed up by well - founded medical evidence .
— John Kemp is a Reuters columnist .
The opinions expressed are his own —
Most successful elected leaders must disappoint their most ardent supporters at some point , as the bright hopes of an election campaign give way to the complex realities and constraints of governing , and need to occupy and retain the political center - ground to win re-election .
The trick of really successful leaders is to let supporters down gently to avoid turning disappointment into frustration and anger , retaining allegiance and support even when the maximum agenda goes unfulfilled and compromises must be made .
Political supporters have to be given enough policy gains to be kept loyal , even as some cherished objectives fall by the wayside .
Despite the enormous outpouring of goodwill to the incoming president , or perhaps because of it , President - elect Barack Obama will be no exception to this iron rule .
The high hopes for the administration ( cultural reconciliation between left and right , poverty alleviation , fairer distribution of economic rewards , renewed growth , financial reform , decisive action on climate change and “ peace in our time ” , to name but a few ) have run far ahead of even the most successful president ’s ability to deliver them in four or even eight years .
So the real question as the new administration prepares to take office is where will it dare and be able to be radical , and where will it be forced by circumstances to be more conservative .
Early indications suggest the administration may disappoint its progressive supporters with a cautious approach to foreign policy , the economy and finance , but its moves in climate change and energy efficiency could be far bolder .
CHOOSING BATTLES CAREFULLY
Like any president , Obama will have to decide which battles to fight and which to avoid , where to spend his political capital , and where to conserve it by hewing closer to the status quo .
Presidents respond to the agenda forced upon them as much as they shape it .
Despite the “ change ” rhetoric , the new administration may find its options severely limited .
Financial crisis at home leaves little room in the budget for new spending mandates beyond short - term stimulus .
While blaming the banks for causing the financial crisis is attractive , the system is probably not strong enough to withstand wholesale reform at the moment , so the administration may have to settle for more piecemeal changes .
Abroad , the administration also faces the familiar Gordian knot of intractable disputes : how to close the detention facilities at Guantanamo , deal with Iran ’s suspected nuclear ambitions , engage European governments and become involved in the Middle East process .
Moreover , Obama ’s commanding lead in electoral college votes ( 365 - 173 ) masks a narrower margin in the popular vote ( 53 percent to 46 percent ) .
For all the enthusiasm about “ change ” , almost half the nation voted for Obama ’s rival Senator John McCain .
The president faces re-election in four years and cannot afford to stray too far from the political center .
The new president has two options .
Try to enact a raft of radical reforms quickly in the hope of changing the whole political game by the time the next election is fought — the kind of “ transformative ” presidency with which scholars have credited Lincoln , Roosevelt , Truman and Reagan — though perhaps only in hindsight .
Or pick a few carefully chosen battles and settle for competent administration and marginal improvements in other areas .
So far , Obama ’s rhetoric implies the former , but his cabinet picks incline to the latter .
His most enthusiastic supporters at home and abroad may be disappointed .
In many areas , circumstances may force the new president to be a gradualist rather than a great reformer , which risks disappointing core groups at home and foreign governments hoping for a more radical break with the past .
During the long campaign for the presidency , Obama showed himself to be one of the finest students of politics ; despite the soaring oratory , he is well aware that politics remains the art of the possible .
The presidential transition has stressed bringing on board Washington insiders with previous governing and legislating experience ( Clinton at State ; Gates at Defense ; Daschle at Health and Human Services ; Blair and Panetta in intelligence ; Geithner and Summers at the Treasury and on the White House National Economic Council ) rather than innovative or iconoclastic visionaries from outside the Beltway .
Nevertheless , the administration needs to find at least some areas in which it can make a decisive break with the past and stress change rather than continuity , if only to maintain the enthusiasm of its core supporters among progressives and liberals .
Climate change and energy policy is shaping up to be the area where the incoming administration can make some bold gestures designed to reach out to domestic supporters and European governments while disappointing their hopes elsewhere .
THE NEW ENERGY TRINITY
Obama ’s selection of Steven Chu to be secretary of energy last month was an indication of the importance he places on using science and technology , as well as a full range of fiscal incentives , to tackle climate change and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels .
The Department of Energy ( DOE ) ’s primary mission is stewardship of the nation ’s nuclear stockpile , which absorbs more than half of the department ’s $ 26 billion budget .
DOE funds some research into alternative fuels .
But until now the leading role on climate change and energy conservation programs has been taken by the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) and the White House Council on Environmental Quality , with DOE playing only a minor supporting role .
So picking Chu , who has been one of the most prominent and outspoken advocates of using tax increases to force reductions in energy use , and a strong supporter of technological solutions to climate change in his role as director of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory , sends a strong message about the incoming president ’s priorities .
Combined with the selection of other strong climate change advocates to head the EPA and Council on Environmental Quality , Chu ’s forthcoming nomination suggests the administration is preparing to be quite radical in this area .
Given the multiplying problems for the incoming administration ’s climate and energy agenda , it may need to be .

Barack Obama has repeatedly talked about removing all combat troops from Iraq but neither the media nor his supporters have paid much attention to the critical adjective : combat .
Left in Iraq will be an uncertain number of " non-combat " troops .
Among these will be 100,000 mercenaries that Minnesota Public Radio politely calls " the parallel army .
. . filling in the gaps . "
Given that we have about regular 150,000 troops there now - both combat and non-combat - that 's quite a few gaps being filled .
The other group being left in Iraq are " non-combat troops " estimated at somewhere around 30,000 to 70,000 - or about the same number of troops we had in Vietnam in early 1965 .
According to war secretary Robert Gates , the number will be " several tens of thousands .
" What 's the difference between combat and non -combat troops ?
The former are assigned to offensive operations while , as Amy Zalman puts it , non-combat troops " may provide training and mentoring , assist Iraqi troops , conduct intelligence and communications functions , among other tasks .
" It is worth noting , however , that the troops left behind are good enough at combat to " provide training and mentoring , " not to mention their ability to " assist Iraqi troops " that presumably will want , from time to time , to engage in combat .
Writes Zalman , " The New York Times notes that the plan may seek to meet Obama 's plan by ' remissioning ' combat troops as non-combat forces and , moreover , that some may continue to conduct patrols with Iraqi forces , which is essentially a combat function .
Admittedly the Status of Forces Agreement provide for a total departure by the end of 2011 , but that 's a long way off .
In any case , what is clear is that Obama 's verbal sleight of hand is more than a little misleading .
Think what the Government could do with all this information .
It has been suggested that council tax bills will be adjusted to take account of social background , so that the middle classes pay more .
Data sharing will allow this to happen .
As Jill Kirby , at the Centre for Policy Studies , who is producing a pamphlet on the subject , observed : ' It is not hard to conceive of a state which makes value judgments about an individual 's suitability to benefit from certain services , and which allocates those services on the basis of a set of criteria ( such as income , educational background or lifestyle ) of which the individual may be unaware . '
S&P Endorses Linux , Raising Red Hat ( RHT )
You do not see too many upgrades in corporate credit ratings during this part of the business cycle , let alone in technology and software .
But Red Hat , Inc. ( NYSE : RHT ) was just raised by Standard & Poor ’s ratings today .
You might even wonder if S&P is almost endorsing Linux after all these years after you look through the notes .
S&P raised the corporate credit rating on Red Hat to ‘ BB ’ from ’ BB -‘ to reflect its consistent operating performance and improvedcapital structure .
S&P said that the outlook is stable .
Keep inmind that this is still a “ junk bond ” rating , but it only has to goabove “ BB + ” up to “ BBB - ” to reach investment grade .
Also noted are the relatively narrow business profile and modestoperating scale , as well as rapid technology evolution .
If you readinto the “ barriers to entry ” of smaller Linux players , it almost soundslike S&P believes that it is getting a lock in the Linux space forcomputers .
Analyst Martha Toll - Reed said , “ We believe these concernspartly are offset by barriers to entry provided by the large number ofindependent software and hardware vendors which certify their productsto work with Red Hat , as well as liquidity , balance sheet strength andcash flow that are good for the rating level . ”
Red Hat shares are down today by 2 % at $ 14.92 and its market cap isjust over $ 2.8 billion .
We also wanted to see for ourselves what else S&P saw with our glance over the books and over expectations .
It actually looks like much of the data here makes sense .
At least it does on the part where thingsare not falling apart at its business .
We still have some strongconcerns about what all of the $ 400 and under netbooks and $ 500 andunder notebook and desktop computers are doing to PC ’s and therefore tosoftware vendors .
But as of November 30 , Red Hat had $ 758 million in cash and shortterm instruments as well as $ 317.8 million in longer - term investments .
All of its operating costs seem offset and its long - term liabilitiesare mostly deferred charges .
We do not believe that RedHat is anywhere close to immune to the malaise out there .
But analystsdo still expect it grow for now .
It is expected to post over $ 650 million in its fiscal period ending FEB - 2009 and $ 737.7 million for thefiscal period ending FEB - 2010 .
That does not mean that it is expectedto show earnings growth , but it is still expected to run atvery profitable levels .
S&P did not really endorse Linux here as an operating system .
Butit did just give it the thumbs up on the business environment and thesafety of its business .
Now our only question is if all of the old rumors about Red Hat being a takeover target have any real merit for down the road .

Dead People Will Provide Heat to Crematorium Facilities
January 5th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
If you ’re dead and worried about the carbon emissions created from your cremation , relax .
The Swedish town of Halmstad has a solution .
After an environmental review showed that Halmstad ’s crematorium was pumping too much smoke into the air , the facility ’s director decided to re-use heat from the cremations to warm up the crematorium ’s buildings .
The plan will both eliminate the crematorium ’s heating bill and allow it to save money on cooling smoke before it is released into the air .
Locals in the town of 55,000 approve of the crematorium ’s system , so it should be up and running soon .
If the plan is successful , the crematorium eventually wants to pipe heat from its facilities to area homes .
And while some may protest Halmstad ’s plan on moral grounds , I ’m sure that the potential monetary savings for the town will ultimately keep them quiet .

Do n't think too much before purchasing that new car or television .
According to a new study in the Journal of Consumer Research , people who deliberate about decisions make less accurate judgments than people who trust their instincts .
" Whether evaluating abstract objects ( Chinese ideograms ) or actual consumer items ( paintings , apartments , and jellybeans ) , people who deliberated on their preferences were less consistent than those who made non-deliberative judgments , " write authors Loran F. Nordgren ( Northwestern University ) and Ap Dijksterhuis ( Radboud University , The Netherlands ) .
In five separate studies , the researchers found that better judgments can often be made without deliberation .
In the first study , participants rated Chinese ideograms for attractiveness .
In a following study , participants were asked to judge paintings that were widely considered high - or low - quality .
Subsequent groups of participants rated jellybeans and apartments .
In all the studies , some participants were encouraged to deliberate and others to go with their gut .
The more complex the decision , the less useful deliberation became .
For example , when participants rated apartments on just three primary characteristics ( location , price , and size ) deliberation proved useful .
But when the decision became more complex ( with nine characteristics ) the participants who deliberated made worse decisions .
The authors believe this study has consequences for the marketplace .
" If deliberative attention naturally gravitates toward highly salient or novel aspects of an object , marketers might use a deliberative mindset to focus consumers ' attention toward particular aspects , " explain the authors .
" For example , if a car boasts one particularly good feature ( for example , safety ) but has a number of other negative features ( for example , expensive , bad gas mileage , poor handling ) , a car salesman might encourage a potential car buyer to deliberate over the pros and cons of the car , while at the same time emphasizing the importance of safety .
In this way , the disturbed weighting of attributes created by deliberation might be used to highlight the one sellable feature and draw attention away from the unattractive features , " write the authors .

State provisions allowing for the possession and use of medical marijuana do not conflict with federal anti-drug laws , according to a series of California court rulings .
In two separate cases , the California Supreme Court refused to hear challenges to the state 's 12 - year - old marijuana law finding that counties are obligated to issue identification cards to qualified patients and that police cannot seize marijuana from state - sanctioned medical pot users .

LOS ANGELES , California ( CNN ) -- Phil Lesh is on the phone .
Bob Weir and Phil Lesh will be taking part in The Dead 's April - May tour .
" I wish I could say I once quit my job to follow the Grateful Dead in my VW bus , " I tell him .
" But honestly , I 'm just not that cool . "
The bass player chuckles .
" It 's mostly trust - fund kids , " he confides .
" They 're the only ones who are able to do that . "
I guess you could say I 'm a wannabe Deadhead .
Like many Americans , I 'm fascinated by tales of the Grateful Dead 's improvisational live shows and colorful sense of community .
Some 40 - odd years after the group rose out of San Francisco 's Haight - Ashbury scene of the mid-1960s , there 's even a popular Sirius Satellite Radio channel devoted solely to the legendary jam band .
A few days ago , the four surviving members of the Grateful Dead dropped a sweet New Year 's gift on fans -- they 'll reunite for their first concert tour in five years .
Just as they did on their last outing , Lesh , guitarist Bob Weir and drummers Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann will perform under the shortened moniker The Dead .
It 's a reverent nod to their iconic lead guitarist , Jerry Garcia , who died from a heart attack in 1995 after a long struggle with drug addiction .
Under the banner , " An Evening With , " the trek will encompass 19 shows in 16 cities , kicking off April 12 in Greensboro , North Carolina , and wrapping up May 10 in Mountain View , California .
The quartet will be joined by guitarist Warren Haynes and keyboardist Jeff Chimenti .
iReport.com : Step back to the 1970s
The reunion is something that 's been rumored since Lesh , Weir and Hart headlined a " Deadheads for Obama " concert in San Francisco last February .
Kreutzmann was in Hawaii that night , but he was there in spirit .
iReport :
Are you grateful for a Dead tour ?
" We 've never , ever endorsed a candidate -- ever , " Lesh states emphatically .
" Not even Robert Kennedy .
It was a big deal for all of us .
But this was the time , and this was the man . "
Do n't Miss iReport.com :
The day I met Bob Weir
Accompanied by his wife , Jill , and their youngest son , Brian , Lesh even traveled to Reno to knock on doors , in an effort to get out the vote in Nevada -- a battleground state that ultimately went to Barack Obama .
Did anyone recognize him when they answered the door ?
" Not really .
Reno is not really a stronghold of Dead - dom , " he deadpans .
Lesh downplays the band 's legacy as founding fathers of a jam band scene that now includes such free - form artists as Phish , the String Cheese Incident and Blues Traveler .
" All we did was steal what jazz musicians did and apply it to rock ' n ' roll .
If we did n't do it , someone else would have , " he says .
For the tour , look for The Dead to continue their trademark three - and - a - half to four - hour shows ( because of their marathon set , there 's no time for an opening act ) .
" We 've been accused of being under - arranged .
We 've also been accused of noodling , " says Lesh .
" We make it different , make it new every night .
We never play the same licks or the same fills twice .
There is a set list -- more or less -- but Bobby , in particular , likes to stick things in . "
iReport.com : Spending time with Bob Weir poolside
The upcoming tour will feature mostly " Grateful Dead classics -- the things people like to hear , " he says , so expect performances of " Truckin ' , " " Casey Jones , " perhaps the band 's sole Top 10 hit , " Touch of Grey , " and maybe even the Holy Grail of Dead jams , " Dark Star . "
Presale tickets go on sale January 13 -- and even though sold - out shows have been a way of life for The Dead , Lesh is n't taking their fan base for granted .
" It 's rough times .
Of course it's an object of concern , " he says .
" All you can do is play the best music you can , and hope people can get out to hear it . "
iReport.com : Colorful tie - dyes and painted buses are never out of style
All The Dead 's members are in their 60s , with Lesh the elder statesman at 68 .
Two years ago , he underwent surgery for prostate cancer .
" I 'm pretty much recovered from that now .
I eat right , exercise and work out with weights three days a week , " he says .
He listens to jazz and classical music in his free time , and continues working on his side project , Phil Lesh and Friends .
Two of his musical " friends " are his sons , Brian , a student at Princeton , and Grahame , who will be graduating from Stanford this year .
Lesh hopes they 'll make a guest appearance when The Dead hits their town -- if it does n't interfere with their finals .

When The Dead announced this tour , Bob Weir released a statement .
" We 've got some unfinished business , " he said .
Lesh goes a step further .
" We 've got some unfinished music , " Lesh clarifies .
" We 're all still evolving in our own ways .
You can always improve your playing .
Let 's see what kind of a goulash we can make out of it .
Besides , " he adds , " I just got two new electric basses . "
All About Jerry Garcia • The Grateful Dead
Mr. Zell financed much of his deal ’s $ 13 billion of debt by borrowing against part of the future of his employees ’ pension plan and taking a huge tax advantage .
Tribune employees ended up with equity , and now they will probably be left with very little .
( The good news : any pension money put aside before the deal remains for the employees . )
As Mr. Newman , an analyst at CreditSights , explained at the time : “ If there is a problem with the company , most of the risk is on the employees , as Zell will not own Tribune shares . ”
He continued : “ The cash will come from the sweat equity of the employees of Tribune . ”
And so it is .
Granted , Mr. Zell , 67 , put up some money .
He invested $ 315 million in the form of subordinated debt in exchange for a warrant to buy 40 percent of Tribune in the future for $ 500 million .
It is unclear how much he ’ll lose , but one thing is clear : when creditors get in line , he gets to stand ahead of the employees .
Mr. Zell is n’t the only one responsible for this debacle .
With one of the grand old names of American journalism now confronting an uncertain future , it is worth remembering all the people who mismanaged the company beforehand and helped orchestrate this ill - fated deal  and made a lot of money in the process .
They include members of the Tribune board , the company ’s management and the bankers who walked away with millions of dollars for financing and advising on a transaction that many of them knew , or should have known , could end in ruin .
It was Tribune ’s board that sold the company to Mr. Zell  and allowed him to use the employee ’s pension plan to do so .
Despite early resistance , Dennis J. FitzSimons , then the company ’s chief executive , backed the plan .
He was paid about $ 17.7 million in severance and other payments .
The sale also bought all the shares he owned  $ 23.8 million worth .
The day he left , he said in a note to employees that “ completing this ‘ going private ’ transaction is a great outcome for our shareholders , employees and customers . ”
“ you have freckles on your ears , ” i said .
“ i’m so glad i know that vital information now , ” you replied .
“ but you could have gone through your whole life not knowing .
you ca n’t see your own ears . ”
“ i could have looked in a mirror .
or taken a picture . ”
“ but would you have ?
would you even have wondered ? ”
“ probably not . ”
“ but now you know .
now you know a little bit more about yourself . ”
“ well .. thank you . ”
and that ’s when we kissed .

A deep - seated global crisis is often a chance to redraw the map , reflecting shifts in the balance of power in different ways .
First , the crisis can confirm or nudge ahead trends which seem to be happening anyway - like the shift of power from Western to emerging Eastern players .
Second , it can put flesh on reforms already in the air - like plans to overhaul the international financial architecture to be discussed at this weekend 's summit being hosted by President Bush in Washington .
China is the latest large economy to announce an economic stimulus plan
And third , there are the instinctive emergency reactions , supposedly temporary , but which can end up reshaping the global chessboard for years to come - the hurried nationalisation of some Western banks , for instance , or possibly Iceland 's desperate bailout appeal to Russia - a Nato member putting financial survival ahead of any security provisos .
Of course to draw firm conclusions at this point , with the economic crisis far from over , is a risky venture .
But some patterns merit closer examination .
First , is the balance of power in the world really shifting eastwards ?
It is a question that has been the subject of much debate recently on the discussion programme The Forum which I host for the BBC World Service .
My guests ' general conclusion seems to be that , yes , Asia is on the rise , and the economic woes of the US and Europe have exposed the fragility of Western banking and the vulnerability of Western economies .
China and India have been less affected .
And , even if demand for Chinese goods slows , its mammoth economy can still be a powerful engine of growth and a much needed source of liquidity .
Russian nerves
And yet , in a world so interdependent economically , can any part be immune ?
Especially given the symbiotic relationship between China and the United States - " Chimerica " as the Harvard historian Niall Ferguson calls it : not two financial systems , but one .
Economists including JM Keynes negotiate the Bretton Woods Agreements
In these terms , surely if the American and other Western economies have succumbed to a chronic bout of sneezing , flu for China and rest of world is inescapable ?
Moreover , perhaps we should not overstate the resilience of emerging economies .
Look no further than Moscow , where the stock market panic and flight of capital abroad have been dramatic , and the fall in world oil prices has added to the economy 's battering .
Despite Russia 's legendary energy wealth , there is a new nervous uncertainty among local businessmen who - one suspects - know more than most about the way the domestic economy remains weakened by corruption and a labyrinthine smoke - and - mirrors way of doing business .
A second question worth pondering - just how likely is it that this weekend 's top - level meeting really will generate reform of the world 's leading financial institutions ?
Bridget Kendall 1998 to present : BBC diplomatic correspondent 1994 - 98 : Washington correspondent 1989 - 94 : Moscow correspondent
More about Bridget
There is grand talk of a ' Bretton Woods Two ' , a vision for a new financial system pushed for some time by , among others , Britain 's Gordon Brown .
True , there is broad agreement on an agenda to seek ways to forestall a global recession , devise an early warning system and consider more international regulation .
But the leaders from 20 of the world 's largest economies bring to the table a variety of conflicting interests , some motivated by practical need , others by ideological considerations , some looking for short term fixes - the move from private to state control of banks for instance - which others view as a desirable long term objective .
Top table reform
So is major reform feasible ?
Is the current economic crisis cataclysmic enough yet to be truly transformational ?
The Europeans say they are united in a call for global financial governance and greater transparency .
The United States has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
Why should this be any different ?
But a rift has opened up between those like the French President , Nicolas Sarkozy , who seek permanent global oversight of financial transactions , and wary Anglo - Saxon governments - including above all the US administration - which fear that too much control could hamper the workings of the free market .
And even if that hurdle is surmounted , could any US president , even one enjoying such goodwill as President - elect Barack Obama , win Congressional backing for a toothy regulatory body that would have real oversight of US institutions ?
Whether the issue is international crimes against humanity or attempts to regulate carbon emissions , the United States has been famously reluctant to accept any authority but its own .
Why should this be any different ?
Russian President Medvedev blames American policies for the current crisis Meanwhile , the powerhouse nations of the so - called BRIC group - Brazil , Russia , India and China - and the petro-states of the Gulf ( armed with the bargaining chip of sovereign wealth funds ) have made it clear that what they want is recognition that the old elite clubs dominated by Western nations no longer reflect reality .
Logic would suggest this means reform of the top tables not just at the IMF and the World Bank , but an enlargement of the G8 ( Group of Eight most industrialised countries ) , and the United Nations Security Council .
Fine in theory .
But in practice Reforming the G8 is probably easiest .
Already the annual summit opens its doors to other players .
And the 2009 host , Italy 's Silvio Berlusconi , has made it known he intends to invite the G20 countries to his G8 Sardinia party .
But the weary process of reform at the UN has left many jaundiced .
It is hard to imagine the mechanism which would require current global powers to agree to anything but a symbolic change .
The Bretton Woods Agreements Agreed in July 1944 , but not all of them operative until 1959 Creation of the IMF and IBRD ( now part of World Bank ) Encouraged open markets Obligation to maintain currency exchange rates within fixed values ( to +/- 1 % ) Likewise at the World Bank and the IMF , the hard bargaining will revolve not just around which new countries get seats on the board , but whether they will be allowed to upset the current balance of power when it comes to decision - making .
Note that already there are voices warning that too many players will make any new arrangement dysfunctional .
There are other complications .
Russia continues to agitate for any adjustment that will lessen US influence , whether in financial or European security matters .
No doubt President Medvedev will want to repeat his and Mr Putin 's belief that the root cause of the current financial crisis lies in American unilateralism following the end of the Cold War and the 9/11 terrorist attacks - an ideological argument that may irritate rather than persuade and make consensus even harder to achieve .
Safety in numbers
And a third area of examination - what do the emergency reactions to the financial crisis so far tell us about the way the world may be heading ?
Reactions seem to boil down to a choice of two - whether to conclude that in times of trouble safety lies in numbers and it is better to be part of a bigger bloc , or whether when the going gets hard , it is better to look after your own - the protectionist , nationalist instinct .
Certainly some people seem to be concluding that size is the best security against future risk .
In beleaguered Iceland , where six months ago opinion suggested a majority were against EU membership , those in favour of throwing their lot in with the EU has crept above 50 % .
A similar trend in Scandinavia is leading the governments in Denmark and possibly Sweden to wonder if they should think again about offering a referendum on joining the Euro .
In global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have - nots ?
And in Scotland , too , recent polls have suggested support for the Scottish Nationalist Party 's vision of independence has lost ground .
Going it alone , it seems , no longer looks so attractive in the wake of a financial crisis .
But at the same time , EU cohesiveness has taken a knocking .
Despite early declarations of EU economic solidarity , it did n't take long for Ireland to break ranks and offer a unilateral guarantee to depositors to forestall a run on its banks , or for Germany to hint it would take similar action .
And disorderly EU bickering ahead of the Washington summit has rather belied claims of European unity .
And in global terms , perhaps the biggest worry of all must be what will a financial downturn mean for the world 's have - nots ?
Fears for poor
For all the high hopes of turning this crisis to advantage , to push through reforms that otherwise would never have been contemplated , there is a danger it could pivot in the opposite direction .
And if this crisis ushers in greater protectionism , it could mean an end to an era of generosity and less concern for the welfare of others .
For the last decade it has been the very poor who have dominated the agenda of the World Bank and the IMF .
Not any more .
In the last two months , it has been Iceland , Hungary , Ukraine and Pakistan knocking at the IMF door .
Already the UN Secretary General , Ban Ki-Moon , has sounded the alarm that his ambitious UN Millennium goals to slash poverty , illiteracy and disease run the risk of being neglected .
This could ' threaten to undermine all our achievements ' he said recently .
Just this week the World Food Programme warned it was having to cut food aid to impoverished Zimbabweans due to a lack of international donations .
A harbinger of things to come , perhaps .
And there is a broader implication - that it may become increasingly difficult to persuade nations to sign up for large - scale interventions to help the desperate and the victimised .
If a global recession cannot be avoided , the United Nations ' much vaunted " responsibility to protect " , only recently enacted , may end up already becoming an outdated aspiration .

Your comments :
The crisis will have low or any impact on international relations .
The governments have to stop pushing money into the banking system immediately and use it to support companies ( not financial ) and create new workplaces
Ervin , Brno , Czech republic Subsidies will end for the developed world .
Developing countries produce will be marketable in those developed countries .
The farmers in developed countries will be discouraged and will shunt farming due to poor returns .
Developing countries , especially African economies will prosper .
Developed countries ' exports will diminish in sales volumes to developing countries .
Availability of cheap raw materials for the bug economies will decrease .
Elphas Moni , Kampala , Uganda
I have been having a feeling lately that the current financial crisis is just another one off event and the situation will normalise soon .
The countries bickering about the US influence seem to be taking advantage of its current financial failings - which is a rather ill fated short term proposition .
More emphasis should be concentrated on what led to the current situation , .i.e. lavish credit from banks , ' cooked books ' from financial institutions etc ...
The Chinese , though not there yet , have shown that we can regulate capitalism to the good of everyone .
But all in all the financial crisis is over hyped and it will therefore have negligible effect on the balance of power .
Charles Lukwago , Kampala , Uganda
This is regarding a new Multipolar World Order

Let 's hope this trend signals the end of the dominance of the Illuminati in Europe and the US !
Maurice , Paris , France
The financial crisis will affect international relations positively .
As the famous saying goes , adversity is a blessing in disguise .
The great financial crisis is serving as an eye opener to those who assumed that without investing in sustainable growth pre-requisites , profits can be harnessed forever .
They are being proved wrong .
Madan Gopal Sharma , Olten , Switzerland
Your article is very interesting , focusing on the materialistic aspects of life ( money , power , control etc ) but it leaves out the more important aspect of humanity , its spiritual reality ( compassion , justice , ethic , respect , truthfulness and many more .... ) .
There definitely needs to be a balance between the material and spiritual , otherwise civilisation as we are experiencing it in these days , will be doomed ... as happened to great civilisations of past ages .
Paula van den Boogaart , Nuernberg , Germany I would like to see more G - 20 Than G - 7 , or 8's .
Also , more countries involved in the decisions of the planet , after all we are in this together .
The less government involvement in a free market , the better off the free market is , take the pain .
David Eaton , Las Vegas , USA
I think that balance of powers will tend to eastern nations but it is a matter of time ( we do not know how many time ) that that balance tends back to western nations again .
I think all nations should work together without thinking about particular interests like the USA and China , that consume lots of fossil fuel .
Rising nations like Brazil and India must be considered in all these international discussions about the economy etc .
Gustavo Pontello , Araraquara , Brazil
The financial crisis has shaken many countries in the last few weeks , it has opened the eyes of the world on how the financial system was structured over the last 50 years .
The fall of the US economy and its domino effect on the rest of the world has proven one thing : the system was created to basically support them .
Now , the leaders of the world 's biggest economy should learn to define the meaning of " balance " in this world .
They must set clear parameters to define how we can all affect each other .
Mark Carbungco , Jakarta , Indonesia Clearly there cannot be economic cooperation while Politically there is so much sparring going on .
The most basic and essential step is for the US to stop entertaining this ridiculous idea that it is some kind of Global Superpower which has to control the world .
Accordingly , Obama 's first task is to unwind all the lunatic strategies Bush embarked on - starting with abandoning plans to install missile shields in Poland ( clearly a breach of the non-proliferation pact and sure to restart cold war activities ) .
Russia should and would respond by toning down their own military enhancements .
This will help improve economic cooperation and free up some funds for more constructive purposes .
Peter , Townsville , Australia I think the world blames the financial collapse on the U.S. , and for good reason .
We sold out our industrial base and the only thing we have left to export is debt .
Now we are broke with no hope of recovery because we no longer produce or save .
An economy based on debt and consumption is UNSUSTAINABLE .
The " free trade " and globalist movement has been the biggest rip - off in world history , and the U.S. will default on the behemoth debt owed to China , Russia , and the Arabs .
The only ones benefitting from this whole mess are the criminal banker - elites who are looting our treasury for " bailouts " .
The American people are not blameless , however .
We lived beyond our means and allowed our governing officials to run wild with their corporate partners in crime .
After all , we were too busy with soccer games and trips to the mall to mind the " For the people , by the people " store .
America will be reduced to 3rd - world ashes by 2012 without a single shot ever needing to be fired .
Ann Minch , Red Bluff , CA ( USA ) Great article except for the absence of any reference to Japan .
This is strange on 3 counts .
First , it is the second biggest economy in the world - how can you possibly discuss the global economy without reference to it ?
Second , to support your argument I would have thought Japan`s own rise post WW2 already suggested the movement away from west towards east long before China .
Third , given Japan`s own financial sector woes in 1990 I thought this would be a good moot point for global discussion as to solving current crisis .
Nicholas Cunningham , Australia
What should Governments of developed countries do ?
1 . Acknowledge that macroeconomic frameworks can be sustained only on strong foundations of microeconomic efficiencies .
The genesis of the present crisis is that financial superstructure has moved too far away from the real sectors of the economy .
2 . Set good examples of fiscal prudence ; current expenditures must be contained within current revenues ; only capital expenditures should be used to inflate or deflate the economy .
3 . Realise that " trickle down " strategies have failed miserably ; must work out stimulus packages that will work bottom up .
For a start , each of the citizens should be given a ' basic grant ' fixed at half the poverty level .
Sastry Kambhampati , Hyderabad , India Re : World Food Programme and Zimbabwe -
Does this seem feasible : instead of shipping food ( and money ) from the West to feed impoverished Zimbabweans , to actually have the UN set up large scale farming on land garnered from the white farmers ?
The land remains Zimbabwean and in time the management of these farms can revert to the locals .
Martin Peros , Toronto , Canada
We like it or not capitalism and free - enterprise is the only successful economic system we have and free world trade is the only vehicle to achieve universal wealth .
The system is obviously not perfect but the best we 've got and the result of centuries of trial and error socio- economic evolution not the creation of any human mind .
Our economy is far too complex and changing for any human mind or minds to embrace it , much less to predict and control it .
One more proof of this is watching the spectacle of world bureaucrats trying desperately to stop the crisis with little or no results .
Nobody knows the solutions because nobody can understand the complexities of the rapidly evolving economic reality .
Lucas Antuna , San Pedro , Paraguay I think we need to head towards ' Total Socialism ' for all countries -
What we extract from the grounds of poor nations should go mainly to their wealth , health and happiness and not to shareholders - Hospitals and infrastructure should be all ' State Owned ' and non profiting - All land should be state owned and state controlled and leased and never used as an asset or passed on to relatives .

Martin Luther King Day in 2009 precedes the dawn of the historic inauguration of America 's first African American President .
This inauguration is hailed as the realization of Dr. King 's dream , a defining moment in the cultural paradigm , a tectonic shift in race relations and a beacon of real change for the plight of the poor and oppressed .
Infusing the dreams and ethos of Dr. King in to the presidential persona demands a confluence of ideals and actions to truly deserve the association .
To betray the dream , to profit from the sacrifice is to insult the legacy .
To be worthy of the torch demands integrity .
“ Somehow this madness must cease .
We must stop now .
I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam .
I speak for those whose land is being laid waste , whose homes are being destroyed , whose culture is being subverted .
I speak for the poor in America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam .
I speak as a citizen of the world , for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken .
I speak as an American to the leaders of my own nation .
The great initiative in this war is ours .
The initiative to stop it must be ours . ”
This speech by Dr.Martin Luther King in 1967 is as poignant today as it was back then .
The names change but the nightmare remains the same .
Today 's Iraq and Afghanistan replace yesterday 's Vietnam .
Today 's increased level of poverty and imprisonment of a hugely disproportionate number of African Americans in the prison system , the slaughter of millions more of the world 's poor and Dr. King 's subsequent murder at the hands of his own government bear witness to exactly which initiative was taken .
President - Elect Barack Obama , in his speeches , expresses his desire to inculcate the ideals of Dr. King in to his decision making and his attitude to his fellow human beings .
He “ chokes up ” repeating the words of this Man of Peace , but he 'll “ hold it together ” on Inauguration day .
He 'll make America , in Dr. King 's words “ a land no longer torn asunder with racial hatred and ethnic strife , a land that measured itself by how it treats the least of these , a land in which strength is defined not simply by the capacity to wage war but by the determination to forge peace – a land in which all of God 's children might come together in a spirit of brotherhood . ”
He stands silent as his country aids in the genocide of the Palestinians .
He will forge peace by sending 30,000 American troops to Afghanistan to intensify the massacre that has left nearly 6,500 of his civilian brothers and sisters dead ( as of September , 2007 ) .
He stands silent on the more than 98,000 of his civilian brothers and sisters who have been murdered in Iraq .
He threatens War against Iran , Syria and already destroyed Lebanon .
He remains silent on the murder of his brother Oscar Grant III by police officer Johannes Mehserle in California .
He perpetuates what Dr. King called “ a nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift ” .
“ Many of the ugly pages of American history have been obscured and forgotten … .
America owes a debt of justice which it has only begun to pay .
If it loses the will to finish or slackens in its determination , history will recall its crimes and the country that would be great will lack the most indispensable element of greatness –justice ” Dr. Martin Luther King , 1967 .
The President - Elect refuses to bring George Bush , Dick Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , Henry Kissinger and the rest of the War criminals to justice as he looks forward from the mountain top and points the way to spiritual death .
Would Dr. King , if he held public office , have voted for invading Iraq , invading Afghanistan , sending arms and money to Israel and would he remain silent as his poverty stricken brothers and sisters were slaughtered ?
The words of Martin Luther King have been hijacked by those would would use his message to further their own narcissistic goals .
His peaceful supplication has been betrayed by lies and a sickening adulation of meaningless oratory .
His greatest statements of love and humanity have been relegated to sound bites for mass consumption by a deceived public who have put their faith in a man who represents all that Dr. King was fighting peacefully against .
The myth of Israel ’s strategic genius
Many supporters of Israel will not criticize its behavior , even when it is engaged in brutal and misguided operations like the recent onslaught on Gaza .
In addition to their understandable reluctance to say anything that might aid Israel ’s enemies , this tendency is based in part on the belief that Israel ’s political and military leaders are exceptionally smart and thoughtful strategists who understand their threat environment and have a history of success against their adversaries .
If so , then it makes little sense for outsiders to second - guess them .
This image of Israeli strategic genius has been nurtured by Israelis over the years and seems to be an article of faith among neoconservatives and other hardline supporters of Israel in the United States .
It also fits nicely with the wrongheaded but still popular image of Israel as the perennial David facing a looming Arab Goliath ; in this view , only brilliant strategic thinkers could have consistently overcome the supposedly formidable Arab forces arrayed against them .
The idea that Israelis possess some unique strategic acumen undoubtedly reflects a number of past military exploits , including the decisive victories in the 1948 War of Independence , the rapid conquest of the Sinai in 1956 , the daredevil capture of Adolf Eichmann in 1960 , the stunning Israeli triumph at the beginning of the 1967 Six Day War , and the intrepid hostage rescue at Entebbe in 1976 .
These tactical achievements are part of a larger picture , however , and that picture is not a pretty one .
Israel has also lost several wars in the past — none of them decisively , of course — and its ability to use force to achieve larger strategic objectives has declined significantly over time .
This is why Israelis frequently speak of the need to restore their “ deterrent ” ; they are aware that occasional tactical successes have not led to long - term improvements in their overall security situation .
The assault on Gaza is merely the latest illustration of this worrisome tendency .
What does the record show ?
Back in 1956 , Israel , along with Britain and France , came up with a harebrained scheme to seize the Suez Canal and topple Nasser ’s regime in Egypt .
( This was after an Israeli raid on an Egyptian army camp in Gaza helped convince Nasser to obtain arms from the Soviet Union ) .
Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion initially hoped that Israel would be allowed to conquer and absorb the West Bank , parts of the Sinai , and portions of Lebanon , but Britain and France quickly scotched that idea .
The subsequent attack was a military success but a strategic failure : the invaders were forced to disgorge the lands they seized while Nasser ’s prestige soared at home and across the Arab world , fueling radicalism and intensifying anti-Israel sentiments throughout the region .
The episode led Ben-Gurion to conclude that Israel should forego additional attempts to expand its borders — which is why he opposed taking the West Bank in 1967 — but his successors did not follow his wise advice .
Ten years later , Israel ’s aggressive policies toward Syria and Jordan helped precipitate the crisis that led to the Six Day War .
The governments of Egypt , Syria , the USSR and the United States also bear considerable blame for that war , though it was Israel ’s leaders who chose to start it , even though they recognized that their Arab foes knew they were no match for the IDF and did not intend to attack Israel .
More importantly , after seizing the West Bank , Golan Heights and Gaza Strip during the war , Israeli leaders decided to start building settlements and eventually incorporate them into a “ greater Israel . ”
Thus , 1967 marks the beginning of Israel ’s settlements project , a decision that even someone as sympathetic to Israel as Leon Wieseltier has described as “ a moral and strategic blunder of historic proportions . ”
Remarkably , this momentous decision was never openly debated within the Israeli body politic .
With Israeli forces occupying the Sinai peninsula , Egypt launched the so - called War of Attrition in October 1968 in an attempt to get it back .
The result was a draw on the battlefield and the two sides eventually reached a ceasefire agreement in August 1970 .
The war was a strategic setback for Israel , however , because Egypt and its Soviet patron used the ceasefire to complete a missile shield along the Suez Canal that could protect Egyptian troops if they attacked across the Canal to regain the Sinai .
American and Israeli leaders did not recognize this important shift in the balance of power between Israel and Egypt and remained convinced that Egypt had no military options .
As a result , they ignored Egyptian President Anwar Sadat ’s peace overtures and left him little choice but to use force to try to dislodge Israel from the Sinai .
Israel then failed to detect Egypt and Syria ’s mobilization in early October 1973 and fell victim to one of the most successful surprise attacks in military history .
The IDF eventually rallied and triumphed , but the costs were high in a war that might easily have been avoided .
Israel ’s next major misstep was the 1982 invasion of Lebanon .
The invasion was the brainchild of hawkish Defense Minister Ariel Sharon , who had concocted a grandiose scheme to destroy the PLO and gain a free hand to incorporate the West Bank in “ Greater Israel ” and turn Jordan into “ the ” Palestinian state .
It was a colossal strategic blunder : the PLO leadership escaped destruction and Israel ’s bombardment of Beirut and its complicity in the massacres at Sabra and Shatila were widely and rightly condemned .
And after initially being greeted as liberators by the Shiite population of southern Lebanon , Israel ’s prolonged and heavy - handed occupation helped create Hezbollah , which soon became a formidable adversary as well as an avenue for Iranian influence on Israel ’s northern border .
Israel was unable to defeat Hezbollah and eventually withdrew its troops from Lebanon in 2000 , having in effect been driven out by Hezbollah ’s increasingly effective resistance .
Invading Lebanon not only failed to solve Israel ’s problem with the Palestinians , it created a new enemy that still bedevils Israel today .
In the late 1980s , Israel helped nurture Hamas — yes , the same organization that the IDF is bent on destroying today — as part of its long - standing effort to undermine Yasser Arafat and Fatah and keep the Palestinians divided .
This decision backfired too , because Arafat eventually recognized Israel and agreed to negotiate a two - state solution , while Hamas emerged as a new and dangerous adversary that has refused to recognize Israel ’s existence and to live in peace with the Jewish state .
The signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 offered an unprecedented chance to end the Israeli - Palestinian conflict once and for all , but Israel ’s leaders failed to seize the moment .
Prime Ministers Yitzhak Rabin , Shimon Peres , and Benjamin Netanyahu all refused to endorse the idea of a Palestinian state — even Rabin never spoke publicly about allowing the Palestinians to have a state of their own — and Ehud Barak ’s belated offer of statehood at the 2000 Camp David summit did not go far enough .
As Barak ’s own foreign minister , Shlomo Ben - Ami , later admitted , “ if I were a Palestinian , I would have rejected Camp David as well . ”
Meanwhile , the number of settlers in the West Bank doubled during the Oslo period ( 1993 - 2001 ) , and the Israelis built some 250 miles of connector roads in the West Bank .
Palestinian leaders and U.S. officials made their own contributions to Oslo ’s failure , but Israel had clearly squandered what was probably the best opportunity it will ever have to negotiate a peace agreement with the Palestinians .
Barak also derailed a peace treaty with Syria in early 2000 that appeared to be a done deal , at least to President Bill Clinton , who had helped fashion it .
But when public opinion polls suggested that the Israeli public might not support the deal , the Israeli Prime Minister got cold feet and the talks collapsed .
More recently , U.S. and Israeli miscalculations have gone hand - in - hand .
In the wake of September 11 , neoconservatives in the United States , who had been pushing for war against Iraq since early 1998 , helped convince President Bush to attack Iraq as part of a larger strategy of “ regional transformation . ”
Israeli officials were initially opposed to this scheme because they wanted Washington to go after Iran instead , but once they understood that Iran and Syria were next on the administration ’s hit list they backed the plan enthusiastically .
Indeed , prominent Israelis like Ehud Barak , Benjamin Netanyahu , and then - Foreign Minister Shimon Peres helped sell the war in the United States , while Prime Minister Sharon and his chief aides put pressure on Washington to make sure that Bush did n’t lose his nerve and leave Saddam standing .
The result ?
A costly quagmire for the United States and a dramatic improvement in Iran ’s strategic position .
Needless to say , these developments were hardly in Israel ’s strategic interest .
The next failed effort was then - Prime Minister Sharon ’s decision to unilaterally withdraw all of Israel ’s settlers from the Gaza Strip in August 2005 .
Although Israel and its supporters in the West portrayed this move as a gesture towards peace , “ unilateralism ” was in fact part of a larger effort to derail the so - called Road Map , freeze the peace process , and consolidate Israeli control over the West Bank , thereby putting off the prospect of a Palestinian state “ indefinitely . ”
The withdrawal was completed successfully , but Sharon ’s attempt to impose peace terms on the Palestinians failed completely .
Fenced in by the Israelis , the Palestinians in Gaza began firing rockets and mortars at nearby Israeli towns and then Hamas won the Palestinian legislative elections in January 2006 .
This event reflected its growing popularity in the face of Fatah ’s corruption and Israel ’s continued occupation of the West Bank , but Jerusalem and Washington refused to accept the election results and decided instead to try to topple Hamas .
This was yet another error : Hamas eventually ousted Fatah from Gaza and its popularity has continued to increase .
The Lebanon War in the summer of 2006 revealed the deficiencies of Israel ’s strategic thinking with particular clarity .
A cross-border raid by Hezbollah provoked an Israeli offensive intended to destroy Hezbollah ’s large missile inventory and compel the Lebanese government to crack down on Hezbollah itself .
However worthy these goals might have been , Israel ’s strategy was doomed to fail .
Air strikes could not eliminate Hezbollah ’s large and well - hidden arsenal and bombing civilian areas in Lebanon merely generated more anger at Israel and raised Hezbollah ’s standing among the Lebanese population and in the Arab and Islamic world as well .
Nor could a belated ground attack fix the problem , as the IDF could hardly accomplish in a few weeks what it had failed to do between 1982 and 2000 .
Plus , the Israeli offensive was poorly planned and poorly executed .
It was equally foolish to think that Lebanon ’s fragile central government could rein in Hezbollah ; if that were possible , the governing authorities in Beirut would have done so long before .
It is no surprise that the Winograd Commission ( an official panel of inquiry established to examine Israel ’s handling of the war ) harshly criticized Israel ’s leaders for their various strategic errors .
Finally , a similar strategic myopia is apparent in the assault on Gaza .
Israeli leaders initially said that their goal was to inflict enough damage on Hamas so it could no longer threaten Israel with rocket attacks .
But they now concede that Hamas will neither be destroyed nor disarmed by their attacks , and instead say that more extensive monitoring will prevent rocket parts and other weapons from being smuggled into Gaza .
This is a vain hope , however .
As I write this , Hamas has not accepted a ceasefire and is still firing rockets ; even if it does accept a ceasefire soon , rocket and mortar fire are bound to resume at some point in the future .
On top of that , Israel ’s international image has taken a drubbing , Hamas is probably more popular , and moderate leaders like Mahmoud Abbas have been badly discredited .
A two - state solution — which is essential if Israel wishes to remain Jewish and democratic and to avoid becoming an apartheid state — is farther away than ever .
The IDF performed better in Gaza than it did in Lebanon , largely because Hamas is a less formidable foe than Hezbollah .
But this does not matter : the war against Hamas is still a strategic failure .
And to have inflicted such carnage on the Palestinians for no lasting strategic gain is especially reprehensible .
In virtually all of these episodes — and especially those after 1982 — Israel ’s superior military power was used in ways that did not improve its long - term strategic position .
Given this dismal record , therefore , there is no reason to think that Israel possesses uniquely gifted strategists or a national security establishment that consistently makes smart and far - sighted choices .
Indeed , what is perhaps most remarkable about Israel is how often the architects of these disasters — Barak , Olmert , Sharon , and maybe Netanyahu — are not banished from leadership roles but instead are given another opportunity to repeat their mistakes .
Where is the accountability in the Israeli political system ?
No country is immune from folly , of course , and Israel ’s adversaries have committed plenty of reprehensible acts and made plenty of mistakes themselves .
Egypt ’s Nasser played with fire in 1967 and got badly burnt ; King Hussein ’s decision to enter the Six Day War was a catastrophic blunder that cost Jordan the West Bank and East Jerusalem , and Palestinian leaders badly miscalculated and committed unjustifiable and brutal acts on numerous occasions .
Americans made grave mistakes in Vietnam and more recently in Iraq , the French blundered in Indochina and Algeria , the British failed at Suez and Gallipoli , and the Soviets lost badly in Afghanistan .
Israel is no different than most powerful states in this regard : sometimes it does things that are admirable and wise , and at other times it pursues policies that are foolish and cruel .
The moral of this story is that there is no reason to think that Israel always has well - conceived strategies for dealing with the problems that it faces .
In fact , Israel ’s strategic judgment seems to have declined steadily since the 1970s — beginning with the 1982 invasion of Lebanon — perhaps because unconditional U.S. support has helped insulate Israel from some of the costs of its actions and made it easier for Israel to indulge strategic illusions and ideological pipe - dreams .
Given this reality , there is no reason for Israel ’s friends — both Jewish and gentile — to remain silent when it decides to pursue a foolish policy .
And given that our “ special relationship ” with Israel means that the United States is invariably associated with Jerusalem ’s actions , Americans should not hesitate to raise their voices to criticize Israel when it is acting in ways that are not in the U.S. national interest .
Those who refuse to criticize Israel even when it acts foolishly surely think they are helping the Jewish state .
They are wrong .
In fact , they are false friends , because their silence , or worse , their cheerleading , merely encourages Israel to continue potentially disastrous courses of action .
Israel could use some honest advice these days , and it would make eminently good sense if its closest ally were able to provide it .
Ideally , this advice would come from the president , the secretary of state , and prominent members of Congress — speaking as openly as some politicians in other democracies do .
But that ’s unlikely to happen , because Israel ’s supporters make it almost impossible for Washington to do anything but reflexively back Israel ’s actions , whether they make sense or not .
And they often do not these days .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Home prices posted another record decline in October , falling 18 % compared with a year earlier , according to a closely watched report released Tuesday .
The 20 - city S&P Case - Shiller index has posted losses for a staggering 27 months in a row .
In October , 14 of the 20 cities set fresh price decline records .
" The bear market continues ; home prices are back to their March 2004 levels , " says David Blitzer , Chairman of the Index Committee at Standard & Poor's .
Sunbelt cities suffered the most , but most of the country is watching home values fall .
Home prices in Phoenix , Las Vegas and San Francisco all fell more than 30 % on a year - over - year basis .
Miami , Los Angeles and San Diego recorded year - over - year declines of 29 % , 28 % and 27 % , respectively .
" As of October 2008 , the 20 - City Composite is down 23.4 % , " said Blitzer .
" In October , we also saw three new markets enter the ' double - digit ' club . "
Atlanta , Seattle and Portland each reported annual rates of decline of about 10 % .
" While not yet experiencing as severe a contraction as in the Sunbelt , it seems the Pacific Northwest and Mid-Atlantic South is not immune to the overall demise in the housing market , " Blitzer added .
Deteriorating environment
Many of the factors affecting home prices turned strongly negative this fall , according to Blitzer .
" October was really the first month to feel the full brunt of the credit crunch , " he said .
" Up until the Lehman Brothers [ bankruptcy filing on September 15 ] , everyone felt relatively optimistic . "
Plus , in many of the free - falling cities the majority of real estate sales consist of distressed properties such as foreclosed homes and short sales .
These houses tend to sell at a steep discount to the rest of the market , and when they account for a large proportion of all sales , they can exaggerate the depth of price declines .
Of course , foreclosures continue to be a big problem as well .
In October alone , nearly 85,000 people lost their homes to foreclosure , adding vacant inventory to an already overburdened market .
Home sellers should not expect prices to improve any time soon , according to Pat Newport , a real estate analyst for IHS Global Insight .
" I expect it 's going to get quite a bit worse over the next couple of months , " he said .
" Existing home sales reports have really been bad . "
Home sales fell 8.6 % in November , much more than expected , to an annualized rate of 4.49 million units according to the National Association of Realtors .
And although interest rates are currently extremely low - the 30 - year fixed - rate averaged 5.14 % during the week of December 24 , according to mortgage giant Freddie Mac ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) - that 's doing more to help people refinancing existing mortgages than it is to help new home buyers .
" Buyers still have to have a 20 % down payment , " said Newport , " and , in this environment , it can be hard to meet that criteria . "
The latest Case - Shiller numbers provide more ammunition to Washington policy makers who want to do more to fix the housing mess , according to Jaret Seiberg , an analyst with the Stanford Group , the policy research firm .
" These data just add to the tremendous pressure on the president - elect and the Democrats to stimulate housing , " he said .
" That means more lucrative tax incentives and broad foreclosure prevention .
All of this will likely be in the stimulus plan that Congress adopts in January . "
Nicholas Retsinas , Director of Harvard University 's Joint Center for Housing Studies , agrees .
" Housing problems are at the core of our economic problems , " he said , " yet , of the government interventions made during 2008 , few were focused on housing . "
With a new administration and Congress in place next month , he expects to see a renewed interest in stabilizing the housing market .
Over at i09 , Annalee Newitz blogs about Lewis Casey , a Saskatchewan college student who built a home chemistry lab and was arrested by police who thought he was brewing meth .
A few days later , the police realized that the chemistry major was n't manufacturing drugs but kept him in the clink anyway because the lab could allegedly be used for making bombs .
From i09 :
On December 24 , Casey was finally released into his parents ' custody , pending a trial to determine whether he was building what police called " improvised explosive devices . "
Yesterday Casey 's lawyer told local journalists :
My client is a very intelligent young man . . . he 's very keen in chemistry , a very curious young person and very capable , very knowledgeable in the area and he was always curious with regard to chemistry , chemical compounds , chemical reactions , that kind of thing .
So from my client 's point of view , it 's completely innocent insofar as he had no intention of creating any explosives or explosive devices .
As people probably know , anything in your house can constitute or be used in chemical or explosive devices , including sugar and cleaning compounds , Mr. Clean , bleach , detergents , all those sorts of things .

Group : Israel deliberately attacked Palestinian journalists RAW STORY
Published : Monday January 5 , 2009
Print This Email This GENEVA ( AFP )  Israel deliberately targeted Hamas - run media installations in its bombing campaign on Gaza and is practising media censorship , a journalist rights group said Monday .
The installations in question include Al - Aqsa television , Al - Resalah newspaper and Sawt Al - Aqsa radio , which the Israeli army bombed on December 28 and over the weekend respectively , the Geneva - based Press Emblem Campaign said in a statement , citing a Palestinian media non-governmental group .
The press group , which fights for better protection of journalists in conflict zones , also condemned the recent deaths of two journalists as a result of Israeli attacks .
" Two Palestinian journalists were killed one in previous attacks by Israel , photographer Hamza Shahin , who died on 26 December 2008 , and another during the current military round on 3 January , Omar Silawi .
" The current attacks against Palestinian journalists remind the media community of the attacks that were committed by Israel against Lebanese media in the July - August war 2006 , " the press group said , referring to the conflict between Israel and Lebanon 's Hezbollah militia .
It called for Israel to allow non-Palestinian media access to Gaza and denounced the military censorship it said journalists were subjected to in Israel " which questions their ability to cover objectively the conflict from the Israeli side . "
The Geneva group called for an independent international probe to look into alleged rights violations during the conflict .
Aid agencies have been warning of a severe humanitarian crisis Israel has halted military operations in Gaza for three hours in the first of what it says will be a daily ceasefire .
An Israeli spokesman said it would allow Gazans to " get medical attention , get supplies ... whatever they need " .
Correspondents say it is unclear if the suspension covers all of Gaza .
Fighting resumed shortly after 1400GMT , eyewitnesses said .
Israel 's move came as pressure built on it and the Palestinian militant group Hamas to accept a ceasefire deal .
The plan , backed by the UN and the US and proposed by Egypt and France , calls for an immediate ceasefire .
Israel 's security cabinet is meeting to consider the deal , but ministers are also expected to discuss expanding operations in Gaza .
In a statement released on Wednesday , France 's President Nicolas Sarkozy said he welcomed what he described as " the acceptance by Israel and the Palestinian Authority " of the French - Egyptian ceasefire plan .
The statement did not mention Hamas .
A senior Hamas official told the BBC that there were " positive signs but no agreement yet " .
Israel said it " welcomes " the initiative but that talks were continuing on the details of the proposal .
An official told the BBC : " We are still having a dialogue .
We have agreement on the principles .
The challenge now is to get the details to match the principles . "
Israel was not sure how long the diplomatic process would take and would need a working arms embargo on Hamas , the official said .
Blockade Israel 's military said the three - hour pause in operations to create " humanitarian corridors " for supplies and fuel would happen every day .

In pictures : Gaza conflict continues A Hamas spokesman told Al Arabiya television that the group would not launch any missiles at Israeli targets during the lull .
Israel has been criticised by aid agencies who have warned of a mounting humanitarian crisis for the 1.5 million Palestinians in Gaza , who are unable to escape from the conflict because of Israel 's blockade .
However Christopher Gunness , a spokesman for the UN relief agency Unrwa , said the move did not go far enough .
" When you are trying to feed 750,000 people a day in Gaza as we are , you need a permanent ceasefire .
You can't do that in a three - hour window , " he said .
The World Bank also warned on Wednesday of a looming public health crisis in Gaza because of damage to its sewage system and a shortage of clean drinking water .
It urged Israel to allow the entry of parts , fuel and staff to the sewage complex in order to prevent the system breaching its walls and drowning up to 10,000 people .
Israel 's decision to facilitate " humanitarian corridors " follows one of the deadliest days since the offensive began last month , with more than 130 people killed on Tuesday .
Overnight , Israeli forces launched 40 fresh air strikes in Gaza , while Israeli media reports say nine rockets were fired into southern Israel from Gaza early on Wednesday .
Little official detail has been given about the French - Egyptian ceasefire proposal , but diplomats say it centres around measures to halt weapons smuggling from Egypt into Gaza , coupled with moves to ease the blockade .

Israel wants to stop rocket attacks on southern Israel and to stop Hamas smuggling weapons into Gaza via Egypt , while Hamas says any ceasefire deal must include an end to Israel 's blockade of the Gaza Strip .
More than 600 Palestinians are now believed to have been killed since Israel began its offensive on 27 December .
Palestinian health ministry officials say at least 195 children were among those killed .
GAZA CRISIS BACKGROUND
Profile : Gaza Strip Who are Hamas ?
In pictures : Tunnel smugglers Middle East conflict : History in maps
An Israeli attack on Tuesday on a UN - run school building , being used to shelter people who had fled their homes , killed 40 people , UN officials say .
The Israeli military said its soldiers had come under mortar fire from Hamas militants inside the school .
However , Unrwa 's Christopher Gunness said the agency was " 99.9 % certain " that there were no militants or militant activity in the school compound , and called for an independent investigation into the incident .
A spokesman for Hamas denied there had been any hostile fire coming from the school .
Since the start of its military operation in Gaza , Israel has lost seven soldiers on the ground .
Four people within Israel have been killed by rockets .
At least five hit southern Israel on Tuesday , one of them injuring a baby .
Support for truce US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice welcomed the French - Egyptian plan , saying the US was " pleased by and wish[es ] to commend ... that initiative " .
Israel 's ambassador to the UN , Gabriela Shalev , did not say whether Israel would accept the proposal but said it would take it " very , very seriously " .
The contours of a possible diplomatic agreement are in place , the BBC's Laura Trevelyan reports from the UN .
However , if Israel continues to control the flow of humanitarian aid into Gaza and can choose to stop it at any time this seems unlikely to command the support of Hamas , our correspondent notes .
Casualty claims in Gaza cannot be independently verified .
Israel is refusing to let international journalists into Gaza , despite a supreme court ruling to allow a limited number of reporters to enter the territory .
Update :
In February 2009 , the United Nations said that a clerical error had led it to report that Israeli mortars had struck a UN - run school in Jabaliya , Gaza , on 6 January killing about 40 people .
Maxwell Gaylord , the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Jerusalem , said that the Israeli Defense Force mortars fell in the street near the compound , and not on the compound itself .
He said that the UN " would like to clarify that the shelling and all of the fatalities took place outside and not inside the school " .

I ran into an interesting article earlier today on the differences in the ability to suppress hunger between men and women .
Apparently , women are worse than men at suppressing hunger .
When the researchers ran their study , they asked the participants to try a technique ( cognitive inhibition ) to suppress their hunger .
Though both sexes claimed they were suppressing their hunger , the women ’s brains were still firing in the hunger areas whereas the men ’s brains were quiet .
Now this may just be proving that men are better at cognitive inhibition , and that another technique could work better for women .
But I think it ’s an interesting study , nonetheless .
What are your thoughts ?
External storage supplier La Cie has found a way to quieten its external drives by adding staggered notches to the trailing edges of the fan blades .
How does that work ?
This is my understanding of the airflow and acoustics involved .
A typical drive or CPU - cooling fan has , La Cie says , seven blades .
These blades are angled and , as they spin , they cut into the air and send it at higher pressure ( pressure side ) underneath the fan blade and at lower pressure ( suction side ) over the top of the fan blade .
The two airflows meet and merge at the trailing edge of the fan and vortices form as the two flows ' different pressure levels get equalised .
The tumbling together of the airflows creates noise .
What Noctua , a La Cie partner in Austria with a Taiwanese manufacturing link , found was that a smooth uninterrupted trailing edge fan blade line was not ideal .
Instead , by putting notches in this edge , the upper and lower fan blade airflows joined at varying points along the trailing edge and this reduced the perceived noise level .
Noctua 9 - blade fan design .
The Noctua NF - P12 fan design has nine , not seven , blades and these are quite close together with a low angle of attack .
Two vortex control notches are cut into each blade 's trailing edge .
These help the two airflows to meet and merge more smoothly and with less tumbling or turbulence , because the single vortex line along smooth trailing edges is broke up into smaller vortices which have the effect of spreading the created noise across a wider range of frequencies .
That mutes the noise and makes it less annoying .
Another neat trick is to put the two notches at different places on each of the nine blades so that the acoustic profile of each blade is different .
The noise is then spread over yet more frequencies , further reducing the perceived annoyance - think of a dull roar being reduced to a dull , broader frequency hum .
The fan 's design also moves as much air at 1300rpm as a 7 - blade fan spinning at 1600rpm .
La Cie claims that its recently announced 4big Quadra and 5 big Network four and five - bay RAID external storage products use this Noctua cooling technology .
Their average noise emission is 40 per cent lower than predecessor products from La Cie ; that 's up to 15 dB quieter .
Olivier Mirloup , LaCie 's Hard Disk Solutions Business Unit Manager , said : " We are very proud of the result .
It 's a vast improvement . "
The 4big Quadra and LaCie 5 big Network are available at suggested retail prices starting from $ 849 .
Remember though , do n't make a noise about it . ®
Mother 's life transformed as doctors unveil first ever whole organ stem cell transplant in new dawn for medical science
Landmark operation : Claudia Castillo has an artificial airway created entirely from her own stem cells
A mother of two has become the first person in the world to undergo a whole organ transplant grown from her own stem cells .
From being virtually bedridden after her windpipe became blocked , 30 - year - old Claudia Castillo , above , is now able to resume the active life she once had .
The breakthrough is thanks to the pioneering work of British scientists , who are hailing a new dawn in transplant surgery which they believe could revolutionise the lives of millions .
They have won an international race to be the first to use adult stem cells to grow an entire organ and implant it successfully .
They believe the technique could be extended to allow surgeons to replace organs such as the heart and the lung , and are confident it will be the normal way of carrying out transplants in just two decades .
And because the technique makes use of adult stem cells donated by the patient , it sidesteps the ethical issues around the use of embryonic stem cells .
One of the researchers , Martin Birchall , professor of surgery at the University of Bristol , said : ‘ What we ’re seeing today is just the beginning .
' I reckon in 20 years ’ time it will be the commonest operation surgeons will be doing .
It will completely transform the way we think about surgery , health and disease .
‘ We believe this success has proved that we are on the verge of a new age in surgical care . ’
At present , patients having organ transplants must spend the rest of their lives on powerful drugs to suppress their immune systems , but this can leave them vulnerable to other infections and complications .
Restored : Mother - of - two Claudia Castillo can now resume the active life she had before her windpipe became blocked and left her bed- ridden
The new technique ends the need for immuno - suppressant drugs .
It uses part of a donated organ as a skeleton to grow stem cells on , but because these parts can be stored for longer than full organs , the method could save many more people and have an impact on lengthy waiting lists .
The revolutionary operation was carried out in Barcelona on Miss Castillo ’s windpipe , or trachea .
Scientists say up to 300 British people whose windpipes become blocked after cancer or infection could benefit every year .
They are already planning to extend the technique to the voicebox .
They say this could help around 3,000 people in the UK every year whose voiceboxes are damaged through cancer and other diseases .
Claudia Castillo talks to her surgeon Paolo Macchiarini before the ground - breaking operation
After that , stem cell - grown hollow organs such as bladders and bowels could be transplanted .
Scientists hope that within 20 years all organs – including heart , liver and lung – could be grown in the lab , helping millions .
Single mother Miss Castillo had TB which had almost blocked one of her bronchi , the twin tubes leading from the windpipe to the lungs , meaning she was permanently breathless .
Part of a windpipe from a 51 - year - old woman who had died from a brain haemorrhage was used in the procedure .
The whole windpipe could not simply be transplanted as it would have been rejected by the patient ’s immune system .
Instead , it was repeatedly ‘ washed ’ to remove all the dead person ’s cells , leaving only a collagen ‘ scaffold ’ .
Then stem cells were taken from Miss Castillo ’s bone marrow .
Stem cells can be prompted to grow into almost any type of cell , and in theory can be used to reconstruct entire organs .
British scientists are hailing a new dawn in transplant surgery
The stem cells were sent to Britain and grown in a lab at the University of Bristol to produce around six million cartilage cells - the material of trachea walls .
The cartilage cells were taken to Milan where , using a machine developed for the purpose , they were grown on to the trachea skeleton , effectively making a windpipe in the lab .
The windpipe was cut to the right length and bent into shape , before being grafted into Miss Castillo in June by Professor Paolo Macchiarini of Barcelona University .
She is now able to walk up two flights of stairs , walk 500 yards without stopping , and care for her two children .
Her body is showing no signs of rejecting the organ .
Professor Macchiarini said : ‘ We are terribly excited by these results .
Just four days after transplantation the graft was almost indistinguishable from adjacent normal bronchi .
Revolutionary :
The new piece of windpipe that has been grown entirely from Claudia Castillo 's own stem cells
‘ We think that this first experience represents a milestone in medicine and hope that it will unlock the door for a safe and recipient - tailored transplantation of the airway in adults and children .
We hope that these future patients will no longer suffer the trauma of speech loss , severe shortness of breath and other limited clinical and social activities . ’
Details of the transplant were described in an early online edition of The Lancet medical journal .
The remarkable results have been hailed as providing crucial new evidence that adult stem cells can offer genuine solutions to serious illnesses .
Many scientists argue that taking stem cells from embryos holds more promise , because they can be triggered to create more types of body cell than adult stem cells .
They are usually taken from embryos left over from IVF procedures .
But pro-life campaigners say it is morally wrong to harvest stem cells from embryos because the technique kills them .
The campaigners will use the latest breakthrough to bolster their arguments that scientists should look only at adult stem cells .
Another of the researchers , Anthony Hollander , professor of tissue engineering at the University of Bristol , said : ‘ This successful treatment manifestly demonstrates the potential of adult stem cells to save lives .
‘ This is an example of stem cell science becoming stem cell medicine . ’
A LIFE RENEWED BY RESEARCH
Virtually bed - ridden and unable to care for her children or perform the simplest tasks , Claudia Castillo faced a bleak existence .
Claudia Castillo faced a bleak existence before her surgery
Diagnosed with TB in 2004 , by March this year her condition had deteriorated so much that doctors told her if she did n’t have the stem cell treatment , they would have to cut one of her lungs out , turning her into an invalid .
That was a year after Miss Castillo , 30 , left , moved from Columbia to live in Barcelona with her children , Johan , 15 , and Isabella , four .
The tuberculosis had made the tube connecting her windpipe to one of her lungs collapse almost completely .
Miss Castillo said yesterday : ‘ The possibility of avoiding the removal of my lung represented a unique chance for me to return to a normal life that I am now enjoying with my children and family .
‘ I was scared because I was the first patient but now I am enjoying life and happy that my illness has been cured .
‘ I wanted to feel completely well and able to do normal things like going to work and being with my children .
Miss Castillo left hospital ten days after the operation and has remained well .
Praising the doctors , she added : ‘ Thanks to their dedication this disease can be treated and people can be made well .
I feel great .
Peter Hain and Jack Straw censured over undeclared gifts
Two senior Labour figures were strongly criticised yesterday for breaches of rules on donations .
Former Cabinet minister Peter Hain was found guilty by Westminster 's sleaze watchdog of ' serious and substantial ' failures in not registering more than £ 100,000 of donations to his Labour deputy leadership campaign .
And Justice Secretary Jack Straw was accused of being ' negligent ' over his repeated failure to declare a £ 3,000 gift .
Mr Hain 's hopes of a return to frontline politics were in tatters after the damning report by the Standards and Privileges Committee .
The former Work and Pensions Secretary now faces the humiliation of being forced to apologise in the Commons .
Guilty :
The reputations of Peter Hain ( left ) and Jack Straw are in tatters after both were investigated for failing to declare donations and gifts
Mr Hain resigned from the Government last January when the Electoral Commission triggered a police investigation into his late declaration of around £ 103,000 in donations .
Some 19 gifts were handed to his failed deputy leadership campaign between May and November 2007 , but not listed with the Register of Members '
Interests within the four - week time limit .
After a police inquiry , the Crown Prosecution Service decided to drop the case saying there was ' insufficient evidence ' to charge Mr Hain or anyone in his team .
The committee said : ' Because of the seriousness and scale of this breach and noting the considerable , justified public concern that it has created , we would ordinarily have been minded to propose a heavier penalty .
' However , we accept that there was no intention to deceive and Mr Hain has already paid a high price for his omissions . '
Mr Hain said the committee had accepted that his mistakes were ' honest ' .
Mr Straw was criticised over a gift from Texas - based energy firm Canatxx Ventures .
It helped pay for the MP's 25th anniversary dinner organised by his constituency party at Blackburn Rovers ' stadium in Mr Straw did not disclose the payment in either the register of MPs ' interests or the Electoral Commission 's donations to parties register .
The Standards and Privileges Committee found that Mr Straw did not declare the donation when it was made and also failed register it when the omission was brought to his attention in 2006 .
The Justice Secretary came clean about the gift with Commons authorities only when an official complaint was made last year .
The report said : ' There has been a clear breach of the Rules of the House , in that Mr Straw unintentionally overlooked his obligation to register a donation in the Register of Members Interests . '
It added : ' Mr Straw called this a chapter of accidents .
Accidents generally happen as a result of negligence , and Mr Straw has clearly been negligent in this case . '
The MPs added that they were ' surprised and disappointed ' that an MP of Mr Straw 's lengthy parliamentary experience had broken the very rules which he had introduced .
As Home Secretary , Mr Straw brought the Political Parties , Elections and Referendums Act on to the statute books in 2001 .
At the time of the donation , Canatxx had applied for planning permission to build a £ 300 million gas storage facility near Mr Straw 's constituency .
Former Local Government Secretary Hazel Blears rejected the scheme after a local planning inquiry , but Canatxx is now planning to resubmit the application .
Mr Straw said : ' I have apologised unreservedly for what the committee notes was an inadvertent oversight . '
Gordon Brown 's spokesman insisted the Prime Minister had full faith in Mr Straw .
How Much Worse Can the Ad Market Get? Just Wait .
Glad to see that Google ( GOOG ) had a decent quarter .
But things look grim for everyone else who makes a living selling ads , and there ’s plenty of lousy news to come .
We ’ve already heard worrisome predictions about online ad sales at Yahoo ( YHOO ) and Time Warner ’s ( TWX ) AOL .
And those are going to be rosy compared to the people who sell offline .
Bad harbinger : Brutal numbers from magazine publisher Meredith Corp ( MDP ) .
The Iowa - based company reported that its print ad revenue was down 20 percent for the last quarter , and that the handful TV stations it owns saw their sales drop about five percent .
Meredith says magazine ads are down 15 percent so far for the current quarter , which sounds comparatively rosy ( down 15 percent is the new up ! ) .
But the company says TV ads have fallen off a cliff and are plummeting out of view : Sales for the current quarter are down 40 percent , led by auto ads , which have basically disappeared –down a staggering 70 percent .
If those numbers are anything close to indicative of the rest of the market , you ’re going to see the ripple effects throughout the media world .
Today , for instance , Barclays analyst Anthony DiClemente used the Meredith results to help explain why he was cutting his estimates for News Corp. ( NWS ) , owner of Dow Jones and of this Web site .
And things can get much worse , DiClemente notes .
The national market for TV ads has stayed relatively strong , but that ’s in large part because advertisers locked in their buys last spring .
But advertisers still have a window to bail out of those commitments in the near future .
And even if they do n’t , it ’s hard to imagine they ’ll re-up at the same levels when the networks pitch them this spring .

Scattered problems were reported nationwide with registration issues snarling the process in some battleground states and massive turnout slowing things down in others .
Long lines persisted in some parts of Pennsylvania , a fiercely contested state .
In Upper Darby , near Philadelphia , township residents and Lincoln University students endured lines that lasted as long as 11 hours and stretched past the state 's closing time of 8 p.m .
Jacintha Johnson , a senior at the historically African - American school , told CNN that she got in line at 7:30 a.m. and voted at 6 p.m .
She said the precinct had only five voting booths to accommodate up to 3,000 people .
" Practically the entire school was out there , " she said .
In Virginia , one of the most hotly contested states , voters reported waits as long as five hours in Norfolk .
In nearby Chesapeake , about 50 percent of the city 's registered voters showed up at the polls Tuesday morning .
" We started the line at about 10:30 a.m. , and we did not get done until 3:30 p.m. , " said Jessica Edwards , who voted in Norfolk .
Some voters in Georgia said they were turned away when informed somebody using their names had already cast ballots in early voting .
Republicans in Colorado lodged a complaint of voter intimidation at polling places by supporters of Barack Obama .

Democrats in several states -- including the key state of Missouri -- received bogus text messages or e-mails Wednesday urging them to put off voting until Wednesday because of long lines .
In St. Louis , Missouri , Lisa Foreman said she went to vote in her precinct where improperly calibrated machines would only select Republican John McCain for president .
She said workers there were trying to fix the problem .
" We stood in line for three hours .
Eventually we had to move to paper ballots , " Foreman said .
In Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , Regina Hollis said she ran into problems with her voter registration , even though she 's lived at the same address for the past five years .
" Today I go to vote , my name is not in the book and I had to fill out a provisional ballot , " Hollis .
Even the rich and famous ran into problems .
When Academy Award - winning actor Tim Robbins showed up at his West 14th Street YMCA polling center in Manhattan , he was informed that his name was missing from the register .
" I went to vote where I normally vote and I was not listed .
I asked for an explanation ; they had none , " Robbins told CNN .
Watch Robbins describe his problems at the polls »
CNN Voter Hotline Voters can report problems to CNN Voter Hotline at 877-462-6608 .
He said he has been voting in the same district since 1992 ; has n't missed a single election ; and has n't changed addresses or political affiliations .
" The poll worker said my name was in the book for the primary two months ago , but missing for the general election , " he said .
Robbins rejected an offer to fill out a provisional ballot .
It took the actor a total of five hours -- and a judge 's order -- to finally vote .
" I 'm just waiting for an explanation , " he said .
" I want a real explanation , and I want that explanation for the hundreds and thousands of people in my district and throughout the city who are experiencing the same thing today . "
Meanwhile , voters in the battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania reported problems signing into the polls in Tuesday 's general election , with Ohio officials acknowledging that some voters in the Cincinnati area were mistakenly issued provisional ballots because of confusion about a state voter ID law .
" They [ poll workers ] are nervous , so they have them vote by provisional ballot , " said Hamilton County Board of Elections Director Sally Krisel .
She explained that her office had undertaken an outreach effort Tuesday morning to remind poll workers of the rules governing provisional ballots .
Watch how some
Ohio voters were surprised »
Ohio voter Rachel Near told CNN's Voter Hotline that she was issued a provisional ballot when she tried to vote in Columbus , Ohio .
" I know that provisional ballots are counted still , but it 's really annoying to not have the poll workers informed about what kind of ID they are supposed to accept , " Near said .
" I would think that at this point in time -- considering the magnitude of this election -- they would be aware of that . "
Provisional ballots are issued in Ohio when voters lack proper identification or are using the last four digits of a Social Security number as proof of ID .
Voters with an address change or name change are also required to vote by provisional ballot .
Voters are required to provide proof of identification within 10 days of the election for their votes to be counted , according to Krisel .
Democrats in Texas , Maryland , Missouri , Mississippi , Alabama and Arkansas reported receiving text messages saying they could vote for Obama on Wednesday .
An e-mail circulated in Arkansas and robocalls in Missouri also told voters they could cast their ballots Wednesday .
Missouri Secretary of State Robin Carnahan said she had " no tolerance " for anyone attempting to confuse voters .
" Every eligible Missourian should be able to cast their ballot today , and my office will immediately respond to any reports of misinformation , " Carnahan said .
" Anyone attempting to deprive voters of their rights on Election Day will be prosecuted . "
In Maryland , a spokeswoman for Attorney General Douglas Gansler said his office passed along complaints about the messages to the U.S. Justice Department and state prosecutors .
In Virginia and North Carolina , rain caused problems for counties using optical - scan paper ballots after water dripping off of wet voters rendered the ballots unreadable by scanners .
Watch people wait in the rain in Richmond , Virginia »
Election officials were encouraging voters to dry off before filling out ballots to avoid problems , and damp ballots were being allowed to dry before being tabulated , said Ryan Enright , a spokesman for Virginia 's Board of Elections .
In North Carolina , the problem seemed to dry up when election officials issued a memo about using paper towels , said Gary Bartlett , executive director of the North Carolina Election Board .
Many voters experienced no problems at the polls .
One voter , casting a ballot in Douglasville , Georgia , outside Atlanta , said it took him six minutes to fill out his paperwork and vote .
Another in Cobb County said his total voting experience lasted only a little more than four minutes .
" I walked right in , there were even empty polling booths , " the voter said of his church polling station .

There are 47 reasons , on any given day , why kinky stuff gets my jeebies heebied .
One of the things I can enjoy , regardless of my emotional connection to my play partner , is rope bondage .
There are many aspects of kink that are intensely personal for me , things that get right into my head and places that remain locked away .
Not everyone gets to go there .
Hell , I do n’t even go there most days .
Too dark and clammy .
But there are some types of play that I can enjoy purely on a physical level .
So long as the top to whom I am bottoming is highly capable , and I am assured of their skill , I can “ go there ” and enjoy the ride .
Rope bondage is one of those play - styles
So …WTF ?!?!
The loss of control over parts of your body is pretty intoxicating … the idea that your movement itself , the one thing since birth that you struggle to achieve and maintain , is now in the hands of someone else … that is something dangerous .
Excitingly so .
It occurs to me that the secret wormhole I find when doing bondage is not just the loss of control : it is the deeper sense that every segment of rope is touched and energized by the person applying the bondage .
That focused intent , that specificity , can elevate the inanimate rope to its own heightened state .
It is as though every section of rope is imbued with , and carries the energy and control and caress of the one who is in control of it .
As the bondage becomes more binding or more complex , it is as though you are held in a physical manifestation of the thoughts of the person slowly taking from you the control of your limbs , skin , body … rope bondage can get to the point where even your breathing is restricted by the rope top .
Imagine if every caress you felt while making love lasted and abraded and caressed and marked your skin in an after - shock of taut tension and sensation .
It is an echo that intensifies instead of fading .
It is a restriction that frees you to struggle and relinquish your control .
And if you add to that the many textures of rope , it is even more engaging .
Slack silk ropes , slick serpentine nylon , earthy heady hemp , scritchy jute , stiff cotton .
All of these have their own notes in the symphony of surrender .
Simple , elusive , complex , difficult , joyous , terrifying , soft , brutal , beautiful .
Have something about kink that you ’d like me to cover on a future WTF Wednesday ?

Seven people were killed and at least 50 were injured when the roof of a church collapsed in Sao Paulo , Brazil , fire officials say .
They say the number of casualties could have been much higher but the accident happened between services when fewer people were inside .
The building belongs to the Reborn in Christ denomination , one of the largest Evangelical Churches in Brazil .
The footballer Kaka was married there in 2005 .
The fire service says about 400 people were either entering or leaving the church in a central district of Sao Paulo when the roof collapsed on Sunday .
Troubled Church
Hours after the accident , Brazilian television showed pictures of firemen and police officers continuing to search through the rubble for survivors .
The roof of the church appears to have been completely destroyed , the BBC's Gary Duffy reports from Sao Paulo .
A spokeswoman for the Reborn in Christ church said the building , which is also its headquarters , normally holds 2,000 people , and is usually crowded on a Sunday night .
The church , a former cinema , is in one of the oldest districts of Sao Paulo .
In 2007 , Reborn in Christ 's two founders , Estevam and Sonia Hernandes , were sentenced to ten months ' detention in Miami for smuggling cash into the United States .
The couple are said to own a network of radio and television stations in Brazil , where they have also faced an investigation over money - laundering charges .
My boyfriend is coming back home after a long trip and I 'm picking him up at the airport .
I am really excited to see him .
I think it is very sweet when men pick women up from the airport holding a bouquet of flowers for them , and I 'd like to do something similar for him , but I 'd like the gift to be more masculine than flowers .
I 'd still like it to be a representation of my love for him , and something that is somewhat easy to see from a short distance .
Any suggestions ?
I always like it when men pick women up from the airport holding a bouquet of flowers for them , and I 'd like to do something similar for my boyfriend ... but get him something a little more masculine .
Help ?
Palin was n't chosen to pick off disgruntled Hillary supporters ( though she will to a degree ) .
She was chosen to pick off Democratic , blue collar men .
Think , people , think .
EBD , in the comments ;
But then , there 's actually the matter of what men like , as opposed to what they want .
It seems to me , in my experience , that a lot of women seem to have no sense of what men actually appreciate in women , and that this misunderstanding is based on a specifically - promoted view that suits women on the left .
A couple of years ago I was watching the Canadian women 's hockey team in a public ... house , and I remember how the women in the room were surprised by the barking intensity of cheering coming from the men .
It made perfect sense to the guys , of course ; when we 're watching , say , NHL hockey , what gets us riled up is when a Glenn Anderson creases the scalp of some board - smashing goon who thought he had # 9 lined up , but the canny fisherman 's son slip - slides past Mongo and drives to the net with the puck .
Well , that pleasure is doubled when you see a big handsome Canadian gal , with her family name right there on her jersey , fighting her way out of the corner with the puck -- it just makes the monkey - brain bonus - light flash a little more frantically .
It 's a different and far more deeply - rotted kind of " you go girl ! " than when some putative feminist is savaging a strong woman like Sarah Palin -- or Kate -- with the assumed support of other women , and on behalf of some putatively oppressed sisteren -en .
When a woman steps forward and faces down Moloch on everyone 's behalf it 's actually more inspiring --* to men* -- than if some suit - guy is doing it .

Friends panic when they glance at my inbox and notice tens of thousands of unread / unopened messages .
They want to stay productive , and Inbox Zero might give them the impression to do so .
But it does n't : about a decade ago , after noticing the insane amount of time I had to invest to keep my Inbox / text messages queue clean , I started ask myself “ Why ? ” .
Now , thinking about all the time people spend to keep their inboxes to zero makes me panic .
What 's the real advantage ?
By morphing the TARP from a trash asset removal plan to a capital injection plan , Hank Paulson did a big favor to members of Congress .
See , supporting the plan was a politically unpopular move , and several politicians lost their seats because of it on November 4th .
But the supporters that remain in office ( which is most of them ) now have a big out .
They can go on cable news and say , " This is n't the plan we voted for , we voted for a plan to buy up toxic mortgages so banks could start lending to homeowners again .
My constituents are barking mad that the money is just going to banks . "
When their furious constituents call up their offices , they can reply , " If I had known what Paulson was going to do with this money , I would 've never voted for it .
It makes me sick , and I 'm doing everything in my power to bail out homeowners . "
California Democratic Rep. Jane Harman was on Fox Business
News making these arguments last night , and we expect to see a parade of politicians hit the airwaves saying the same thing .
Of course , the original plan made no sense at all , but since we never tested it , nobody ever has to know that .
The fact that TARP2.0 , or whatever they 're calling it is becoming such a joke , only helps Congress more , because it makes the politicians look like victims of a confidence scheme .
So while the Jane Harmans of Capitol Hill can rail away on Paulson , call him a traitor , and say he marks a failure of leadership , you know that privately they 're extremely grateful for giving them cover and removing the responsibility for their actions .

In a past life as an advocate I 'd run into this kind of thing and call it to the referee 's attention and have the bogus ' evidence ' thrown out .
The referee would always throw it out .
While having a referee cal the opposer a ' lying dog ' in a decision to dismiss the case would have been nice , it never happened .
What happened is the referee did his or her job and rendered a generally unassailable decision based on the merits and we won .
" Merits " are facts supported by a preponderance of evidence .
Throw out the the bogus evidence and the merits disappear .
( And referee 's hate to be played , benefit 's of doubt DO NOT go to the liars . )
It 's just a matter of waiting .
Coleman is going to lose this and any disgruntlement over the Judge 's not throwing out the case is misplaced .
That would just give the liars a good reason for further appeal as the referee not having decided the case on the FULL merits ( if there are other arguments in the case ) .
Boy - o - boy , I 'm loving this
WHOO HOOO !

Franken is certified as winner - got the news on while I read the blog .

Is n't the lawyer (s ) handling the Coleman guilty of at the very least , contempt of court for knowingly presenting as prima facie " evidence " documents it knew was not " the best evidence " .
It would seem to me that something this serious would call for disbarment .
Can an attorney be disbarred if he knowingly allows his client in response to his direct examination , i.e. , suborning perjury .
Was not this attorney commiting a fraud on the court with his presenting as evisencea " different set of documents " than what was in the original envelope .
Coleman had a right to " contest " the election under Minnesota law , but did he not break the law in the " contest " phase with this ' doctored " evidence .
Is n't he just another Rehypocriticans

To The Skeptical Cynic ,
If only it were a perfect world ...
You 're probably right , I 'm not Esquire - ed so I do n't know .
My opposers just wrote a reply that was a variant of ' Shocked , I 'm shocked !... presented what was given me in response to data requests ... new clerks etc ' .
I would be surprised if there were not sanctions and penalty 's for it but how often they 're invoked and persued is , well , not often I suspect .
I like your version of the law better than how I saw some lawyers practice it .

I thought Franken 's attorneys were as dumb as I have been saying Franken is , maybe I overreached just a little , but the rest of my case is a doozy !
Just wait till I prove the duplicated counts in the counties where the vote total did n't exceed the total of signed voters .

This has got to Minnesota this is happening in , any other State where the GOP runs things and if this were a Dem they would have thrown the whole case out and Norm would have been installed already .
20 years ago when the State had some real Dems with sack , Franken would have been sitting by now .
Was n't that enough ( tampering ) evidence to throw the Coleman camp out of the courtroom on their asses ?

FYI , since I had to look it up : http://en.wikipedia.org/...iki/United_States_Senate
Democratic Party 56
Republican Party 41
Independent 2 ( Both caucus with the Democrats )
Disputed Seats 1
The MN race remains disputed
Total 100
So in a very tough battle , if Franken wins and is eventually seated , 59 ' dems ' and 41 repugs .
Biden wo n't probably play much of a role as a ' decider ' in this senate , since I believe he can only vote if its 50 - 50 ( or some other tie if some members are n't present ) .

** As of this posting , CNBC has only received comments favoring decriminalization of marijuana .
They might as well have displayed a link to ONDCP.gov across the screen for an hour .
CNBC 's Marijuana , Inc. could n’t have been more sensationalist if John Walters wrote the screenplay and Bill O’Reilly did the interviews .
I ’m serious , it was that bad .
Of course , it ’s impossible to know how the casual observer may interpret a propaganda trainwreck such as this , but for me it crossed the threshold of absurdity to the point of almost becoming useful .
If one factual concept emerged unscathed from this , it is that there is simply nothing you can do to stop the marijuana economy .
Marijuana , Inc. painted California as a veritable narco - state , thrown into anarchy by liberal values and unscrupulous profiteers .
If there ’s a lesson in there other than the fact that our marijuana laws are a disaster , I must have missed it .
The great irony of this is that , whether they like it or not , CNBC is selling their product to the same exact market .
Who do they think watches this stuff ?
Just turn off the sound and you ’ve got sixty minutes of first - rate pot porno to accompany the musical selection of your choice .
They used blatant pot porn to promote it , so they know exactly what they ’re doing .
Something is seriously out of balance when CNBC puts out an obnoxious propaganda program , while simultaneously hosting an online poll that favors decriminalization at 97 % .
They even felt compelled to put this disclaimer on their comment section : Marijuana sells in the media for the same exact reason it sells in the street .
The only difference is the media still feels the need to cut their marijuana merchandise with some nasty shit .
If the mainstream media wants to sell us pot , that ’s fine .
But give it to us straight .
Foundationalism and Hermeneutics
Περὶ Ἑρμηνείας
Traditional " foundationalism " was the view that knowledge could be started , or started again , from nothing by finding pieces of certain and infallible knowledge , the " foundation , " upon which all other knowledge could be constructed .
The classic attempt to do this occurred with René Descartes ( 1596 - 1650 ) , who believed that if he could conceive anything " clearly and distinctly , " he then could rely upon it as being true and build the rest of knowledge on it .
This became the pattern with the Rationalists , who based their systems on what they saw as self - evident first principles of demonstration , as these had originally been conceived by Aristotle .
Something counted as " self - evident " if one knew it was true simply by understanding it .
The Rationalist project , however , suffered from the disability that " self - evidence " was a subjective claim of certainty , which meant that different Rationalists could regard different things as being self - evident , with no way to rationally resolve the dispute .
Hence , making such claims , the systems of Descartes , Spinoza , Leibniz , etc. produced very different results .
A similar foundationalism , however , occurred with the Empiricist opponents of Rationalism .
The Empiricists also claimed a few things to be self - evidently true ( Hume even put geometry in that category ) , but mostly they regarded experience as providing foundational pieces of knowledge .
Statements about experience were not self - evident in terms of being understood , but they could be grasped as intuitively true as part of empirical observation .
This kind of foundationalism came to a kind of grief much like the Rationalistic self - evident truths , since it turned out that disagreements and apparent mistakes could occur even in the course of direct empirical observation :
The " foundational " pieces of knowledge were neither certain nor infallible .
A similar difficulty would afflict any kind of " Intuitionism , " which would not necessarily regard any truths as self - evident , but could regard pieces of knowledge based on " intuitions , " whether empirical , rational , or otherwise , as foundational .
That no item of knowledge could be regarded as infallible or incorrigible , i.e. all knowledge can be mistaken and can be improved , has been taken as decisive disproof of foundationalism .
As far as it goes , this is an inescapable conclusion .
Whether there was anything insightful about foundationalism , however , must be determined once we see what the alternative has turned out to be .
A certain alternative , indeed , has become all but dominant , not so much in philosophy , though it is powerful there , but in the popularized epistemology that we find in English departments and other areas of intellectual life that are liable to seize upon the " latest thing " as , indeed , self - evidently true .
If foundationalism is the thesis that we can construct knowledge with absolute certainty starting from nothing , then the denial of this can give us various possible theses : ( 1 ) knowledge cannot be constructed , ( 2 ) there is no absolute certainty , and ( 3 ) knowledge cannot be started from nothing .
The first thesis gives us the idea of " deconstruction " to describe and symbolize the failure of foundationalistic projects .
The second thesis , that we cannot have absolute certainty , is now accepted by all but everyone outside a few Aristotelians .
But the third thesis is the best clue to an alternative theory :
If knowledge cannot be started from nothing , what does it start with ?
With previous knowledge , of course .
But what is to count as previous knowledge ?
Why , just whatever it was that we thought we knew before whatever happened that changed our minds .
And if there is no certainty to knowledge , and no permanent , fixed system can be constructed , then the new knowledge will be what we think we know until something else happens to change our minds again .
This process ends up being described by the " hermeneutic cycle . "
" Hermeneutics , " from Greek ἑρμηνεύω , hermêneuô , " to interpret or translate " ( from the messenger , ἑρμηνεύς , of the gods , Hermes , Ἑρμῆς ) , is the theory and practice of interpretation ( ἑ ρμηνεία , hermêneía ) , originally the interpretation of texts , especially religious texts .
The " hermeneutic cycle " is the process by which we return to a text , or to the world , and derive a new interpretation -- perhaps a new interpretation every time , or a new one for every interpreter .
It is clear that this happens all the time .
We can understand a book , a movie , etc. a little differently each time we read or see it .
This was serious business in the Middle Ages , when differing interpretations of scripture could produce heresies , schisms , persecutions , wars , etc .
Some issues that emerged were the questions of who had the authority to interpret scriptures and of whether interpretation was something that anybody could do or if it required particular abilities or inspiration .
Thus , one difference between Orthodox Islam and Shi'ism was the view in the former that , originally , virtually any Moslem could interpret the Qur'ân and the Traditions , while the latter held that the proper interpretation could only be given by one possessing the divine spark that descended from ' Alî , the son - in - law of the Prophet Muhammad .
The Catholic Church is famous for the doctrinal authority of the Pope , but earlier Christianity invested doctrinal authority in Church Councils .
In this century , interest in hermeneutics grew steadily in Continental philosophy without much notice in the Anglo - American world , until Thomas Kuhn published The Structure of Scientific Revolutions in 1962 .
As the ( empiricist ) foundationalism of Logical Positivism was tottering , Kuhn provided a powerful alternative vision : Scientific knowledge changed , not through confrontation with the hard facts , but by a social struggle between contending interpretations of intrinsically ambiguous evidence .
As Logical Positivism actually then did collapse , the full force of the alternative burst through with Feyeraband , Habermas , Derrida , Foucault , etc. etc .
While The Structure of Scientific Revolutions hardly mentioned truth as a concern of science , many of the new hermeneuticists positively rejected the possibility of any kind of objective truth .
All was interpretation .
" Reality " is only accessible to us in terms of how we understand and interpret it .
Thus , if there is no " reality " to be independently compared with our knowledge , all we can do is oppose one interpretation to another , and each of these is ultimately going to be as well motivated by the " facts " as any other .
There are no foundational pieces of knowledge .
Such a theory is well called " deconstruction " [ note ] .
Since there is no foundation upon which to construct a system of knowledge , the best we can do is the therapeutic task of taking purported systems of knowledge and " deconstruct " them by showing the unmotivated assumptions or arbitrary interpretations upon which they are based .
As there is no constraint in reality on interpretation , the hermeneutic cycle , as in the diagram , can spiral out of control -- e.g. Incredible Hulk comic books can be interpreted to mean the same thing as Hamlet .
The project behind this has often been the morally confused one of equating relativism with liberal democratic toleration .
In fact , major exponents of hermeneutics and deconstruction , like Martin Heidegger and
Therefore we will be incoherent , but without systematically resigning ourselves to incoherence .
Jacques Derrida , Writing and Difference , translated by Alan Bass , University of Chicago Press , 1978 , p.84
As part of a critique of science , deconstructionist views , starting with Kuhn , even turn up advocated by the popular historian and commentator on science and technology , James Burke , in his various television series , like The Day the Universe Changed .
The title is meant to be taken literally .
Since there is no " reality " independent of interpretation , " The Universe is , at any time , what you say it is , " as Burke says himself .
Hence ,
The Day the Universe Changed ends with the idea that Buddhism is just as good an interpretation of the world as modern science , since there are plenty of people who say the universe is that way .
Why Buddhism has not then built , or even understood , microwave ovens is a good question , of the same order as the question why quantum mechanics does not deliver one from the cycle of birth and death .
That Buddhists are usually quite happy to study Western science and build their own electronic devices , which are not then based on Buddhist doctrine , provides a clue that quantum mechanics and Buddhism are probably not talking about the same thing , whether or not we conceive of it all as part of the same " universe " -- not withstanding a fair amount of literature now ( e.g. The Tao of Physics ) arguing that the newest discoveries in science merely restate the oldest truths of Eastern Philosophy .
As I have indicated , the oldest truths of Eastern Philosophy did n't even invent the telegraph , while the newest truths of science have nothing like the soteriological purposes of Buddhism , Hinduism , and Jainism , or the moral or aesthetic purposes of Confucianism or Taoism .
Relativism , or the idea that the universe is whatever you think it is , despite the attractions of this for someone like James Burke , does not seem like the kind of thing to recommend scientific knowledge at all .
Indeed , the most conspicuous exponents of deconstruction , or its successor , " post modernism , " are either uninterested or positively hostile to science .
After all , even any presumed achievements of science , like modern medicine , hygiene , or technology , are themselves subject to deconstructive interpretation .
In terms of its " lumpen Marxism , " post - modernism can dismiss all of science and its achievements as instruments of white , male , capitalist , Euro- centric ( if not Zionist ) power .
It is just as likely that oppressed women and Third - World cultures have their own " ways of knowing , " their own truths , even their own mathematics -- and theirs are certainly going to be less racist , sexist , classist , and species - ist and more friendly to the earth than capitalism .
Most noteworthy scientists have little patience with this kind of thing .
Thus , Roger Penrose , an important mathematician and now a significant interpreter of science , has said , in his great The Emperor 's New Mind [ Oxford University Press , 1989 , p. 299 ] :
I have taken for granted that any ' serious ' philosophical viewpoint should contain at least a good measure of realism .
It always surprises me when I learn of apparently serious - minded thinkers , often physicists concerned with the implications of quantum mechanics , who take the strongly subjective view that there is , in actuality , no real world ' out there ' at all !
The fact that I take a realistic line wherever possible is not meant to imply that I am unaware that such subjective views are often seriously maintained -- only that I am unable to make sense of them .
That the whole idea of science and knowledge becomes senseless , unless there is some way for external reality to impinge upon and limit our interpretations , was well appreciated in the context of hermeneutics by Richard J. Bernstein in Beyond Objectivism and Relativism : Science , Hermeneutics , and Praxis [ University of Pennsylvania , 1983 ] .
The truth of hermeneutics ( expressed by Bernstein as " relativism " ) was , indeed , that various interpretations are usually possible for each text , empirical datum , or whatever is to be interpreted .
The truth of foundationalism ( expressed by Bernstein as " objectivism " ) , on the other hand , was that the text or the datum does impose a limit to interpretations .
Comic books can be interpreted to mean many things , but it is ridiculous to see them as dealing with human life in the same way as Shakespeare .
How this works in regard to science can be seen in one of the great studies of the history and philosophy of science , Martin J.S. Rudwick 's The Great Devonian Controversy [ University of Chicago Press , 1985 ] .
The " great Devonian controversy " was over the mapping and interpretation of the geological strata in Devonshire in the 1830's , leading to the introduction of the " Devonian System " for Paleozoic strata and time .
Since deconstruction received its greatest boost from Kuhn 's study of science , it is suitable that Rudwick should implicitly refute many of Kuhn 's conclusions .
At the same time , Rudwick reinforces the refutation of foundationalism .
The geologists in his study believed they were doing inductive , empiricist " Baconian " science , with no mental preconceptions .
They clearly were not .
They could not start with nothing .
Of course , that makes their method conformable to Karl Popper 's view of falsification .
The refutation of foundationalism does not necessarily imply deconstruction .
At the same time , a striking thing occurs to Rudwick 's geologists , which hardly would seem possible for Kuhn 's theory .
By examining the evidence in Devonshire , it becomes obvious at one point to all the major geologists that everyone was wrong , and for a while the work just drifts along with no credible theory to handle the facts , until someone ( Murchison ) comes up with a new idea .
The " revolution " thus occurs , not by a new theory pushing out an old one , as Heliocentrism did Geocentrism , or as Einstein did Newton , but with all theories being falsified by the evidence , the very thing Kuhn thought was n't possible .
Something else of the sort happened when Lord Kelvin proposed that the energy of the sun came from gravitational collapse , which meant that the sun and earth could only be some five million years old , while geologists had already concluded that the earth was far older than that .
This was an anomaly in science , persisting for decades , that could not be resolved by the geologists , who actually were right , but only by completely new ideas in physics , which led to the theory of nuclear fusion .
Thus , ironically , the geologists " won " the argument , but not by any interpretation of the evidence that they could ever offer themselves .
Indeed , the refutation of Ptolemy by Galileo really came down to one critical observation :
The phases and the change in apparent size of Venus were not explained by Ptolemaic astronomy , but they were by Copernicus 's theory .
Although others , like Tycho Brahe , cleverly proposed geocentric theories that would take the new observations into account , the damage was done , and it was done by empirical evidence that did not admit of " deconstruction . "
If the range of hermeneutic interpretation is limited by a text , or by empirical evidence , or by anything else , then it is possible for the hermeneutic cycle to narrow down instead of spiralling out of control .
The " limit " of the spiral , whether it is reached or not , is the principle of objectivity and reality .
As in quantum mechanics itself , there can be a larger or smaller range of uncertainty , but that will be merely a range , not an unconstrained infinity of possibilities .
Indeed , the theoretical possibility that an infinite number of scientific theories could explain the same " facts " runs up against the hard reality that the theoreticians of these possibilities rarely can propose even one new theory that would take all the relevant facts into consideration -- usually exercises of the sort must grotesquely overlook some of the most elementary considerations .
A pretty precise analogy of this exists in mathematics .
Part of the enjoyment of mathematics is taking an interesting equation , plugging in different values , and seeing what happens .
However , this cannot be done with one of the most important equations in the history of physics , which is the equation that must be used in Kepler 's Second Law of planetary motion .
Thus , the equation M = E - e*sin E relates the " mean anomaly " ( M ) , to the " eccentric anomaly " ( E ) of an orbit .
The variable " e " is the eccentricity of the elliptical orbit .
The " mean anomaly " ( in degrees ) is where a planet would be after moving at a constant rate in a circular orbit .
However , Kepler discovered that the planets move in elliptical , not circular , orbits , and that they move faster when closer to the Sun than when further away , with the radius of their orbit sweeping out " equal areas in equal times . "
The " eccentric anomaly " takes into account the fact that the motion is not uniform around the orbit .
With the " eccentric anomaly " in hand , it can be converted to the " true anomaly " ( ) , the position of the planet in its orbit measured from the focus of the ellipse , i.e. from the Sun itself .
This uses what at first looks like a more complicated equation , .
However , given " E , " this equation can be solved for " " quite simply .
The problem is with the other equation .
How do we solve M = E - e*sin E for " E " given " M " ?
It is not easily done .
In fact , it can not be done .
Instead , we must start deriving approximations , very much like in the hermeneutic cycle .
Thus , we rearrange the equation as E = M + e*sin E m , and then for E m we actually just use M .
This does not give us the right answer , but it does give us an " E " that is a little different from " M. "
We take our result , E m 1 , and run E = M + e*sin E m again .
And again .
What we quickly notice is that that the values we get for " E " switch back and forth between a larger number and a smaller number .
And as we continue running our procedure , the values get closer together .
Obviously they are converging on the true value , a limit , of " E. "
They will never become identical ; but we can make them close enough for whatever level of accuracy we may desire .
Indeed , if our calculator displays 11 or 14 numbers -- which is what my calculators could do when I was playing with this stuff back in 1981 or so -- they may soon look identical in terms of the accuracy of our device .
So this is exactly the behavior we would expect from a realistic hermeneutic cycle .
The mathematics here is about as realistic as one can get , with planets hurtling throught the Void but following the paths described by these equations .
All we need to believe is that this works the same way when we substitute meaning and truth for numbers .
All we need are concrete examples from the history of science , which is what we now have here .
Rudwick 's " great Devonian controversy " study ends with graphic tables illustrating how the theories and associations of the participants in the controversy evolved ; and the tables strikingly display the same spiralling down structure as the table of the " realistic " hermeneutic cycle given here .

The interaction of hermeneutics and foundationalism is the same as the interaction of interpretation and reality .
Our connection to reality may underdetermine the interpretation , leaving a range of possibilities , but it does impose a limit to interpretation , determining a certain range .
What hermeneutics and foundationalism really represent , however , is something logically more precise .
Hermeneutics is about interpretation , which is about meaning , which is about what is understood .
Foundationalism is about reality , which is about truth , which is about what is known .
Traditional foundationalists and deconstructionists all tend to confuse meaning with truth and understanding with knowledge .
Thus , in one of the most classic forms , the Logical Positivists denied that statements could be meaningful if they could not be ( empirically ) verified .
That Logical Positivism itself could not be thus verified , and so could not be meaningful , seemed to escape their notice for decades , even though Wittgenstein had already seen the problem by the end of his Tractatus .
At the other end of the spectrum , deconstruction simply holds that any interpretation of meaning is already true , to the extent that " truth " means anything , just by being produced .
Both of these extremes should be seen for what they are : grotesquely reductionistic and absurd .
If meaning and truth are different and independent , then we have a requirement for an important epistemic and probably even ontological dualism , between understanding and knowledge , or between thought and intuition .
This dualism has always tended to break down ( as the Rationalists assimilated perception to thought and the Empiricists thought to perception ) ; but it keeps returning , is all but unavoidable in common sense , and is theoretically upheld by the greatest philosophers , like Kant .
There are indeed truths of meaning , analytic truths , and the meaning of truths , since no proposition can be expressed without meaning for its terms ; but this interaction and interdependency of meaning and truth , again , has tended to confuse people over the importance of the difference .
Quine 's denial of analytic truth ( in the infamous " Two Dogmas of Empiricism " ) seems to result from the paradox that there may be truths about meaning for a concept , even though the concept cannot be applied to reality without falsehood -- e.g. the concept of phlogiston , the last version of the theory that fire was a substance .
This confusion is actually built into common systems of Symbolic Logic , where it is impossible to say " some Greeks gods live under the sea , " which is true , without simultaneously asserting that " Greek gods exist , " which is false -- i.e. through the locution , " There is an x [ the " existential " quantifier ] , such that x is a Greek god , and x lives under the sea . "
It should be clear that it is possible to understand something , even though it cannot possibly be true , and that it is possible to know that something is true , without understanding it very well -- even Socrates says that the poets say true things , " without any understanding of what they say . "
As understanding and knowledge thus can vary somewhat independently , it is then essential in life and in philosophy to retain an awareness that different issues , hermeneutic and foundational , may be involved in many , or all , questions .
The first non-literal reading of sacred text may have been done by Philo Judaeus , who wished to interpret the Bible as containing the truths of Greek philosophy -- with the claim that Greek philosophers had actually gotten their ideas from the Bible and from Judaism , by way of the secret and esoteric teachings into which they had been initiated .
Later Christian exegetes were not at all adverse to this claim , but they also had other fish to fry .
They wanted to see the New Testament as representing a system already implicit in the Old , so that the Old Testament itself could be read as referring to the New .
By the time of Dante Alighieri ( c.1265 –1321 ) , the system of allegorical interpretation had been elaborated into four traditional levels .
Dante himself wrote
The Divine Comedy with this in mind , and he explained the " four - fold method " or " allegory of the theologians " in a letter to his patron and protector , Cangrande I , Lord of Verona : Rather , it may be called " polysemous , " that is , of many senses .
A first sense derives from the letters themselves , and a second from the things signified by the letters .
We call the first sense " literal " sense , the second the " allegorical , " or " moral " or " anagogical . "
To clarify this method of treatment , consider this verse :
When Israel went out of Egypt , the house of Jacob from a barbarous people : Judaea was made his sanctuary , Israel his dominion [ Psalm 113 ] .
Now if we examine the letters alone , the exodus of the children of Israel from Egypt in the time of Moses is signified ; in the allegory , our redemption accomplished through Christ ; in the moral sense , the conversion of the soul from the grief and misery of sin to the state of grace ; in the anagogical sense , the exodus of the holy soul from slavery of this corruption to the freedom of eternal glory ... they can all be called allegorical .
This is a nice treatment , for we see that all the non-literal interpretations are " allegorical " in their own way , although the allegorical forms are then subdivided .
The literal meaning of the Exodus is the story of Moses leading Israel out of Egypt .
Meaning / Sense Time Literal Past Allegorical / Typological Past - to - Present Tropological / Moral Present Anagogical / Mystical Future
The " tropological " interpretation , the " moral " of the story , is then indeed at the level of morality .
The escape from Egypt is thus the escape from sin , by redemption and atonement , which establishes one in a state of moral grace , forgiven and free of sin .
In the temporal version of the analysis , this puts one in the present , where redemption means that one is ready to behave henceforth in a righteous and blameless manner .
The events of the Exodus , after all , were in the past , while the mechanism of salvation established by Christ brings the events of the past , in his own time , as a living entity into the present .
Finally , the " anagogical " or mystical level of the allegory addresses the most purely religious aspect of the business .
The Exodus from Egypt this represents the escape of the soul from the world and its reunion with God .
This is the ultimate purpose of redemption , which is not just to be morally corrected but to be saved .
Salvation frees us from the suffering , death , loss , and grief that are inevitable in this life .
In the world right now , we look forward to this in the future .
The themes of Dante 's example are those of The Divine Comedy itself .
Literally , the great poem it is an account of Dante 's journey through Hell , Purgatory , and Heaven .
Since the historical Dante did not literally make this journey , and Dante is not simply writing a fictional adventure story , the seriousness of the work is in its other meanings .
Thus it is an allegorical Christian pilgrimage .
As a " comedy , " it has a happy ending , namely the accomplishment of redemption and salvation .
Dante lost in the " dark wood , " the selva oscura , at the beginning means that he begins from ignorance , despair , and sin .
By the end , of course , in the presence of God , he has learned the nature of Christ 's sacrifice and has achieved both moral correction and the promise of Heaven , which covers all the levels of the allegorical meaning of the poem .
Whether it is the theological reading of Scripture , or Dante 's design in The Divine Comedy , we see that there is a doctrinal background to all the levels of interpretation .
In modern hermeneutics , of course , " desconstruction " may serve to smuggle in either a worldview that is simply Nihilistic or Nietzschean , or an even more sinister Marxist hermeneutic that seeks to restore a Soviet construction of society and politics .
Those who most eagerly " deconstruct " morality and tradition rarely reflect on , let alone critically examine , their own moral indignation or self - righteousness , which is based on a Marxist pseudo - morality .
The Tomb of Dante
The Ghica at Ravenna
Dante 's Purgatory
The Dungeon of Ugolino
The sort of hermeneutic system that we seen in Dante is not something unique to the West .
There is a nice case of another four - fold pattern of interpretation in Chinese and Japanese Buddhism :
... in his commentary Fa-hua wen -chü ( Words and phrases of the Lotus Sûtra ) , Chih -i [ Zhiyi , 538 - 597 AD ] uses the term kanjin [ , " mind contemplation " ] ... as the last of the " four modes of interpretation " ( ssu- shih , shishaku ) , a four - part hermeneutical guideline for interpreting the " words and phrases " of the Lotus Sûtra . [ 1 ]
The first is to see the sûtra 's words and phrases in terms of " causes and conditions " ( yin - yüan , innen ) -- that is , how they represent the Buddha 's response to the specific receptivity of his hearers . [ 2 ]
The second , " correlation with teachings " ( yüeh - chiao , yakkyô ) , is to understand them in terms of each of the " four teachings of conversion " -- the categories into which Chih-i analyzed the Buddhist teachings . [ 3 ]
The third , pen-chi or honjaku , is to understand them from the two viewpoints of the " trace teaching " and the " origin teaching , " the two exegetical divisions into which Chih -i analyzed the Lotus Sûtra . [ 4 ]
Fourth , having grasped the meaning of a particular word or phrase from these three doctrinal perspectives , one then internalizes it , contemplating its meaning with respect to one 's own mind .
[ Jacqueline I. Stone , Original Enlightenment and the Transformation of Medieval Japanese Buddhism , Kuroda Institute , U. of Hawai'i Press , 1999 , p.157 , brackets and colors added ]
Chi-i founded the Chinese T'ien - t'ai , , school of Buddhism , which later became the politically dominant Tendai school in Japan .
" Mind contemplation , " , like the anagogical level [ 4 ] of Christian interpretation , has the highest soteriological function .
Relating the meaning to the two halves of the Lotus Sûtra is rather like the allegorical project [ 2 ] project of relating the Old to the New Testaments .
On the other hand , the other two levels are more concerned with Buddhist issues , the means by which the Buddha addresses his audience , the " causes and conditions , " and the manner in which Buddhist doctrine is expressed , the " correlation with teachings . "
We do n't get a " tropological " [ 3 ] level of purely moral import .
Again , as in Dante , we see the forms and purposes of interpretation determined by a doctrinal background .

Monday was “ a big day in the world of media , ” said John Hinderaker in Power Line .
The Tribune Co. , which owns the Chicago Tribune , the Los Angeles Times , The Baltimore Sun , and other papers , filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy , and The New York Times said it needs to borrow $ 225 million against its New York headquarters .
Newspapers are in trouble because they have n’t figured out how to make up for losing their “ cash cow , ” classified ads , to the Internet .
And Tribune Co. is merely the “ first domino ” to fall , said Denny Wilkins in Scholars & Rogues .
If your local paper is “ a big metropolitan daily , it ’s for sale — you just have n’t been told that yet . ”
After all , who wants to invest in a business that ’s “ losing gobs of money , has fired or bought out its best artisans , ” and whose only solution has been “ cutting more costs ? ”
The newspaper industry may be ailing , said Stephane Fitch in Forbes online , but “ Tribune Co. would be trundling along profitably ” if it were n’t for owner Sam Zell .
Even the Tribune newspapers are still profitable .
The company is in trouble only because Zell saddled it with a huge amount of debt in his highly leveraged buyout a year ago .
Bankruptcy was Zell ’s “ Plan D , ” said Ken Doctor in paidContent.org , after he bought at the wrong time , failed to sell assets , and could n’t renegotiate with Tribune ’s lenders .
Still , the move shows that “ no news brand is sacred , ” that we have “ no idea what the 2015 news landscape will look like , ” and that in the meantime , all newspapers are just “ buying time . ”
At Agile 2008 I was calmly coding together with Daniel Brolund in the open space area .
We were interrupted by a guy that asked us if we did any coding in Ruby and if we did he will hold a lightning - talk about a framework he had put together to create SWT - gui:s using JRuby .
Interestingly enough I had thought about how GUI - coding could probably be improved in a language such as Ruby so I reluctantly stopped what I was doing and watched the lightning talk .
This was the first time I ever saw Glimmer and it totally blew me away !
It must be possible to do in Scala !
I had already started playing with Scala and I thought it would be a cool experiment to see if I could do something similar in Scala .
After all , scala is a pretty expressive language .
I made the first attempt a few months ago and I think that qualifies as a failure .
I got something to work but all the mutable state and redundant classes I had to create bothered me big time .
I showed what I did to colleague and I got some pointers on how to make my code more function - oriented and hence get rid of some redundancy and mutable state .
But my lacking knowledge of Scala and FP prevented me from finishing the task back then .
Success !
Yesterday I gave it another shot and it took me only an evening to make this code :
shell ( text ( " User Profile " ) , composite ( gridLayout ( 2 , false ) , group ( text ( " Name " ) , gridLayout ( 2 , false ) , gridData ( FILL , FILL , true , true ) , label ( text ( " First " ) ) , edit ( text ( " Bullet " ) ) , label ( text ( " Last " ) ) , edit ( text ( " Tooth " ) ) ) , group ( gridData ( FILL , FILL , true , true ) , text ( " Gender " ) , radioButton ( text ( " Male " ) , selected ) , radioButton ( text ( " Female " ) ) ) , group ( gridData ( FILL , FILL , true , true ) , text ( " Role " ) , checkBox ( text ( " Student " ) , selected ) , checkBox ( text ( " Employee " ) , selected ) ) , group ( text ( " Experience " ) , rowLayout , gridData ( FILL , FILL , true , true ) , spinner ( selection ( 5 ) ) , label {text ( " years " ) } ) , button ( text ( " save " ) , gridData( RIGHT , CENTER , true , true ) ) , button ( text ( " close " ) , gridData ( LEFT , CENTER , true , true ) ) ) )
Display this :
Pretty cool !
I will admit that I have gracefully stolen most of the ideas from Glimmer .
Even the example above is a slightly modified Glimmer - example .
I will probably go over it a couple of times to see what I can improve from a Scala perspective .
I particulary dislike the gridData functions .
I think there is room for improvement there .
How does it work ?
The general pattern is simple .
Take a look a the group element in the code above .
Group is implemented like this :
def group ( setups :( Group => Unit ) * ) ( parent : Composite ) = { val group = new Group ( parent , SWT.
NONE ) rowLayout ( group ) ; setups.foreach( setup => setup( group ) ) }
If you , like me when I saw my first Scala examples , have some dificulty with the double parameterlist notation it is a shorthand in Scala for returning a function .
So the above is a function that takes a variable number of functions that take a Group as the only parameter .
Unit in Scala is equivalent to void in java .
The group - function will return a function that takes a Composite , parent , as it ’s only parameter .
The cool thing about this is that you can pass the first set of parameters ( the variable number of functions that takes a Group and return Unit ) and save the returned function for later evaluation .
When the composite parent is later passed what will happen is the following :
A new Group widget will be created with parent as parent
as a default the layout of the group will be set to row layout , this may be overridden in the next step .
Each function in setup will be applied to the newly created group .
Remember , the setup - functions take a group as a parameter so they can perform whatever action on the Group .
You have full freedom to do whatever can be done with a group in any of those functions .
The variable length argument is one of the missing pieces I needed to solve the puzzle , I failed to find information about variable arguments via google .
Ok , I did not spend an awful lot of time trying …
What does one of those setup - methods look like then ?
Let ’s start with something simple , the label :
def label ( setups : ( Label => Unit ) * ) ( parent : Composite ) = { val label = new Label ( parent , SWT.
NONE ) setups.foreach( setup => setup( label ) ) }
The pattern repeats itself , lazy creation of the label onto the parent composite ( for instance a Group ) and the posibility to furter customize the label .
Now comes the next secret I had to learn in order to solve the puzzle .
Take a look at the text - function :
def text [ T T. I do n’t know what that construct is called , I call it declarative duck - typing , you know if it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck it ’s a duck !
Here I declare that T can be any type that has a function named setText that takes a String as an argument and returns nothing .
If I did not declare this then the subject .setText ( txt ) line would not compile .
But I ’m getting ahead of myself .
Why did I need to find this construct ?
Several different widgets in SWT has a setText - method , for instance , shell has a setText , label has a setText etc but some controls do not .
There is no common interface between all different widgets that has a setText - method .
That makes things a bit tricky , my first attempt was to overload different setText - functions , one for label , one for shell etc …
This was not only tedious , it did n’t work since the difference between all of those overloaded methods is in the parameterlist of the returned function .
Luckily , this little inconvenience forced me to discover this NEAT feature of the Scala - type system .
I ’m happy I did .
In conclusion
I was able to make a DSL that is very comparable to glimmer which was my original goal .
I was able to make the whole thing initialize lazily .
Basically I just build a tree of constructing functions and then I sort of light the fuse by passing a shell to the root of that tree and the GUI is created .
I did not have to introduce any mutable state other than what is already mutable in SWT .
I have a feeling that this approach is very extendable .
Maybe the GUI is a good place to introduce Scala in Java - projects ?
My feeling is that Scala would slowly eat it ’s way in to other parts of the system from there :)
Perhaps this is a good candidate for an open source project ?
Would you want to use it ?

Americans have been conditioned to think in stark contrasts : good versus bad , righteous versus evil , and the just versus the unjust .
As a result , beliefs are fostered that permit the United States to wallow in self righteousness and to justify its aggression around the globe .
U.S. foreign policy makers , in concert with mainstream media , routinely portray any government or national leader that does not accept our imperial dictates as rogue , undemocratic or evil .
Iran 's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has been one of the most frequently demonized national leaders .
As an American Iranian , who plans to visit Iran in the near future , I have been keenly aware of the repeated charges hurled at President Ahmadinejad .
Foremost among these charges are the claims that Ahmadinejad wants to " wipe Israel off the map , " or that he has denied the authenticity of the Holocaust .
Since 2005 , when these statements were first attributed to Ahmadinejad , the American public has incessantly been fed distortions of what he really said .
The accurate translation of what he actually said is , " the Zionist regime is doomed to fall off the pages of history , following the path of all oppressive regimes before it , " not that Iran or Ahmadinejad would " wipe Israel off the map . "
Two important points , almost never mentioned in the mainstream U.S. media , need to be highlighted here : ( 1 ) Ahmadinejad says the " Zionist regime , " not Israel or the Jewish people , and ( 2 ) he uses the passive voice , referring to the historical imperative , not the active voice purporting a military action to overthrow Israel .
The " Holocaust is a myth " charge should actually read as " In the name of the Holocaust they created a myth . "
Ahmadinejad then doles out criticism against imperial powers as follows : " If you have burned the Jews why do n't you give a piece of Europe , the United States , Canada or Alaska to Israel .
Why should the oppressed people of Palestine be punished for it ? "
Despite his unambiguous views regarding Israel and Palestine , the rallying cry portraying Ahmadinejad as a raging anti-semite has mushroomed across America , materializing in every corner from small town barbershop conversations to the televised U.S. Presidential campaigns .
As one who needs to see it to believe it , I jumped at the opportunity to meet President Ahmadinejad when he was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly last month .
My husband and I attended two events sponsored by various religious , peace and social justice organizations that were held in order to introduce President Ahmadinejad to the peace community in the United States .
Hope was expressed that " the exchange of views will enable us to explore faith perspectives for dealing with global issues such as poverty , war and prejudice " - plagues that approximate what Martin Luther King Jr. aptly called the axis of evil : racism , poverty and militarism .
While the organizing sponsors should be commended for the monumental effort involved in pulling together events of this magnitude , and for their sincere search for peaceful relations with Iran , the questions and comments directed to President Ahmadinejad echoed the routinely propagandized biases that the majority of Americans have come to treat as gospel .
Most questions were indistinguishable from those posed by Larry King the night before in an interview with the Iranian President .
Absent were questions or acknowledgements of imperialistic U.S. offences committed against Iran : orchestrating the 1953 coup against the Democratically elected government of Prime Minister Mohammed Mosadeq and appointing the dictatorial Shah in his place ; imposing 29 years of economic sanctions against Iran after the Iranian people overthrew the Shah ; orchestrating and supporting the eight - year Iraq war against Iran ; the downing of Iranian passenger Flight 655 by U.S. missiles , killing all 290 passengers and crew , including 66 children ; and sponsoring ongoing covert operations inside Iran and across its borders through allocation of hundreds of millions dollars , euphemistically called Democracy Fund , designed to destabilize the Iranian government .
Unwittingly , the organizers of the meeting with President Ahmadinejad harmed their goal of building bridges between our two nations when they missed the opportunity to apologize for , or even acknowledge , these acts of aggression .
Just think what might be achieved for peace if squaring off with other countries began with a sincere " I 'm sorry , " the first lesson instilled in us as children , when our parents wanted to exact remorse after we pinched our baby sister .
After listening to President Ahmadinejad , I came to believe that the purported Iranian " threat " to the United States is rooted in Ahmadinejad 's straight talk .
He freely spoke of the plight of more than 5 million Palestinians whose lives and land have been illegally besieged for over 60 years in the U.S. - backed Israeli occupation that gnaws away at prospects for peaceful coexistence .
President Ahmadinejad proposed that lasting peace will only be achieved through a free referendum where all the peoples of Palestine ( including Jews , Muslims and Christians ) determine their own fate , complying with the spirit of the Charter of the United Nations .
More simple truth that most American leaders and the powerful Israeli lobby are loath to face is Ahmadinejad 's view , shared increasingly worldwide , of who really poses a nuclear threat .
His forthright approach takes on new meaning when we own up to the plain facts : the United States has an arsenal between five and ten thousand ( depending on the source of information ) nuclear warheads and we are the only country to have used nuclear weapons twice , killing and maiming an estimated 199,000 civilians , innocent men , women and children .
Israel , decidedly the most influential U.S. ally , currently has approximately 200 nuclear warheads , funded largely by U.S. taxpayers .
Given this indisputable evidence of our own government 's culpability , I was embarrassed when a spokesperson posited to Ahmadinejad , " our government is concerned with Iran becoming a nuclear power . "

The New York Times and Gaza : Justifying genocide
31 December 2008
On the fourth day of the Israeli aerial blitz against the population of Gaza , the New York Times , the mouthpiece of US establishment liberalism , weighed in on the subject for the first time on its editorial pages .
In a lead editorial , the Times made its position clear in short order .
" Israel must defend itself , " it began .
" And Hamas must bear responsibility for ending a six - month cease - fire this month with a barrage of rocket attacks into Israeli territory . "
There is little to distinguish the " newspaper of record 's " version of events from the mendacious account being peddled by the American media in general : the Palestinians are the aggressors and Israel the victim .
Never mind the grim and unequal equation of the conflict : roughly 100 Palestinians killed for every Israeli .
The Times ' potted explanation of the war , presented as though it were common knowledge and irrefutable fact , conveniently ignores that it was the Israeli military which broke the cease - fire with a provocative cross - border raid into the Gaza Strip in which six members of the Hamas security force were killed .
The date of the raid was November 4 , not by coincidence Election Day in America .
The timing is an indication that the attack was a politically calculated provocation by the Israeli regime , which it held in abeyance until after the electoral contest in the US , its indispensable patron , had been concluded .
Press reports in Israel indicate that the attack on Gaza had been actively prepared for six months , with the Zionist regime agreeing to the cease - fire only to give its military the time it needed .
One of the principal aims of the operation was to reestablish the credibility of Israel 's military after the humiliating defeat it suffered in Lebanon two - and - a - half years ago and to thereby intimidate all others in the region .
The present military operation has been launched by Israel not as an act of self - defense but in pursuit of definite geopolitical aims and in response to its own internal political and social contradictions .
The Times editorial engages in a bit of hand - wringing over whether the slaughter in Gaza is good for Israel — not a word of sympathy for the dead and maimed Palestinian men , women and children — and issues a hypocritical appeal for the Israeli regime to " limit civilian casualties . "
Passed over in silence is the brutal Israeli blockade which has left Gaza 's population impoverished and hungry , without adequate food , medical supplies , electricity , potable water or other basic necessities of life .
The cease - fire was supposed to alleviate these desperate conditions , but Israel merely tightened the noose around Gaza .
Nor is there any mention of how 1.5 million people came to be trapped in these desperate conditions and on this narrow strip of land as a result 60 years of Israeli expulsions and occupations .
If the Times editorial is merely cynical , the opinion piece which the newspaper chose to publish on the opposite page of its Tuesday edition is colored by outright criminality .
The author is Benny Morris , a prominent Israeli historian , whose views were formerly identified with the Israeli left , but who in the past several years has swung decisively over to the extreme right .
" Why Israel Feels Threatened " is the title of Morris 's piece , which provides a more lengthy and sophisticated justification of the slaughter in Gaza and a sinister warning of greater crimes still to come .
He presents a portrait of Israel surrounded by increasingly dangerous enemies , while confronted with dwindling support from its allies in the West .
" To the east , Iran ... to the north , the Lebanese fundamentalist organization Hezbollah ...
To the south , Israel faces the Islamist Hamas movement , which controls the Gaza Strip . "
As a result of these " dire threats , " Morris insists , " Israelis feel that the walls — and history — are closing in on their 60 - year - old state . "
Who is threatening whom ?
Israel is the one state in the world that recognizes no permanent boundaries .
In the north , it has repeatedly invaded Lebanon , on the last occasion in July 2006 , carrying out massive bombings of the country 's south and Beirut 's suburbs and killing thousands of civilians .
In the east , it has imposed unbearable conditions of life on West Bank Palestinians , sealing them behind an apartheid wall and subjecting them to restrictions , roadblocks and repression .
And in the south , it is now pounding Gaza 's teeming neighborhoods with high explosives , while preparing for a ground invasion .
As for Iran , Morris spoke for the bullying state that he represents in an op - ed piece that the Times published in July , essentially threatening the Iranian people with nuclear annihilation .
Urging a conventional bombing attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities , Morris wrote then that the operation would result in " thousands of Iranian casualties and international humiliation " for Iran .
He added that , if this attack failed to halt Iran 's nuclear program , " The alternative is an Iran turned into a nuclear wasteland . "
In his latest piece , Morris reserves what he perceives as the darkest threat for last : demography .
The very existence of 1.3 million Arab citizens inside Israel 's pre-1967 borders , he warns , " offers the recipe " for the " dissolution of the Jewish state . "
These Arab - Israelis , he states , have become " radicalized " and are " embracing Palestinian national aims . "
Moreover , higher birthrates among Arab - Israelis , if the trend continues , mean that they would constitute the majority of Israel 's citizens by as early as 2040 .
Within as little as five years , Arabs could become the majority within the borders of pre-1948 Palestine ( including Israel , the West Bank and Gaza ) .
" Most Jews , " Morris asserts , " see the Arab minority as a potential fifth column . "
He concludes that the threats facing Israel are " difficult to counter " because of Israel 's commitment to " Western democratic and liberal norms . "
He adds darkly that the sense of danger from these developments " has this past week led to one violent reaction .
Given the new realities , it would not be surprising if more powerful explosions were to follow . "
For the casual reader of the Times , this piece by Morris is clearly meant to inculcate a weary acceptance of still greater atrocities in the name of Israeli " self defense . "
The politics of Benny Morris
But , as the Times is well aware , Morris is a fervent and public advocate of ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians .
For those more familiar with his political record , the genocidal conclusions that flow from his arguments are clear .
Morris first gained a name for himself as one of Israel 's so - called " new historians , " who in the 1980s exposed the founding myths of the Zionist state and provided documentary evidence that Israel was established only through the violent and forced expulsion of up to three - quarters of a million Palestinians from their land .
This population of stateless refugees has now swelled to nearly 4 million .
While he was then considered a man of the left , beginning in 2000 , with the onset of the second Intifada and the collapse of the Camp David " final status " talks , he turned sharply to the right .
He upheld his earlier findings — and produced new ones showing that Israeli military forces were responsible for a deliberate campaign of massacres and rapes aimed at driving out the Palestinians — but then defended these crimes as necessary and justifiable .
In a January 2004 interview with Ha'aretz Magazine , Morris spelled out his position : " Under some circumstances expulsion is not a war crime .
I do n't think that the expulsions of 1948 were war crimes .
You can't make an omelet without breaking eggs .
You have to dirty your hands . "
Morris went further , declaring that Israel 's founder , David Ben-Gurion , " should have done a complete job " and " cleaned the whole country " of Arabs .
As historical justification , he added , " Even the great American democracy could not have been created without the annihilation of the Indians . "
" There are circumstances in history that justify ethnic cleansing , " he continued .
" I know that this term is completely negative in the discourse of the 21st century , but when the choice is between ethnic cleansing and genocide — the annihilation of your people — I prefer ethnic cleansing . "
Morris was not merely offering his opinions on history .
He insisted in his 2004 interview that under " other circumstances ... which are likely to be realized in five or ten years , " characterized by war and crisis , " acts of expulsion will be entirely reasonable .
They may even be essential . "
Elsewhere in the Ha'aretz interview , he described the Palestinian people as " a wild animal that has to be locked up in one way or another , " and he concluded , " When the choice is between destroying or being destroyed , it 's better to destroy . "
This is the language of fascism .
It offers a pseudo - intellectual justification of the policy known in Israel as " transfer " — that is , the forced expulsion of the remaining Arab population from Israeli territory , and potentially from the West Bank and Gaza as well .
Initially championed by such fascistic elements as the late Meir Kahane , it has been increasingly embraced by Israel 's main parties and leaders .
Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni , a leading candidate for prime minister , expressed this policy somewhat delicately recently , declaring that as Israel 's leader she would " approach the Palestinian residents of Israel ... and tell them : ‘ Your national aspirations lie elsewhere . ' "
The distinction that Morris makes between ethnic cleansing and genocide is a false one .
One practice leads to the other .
The Nazis ' " final solution " initially called for forced emigration , the expulsion of Jews from Germany .
Then came the death camps .
The Times ' publication of Morris 's column only underscores its own opportunistic and cynical attitude towards ethnic cleansing and genocide .
Whether it opposes these practices or tacitly accepts them is entirely dependent on who is carrying them out and whose interests are served .
Thus , on Sunday it published a piece by its columnist Nicholas Kristof urging Obama to take military action against Sudan over what he described as genocide in Darfur .
Similarly , the newspaper was a major proponent of US intervention in the former Yugoslavia in response to ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and charges of the same in Kosovo .
When opposing ethnic cleansing serves to further US consolidation of its control over oil - rich countries in Africa or to expand eastward the domination of NATO , it becomes a moral imperative .
When it is practiced by US allies , it is quietly supported .
The slaughter in Gaza and the more horrific crimes being suggested by the likes of Morris are a telling indication of the political , social and moral blind alley reached by the nationalist project initiated under the banner of Zionism .
In 1938 , Leon Trotsky stated that the " attempt to solve the Jewish question through the migration of Jews to Palestine " represented a " tragic mockery of the Jewish people . "
He issued a prescient warning that " The future development of military events may well transform Palestine into a bloody trap " and insisted that " the salvation of the Jewish people is bound up inseparably with the overthrow of the capitalist system . "
Seventy years on , the Zionist project threatens to become a " bloody trap " not only for working people in Israel , but for the entire region .
The only alternative remains the struggle to unite the working class , Jewish and Arab alike , in a common fight against capitalism and for the creation of a socialist federation of the Middle East .
Bill Van Auken
Geir Haarde this afternoon spoke to journalists explaining that the government coalition between his Independence Party and the Social Democrats is now over .
He will officially inform President Olafur Ragnar Grimsson of the situation at 16.00 this afternoon at the President ’s Bessastadir residence .
In his speech , Haarde explained that , unfortunately , the two parties had not been able to come to an agreement .
A large part of the problem was , apparently , the Independence Party ’s refusal to give the post of Prime Minister over to the Social Democrats .
He defended his party ’s point - of - view , saying that the smaller of the governing parties cannot be allowed to hold the office of Prime Minister in a cabinet that is already made up of an equal number of both parties ’ ministers .
Haarde said that the Social Democrats have been very difficult to work with recently ; but that his relationship with their leader , Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Solrun Gisladottir , has remained strong .
Haarde stated that his preferred option now would be for the country to be governed by a unity coalition of all ( or nearly all ) political parties until the general election on 9th May .
Although he still feels next winter would have been the best time for elections , the most important thing now is not to allow the entire political system to become paralysed for the next three months .
The Islamic movement Hamas is taking over from Fatah , the party created by Yasser Arafat , as the main Palestinian national organisation as a result of the war in Gaza , says a leading Fatah militant .
" We have moved into the era of Hamas which is now much stronger than it was , " said Husam Kadr , a veteran Fatah leader in the West Bank city of Nablus , recently released after five - and - a - half years in Israeli prisons .
" Its era started when Israel attacked Gaza on 27 December . "
The sharp decline in support for Fatah and the discrediting of Mahmoud Abbas , President of the Palestinian Authority , because of his inertia during the 22 - day Gaza war , will make it very difficult for the US and the EU to pretend that Fatah are the true representatives of the Palestinian community .
The international community is likely to find it impossible to marginalise Hamas in reconstructing Gaza .

" Hamas has been highly successful in portraying itself as the party of the resistance , and Fatah and Mahmoud Abbas as the opponents of resistance at a time [ when ] the public wants to resist , " said Ghassan Khatib , a former Palestinian minister of planning .
He adds that Mr Abbas was badly damaged in the eyes of Palestinians when he blamed Hamas for Israel 's assault on Gaza in the conflict 's first two days .
Mr Kadr , who says he was tortured by Israeli interrogators during detention , does not welcome Hamas 's triumph .
But he is convinced that , just as Fatah 's long reign was launched by the battle of Karamah in March 1968 , when Fatah fighters aided by the Jordanian army , repelled an Israeli attack on their HQ in the Jordan valley , so Hamas will gain from the Gaza war .
" The Hamas era comes 40 years after Karamah began the Fatah period , " he says .
Hamas is conscious of its political success even if it was able to do little against the Israeli army .
Mr Khatib , in his office in Ramallah , the Palestinian capital on the West Bank , says the first priority must be the formation of a Palestinian unity government between Hamas and Fatah .
But he adds gloomily that " the chances of this happening are slim " because the Gaza war has exacerbated hatred between the two sides as Fatah supporters are hunted down and sometimes executed in Gaza .
Aside from Gaza there is another reason why President Abbas and Fatah are weak .
Long years of negotiations with Israel have achieved nothing while red-roofed Israeli settlements have sprouted on every West Bank hilltop .
Driving into Nablus , a city of 250,000 people that was once the bustling heart of the West Bank , the streets are empty and row after row of shops are shut .
" We had eight years of complete closure when people could not get in or out of Nablus aside from the 3 per cent who had permits , " complains the city 's mayor Adly Yaish .
" Most factories shut and 60 per cent of people live below the poverty line . "
The closure became a little looser three months ago , but yesterday there were long lines of vehicles at the Israeli checkpoints around the city .
The rise of Hamas and the demise of Fatah is best explained by the failure of President Abbas to achieve anything through negotiations for ordinary Palestinians .
" We in Fatah have failed to remove a single Israeli checkpoint , " admits Mr Kadr .
" It takes me as long to reach Ramallah 50 kilometres away as it would to fly from Jordan to Ankara . "
He believes the Gaza war has spread the seeds for another Palestinian uprising .
" The coming uprising will be very hard for both the Palestinians and the Israelis , " he warns , though he does not forecast when it will occur .
He points to a television in his office on which a young Palestinian girl called Dalal is shown picking through the ruins of her house in Gaza where all her family had died and only her cat had survived .
" Can you imagine how Palestinians feel when they see this ? " he asks .

Pakistan was locked in crisis last night , with the government pressed by Washington to deepen its conflict with Islamic militants in the lawless regions on the Afghan border , and obliged to call in the International Monetary Fund to stave off financial catastrophe .
In the rugged north of the country , a major military offensive to root out Taliban militants has created a flood of up to 200,000 refugees and pitched Pakistani against Pakistani , Muslim against Muslim , in a conflict some are beginning to regard as a civil war .
A new US intelligence estimate meanwhile has warned that the renewed insurgency , coupled with energy shortages and political infighting , means that Pakistan , which is the only Muslim nation with nuclear weapons , is " on the edge " .

" Pakistan is going through the worst crisis of its history , " according to a leaked letter signed by the former prime minister Nawaz Sharif , the main opposition leader .
It is a view shared by Imran Khan , another opposition leader , who says that the political and economic meltdown " is leading to a sort of anarchy in Pakistan " .
" How does a country collapse ? " the former cricketer asked .
" There 's increasing uncertainty , economic meltdown , more people on the street , inflation rising between 25 and 30 per cent .
Then there 's the rupee falling . "
Pakistan is experiencing power cuts that have led to hourly blackouts , a doubling of basic food prices and a currency that has lost a third of its value in the past year .
" The awful thing is there 's no solution in sight – neither in the war on terror nor on the economic side , " Mr Khan said during a visit to London .
Heightening the sense of national emergency , the government yesterday turned to the International Monetary Fund for $ 15 bn ( £ 9.3 bn ) to cope with a balance of payments crisis caused by a flight of capital , after previously saying that applying to the IMF would be a last resort .
Almost every day there are retaliatory attacks against police and soldiers and Western targets .
Hundreds of soldiers and an unknown number of civilians are losing their lives .
The national parliament rejected the US influence on the government by adopting a resolution last night calling for an " independent " foreign policy and urging dialogue with the extremists .
The military operation against the so - called Pakistan Taliban is concentrated in the largely autonomous tribal areas that border Afghanistan .
A total of 120,000 troops and paramilitary forces have been deployed against what senior officers say is a skilled and tenacious enemy .
" They do not fight in one place , you can not fight them in one place .
It 's basically guerrilla warfare , " said Lt Col Haider Baseer , a military spokesman .
" The area is mountainous , it 's vast .
And everybody carries a gun .
It 's the culture . "
Long accused of failing to confront the militants , the military angrily points out that up to 1,500 soldiers and many more civilians have been killed in such operations since 2001 .
America has triggered national anger by dispatching troops from Afghanistan to attack a Pakistani village .
At the same time , Pakistani officials point out that US and Nato forces in Afghanistan are looking to negotiate with the Taliban – something they have previously criticised Islamabad for doing .
Mr Khan claimed that the US - led " war on terror " had led to " approximately one million " men taking up arms in the tribal areas .
" The total al - Qa'ida who were supposed to be in Pakistan were 800 to 1,200 people .
This is the biggest gift of George Bush to al - Qa'ida , what he 's done there , " said Mr Khan .
" It 's like a factory of terror , it 's producing terrorists , radicalising our society , pushing those people who had nothing to do with al - Qa'ida or Taliban into the arms of militancy and opposing the Americans and the Pakistan army , " he said .
Although Mr Khan leads the marginal Pakistan Tehrik - e - Insaf – which boycotted the last election – his views carry weight because of the strong moral stand he has taken in support of an independent judiciary and against endemic corruption , according to Pakistani analysts .
This week , perhaps partly to try to smooth relations , Richard Boucher , the US Assistant Secretary of State , praised the current military operation , which is said to have killed up to 1,000 militants .
" I think it is good Pakistan is taking serious military action against the terrorists , " he told reporters during a trip to the country , during which he met the recently elected President , Asif Ali Zardari .
But Mr Zardari 's coalition government is weak and the civilian president is accused by critics such as Mr Khan of being a " puppet " of the Americans , as was his predecessor , Pervez Musharraf .
Suicide bombs have become a near - daily occurrence .
There have been more than 100 since July 2007 , killing around 1,200 people .
In 2006 , there were just six such attacks .
A report by the Pakistan 's ISI intelligence agency suggested that in the first eight months of the year , more people were killed by suicide bombers in Pakistan than in Iraq or Afghanistan .
It remains unclear whether the army will continue to remain on the sidelines , as General Musharraf 's successor as army chief - of - staff , General Ashfaq Pervez Kiyani , has pledged to do .
But the army could act as a power broker from behind the scenes .
" I have never known as much uncertainty as this , " said Mr Khan , who is based in Lahore and is visiting his children who live with his former wife , Jemima Khan .
The security risks are now so grave for Pakistani politicians that for the first time , Mr Khan is considering wearing a bulletproof vest after receiving death threats .
Find and Replace : Replace " FUCK " with " FUCK YOU APPLE "
This guy David Carnoy recently wrote and self - published a by - the - numbers thriller called " Knife Music , " which he tried to turn into a stand - alone application for the iPhone .
Apple ran his book through their iCensor and then rejected it because they found the word " fuck " in the back somewhere .
" Applications must not contain any obscene , pornographic , offensive or defamatory content or materials of any kind ( text , graphics , images , photographs , etc. ) , or other content or materials that in Apple 's reasonable judgement may be found objectionable by iPhone or iPod touch users . " 1 ) .
Is n't Apple selling Dr. Dre brand headphones for $ 400 ? 2 ) . Businesses do not have more " rights " than the government , which must abide by the Constitution , and therefore the 1st Amendment .
You cannot create a product which violates the Constitution , like making some kind of portable electronic device which causes people to be your slave . 3 ) .
Apple is only a business , you know .
They used to make useless computers , now they make phones and Walkmans .
At first , Carnoy was all like : " Dang , man , this seems like a violation of my rights as an author .
Are you gonna ban all books with " dirty " words ?
That 's most books , and that 's ALL literature .
Are you just stupid ; stupider than Kings and Queens ?
Do n't you know that all English " dirty " words are really original Anglo - Saxon formal nouns that were glazed over with French replacements in 1066 when England was sacked by William the Conqueror ?
Are you racist against Picts and Jutes too , or do you merely hate language itself , a technology that cannot be sealed inside a smooth chrome box and sold for two thousand dollars and a subscription fee ?
" And then Carnoy sighed and said : " Apple is treating me like a child so I will act like a child and I will behave .
" Instead of filing a lawsuit and making millions of dollars , Carnoy went ahead and changed the " inappropriate " line of dialog , resubmitted it to the Apple Store , and got the book approved by their watchdog committee ( Do you really want to read the " thriller " of a writer who is so pusillanimous : a writer who wo n't even stand up to a phone company ? )
From the " Knife Music " website " Tense and twisting , Knife Music is the story of a doctor struggling to clear his name after being accused of raping and causing the suicide of a young girl .
The novel pits Cogan , a 43 - year - old surgeon and self - described womanizer , against Hank Madden , a handicapped veteran detective .
From the outset it 's not clear who is victim and who is victimizer , as the usually dispassionate Madden grapples with his long - suppressed prejudices and his obsession with bringing Ted Cogan to justice at any cost -- to the doctor or himself .
It all leads up to the most stunning surprise ending since Scott Turow 's Presumed Innocent .
" The offensive line of dialog comes when some teenage girl tells a detective that her dead friend asked Cogan to " fuck me like you mean it .
" What did Carnoy change this devastating line to ?
" Enter me like you mean it ? " " Eat me like you mean it ? "
Does n't this ruin the sense of timing and the shock - glitch that good profanity provides ?
If the government were trying to do this , every artist in the country would be up in arms and ready to burn shit down .
But since it is APPLE ( Oh God -- APPLE ) , everybody is taking notes , trying to figure out how to make them happy .
" Note : Please DO NOT include profanity when you write any novels about diabolical surgeons raping and murdering teenage girls .
THANX . ;- p" It 's hard to watch a fiction writer be such a gutless serf .
Hopefully , he will snap out of it and remember his roots .
If Apple picks a fight with literature , literature will destroy them like it has destroyed every other culture , ideology , country , or tyrant who has tried to control it .
Literature only looks like it is sleeping .
Literature is sleep itself , and its teeth and claws are dreams , time , and perspective .
If Apple picks this fight , literature will wait for Apple to die , and then it will write the epitaph , and it will be fucking ugly , fucking funny , and most of all , motherfucking sad .
Names will be named .
iNames will be iNamed .
UPDATED BELOW
I do n't usually reveal sources , but I think this is incredibly important .
Michael Connell died in a plane crash last night .
He was a key witness in the Ohio election fraud case that I have been reporting on .
More importantly , however , he had information that he was ready to share .
You see , Mike Connell set - up the alternate email and communications system for the White House .
He was responsible for creating the system that hosted the infamous GWB43.com accounts that Karl Rove and others used .
When asked by Congress to provide these emails , the White House said that they were destroyed .
But in reality , what Connell is alleged to have done is move these files to other servers after having allegedly scrubbed the files from all " known " Karl Rove accounts .
In addition , I have reason to believe that the alternate accounts were used to communicate with US Attorneys involved in political prosecutions , like that of Don Siegelman .
This is what I have been working on to prove for over a year .
In fact , it was through following the Siegelman - Rove trail that I found evidence leading to Connell .
That is how I became aware of him .
Mike was getting ready to talk .
He was frightened .
He has flown his private plane for years without incident .
I know he was going to DC last night , but I do n't know why .
He apparently ran out of gas , something I find hard to believe .
I am not saying that this was a hit nor am I resigned to this being simply an accident either .
I am no expert on aviation and cannot provide an opinion on the matter .
What I am saying , however , is that given the context , this event needs to be examined carefully .
If you want to understand the context more broadly , I suggest you read this article I did a while back about the break -ins and arson cases that Siegelman and others have experienced .
Just to be very clear and state again , I am not claiming conspiracy theory or direct relation to Karl Rove or the White House in any of these events .
What I am saying , however , is that these possible relationships cannot and should not be overlooked by investigators .
There are far too many serious and reasonable questions that must be answered for the public .
I have been to Mr. Connell 's home .
Mr. Connell has confided that he was being threatened , something that his attorneys also told the judge in the Ohio election fraud case .
When I met with Heather , his wife , I did so carefully because of the threats he was getting .
I left a note for her in her mailbox and asked her to meet me in a local park near their home .
Heather came and through our conversation I got the sense that these were not bad people or corrupt people .
The Connell 's really believed that what they were involved in served God 's plan .
Regardless of of what any of us think about their religious views or allegations relating to Connell 's involvement in various things , I do think these were good people who got caught up in something bigger than themselves .
My heart goes out to Heather and the children .
UPDATE ONE
Okay children - because that is what I am going to call adults who willfully mis-read information .
I will say this AGAIN ( as I have twice in the above entry and also used bold case so that no one would miss the caveat ) , I am NOT - I repeat NOT - saying this was a ) .
a murder , b ) .
that it was in any way connected to the White House or to Karl Rove , and c ) .
that I am convinced of any of the above three .
On the contrary , I have said - AND AM NOTING AGAIN - that I do n't know what happened .
I am NOT an aviation expert .
What I am saying - AGAIN - is that the context is important and must be considered .
Investigators must conduct their work transparently on this case as to address the many serious and reasonable ( not remotely CT - based questions ) relating to this crash and the person who died .
The public has a right to know and investigators must address these questions by conducting a very open investigation of the crash .
The facts are not all in yet and so I have no answers for you - AS I HAVE ALREADY NOTED .
But I felt it important to share the context , obligated even to share it .
Now if you folks ( you know who you are ) want to read this as me rolling myself in tin-foil , then that is your choice .
Obviously that is not my hope , but I cannot help the lunacy that people want to engage in .

Sun has upgraded MySQL Enterprise , its subscription - based service for the open - source MySQL database , adding access to a query analysis tool for tracking and fixing problematic code and performance issues .
The tool allows users to perform real - time analysis of " all queries across all servers , " as well as search and sort them according to metrics such as content , date / time and query type , according to Sun .
MySQL users can already investigate poor query performance through the database 's " slow query " log , but the new tool makes the process much more efficient , said Rob Young , senior product manager for MySQL Enterprise .
One analyst said the tool is a welcome addition to the service , but not groundbreaking .
" MySQL Query Analyzer is just one of many ways in which MySQL is playing catch - up with more mature DBMS products , " said Curt Monash , founder of Monash Research , via e-mail .
" It should be helpful to smaller enterprises that do their reporting on MySQL . "
The tool has been integrated with MySQL Enterprise Monitor , which helps database administrators track the health of their servers .
Subscribers to the MySQL Enterprise service get monthly software updates , service packs each quarter and " emergency hot fix builds , " as well as 24 - 7 support .
The updated service is scheduled to be available within a month .
Pricing ranges from US$ 599 to $ 4,999 per server per year , or as an " unlimited site - wide agreement " that starts at $ 40,000 per year .
Sun is also offering free 30 - day trial subscriptions .
The company , which announced it was laying off up to 6,000 employees last week , is banking increasingly on software assets like MySQL as its high - end server business continues to struggle .
Editta Sherman , a 96 - year - old portrait photographer , announced back in October that she would n’t leave her rent - controlled apartment above Carnegie Hall , which the state wants to repurpose for educational facilities , for less than $ 10 million .
Who can blame her ?
As you can see from the photo , the apartment is amazing , and Editta looks fab in it .
Plus , she ’s lived there for the past half century — as long as Madonna has been alive ! — and only pays $ 530 a month .
As her old friend George Gershwin might have said , they ca n’t take that away from her .
Or they ought not to .
But today the Post reports that the state has served Editta with an eviction notice .
Sure , the paper reports , they offered to relocate residents “ to equivalent or superior apartments in the neighborhood , paying any differential in rent for the remainder of their lives . ”
But is that good enough ?
No. Because Editta ’s battle is not just about real estate .
It is not about an old lady ’s right to live out her days in peace .
It ’s not even about standing tall against developers a.k.a.
The Man. Editta and her apartment , with its checked floors and cast - iron staircase and grand location , are one of the last beacons of hope for all creative - class New Yorkers .
They symbolize the Great New York Dream :
That we will someday land the perfect , beautiful , cheap apartment in a great area that we will live in forever .
Without that dream , New York would n’t even have a creative class .
We ’d all move to Pennsylvania .
Thankfully , Editta knows the importance of her position and is up to the challenge : “ I ’m never leaving , ” she told the Post today .
“ They ’ll have to drag me out .
They ’ll have to use their bare hands . ”
Shine on , Editta .

When Your Pain Has No Name Chronic pain can be all the more traumatic when its origins are a mystery .
Nov. 5 , 2008  -- Cynthia Toussaint was a ballerina .
She was no stranger to the aches , pains and occasional injuries that came with the trade .
So when the pain from an injury to a right hamstring would n't subside , Toussaint , then 21 , did what she could to endure it .
After all , she had auditions to attend -- in particular , a promising role in the musical Fame .
When the burning , unrelenting pain was too much to bear , however , she sought a doctor 's opinion .
" I was told that I would n't dance for eight weeks and I thought , ' No , they 're wrong , ' " she recalls .
But the pain would last for much longer than eight weeks .
For months it persisted .
A year and a half after the pain in her right leg started , she began to experience a similar pain in her left leg .
Six and a half years after that , the pain had spread to both arms .
The spread of her condition was not always so gradual .
One morning , she woke up to find that her left arm had bent itself into a state of permanent contracture .
" It was so shocking to wake up to find that one of my arms would not unfold anymore , " she says .
Today the pain is everywhere .
Toussaint describes it as a feeling as if she has " been doused with gasoline and lit on fire ... burning from the inside out ...
It 's pain like I never imagined . "
The condition which ushered Toussaint into a life of chronic agony also gradually robbed her of her ability to dance , her ability to walk -- and , as it spread to her vocal cords , her ability to talk .
" Here I am 26 years later in a wheelchair , " she says .
" I had everything ; my life was just starting .
Suddenly I had this injury that never goes away . "
Her voice would eventually return .
But for years , Toussaint 's battle with chronic pain and loss of function came spiked with the bitter reality that no matter how many doctors she saw , none could give her an accurate diagnosis of her condition .
Worse , without a solid diagnosis , she says many physicians refused to take her case seriously .
" I was told that I was crazy for 13 and a half years , " Toussaint says .
Once , one of her doctors told her to take a truth serum so she would admit that she was not truly in pain .
Another suggested that she was fabricating her pain condition due to stage fright .
And a visit to yet another doctor was met with even greater insensitivity , she recalls .
" I said , ' What should I do ? ' and he said , ' Shoot yourself in the head . '
He thought it was funny . "
More than a decade had passed before Toussaint found that she suffered from a mysterious condition known as complex regional pain syndrome ( CRPS ) , alternatively known as reflex sympathetic dystrophy syndrome ( RSD ) .
The nature of the condition continues to baffle doctors , as does its exact cause .
But finally , her pain had a name .
" When I got my diagnosis , it could n't have been worse , " Toussaint says .
" But it was the happiest day of my life .
They could never say I was crazy again . "
Patients Battle Pain , Stigma
Toussaint 's struggle with her condition turned her into an activist against pain .
She launched the nonprofit site For Grace , devoted to helping women find answers about their chronic pain .
More recently , she has channeled her crusade against chronic pain conditions into the political realm , making it a centerpiece of her run for a California state congressional seat in 2006 and in other political efforts to bring more attention to these conditions .
It is a success story that stands in stark relief against the lives of those who are still searching for answers to their agony .
Michael Smith , associate professor in psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore , says that there are a number of pain conditions for which the origins and exact causes are still unknown .
" We 're supposed to be this wonderful medical system that can do anything , that can save lives , " Smith says .
" But we really do n't know enough about pain . "
" It is often difficult to come up with a diagnosis for a patient with chronic pain in particular , " agrees Dr. Paul Christo , director of the Multidisciplinary Pain Fellowship at the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine .
" Sometimes these types of pain do have names , but we still do n't understand the exact mechanisms of the pain . "
And because chronic pain is often misunderstood , many patients go without the treatment they need .
This , in itself is a problem ; untreated , chronic pain conditions can actually worsen , recruiting more nerves until the pain spreads throughout the body .
Dr. Doris Cope , director of the Pain Medicine Program at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center , says that this spread is often ignored -- particularly in the absence of a proper diagnosis .
" Some doctors say , ' Oh , there 's nothing wrong with you , ' " she says .
" Meanwhile there is pain . "
Still , patients may find themselves swept into dismissing their conditions as well .
" First of all they begin to doubt it themselves , " Cope says .
" Secondly , they get the feeling of helplessness and hopelessness .
They do n't know what 's happening . "
Worse , for these sufferers chronic pain has not only a physical component but an emotional one as well .
As the pain spreads , the same chemical signals involved in depression , anxiety and stress also come into play , commencing a symphony of physical and emotional misery for the chronic pain patient .
" For many people , their pain takes over their entire life .
It affects their work life , their family life , their social life , " Cope says .
It is a personal tragedy to which Toussaint can attest .
" It destroyed every relationship in my life except for my relationship with my partner , John , " she says .
" He stood by me , but my entire family left me behind .
" The emotional pain becomes more serious than the physical pain . "
Chronic Pain , Depression Closely Linked
Little surprise , then , that chronic pain is regularly tied to depression .
" Imagine that you develop chronic pain and in time you are no longer able to work , " Christo says .
" That can be very disruptive and lead to a loss of self - esteem and self - worth .
At the same time , it can change the nature of your relationship with your family and friends .
" If the patient has lost their sense of self - worth and become depressed , that in turn can lead to social isolation . "
Smith agrees .
" [ Patients ] get the feeling that they really can't control the pain ; they feel helpless about it ...
In some cases these patients can go to full - blown clinical depression . "
The roots of this depression even appear to transcend emotions alone .
On Monday , scientists revealed additional biological clues as to why pain and depression may be so closely linked .
A team of researchers led by Irina Strigo of the University of California San Diego compared brain scans of people with depression to those of 15 people who were not depressed while these subjects anticipated or experienced a painful sensation .
What the researchers found was that those with depression showed a higher level of activity in the areas of their brain that processed emotions .
Moreover , the regions of the brain that are normally involved in mitigating pain were less active in the depressed subjects -- a hint that chronic pain may have a propensity to feedback on itself .
Toussaint says the depression that accompanied her chronic pain was nearly too much for her to bear .
" I suffered very , very extreme depression , " she says .
" All of us with pain do .
We 're being tortured 24/7 , we 're not believed , and our lives are upside - down .
" I had a plan of suicide -- not because of the physical pain but because everyone I knew had abandoned me . "
Fighting the Pain
Fortunately , pain experts say , the majority of those battling mysterious chronic pain can find answers if they search long enough .
" Most pain does have a label , " Cope says .
" If you can find some general idea of what 's causing your pain , you can tailor treatment toward that . "
" A lot of people do n't realize that there are treatments available , " Christo says .
" We do have some pretty reasonable treatments for people that can help control the pain and increase quality of life . "
As for the best way to access these resources , Christo says pain sufferers can start with a simple Internet search , using their symptoms as search terms .
" What will usually come up is a description of the condition , and sometimes a directory of self - help groups , " he says , adding that some support Web sites even have suggestions for doctor referrals .
For those who have found themselves being pinballed from one doctor to the next , finding a multidisciplinary pain management center may be the best step .
Here , patients can afford themselves an entire spectrum of care services -- from pain physicians and physical therapists , to psychiatrists trained in helping those with chronic pain come to deal with their conditions .
" Medication , injections , physical therapy and pain psychology all can come together to significantly improve quality of life , " Christo says .
For Toussaint , the medicine that worked best was the anti-seizure drug Neurontin .
Today , this medication , combined with a physical therapy regimen that incorporates Eastern and Western healing techniques , allows her to control the pain brought about by her condition .
As is the case with some who face chronic pain , Toussaint may live with her condition for the rest of her life .
But she says that those who face a similar struggle must take heart that an answer exists for their mysterious pain .
" Know that you 're not alone , " she says .
" Know that you 're pain is real .
And know that you deserve the dignity of proper diagnosis and treatment . "

FOR A FLEETING TIME TUESDAY AFTERNOON , the stars in the stock market were aligned in a configuration not seen in a half - century : shares yielded more than bonds .
Specifically , the dividend yield on the Standard & Poor 's 500 stock index touched 3.57 % at 1:13 PM Eastern time , exceeding the 3.54 % yield on the benchmark Treasury 10 - year note , according to Bloomberg News .
That 's something that had n't happened since 1958 .
I was aware that there was a time when equities provided more income than bonds , but that belonged to a long - gone era .
That was a time I knew of only from old movies , yellowed newspaper clippings and stacks of old Life magazines .
It was when gentlemen wore suits and fedoras , not just to work but even to the ballpark ; when the Dodgers played in Brooklyn ; a bygone era already a half century ago .
To contemporary market observers , it 's more than nostalgia .
For the S&P 500 to yield more than Treasuries suggests the market is very cheap by historical standards , says Jack Ablin , portfolio strategist for Harris Private Bank .
" Dividend yield , like price - to - sales , is one of those persistent metrics .
We can all quibble about earnings , but dividends , particularly those of the entire S&P 500 , are remarkably consistent , " he adds .
" You can fake earnings through hanky - panky , but you cannot fake dividends , " agrees Barry Ritholtz , chief executive and director of equity research at Fusion IQ .
So after a 47 % drop , stocks look relatively cheap for the first time in a long time , he adds .
Scott Minerd , chief investment officer for Guggenheim Partners , calls the drop in Treasury yields below the S&P 500 dividend yield a " straw in the wind " that the stock market may be bottoming .
Still , he thinks the market is signaling that dividend cuts are in the offing , but this recessionary trend also will push Treasury yields still lower .
Indeed , Paul Kasriel , chief U.S. economist at Northern Trust , agrees the dividend yield on the S&P 500 implies " the numerator in that fraction is likely to decline in 2009 . "
But to Richard Russell , who started his Dow Theory Letter a half century ago , this reversal of fortune suggests the 10 - year Treasury yield is " unnaturally low . "
After all , triple - A tax - free municipals outyield comparable Treasuries as the headlong flight to quality has boosted the prices of government securities and the dollar .
" It 's a general sign of profound risk aversion ( and a flight to quality ) , adds Douglas A. Kass , who head Seabreeze Partners Management .
" And in a broad sense , the absence of a differential [ between the S&P 500 and Treasury 10 - year yield ] reflects a growing sense that corporate profit growth will be limited over the next couple of years , " he says .
Indeed , that lack of difference also reflects the low level of expected future inflation , Kass adds .
That also is reflected in the so - called TIPS spread ( the difference between regular and inflation - indexed notes ) , which implies the consumer price index will rise just 0.64 % annually for the next 10 years .
Adds Dominic Constar , interest - rate strategist at Credit Suisse , the convergence of stock and Treasury yields suggests that corporations , including banks , have been slow to cut payouts " as the economy teeters on a deflationary abyss . "
This would mark a reversal of the trends that pushed bond yields above stock yields a half century ago .
After World War II , " growth was in the air , as was slow and steady inflation , " says Rob Arnott , the head of Research Affiliates , an institutional advisory firm .
" So , yield plus growth ( stocks ) could trump yield alone ( bonds . )
For the next 50 years , that was the norm . "
At the time , however , it was viewed as an aberration , writes Peter Bernstein , the eminent economic historian .
But despite a severe recession then , with real gross domestic product plunging at a shocking 10.4 % annual rate in the second quarter of 1958 , the CPI failed to subside as in past downturns .
After equity yields had exceeded Treasury yields since 1929 , the two flip - flopped in 1958 and never looked back .
During the inflationary uptrend of the next two decades , bond yields would soar into the mid-teens by the time of their peak in 1981 .
That was far above dividend yields , which did rise to 6 % , although actual payouts increased substantially .
Even more telling was the relative movements in stock and bond yields over the years .
Bernstein calculates that from 1954 to 1969 -- while inflation was relatively low and stable -- bond and stock yields moved mostly in tandem .
But from 1970 to 1999 -- the Great Inflation -- bond and stock yields moved inversely .
From 2000 on , bond and stock yields have been back in sync .
Arnott takes it a step further .
" In a world of deleveraging , both for the financial services arena and for the economy at large , growth is less certain , " he says .
" And with the economy eroding sharply , so is inflation .
If stocks do n't deliver nominal growth in dividends and earnings , then their yield ' must ' exceed the Treasury yield , in order to give us any sort of risk premium . "
Arnott attributes the concern about future growth to concerns about the incoming Obama administration .
" The markets are suggesting prospects for growth in the new Administration are very worrisome .
Obama can ' create ' a market recovery by voicing some strong support for the power of capitalism ( he could say ' capitalism with a heart ' ) for global wealth creation . "
Perhaps .
I would observe that this cycle has been driven by the bursting of a global credit bubble .
And that happened with a conservative Republican U.S. Administration , a Labor government in the U.K. , center - right and center - left governments in Europe , and a partly Communist , partly market system in the fastest - growing economy in China .
On the positive side , the Group of 20 agreed on broad principles to try to boost growth and avoid protectionism -- a marked difference from the beggar - thy - neighbor policies of the 1930s .
Still , the markets seem to be saying that , notwithstanding the best intentions of governments , the forces of contraction appear to be even greater their powers .
In that context , stocks should yield more than government bonds .

Exclusive to STR
As a child , for reasons I do not recall or understand now upon reflection , I was completely opposed to having to watch any show on television that was not in color .
I assumed that everything in black and white was stale , boring and just plain old , and hence not worth my time when I could be watching cartoons on Nickelodeon .
One show that my parents watched from time to time was ' The Andy Griffith Show , ' which the child version of myself , being what he was , made every effort to avoid .
I went through my childhood and adolescence without seeing anything beyond the intro and hearing that familiar whistle .
By the time of college , I had finally managed to completely shed my color prejudiced view of television programs and cinema .
College was about the time that I really started to think a lot more about politics .
Maybe it 's something about that age and the environment ?
Of course this discovery and transformation period in college led me away from Fox News and towards places like LewRockwell.com , Strike The Root , and the Mises Institute .
Essentially : away from the statist ( probably the very worst of them all : the " neocon " ) towards the libertarian .
This road toward liberty led me to be the Rothbardian market anarchist I am today .
Near graduation , I also started to watch shows and movies that I had missed out on through my younger prejudice .
At some point I revisited ' The Andy Griffith Show ' , and through my now radical libertarian - tinted glasses , my Rothbard goggles , I saw something rather wonderful in the show that every man of even a very slight libertarian leaning can appreciate .
Andy Griffith vs. Barney Fife - Market and Man vs. State
' The Andy Griffith Show ' centered around two police officers in a small North Carolina town : Andy Griffith and his bumbling deputy sidekick Barney Fife .
Andy was portrayed as always civil and ever courteous gentleman , using his wits in place of violence and the pointing of guns , as Barney was all too quick to do , which rarely turned out to work .
It was rare Andy ever arrested anyone who was truly non-violent , and even the violent were treated with a base respect for life .
In episode 95 : " The Big House , " Andy fools two escaped convicts back into the jail instead of turning the streets into a war zone , and to his credit , without hurting the convicts .
He often boasted throughout the show that he accomplished a task without firing a shot himself , and in episode 166 ( " Off to Hollywood " ) , even receives $ 1,000 from the Belmont Film Studio for rights to his story , " Sheriff Without a Gun . "
Andy was much more inclined to resolve all problems he encountered in Mayberry peacefully .
Much like the theorized and realized anarchist society and anarchistic societies in history , he resolved conflict through peaceful ends .
The tendency of Andy to negotiate and peacefully resolve matters is shown in Episode 158 : " Opie and the Carnival , " where a carnival comes to town and scams Andy 's son , Opie .
Opie throws away his money trying to win an electric razor in a carnival game .
The game is rigged , however , and Andy soon finds out .
Andy then sets about to scam the scammers .
He cleans the carnival shelves of prizes , much to the frustration of the dishonest carnies , and then shows them his badge .
He informs the cheats that when Opie comes to try again , he better walk away with a razor .
He did not hurt them or arrest them .
He did not start liberally applying pepper spray and throw them in the tank after an embarrassing and dehumanizing strip search .
He merely demanded that they make right through a form of restitution or he would take legal actions in response to their obvious fraud .
They remained free for a non-violent crime and everyone who was wronged was made happy in the end .
Andy was also opposed to coercively intervening in other people 's affairs that he felt was not his legal or moral right to become involved with .
In one instance , Opie is being bullied by another boy and Andy does not intervene but chooses to let Opie fight his own battles , believing he must learn to stand up for his rights .
Imagine that !
In another episode ( 152 : " The Case of the Punch in the Nose " ) , Barney opens an old case that involved Charley Foley charging Floyd with assault .
The whole ordeal took place such a long time ago that no one even recalls how it began .
Barney , being the statist busybody and the ' look how important I am ! ' sort of goon he is , manages to refresh everyone 's memory and rekindles the nose punching fire of old .
Andy steps in again as the real man -- the adult -- in the scene and convinces everyone to talk out their problems , and it works .
Incredible !
Through peaceful discourse and discussion , the two opposing parties , through the use of a neutral third , achieve a peace without more punching .
Barney , on the other hand , was more than willing to pull a gun and start making threats .
Andy was always shown as possessed of a smooth and easy going character , as opposed to Barney , who constantly tried to flaunt the fact that he was " in charge here ! " .
Barney was in all actuality a weakling and a coward .
This led him put on a show of authority and superiority to compensate for his own insecurities and shortcomings .
In episode 94 ( " Mountain Wedding " ) , Andy and Barney visit the Darling family about a man named Ernest T. Bass who has his mind set on marrying Charlene Darling .
Barney 's immediate reaction to the violence displayed by the quite ignorant and obviously not too mentally healthy family is violence in turn .
But Andy sets up a scheme where Barney ends up posing as the bride , and the day is saved without bloodshed .
Officer
Fife 's over - zealous behavior was the constant source of his anxiousness to resort to violence , and ludicrously tyrannical in his treatment towards any man that may be in the small jail .
In episode 148 ( " Barney Runs for Sheriff " ) , Barney challenges Andy to a public debate and accuses peaceful Andy of not fulfilling his obligations and duties of being a provider of law .
He cites Andy allowing jaywalking ( punishable by death I would imagine in the court of Barney ) , failing to have emergency equipment such as tear gas and submachine guns ( necessary equipment for enforcing jaywalking laws ) , and refusing to carry a sidearm -- failing to recognize that the witty southern American Odysseus , Andy , had no need for it .
Barney was grossly incompetent at his job .
I would say this is mostly due to his inability to see anything but force as a solution to any perceived problem .
In episode 85 ( " The Great Filling Station Robbery " ) , a young man trying to start a honest life after a history of criminal behavior is the primary suspect in a robbery of the gas station he now works at .
Barney is more concerned with using the latest new gadgets that he spends the taxpayers ' money on than in taking any concern for the life of the young suspect .
Andy in contrast spends his time trying to clear the name of the well intentioned man , assuming innocence , not guilt .
In episode 95 mentioned earlier , two escaped convicts are being held in the jail while federal officers call and wait for other federally employed officers to arrive .
Gomer ( Barney 's equally idiotic cousin ) is deputized to help Barney , and between the two , they manage to let the criminals escape three times .
This seems to be a recurring event throughout the series ( Episode 50 : " Jailbreak " adds yet another instance to this case against Barney ) .
In both episodes , his violent behavior led him to overlook other options than force for use against the criminals .
This along with his obsession with being the boss was exploited time and again by the criminals .
Andy : 1 , Barney : 0
Andy Griffith acted like a man .
He behaved time and again like a compassionate human being and not as an officer of the state , not as an embodiment of the government , dogma incarnate .
No , he was more of a negotiator than a guard or a civil violence figure , a policeman .
He tried to settle matters through arbitration and restitution , which often ended in both parties being satisfied or even one admitting his wrongdoing after being reasoned with .
He rarely ever arrested anyone who was truly non-violent , and even the violent were treated with a base respect for life .
And for his civil and peaceful behavior , it was he who held the respect of the whole of the community , and as the superior man to the state figure Barney .
Andy constantly corrects the mistakes of Barney , who fouls up the absolute simplest of tasks .
His incompetence is caused by applying almost childlike bullheadedness and forceful behavior to all scenarios and his need to be everyone 's boss .
If ' The Andy Griffith Show ' was not meant as a commentary on the state , it certainly showed a vision of small towns in the South and man 's preference and reverence for peace , wisdom , and courtesy in all matters ( embodied in Andy ) over war , ignorance , and incivility ( embodied in Barney ) .
For arbitration and settlement , not force and threats .
For restitution and not imprisonment or death .
I am immensely glad that I decided to revisit my past to give this show a shot .
It gives a truly libertarian message of the merits of peace and reason as opposed to ignorance and violence .

Bleak retail sales and accelerating unemployment have hit the UK
The UK is now in recession for the first time since 1991 , official government figures have confirmed .
Gross domestic product fell by 1.5 % in the last three months of 2008 after a 0.6 % drop in the previous quarter .
That means that the widely accepted definition of a recession - two consecutive quarters of negative economic growth - has been met .
It represents the biggest quarter - on - quarter decline since 1980 , and a 1.8 % fall on the same quarter a year ago .
The worse - than - expected contraction sent sterling to a 24 - year low against the dollar , with one pound buying $ 1.355 .
Meanwhile the FTSE 100 index fell almost 2 % , below 4,000 points .
' Broad - based decline '
The figures , from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , showed that manufacturing made the largest contribution to the slowdown , contracting by 4.6 % despite hopes that the weak pound would help exporters .
RECORD QUARTERS
Biggest post - war quarterly decline was - 2.6 % in Q2 1958 Largest drop in one quarter over previous year was - 4.1 % in Q4 1980 Worst fall in one quarter on previous year in 1990s recession was - 2.2 % in Q2 1991

How quickly could the UK recover ?
How to cope during the recession
With the exception of agriculture , all elements of the economy shrank from the previous three months , the ONS added .
The fall in GDP was slightly steeper than most analysts had been expecting , said the BBC 's economics editor Stephanie Flanders .
" These figures suggest that it 's not going to be done by Christmas , " she said .
The downturn was " broad - based " our economics editor added , saying that the bleak manufacturing data ended " any prospect of this being a white - collar recession that would largely escape manufacturers " .
' Sad commentary ' Chancellor Alistair Darling said that the figures underlined the scale of the challenges the government faced .
" It 's going to be a difficult year for families in the UK .
We need to go about the problem with a sense of purpose , " he said .
Countries across the globe were facing recession , he added , saying that the crisis could be solved " better and quicker " if other governments also acted to stimulate their economies .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME

More from Today programme Shadow chancellor George Osborne accused the government of failing to command confidence at home or abroad .
" With unemployment rising faster than anywhere else , and businesses closing every day , these figures are deeply worrying , " he said .
" It 's difficult to see how we 'll get that confidence with a Prime Minister who blames everyone else for the mess we 're in and refuses to acknowledge any mistakes . "
And Liberal Democrat treasury spokesman Vince Cable said the situation was " very serious " .
" It 's a sad commentary on a decade of Labour government that they have succeeded in producing an almost exact replica of the boom - bust cycle we had under the Conservatives . "
' Grim '
What started as a crisis in the financial sector continues to infect the wider economy .
Unemployment is accelerating sharply , with 1.92 million people now out of work , the housing market remains severely depressed and retail sales are weak .
Even though December 's retail figures were better than expected , growing by 1.6 % , this was driven by heavy price - discounting and should be treated " with caution " the ONS said .
We are well into the financial crisis but the economic crisis is only just beginning
Graham Leach
Chief Economist
Institute of Directors " It is difficult to see why things should improve in the foreseeable future , " said Andrew Smith , chief economist at KPMG .
Neil Mackinnon , chief economist at ECU Group , said the GDP figures were " grim " and underscored the depth of the recession .
" There are no green shoots of recovery , no light at the end of the tunnel , " he added .
The average recession in the UK since 1955 has lasted for three quarters , but the past two recessions have lasted for five .
In fact , many forecasters believe a recession could stretch into 2010 and be as severe as that of the early 1990s .
The UK economy was heading for a " long cold winter " which was unlikely to end before spring 2010 , said Graeme Leach , chief economist at the Institute of Directors .
" The debate on the length and depth of the recession is extremely complex and at this stage one cannot be dogmatic about the outcome , " he said .
" The latest recession is beginning to look as if it will be more like the 1980s than the 1990s in terms of lost output .
We are well into the financial crisis but the economic crisis is only just beginning . "
Deteriorating picture GDP is the most commonly used indicator of national income .

It attempts to measure the sum of incomes received by the various wealth - creating sectors of the economy , from manufacturing and retail to agriculture and service industries .
The consensus forecast for 2009 as a whole is now for a 2.1 % decline in GDP .
As recently as December , the forecast was for a drop of 1.5 % .
This highlights the rapidly deteriorating economic picture over recent weeks , during which a number of the UK 's best known high street retailers , such as Woolworths and Zavvi , have gone into administration .
As well as its low against the dollar , the pound has slumped against the euro and many analysts believe that parity is now inevitable .
International investors are said to be losing confidence in the UK economy and the government 's attempts to kick - start lending from the banks .
The official government forecast is for the economy to shrink between 0.75 % and 1.25 % in 2009 , although the Chancellor Alistair Darling has indicated that he will revise this figure in the Budget .
Injection Efforts to prevent the recession deepening have been widespread , though critics say they have not gone far enough .
The Bank of England has aggressively cut interest rates to 1.5 % - aimed at driving down the cost of lending and making it easier for consumers and businesses to access credit .
However , banks have been reluctant to lend sufficiently , despite a £ 37bn injection into major banks , and a scheme to offer insurance to banks against potential losses on risky loans .
A temporary cut in value added tax ( VAT ) , from 17.5 % to 15 % , was an attempt to encourage consumers to spend and boost the retail sector and wider economy .

The Pope is said to be fond of new technologies Pope Benedict XVI has launched his own dedicated channel on the popular video sharing website , YouTube .
Video and audio footage of his speeches as well as news of the Holy See will be posted on the site , the Vatican says .
Although the Vatican has its own website , the YouTube venture represents its biggest reach into cyberspace , says the BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome .
Vatican officials say it is aimed at everyone from devout Catholics to the casual web user .
But there is a debate within the Catholic Church about the value of the internet as a missionary tool , our correspondent says .
' Digital generation '
The 81 - year - old Pope 's first YouTube message spoke of a new way to spread hope around the world : " You must find ways to spread - in a new manner - voices and pictures of hope , through the internet , which wraps all of our planet in an increasingly close - knitted way , " he said in Italian .
HAVE YOUR SAY I think it is great .
I am converting currently so would be good to watch .
Charlotte Kohler , London Working in collaboration with YouTube 's owners , Google , the Vatican is to supply a variety of material for its new channel , which was launched on the Church 's World Day of Communications .
Featuring text , audio and video initially in English , German , Spanish and Italian , the channel marks the Vatican 's latest foray into new media .
The Vatican 's own website ( www.vatican.va) was launched in 1995 .
The Catholic Church will retain full control of the content .
The aim of the deal was to " secure the Pope 's presence on the web " , said the Vatican 's Osservatore Romano newspaper .
It added that Pope Benedict had always been " fond of new technologies " .
Archbishop Claudio Maria Celli , head of the Vatican 's communications department , told the newspaper the Pope hoped to reach out to " the digital generation " .

Google Guidelines
Here are some of the important tips and tricks that can be employed while dealing with Google .
Do's
� A website should have crystal clear hierarchy and links and should preferably be easy to navigate .
� A site map is required to help the users go around your site and in case the site map has more than 100 links , then it is advisable to break it into several pages to avoid clutter .
� Come up with essential and precise keywords and make sure that your website features relevant and informative content .
� The Google crawler will not recognize text hidden in the images , so when describing important names , keywords or links ; stick with plain text .
� The TITLE and ALT tags should be descriptive and accurate and the website should have no broken links or incorrect HTML .
� Dynamic pages ( the URL consisting of a �?� character ) should be kept to a minimum as not every search engine spider is able to crawl them .
� The robots . txt file on your web server should be current and should not block the Googlebot crawler .
This file tells crawlers which directories can or cannot be crawled .
Don�ts
� When making a site , do not cheat your users , i.e. those people who will surf your website .
Do not provide them with irrelevant content or present them with any fraudulent schemes .
� Avoid tricks or link schemes designed to increase your site 's ranking .
� Do not employ hidden texts or hidden links .
� Google frowns upon websites using cloaking technique .
Hence , it is advisable to avoid that .
� Automated queries should not be sent to Google .
� Avoid stuffing pages with irrelevant words and content .
Also do n't create multiple pages , sub - domains , or domains with significantly duplicate content .
� Avoid " doorway " pages created just for search engines or other " cookie cutter " approaches such as affiliate programs with hardly any original content .

Amid a sour economy , one business appears to be thriving as the year comes to a close : counterfeiting .
Arrests for making fake money have hit a five - year high .
Reports of counterfeit bills almost always go up around the holiday season .
Yet as the economy sags , regular folks are trying to pass off fake bills to pay everyday expenses , joining what is typically the province of drug dealers , federal authorities say .
Counterfeiting arrests in the USA jumped 28 % this year over 2007 — the highest number since 2004 , according to the Secret Service , a division of the Homeland Security Department that safeguards the nation 's currency .
Counterfeiters passed $ 64.4 million in fake cash into the economy , a 5 % increase over 2007 and also a five - year high , says Special Agent Darrin Blackford , spokesman for the agency .
" It 's not just the criminal element , but we 're also seeing more students that maybe use a counterfeit $ 20 bill to buy pizza or someone trying to do it to purchase gas to get to work , " says Brian Marr , Secret Service special agent in charge of the Little Rock field office .
Marr says reports of fake bills spiked this year when gas prices hit record highs .
The holiday surge comes as counterfeiters try to mix their bills into the crush of holiday shopping , federal agents and local police say .
Counterfeiters also take advantage of technological advances in scanners and printers , which make it easier to duplicate currency .
" The holiday season is a great time to pass counterfeit currency .
The cashiers are overwhelmed , " says John Large , special agent in charge of the Secret Service criminal investigations division .
Among cities with recent counterfeiting cases : • In Milford , Mich. , detectives this month were investigating the case of a 15 - year - old boy who allegedly photographed currency on a scanner copier and passed it off at his high school cafeteria .
•
In Moultrie , Ga. , earlier this month , banks found counterfeit $ 20 and $ 100 bills in merchants ' deposits , says Lt. Alfonzo Cook , who commands the city 's detective division .
Moultrie police broke another counterfeiting case last summer , catching a man as he printed bills on a color scanner on his kitchen table .
" Christmastime is always like this , but it's a little bit more intense this year , " Cook says .
" It probably has to do with the economy .
I 've got a feeling there 's a lot more out there . "

The coach of a Dallas high school team that beat another team by 100 - 0 was fired Sunday , the same day he e-mailed a newspaper saying he will not apologize “ for a wide - margin victory when my girls played with honor and integrity . ”
Kyle Queal , the headmaster for Covenant School , said to The Dallas Morning News that he could not answer if the firing was a direct result of Coach Micah Grimes ’s e-mail message disagreeing with administrators who called the blowout “ shameful . ”
Torture and CIA " ghost " prisons will be no more .
Guantanamo Bay will be closed .
Lo and behold , the leader of communist Cuba has called the 44th President of the United States " an honest man " .

Truly , in the first 100 hours of Barack Obama , change has come to America .
In fact , change arrived in his first 100 minutes – before even the olive - green presidential helicopter carrying George W Bush into retirement had lifted off from the east plaza of the US Capitol , to the relief and joy of the two - thirds of Americans long sick of the sight of him .
In these first four days in office Obama has made many decisions , some symbolic , some of substance .
But nothing signalled a new era more powerfully than the inaugural address itself , his first official act after taking ( incorrectly , as it transpired ) the Oath of Office .
More explicitly than almost any inaugural in history , the 21 - minute speech repudiated the attitudes and policies of a departing president .
The Bush administration 's scorn for internationally stipulated rights of prisoners , its disregard for science , its high - handed foreign policy , and its blind veneration of the market – Obama disowned them all .
So much so , indeed , that some Bush staffers went public with their fury when they learnt of the speech 's contents .
And though much , much more will be done in the weeks and months to come , Obama has made a real start in turning words into deeds .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
On foreign policy , Guantanamo Bay is only a part of it .
Quickly focusing on the Middle East , where every gesture of a US president is minutely parsed , Obama chose to make his first foreign call to Mahmoud Abbas , the Palestinian President .
Only then did he speak to the leaders of Israel , Egypt , and Jordan .
Obama , as he must , says America 's support for Israel is unswerving .
But few other presidents have spoken as forthrightly as he did at the State Department last week about the human suffering of the Palestinians in Gaza , or insisted as strongly that the border must be opened .
The choice of George Mitchell , the skilled Lebanese - American negotiator and former Senate majority leader , as special envoy to the Middle East at last brings a genuinely honest US broker to bear on the crisis , as the parties to Northern Ireland 's peace accords can testify .
Much the same goes for the hard - driving Richard Holbrooke , architect of the 1995 Bosnian accords , who will play an equivalent role in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
On the home front , there have been comparable symbolic decisions in these first 100 hours .
Obama has moved to clamp down on lobbying excesses .
He has issued executive orders to make government more transparent .
To show he realises the misery faced by millions of ordinary Americans , he has ordered senior staffers to accept a pay freeze that for some amounts to a pay cut .
As well as his traditional intelligence briefing , the new President will now receive a similar daily economic briefing from his top White House economic adviser , Larry Summers .
Naturally , there are ample grounds for scepticism .
Every incoming president vows war on lobbyists , that peculiarly Washington species which greases the financial wheels of political campaigns and which – especially when Republicans were in control – sometimes virtually wrote congressional legislation .
On paper , the restrictions Obama announced on Wednesday are severe .
No one who has lobbied the government within the past two years will be able to serve in the new administration , and once they leave it , they will be barred from lobbying – not for a single year , as was the case under Bush , but for as long as Obama remains in the White House .
Alas , the 44th President has already broken his own rule by naming as Deputy Defence Secretary ( the hugely important job held by Paul Wolfowitz in the run-up to the Iraq War ) a former defence industry lobbyist named William Lynn .
Ditto the Obama campaign promise to reduce partisanship in Washington .
The inaugural address showed his willingness to listen to different points of view : " The question is not whether government is too big or too small , " he declared , " but whether it works . "
On Friday he summoned both Republican and Democratic leaders to the White House to press the $ 825 bn economic stimulus package now wending its way through Congress .
So far , so good .
But every president takes office promising greater political civility .
After all George W Bush , one of the most polarising presidents ever , was pledging back in January 2001 to be " a uniter , not a divider " .
And for all the professions of sweetness and light on Capitol Hill , some Republicans are digging in against the economic measure , accusing the Democratic majority once again of ignoring them .
Plus ça change .

Many presidents also take office promising greater openness .
On this score , too , Obama last week delivered handsomely , by lifting restrictions on the Freedom of Information Act , and reversing a Bush - era order that allowed presidents and their heirs to refuse to release records on the grounds of executive privilege .
Both moves delighted historians – and they may soon be embarrassing the super - secretive previous administration .
But do not get carried away .
Obama is no great lover of the press .
His campaign 's strategy of keeping the press at arm 's length worked so well that it irked many journalists .
The approach may well be continued , breeding similar resentment .
The affable Robert Gibbs , the new presidential spokesman , was given a gentle ride at a packed first briefing on Thursday .
Hours later , however , the man they call " no - drama Obama " sounded distinctly testy when he visited the cramped press working quarters by the briefing room , only for reporters to pepper him with questions about Lynn .
Even Hillary Clinton 's ecstatic reception at the State Department last week raised some disconcerting memories .
Eight years ago the no less charismatic Colin Powell arrived in the building , promising a new dawn for US diplomacy – only to lose out to Donald Rumsfeld 's Pentagon across the board .
No one is saying the same will happen now .
It is merely a reminder that the heady talk of the first 100 hours can be just that : talk .
Already , though , Obama has served notice he will be a pragmatist : " I 'll listen to any good idea , wherever it comes from , " he is fond of saying .
More important , unlike his predecessors Bill Clinton and George W Bush , he bears no scars from the fractious and divisive 1960s .
A Democrat he may be , but he is not a knee - jerk liberal .
Once his nomination was secure last summer , for instance , Obama watered down his earlier opposition to Bush 's use of warrantless domestic wiretapping as part of the " war on terror " , a programme that was anathema to the left .
Pragmatism also means accepting the facts .
In that inaugural address , no slap to his predecessor was more stinging than his vow to " restore science to its rightful place " .
The news delighted not just the academic community , which watched , frustrated and helpless , as the Bush administration doctored expert reports and shaped policy on global warming , stem - cell research and the like , to suit its ideology – even its theology .
The halt on federal aid for stem - cell research announced in 2001 could be reversed soon , while a ban on government funding for groups that offer abortion counselling abroad has already been lifted .
In fact , the crucial early decisions of the Obama administration , including ones on another bank bailout and the fate of the US car companies , are yet to come .
In that sense , last week was merely the beginning of the beginning ; even the burning matter of the family dog ( labradoodle or Portuguese water dog ? ) is unresolved .
Already , however , the style has changed utterly .
Pragmatism is replacing ideology , talking past people is out , talking to people is in .
No shock in these last few days has been greater than a president who speaks in grammatical sentences , who pauses an instant to ponder a question before answering it .
Obama 's calm and preparedness are remarkable .
It 's almost as if he had been anticipating this moment for years .
Bush 's great hero was Winston Churchill .
But if any recent US president at this stage in proceedings reminds one of Churchill – and his words about May 1940 that " I felt as if I were walking with destiny , and that all my past life had been but a preparation for this hour " – it is somehow Obama .
" He looks very comfortable in his surroundings , " Robert Gibbs said of his boss , and this time a spokesman 's words did n't just sound like spin .

Editor 's Note :
We are posting this article from our July 1959 issue to offer an historical perspective on some of the issues being discussed at the United Nations Framework Climate Change Conference in Poznan , Poland , which began December 1 and runs through December 12 .
The theories that explain worldwide climate change are almost as varied as the weather .
The more familiar ones attribute changes of climate to Olympian forces that range from geological upheavals and dust - belching volcanoes to long - term variations in the radiation of the sun and eccentricities in the orbit of the earth .
Only the so - called carbon dioxide theory takes account of the possibility that human activities may have some effect on climate .
This theory suggests that in the present century man is unwittingly raising the temperature of the earth by his industrial and agricultural activities .
Even the carbon dioxide theory is not new ; the basic idea was first precisely stated in 1861 by the noted British physicist John Tyndall .
He attributed climatic temperature - changes to variations in the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
According to the theory , carbon dioxide controls temperature because the carbon dioxide molecules in the air absorb infrared radiation .
The carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere are virtually transparent to the visible radiation that delivers the sun 's energy to the earth .
But the earth in turn reradiates much of the energy in the invisible infrared region of the spectrum .
This radiation is most intense at wavelengths very close to the principal absorption band ( 13 to 17 microns ) of the carbon dioxide spectrum .
When the carbon dioxide concentration is sufficiently high , even its weaker absorption bands become effective , and a greater amount of infrared radiation is absorbed [ see chart on page 42 ] .
Because the carbon dioxide blanket prevents its escape into space , the trapped radiation warms up the atmosphere .
A familiar instance of this " greenhouse " effect is the heating - up of a closed automobile when it stands for a while in the summer sun .
Like the atmosphere , the car 's windows are transparent to the sun 's visible radiation , which warms the upholstery and metal inside the car ; these materials in turn re-emit some of their heat as infrared radiation .
Glass , like carbon dioxide , absorbs some of this radiation and thus traps the heat , and the temperature inside the car rises .
Water vapor and ozone , as well as carbon dioxide , have this effect because they too absorb energy in the infrared region .
But the climatic effects due to carbon dioxide are almost entirely independent of the amount of these other two gases .
For the most part their absorption bands occur in different regions of the spectrum .
In addition , nearly all water vapor remains close to the ground , while carbon dioxide diffuses more evenly through the atmosphere .
Thus throughout most of the atmosphere carbon dioxide is the main factor determining changes in the radiation flux .
The 2.3 X 1012 ( 2,300 billion ) tons of carbon dioxide in the earth 's present atmosphere constitute some .03 per cent of its total mass .
The quantity of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is determined by the amounts supplied and withdrawn from three other great reservoirs : oceans , rocks and living organisms .
The oceans contain some 1.3 X 1014 tons of carbon dioxide — about 50 times as much as the air .
Some of the gas is dissolved in the water , but most of it is present in carbonate compounds .
The oceans exchange about 200 billion tons of carbon dioxide with the atmosphere each year .
When the equilibrium is disturbed , the oceans may engulf or disgorge billions of additional tons of carbon dioxide .
This puts a damper on the fluctuations in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere : when the atmospheric concentration rises , the oceans tend to absorb much of the excess ; when it fails , the oceanic reservoir replenishes it .
Both the atmosphere and the oceans continuously exchange carbon dioxide with rocks and with living organisms [ see illustration on pages 44 – 45 ] .
They gain carbon dioxide from the volcanic activity that releases gases from the earth 's interior and from the respiration and decay of organisms ; they lose carbon dioxide to the weathering of rock and the photosynthesis of plants .
As these processes change pace , the content of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere also changes , shifting the radiation balance and raising or lowering the earth 's temperature .
Of course during any particular geologic era other factors may influence climate .
Nonetheless let us examine some of the known facts of geological history and see how many can be explained in terms of variation in the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere .
Studies of rock strata reveal that for the past billion years most of the world has had a tropical climate .
Every 250 million years or so this tropical spell is broken by relatively short glacial periods which bury a substantial portion of the earth under ice sheets .
These cool periods last several million years , during which the glaciers retreat and advance many times as the temperature rises and falls .
During the last 620,000 years of the current glacial epoch , for example , deep ocean sediments show 10 distinct temperature cycles .
The carbon dioxide theory may well account for these temperature fluctuations .
A decline in the carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere–ocean system — and a period of decline in worldwide temperature — may be induced by a number of developments .
The rate of volcanic activity could slow down as the rate of rock weathering increased , or an especially flourishing mantle of vegetation could take up huge quantities of carbon dioxide and form new coal beds and other organic deposits in marshy areas .
After a geologically short time , the adjustment of the atmosphere–ocean equilibrium to the leaner supply of carbon dioxide could bring the atmospheric concentration down to .015 per cent , half its present value .
Calculations show that a 50 - per cent decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide in the air will lower the average temperature of the earth 6.9 degrees Fahrenheit .
We can be reasonably sure that such a sharp drop in temperature would cause glaciers to spread across the earth .
As the ice sheets grow , the oceans shrink ; at the height of glacial periods ice sheets contain 5 to 10 per cent of the oceans ' waters .
The glaciers contain little carbon dioxide , however , because ice can hold very small amounts of carbonates compared to the same volume of sea water .
The shrunken oceans thus accumulate an excess of carbon dioxide which they must release to the atmosphere in order to return to equilibrium .
And so the cycle draws to a close :
As carbon dioxide returns to the atmosphere , the earth 's temperature rises and the ice melts away .
The oceans fill to their former levels , reabsorb the carbon dioxide they had released , and a new glacial epoch begins .
So long as the total amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere - ocean system does not change , such a cycle of temperature oscillation will tend to repeat itself .
The period of the complete cycle would be determined primarily by the time required for an ice sheet to form , grow to maximum size and melt away .
Estimates indicate that this should take about 50,000 years , in agreement with the observed time for the cycle .
Other time factors in the cycle , such as the period required for the ocean–atmosphere system to come to equilibrium after a change in its carbon dioxide concentration , are probably much shorter .
The system never quite reaches equilibrium , however , because the freezing and melting of glaciers is out of phase with the fluctuation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere .
Glaciers are slow to form and slow to melt , so for thousands of years during the earth 's recovery from an ice age the cold winds from melting glaciers continue to chill the earth .
The mechanism here proposed to explain the cycle of glaciation does not depend in any way upon the particular numbers assumed for illustrative purposes .
Such oscillations will occur whenever the temperature during one phase of the cycle falls low enough to cause ice sheets to grow and during another phase rises high enough to cause them to melt .
A change in the comparatively small volume of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere provides ample leeway to swing the temperature past either extreme .
The oscillation is reinforced by the accompanying change in the earth 's humidity .
A colder atmosphere holds less water vapor , and so further reduces the atmospheric absorption of infrared radiation emitted by the earth 's surface .
At the same time , however , the earth 's cloud cover thickens and precipitation increases despite the reduction in the water - vapor burden of the atmosphere .
The top of a cloud is cooled by the radiation of heat into space ; when there is less carbon dioxide in the atmosphere , cloud tops lose more heat energy and thus become colder .
With a steeper temperature gradient there is increased convection within the cloud .
The result is larger clouds and more precipitation .
Moreover , since the cloud cover reflects the sun 's visible radiation back into space , less solar energy reaches the earth , and the temperature falls still lower .
The geological record indicates that the huge capacity of the biosphere to store and turn over carbon dioxide has also had its effect upon climatic change .
We know that plants borrow 60 billion tons of carbon dioxide yearly for photosynthesis .
Under present conditions the organic world repays nearly all of this debt each year via respiration and decay .
The formation of new fossil fuel deposits withholds at most only 100 million tons of carbon dioxide , or less than .2 per cent of the annual amount used for photosynthesis .
At one time , however , the withdrawals were much larger .
During the Carboniferous period , when most of the coal and oil deposits were formed , about 1014 tons of carbon dioxide were withdrawn from the atmosphere–ocean system .
This staggering loss must have dropped the earth 's temperature to chilly levels indeed ; it is not surprising that the gigantic glaciers that moved across the earth after this period were perhaps the most extensive in history .
The present capacity of plants to consume carbon dioxide in photosynthesis gives us an interesting clue to the carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere in bygone ages .
Plants are almost perfectly adapted to the spectral range and intensity of the light they receive , yet they grow far more rapidly and luxuriantly in an atmosphere that contains five to 10 times the present carbon dioxide concentration ; in fact , florists sometimes release tankfuls of carbon dioxide in greenhouses to promote plant growth .
The present carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere must therefore be unusually low .
Apparently plant evolution was keyed to some much higher concentration in the atmosphere of the geologic past .
This hypothesis is also supported by the known fact that the earth 's climate was warmer during most of geologic time ; presumably the atmosphere then contained a much higher percentage of carbon dioxide .
Much of the carbon dioxide in the atmospheres of past geologic epochs now lies buried in the carbon dioxide reservoir of the earth itself .
The earth 's hot springs and volcanoes pour about 100 million tons of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere per year .
The earth in turn recaptures approximately the same amount each year by the weathering of rocks .
But this equilibrium is upset during periods of mountain - building .
In fact , the carbon dioxide theory provides an essential link to explain the timing of the last two glacial epochs with respect to the mountain - building periods that preceded them .
At least several million years intervened between the climax of these mountain - building episodes and the formation of the great ice sheets .
If glaciation was brought on only by the elevation of the land or by the slight darkening of the sky with the dust of volcanoes , there should have been no great time lag before the onset of the glaciers ,
But these upheavals exposed large quantities of igneous rock to the chemical action of the minute amounts of atmospheric carbon dioxide dissolved in the rain water that washed over them , Over millions of years the weathering of the rock trapped vast quantities of carbon dioxide from the air .
With the atmospheric concentration reduced sufficiently , the temperature fell , permitting the young mountains to provide natural birthplaces for the glaciers that then crept across the earth .
Some periods of mountain - building have not produced glaciers ,
In these periods the output of carbon dioxide from volcanoes , which are especially active during the early stages of mountain - building , might have balanced the carbonate consumption of the newly exposed rocks ,
In fact , a landscape teeming with active volcanoes could easily release more carbon dioxide than the rocks could possibly absorb , so the temperature of the earth would rise sufficiently to prevent the expansion of glaciers .
The geological effects of volcanic action , coal formation or any other local disturbance of the carbon dioxide concentration are not restricted to the area in which they occur .
If the amount of carbon dioxide in one hemisphere of the earth rises or falls sharply , the concentration in the other hemisphere changes rather quickly .
In less than a few decades the concentration in both hemispheres becomes identical .
According to the carbon dioxide theory , this rapid diffusion helps to explain the fact that glaciers advance and retreat simultaneously in both hemispheres .
During the past century a new geological force has begun to exert its effect upon the carbon dioxide equilibrium of the earth [ see graphs on page 43 ] .
By burning fossil fuels man dumps approximately six billion tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year .
His agricultural activities release two billion tons more .
Grain fields and pastures store much smaller quantities of carbon dioxide than the forests they replace , and the cultivation of the soil permits the vast quantities of carbon dioxide produced by bacteria to escape into the air .
Not all of this eight billion tons of surplus carbon dioxide remains in the atmosphere , Plants remove some of it .
When the atmospheric concentration rises , plants use more carbon dioxide for photosynthesis .
In a few years , however , the increase in the rate of photosynthesis is balanced by advances in the rate of respiration and decay processes .
The net result is only a slight increase in the carbon dioxide content of the biosphere .
Most of the carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere by human activities will ultimately be absorbed by the oceans [ see graph on page 46 ] .
To predict the effect of human activities upon climate we must calculate just how rapidly this happens .
Recent studies make it appear that volume of carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans comes to equilibrium with the carbon dioxide pressure of the atmosphere in about 1,000 years , and that the oceans take up about half of any carbon dioxide added to the air .
Over a longer period of time , perhaps several thousand years , the oceans take up much larger additional quantities of carbon dioxide in carbonate compounds before the system again reaches equilibrium .
These equilibrium rates are quite significant , because they will govern the temperature of the earth as long as man burns large amounts of fossil fuels .
We have only to extrapolate existing records of temperature and fossil - fuel consumption to predict the climate of the future .
Quite accurate records of the amount of fossil fuel consumed in the world each year show that in the past 100 years man has added about 360 billion tons of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere .
As a result the atmospheric concentration has increased by about 13 per cent .
The carbon dioxide theory predicts that such an increase should raise the average temperature of the earth one degree F .
This is almost exactly the average increase recorded all over the world during the past century !
If fuel consumption continues to increase at the present rate , we will have sent more than a trillion tons of carbon dioxide into the air by the year 2000 .
This should raise the earth 's average temperature 3.6 degrees .
In less than 1,000 years , if consumption continues to increase at the current rate , we will have exhausted the currently known reserves of coal and oil .
By that time we will have multiplied the carbon dioxide tonnage of the air 18 times .
When the ocean–atmosphere system comes back to equilibrium , the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air will be 10 times greater than it is today , and the earth will be 22 degrees warmer .
In another few thousand years , when the carbonate content of the oceans has reached equilibrium , the concentration will still be four times greater than it is today .
The earth 's temperature will then fall to about 12.5 degrees above its present average .
Meanwhile the carbon dioxide content of the oceans will have doubled .
This raises an incidental question about the welfare of sea organisms .
We know that an increase in carbon dioxide concentration increases the acidity of water , and that many marine animals are extremely sensitive to changes in acidity .
However , if the carbon dioxide content of the air were to increase sevenfold , the acidity ( pH ) of sea water would not rise more than .5 above its present value .
Thus changes in carbon dioxide concentration , which have such a profound effect on climate , will probably not disturb future marine life .
Perhaps only man will be uncomfortable .
We shall be able to test the carbon dioxide theory against other theories of climatic change quite conclusively during the next half - century .
Since we now can measure the sun 's energy output independent of the distorting influence of the atmosphere , we shall see whether the earth 's temperature trend correlates with measured fluctuations in solar radiation .
If volcanic dust is the more important factor , then we may observe the earth 's temperature following fluctuations in the number of large volcanic eruptions .
But if carbon dioxide is the most important factor , long - term temperature records will rise continuously as long as man consumes the earth 's reserves of fossil fuels .

Yes , that 's right ; snowcrash feels exactly twice as strongly about this as johnnyichiban .
Thank God for RossFenelon and his reasoned thinking :
Alright * exhale *...
Now that my co-workers have talked me down off that ledge , I have had a chance to look at this rationally .
I understand why he did this .
This is just a self indulgent fanboy fantasy being fulfilled by someone with more clout than taste .
I have nothing against his appreciation for Shinichiro Watanabe 's masterpiece .
But if he would take an honest look at his acting " style " and the demands for this role he would see that it would be better for him to step down and let a relatively unknown actor take this role .
These are the reasons ;
1 ) He 's too old .
He has the height and build for the character and also the martial arts background .
But at his age , he would be hard pressed to convey Spike 's boyish devil - may - care attitude .
Maybe in his Bill & Ted days or even Devil 's Advocate .
Not now though .
This brings me to my next point 2 ) He 's too famous ; Spike is a subtle and complex character .
Outwardly aloof but deceptively deep and introspective .
This is his main appeal .
Reeve 's fame will undoubtedly over shadow those complexities and this film will most likely devolve into a run of the mill Sci - fi action vehicle for the star .
Average movie goers , uninitiated into the Bebop world , will miss out on the depth this character has to offer .
the only thing that could give me any hope that this movie will be a quality effort is if they announce that Yoko Kanno is going to do the score along with the Seatbelts and the other artists who made the unforgettable music of Cowboy Bebop .
Lastly , if Reeve 's ABSOLUTELY had to be in the movie in a leading capacity , the only role I could see him filling is maybe that of Vicious .
With his deadpan acting style he might be able to pull that off ... maybe ... possibly ...
Oh who am I kidding we 're screwed .

Others , meanwhile , did n't see this as the This Is A Disaster that it so clearly is :
OlavRokne : " Keanu is a better actor than anyone gives him credit for .
In fact , he may have been one of the only things * right * about the Day the Earth Stood Still ( the other was John Cleese ) . "
DaltonKonowalchuk : " Keanu was one of the two good things in TDTESS , the other was John Gleese .
The man was outstanding in Scanner Darkly and Matrix .
He has a slate of good projects , give him some credit .
And he has the looks , the vibe and the style of Spike , he will make it just right .
Plus , they are bringing the original japanese team on board , what means they are serious about doing something good with it .
As for Jet , bring Dwayne Johnson ! "
Final : " I 'll disent .
I think he can pull it off .
Spike was n't that outwardly emotional .
I 'm more concerned about who will play Jet and Ed ...
Faye they 're gonna screw up and get Megan Fox or some other eye candy that can't act . "

Well , that 's us told .
From now on , we here at io9 will be stuhfooing on a regular basis .
Or something .
Turkey 's prime minister , Recep Tayyip Erdogan , yesterday fiercely attacked an online apology for the alleged genocide of Armenians by Ottoman forces in the first world war , warning that it could derail efforts to restore long - severed ties with Armenia .
The apology - organised by Turkish intellectuals in the form of a petition - provoked an outcry from right - wing nationalists , and Erdogan added his voice by making clear he felt Turkey had nothing to apologise for .
" I neither accept nor support this campaign .
We did not commit a crime , therefore we do not need to apologise , " he said .
" It will not have any benefit other than stirring up trouble , disturbing our peace and undoing the steps which have been taken . "
Yesterday afternoon organisers claimed more than 11,100 people had signed the apology , two days after it was launched .
Signatories include prominent academics , writers and journalists .
British singer Peter Gabriel has also lent support , although the petition is only intended for Turks .
One organiser , Cengiz Aktar , professor of EU studies at Istanbul 's university of Bahcesehir , dismissed Erdogan 's " knee - jerk " remarks and said the number of signatories showed him to be out of step .
" From now , anyone who speaks about the Armenian question will have to take into account this expression of consciousness .
It 's a new element in the debate . "
The apology does not mention the word genocide , but acknowledges that Armenians suffered a " great catastrophe " in 1915 , while criticising Turkey 's denial .
Armenia 's government , supported by historians and an influential disaspora , says up to 1.5 million Armenians died in expulsions by the Ottoman imperial government .
Turkey rejects the claims but has proposed a joint commission to investigate .
According to a new paper published in Nature Geoscience and available online here , scientists from the UK , US , and Australia have detected anthropogenic influence on the climate of both the Arctic and Antarctica .
Ana according to a Scientific American article on the paper , one of the paper ’s reviewers , Andrew Monaghan of the National Center for Atmospheric Research , believes that the paper may be understating the effect of anthropogenic carbon emissions on Antarctica .
Monaghan ’s reason ?
The new paper gives equal weight to cooling in the interior of Antarctica as to heating on the periphery , while interior cooling is suspected to be a result of the CFC - caused ozone hole .
While the paper is impressive for the data it used ( 100 years of Arctic temperature measurements and 50 years of Antarctic measurements from all available monitoring stations ) , the figures illustrate just how sparse the data set really is .
If you look at the image below ( Figure 2 , parts c and d ) , all the colored sections are areas where there is sufficient data to draw conclusions from , while the gray areas have insufficient data .
As is obvious , there ’s a lot more gray than colored sections , and so critics could fairly attack the accuracy of the paper ’s conclusions based on insufficient data .
However , the authors tried to immunize themselves against such criticisms by comparing the results of their simulations and results based on their limited data with previously - generated methods for infilling the missing data developed by other researchers .
Ultimately , though , if you look at the topmost image ( figure 1 from the paper ) , you ’ll notice that the black observed line tracks most closely to the red line labeled “ All ” .
That red line is the combined output of four climate simulations that include anthropogenic effects – the blue line is the simulation output when only natural effects such as solar irradiance and volcanism are included .
In other words , only by including human influences on climate could the models be made to match reality .

Methane concentrations increase globally in 2007
According to TGDaily , a new paper on atmospheric methane from several MIT researchers suggests that new data contradicts anthropogenic global warming ( AGW ) and that , as the TGDaily article says :
[ S ] ince all worldwide levels rose simultaneously throughout the same year , it is now believed this may be part of a natural cycle in mother nature – and not the direct result of man ’s contributions .
Of course , that ’s not at all what the MIT researchers said .
It ’s true , according to a New Scientists article on the same paper , that MIT researcher Matthew Rigby is quoted as saying “ The worry is that we just do n’t understand the methane cycle very well . ”
And it ’s also true that Rigby and MIT professor and co-author Ronald Prinn were surprised by the simultaneous rise in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres , since there ’s no obvious sources for massive methane releases in the Southern Hemisphere like there is in Arctic methane hydrate deposits .
But they have suggested an alternative hypothesis for the rapid increase in methane concentrations , a hypothesis that has precedents in the data of prior years .
It ’s possible that the simultaneous change in both hemispheres is related to a breakdown in the global effectiveness of a chemical reaction in the atmosphere that breaks methane down into water and carbon dioxide .
However , it ’s too early to know if the increase is a short term “ blip ” in methane concentration ( as illustrated at several points in IPCC AR4 WG1 Chapter 2 , Figure 2.4b , page 142 ) or whether methane concentrations will continue to grow at an accelerated rate for years or longer .
If it ’s the former , then it ’s probably not a big deal .
But if it ’s the latter , then that suggests either the hydroxyl / methane reaction is breaking down ( a very bad thing ) or that organic decay and hydrate thawing is dumping massive , and likely increasinly so , amounts of new methane into the atmosphere .

Architect of Berkeley ’s new solar plan gives Grist an update
As of yesterday , the city of Berkeley , California has started their plan to reduce the price of solar panels for residential and commercial customers by converting the tens of thousands of dollars for installation into bundled city bonds that are paid off with higher property taxes .
This reduces the cost of entry and makes the repayment time for the panels independent of how long the owner will be willing to stay in the home .
The hope is that this program will make people far more willing to add solar to their homes and businesses and will reduce the interest rates the homeowners will have to pay below what they ’d pay if they got a straight bank loan for the solar upgrade .
Grist has a guest post on this innovative solar funding program by the architect of the program , Cisco Devries .

Two useful climate disruption maps
The progressive think tank the Center for American Progress ( CAP ) has put out two maps that could be quite useful for people concerned about the impact of green jobs and climate disruption on their communities .
The first , the Interactive Map of the Green Recovery , shows how many jobs would be created in each state that received money from a CAP / University of Massachusetts $ 100 billion Green Recovery program .
My home state of Colorado , for example , would receive more than $ 400 per person under the plan , that $ 2 billion total would be expected to produce almost 33,000 new jobs , and reduce the unemployment rate by between 20 and 30 % ( ie from 6 % to between 3.6 and 4.8 % ) .
The second map ( example screen shown below ) shows where a variety of climate disruption - caused problems are occurring and where they ’re expected to occur as climate disruption gets worse throughout this century .
Not only that , the “ Human Toll of Climate Change ” map shows a number of existing and projected problems on a Google map for parts of the entire planet , not just the U.S. , and every data point is classified and supported with scientific research .
It ’s very well done and should be considered a very useful reference .

In January 2001 , mere days before Dubya took office for the first time , satire magazine The Onion published a then - funny piece about president - elect Bush giving a speech assuring the country that ‘ Our Long National Nightmare Of Peace And Prosperity Is Finally Over ’ .
Bush pledged to end the Clinton era — “ eight long years characterized by unprecedented economic expansion , a sharp decrease in crime , and sustained peace overseas .
The time has come to put all of that behind us . ”
According to The Onion , Bush promised to attack the environment , send the nation into massive debt , deregulate dangerous , greedy industries , start “ at least one Gulf War - level armed conflict ” , bring back economic stagnation , and heal the “ terrible wedge President Clinton drove between church and state ” .
They satirically had Bush concluding :
We as a people must stand united , banding together to tear this nation in two .
Much work lies ahead of us :
The gap between the rich and the poor may be wide , be there ’s much more widening left to do .
We must squander our nation ’s hard - won budget surplus on tax breaks for the wealthiest 15 percent .
And , on the foreign front , we must find an enemy and defeat it .
The ironic thing is , their over - the - top predictions came true .
Pity that .
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Britons are entering the downturn unable to cut household costs because they do n’t know how to cook cheap meals , turning instead to fast food , celebrity chef Jamie Oliver said Wednesday .

Britain is witnessing a “ new poverty that we have never seen before , ” Oliver told parliament ’s health committee .
“ This is n’t about flash trainers or mobile phones or Sky dishes or plasma TV screens .
It is a poverty of being able to nourish their family , in any class ( of society ) , ” he said .
“ It directly runs with the outrageous obesity that is actually happening now . ”
Oliver , who is on a crusade to improve Britain ’s eating habits , said that in previous downturns households were more equipped to trim costs and still make food “ nice and tasty . ”
“ But this is the first time in British history where you have n’t got most of the population able to cook and you can statistically see where people are spending their money now and fast food options are up , ” he said .
Oliver added that the problem straddled all social classes .
“ It is genuinely classless .
There ’s plenty of City boys , who used to earn a load of money , that ca n’t nourish their kids properly even with a gold ( credit card ) , ” he said .
The chef , who almost single - handedly convinced the government to spend an extra 200 million pounds on improving dinners in Britain ’s schools , warned that Britain was facing an “ incredibly profound ” health crisis .
At a news conference after the hearing , Oliver said obesity was now an “ epidemic . ”
“ If we do n’t deal with it in the next 10 years , it ’s going to be 10 times harder to fix and it will be a horror show , ” he told reporters .
Last month , Oliver set out an anti-obesity “ manifesto , ” in which he called for more cookery education and government - funded food centers in every town .
It calls for cooking skills to be taught in primary schools as well as to adults at work and in the community .
He demanded the government appoint a dedicated minister for food from within the private sector to drive policy over the next decade .
“ We are not in a great place , but we are in a place from which it can be fixed , ” he told the committee .
“ If we leave it , it will be like America , where it is almost not worth it , because it ’s so ingrained . ”
Despite his healthy eating campaign , Oliver stressed he was not against fast food .
“ I do n’t want to demonize fast food .
Burgers taste good , pizzas taste good , kebabs taste good ( but ) what we ’ve got is a large group of people ( only ) buying into those options , ” he said .
SAN FRANCISCO  Internet security is broken , and nobody seems to know quite how to fix it .
Despite the efforts of the computer security industry and a half - decade struggle by Microsoft to protect its Windows operating system , malicious software is spreading faster than ever .
The so - called malware surreptitiously takes over a PC and then uses that computer to spread more malware to other machines exponentially .
Computer scientists and security researchers acknowledge they can not get ahead of the onslaught .
As more business and social life has moved onto the Web , criminals thriving on an underground economy of credit card thefts , bank fraud and other scams rob computer users of an estimated $ 100 billion a year , according to a conservative estimate by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe .
A Russian company that sells fake antivirus software that actually takes over a computer pays its illicit distributors as much as $ 5 million a year .
With vast resources from stolen credit card and other financial information , the cyberattackers are handily winning a technology arms race .
“ Right now the bad guys are improving more quickly than the good guys , ” said Patrick Lincoln , director of the computer science laboratory at SRI International , a science and technology research group .
Ed. Note : Boing Boing 's current guestblogger Clay Shirky is the author of Here Comes Everybody : The Power of Organizing Without Organizations .
He teaches at the Interactive Telecommunications Program at NYU , where he works on the overlap of social and technological networks .
It is famously difficult to teach people to program , and CS lore says that there are simply people who get it and people who do n't .
Saeed Dehnadi and Richard Bornat , two computer instructors at Middlesex University in the UK , put that idea to the test , and ended up not with two kinds of people , but three .
They devised a basic aptitude test for first year students of computer programming , and then administered it on the first day of class , before the students had learned anything .
( One of them maintains this was a mistake , the other claims it was planned . )
The result was an almost perfect correlation between the results of the test and the student 's subsequent performance .
The test asked simple questions about assignments ( example shown in the image above . )
The group tested broke down into three camps : people who answered the questions using different mental models for different questions , people who answered using a consistent model , and people who did n't answer the questions at all :
Told that there were three groups and how they were distinguished , but not
told their relative sizes , we have found that computer scientists and other programmers have almost
all predicted that the blank group would be more successful in the course exam than the others :
" they had the sense to refuse to answer questions which they could n't understand " is a typical
explanation .
Non-programming social scientists , mathematicians and historians , given the same
information , almost all pick the inconsistent group : " they show intelligence by picking methods to
suit the problem " is the sort of thing they say .
Very few , so far , have predicted that the consistent
group would be the most successful .
Remarkably , it is the consistent group , and almost exclusively
the consistent group , that is successful .
Interestingly , this correlation is unrelated to correctness — being consistently wrong in your mental model of how a computer works is better than being inconsistently right , because if you are consistently wrong , you only have to learn one thing to start being consistently right .
Dehnadi and Bornat 's thesis is that the single biggest predictor of likely aptitude for programming is a deep comfort with meaninglessness :
To write a computer program you have to come to terms with this , to accept that whatever you
might want the program to mean , the machine will blindly follow its meaningless rules and come to
some meaningless conclusion .
In the test the consistent group showed a pre-acceptance of this fact :
they are capable of seeing mathematical calculation problems in terms of rules , and can follow those
rules wheresoever they may lead .
The inconsistent group , on the other hand , looks for meaning
where it is not .
The blank group knows that it is looking at meaninglessness , and refuses to deal
with it .
( It will be interesting to see how long it will be in the comments before someone chimes in with the snake oil of the industry : " But method X / language Y is so intuitive that it solves this problem ! "
Dehnadi and Bornat 's literature review should be required reading for this group . )
Dehnadi and Bornat 's programming aptitude research
UPDATE : In the comments , Greebo points to research trying and failing to replicate the salience of consistency as a predictor , in a paper suggesting that " … the consistent group may actually contain two distinct subgroups , one that does much better than the inconsistent group , and one that does much worse . "
That paper is also interesting for its engagement with the larger issue of replication of experiments involving humans , as they were not able to fully replicate the research ( self - selecting group , not given on first day of class , etc … ) and use those issues as a platform for illustrating the difficulties with this kind of research generally .

The semi-final results of the hand recount were published today at 1:28 PM CT on the Minnesota Secretary of State 's website .
Of Minnesota 's 4,130 precincts , 4,129 have finished reporting .
The remaining precinct represents the Minneapolis ' 3rd Ward where 133 Ballots have gone missing .
During the ensuing search 12 sealed and uncounted absentee ballots were found .
Pending the returns of these 145 ballots , here is the count :
Recount Original Coleman : 1,208,344 - 1,210,995 = - 2,651 Franken : 1,207,657 - 1,210,285 = - 2,628 Franken Net Today : 13 ( 91 Yesterday , - 13 day before , 41 ) Total Franken Net : 23 Franken Deficit : 192 Current Margin : 687
But there are also 1,965 votes , as certified on November 18th , from the aforementioned Minneapolis precinct , which are not included in the count .
Based upon those roughly two thousand votes , Franken leads Coleman by 495 ; and that 495 is not included in the table above .
There are still 6,655 challenged ballots that have not been counted that will be reviewed by the canvassing board starting next week .
From the challenge pile , Coleman is responsible for 3,375 and Franken 3,280 .
Both sides have called the opposition 's challenges frivolous , and both sides appear to be right .
On December 3rd , the Franken Campaign issued a press release regarding their frivolous challenges :
This afternoon , the Franken campaign sent a letter to the Secretary of State withdrawing 633 challenges .
The fact that we are withdrawing these challenges does not in any way have any effect on the likelihood that Al Franken will win the recount .
The only practical impact of what we are doing today is that it will save the state canvassing board the trouble of looking at these challenges themselves .
Source : Al Franken For Senate
Not to be out done , the Coleman campaign released their version of the story on December 4th :
Today , in the spirit of working to remedy an excess of challenged ballots , we will voluntarily withdraw 650 challenged by the Coleman campaign .
This morning , I left a voicemail , and sent an email , to Franken campaign attorney Marc Elias regarding challenged ballots .
We are doing so this in the spirit of reaching out to their campaign so we can sit down early next week and discuss what process we can agree to in order to winnow down these challenged ballots .
Source : Norm Coleman For Senate
Factoring in the 1,283 withdrawals into the challenge count yields the following result :
Franken : 2,647 Coleman : 2,725 Total : 5,372 Margin : 78
Once the final precinct is included , disregarding the 133 ballots , Franken could net as many as 495 votes .
If the 133 ballots were erroneously counted twice , Franken would lose 46 votes , reducing his gain from Minneapolis Ward 3's First Precinct to 449 .
If Franken also sweeps the 12 new absentee ballots , he will head into the challenge phase , of the recount , with a minimal deficit of 180 votes .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Web search leader Google Inc said on Tuesday that Google App Engine would offer additional computing resources for developers this year and announced pricing for the service .
Developers using Google App Engine , which lets outsiders build Web applications on the same infrastructure that runs Google ’s own applications , will have a free quota of 500 Megabytes of storage and enough computing power and bandwidth for about 5 million pageviews per month .
But for further usage Google said it would charge developers depending on how much storage and bandwidth they require beyond the free quota and that the pricing plans would be effective later this year after a preview period .
GETTING oil and gas companies to contain the harm they do to the environment just got a little easier .
Companies are sometimes asked to preserve pristine land to compensate for the damage their operations do – both directly and through the roads , houses and towns that spring up nearby .
This poses a problem because the companies can easily claim credit for protecting land their activities would never have damaged anyway .

CLEVELAND --
An off - duty Cleveland police officer chased down and captured a juvenile gunman after the teen fired into a crowd at Broadway and Union avenues about 3:00 p.m. , police said .
Steve Loomis , president of the patrolmen 's union , said Patrolman C. Perkins witnessed two males shouting at each other .
One of the males pulled a gun and fired seven shots at the crowd .
Nobody was struck by the gunfire , Loomis said .
Perkins was picking up his daughter from school .
He jumped out of his car , told his daughter to call 9 - 1 - 1 and chased the gunman .
He arrested a 16 - year - old South High student a few blocks away , Loomis said .
Loomis commended Perkins for his actions .
" His police instinct took over , " Loomis said .
" He was nervous . "
Lt. Thomas Stacho , police spokesman , said the officer recovered the gun , which was reported stolen from a house last night .

I am very interested in the role of web sites like CL in enabling women to be more precise about their sexual needs .
I find it fascinating in fact , that you can post for a green eyed man who ’s under 5 ’ 10 ’’ , smokes but does n’t drink and who likes striped goldfish , and your mailbox fills up with 20 responses in 20 minutes .
[ do n’t believe me ?
Try it yourself , posting as a female in NSA . ]
Of course , I extrapolated that such web sites are doing this for other women because well , CL is doing that for me .
So , I ’ve decided to post a guide to what would drive me wild .
This is n’t particularly an erotic piece of writing : that was last Friday , and boy , was I rewarded .
63 responses !
This is more of a philosophy .
I doubt it works for all women .
Many men have told me in the last few months that all women are different , in the way they want to pleased as well as in the way they please .
I ’m not wholly convinced that the same is true for men , but feel free to post your opinion .
So , here goes .
For me , achieving an orgasm and becoming aroused are two wholly separate experiences .
I can become aroused by many sexual practices , many flavors .
And , often , arousal is enough .
I am very , very good at pleasing myself .
Sure , it ’s been harder since the antidepressants , but they have changed my life , and it ’s a side effect that I accept .
I rarely come with someone else , and while I ’m working on changing that by actually talking about what I want , I am also ok with just becoming aroused because it provides fodder for my fantasies .
But if I was a man , making love to me , here ’s what I ’d do .
First , I would want to make me come before we had sex .
It ’s to the man ’s advantage physically , because the vaginal tissue becomes engorged with blood ( much the same way a penis does ) , swollen and so wet after orgasm .
Also , once you ’ve made me come , all my tissues become swelled ( my breasts ) and the somewhat analgesic effects of orgasm also take over .
What does this mean to a man ?
He can do it really hard , rough if that ’s his and his partner ’s thing , and it ’s not going to hurt as much .
Pinch my nipples when you greet me hello ?
There ’s no fine line between pleasure or pain there for me , buddy .
Just pain .
It ’s hurts , and I do n’t like it .
That ’s why I go “ Och ! ” because you , see , it hurt me .
No , I was n’t joking .
For me to come , it ’s got to be done softly .
That ’s how I do it .
In fact , if you want to learn about my body , why do n’t you ask to watch me .
You may be surprised .
I do n’t shove three of my fingers into my vagina , in fact , I do n’t put anything in there .
Yes , that ’s right .
I do n’t touch it .
All I do is take a single finger right above my clit and I rub back and forth – NOT up and down – for about five minutes .
Consistently .
I would never touch the clit directly : it hurts way too much .
Again , no fine line there between pleasure and pain .
It hurts .
I think it probably hurts like after you come in my mouth , and you ’re still there , and I withdraw you slowly , and you still suck in air quickly .
If I do start to moan or make some other sound that indicates you ’ve found the right spot , then please do n’t change what you ’re doing .
Do not go faster or slower .
Because I have to build up again from scratch .
The stop start thing gets me exhausted , I get frustrated , roll over , give you a blow job and then I leave .
Also , no homing pigeons , please .
If I move your hand away from a spot , do n’t back there .
Of course , the joy of sex with others is the foreplay to orgasm .
Touch my breast softly .
Treasure them .
Kiss me softly .
Do not suck on my nipples like you ’re trying to get the last bit of soda out of a can .
Hurts .
Try sticking your tongue in them .
You know my girlfriends say when they 've had great sex ?
“ He was so gentle . ”
It ’s a turn on .
Ask me if it feels good .
Some women are loud , some are n’t .
Some women will tell you what do to , some cannot imagine doing so .
Most would answer a direct question , and many if not all , would answer a or b , if you said do you like it this way , or that way ?
Now , I have difficulty letting you do all the work .
So , if want me to come , tell me you ’re enjoying my body .
Tell me you are getting pleasure from touching my body .
Then I can relax .
Also , a word or two about vibrators .
They are wonderful , wonderful toys , and I like them lots .
But a few tips : take a vibrator and put it on your nipple for 10 minutes .
What do you feel ?
Nothing .
Any piece of your body stimulated that intensely becomes numb after about 10 minutes .
That 's why people use " muscle massagers " to ease muscle tension : it makes the muscle numb !
Numb is not the feeling that you want to achieve here .
Move the vibrator around .
A lot or adjust a little , depending on what works .
Lubricant ?
Good idea .
Forget the strawberry flavored stuff .
And I ’d rather you not use that half full bottle by your bed side ; I do n’t where it ’s been and I do n’t want to think about that .
Pony up six bucks for a new bottle .
( And then I ’ll buy the next bottle ) .
And let me frigin ' see it .
Do not put gloop in my body without asking me or telling me what it is .
Also , K - Y is used in gynecology exams .
Rub that cold shit on me and I start to feel well , like I ’m at the gynecologist Again , not the feeling you want to go for , unless you ’re doing that gyno role play thing .
Rub it on your hands to warm it up .
Let me rub some on your dick when I ’m going down on you : we ’ll both enjoy it more .
What ’s in for you when you ’ve done this ?
Well , almost anything you want .
( This , by the way , is not a plea for e-mailed responses . )
You can bang me hard and deep from behind , slapping me on the ass .
We can sixty nine , or I ’ll get on my knees and suck you until you ’re dry .
I can whisper how you made me feel as no one else did while you hook my legs over your shoulders , or I can shout “ Give me your angrey love !
I want it so badly ! ” while I straddle you .
Because you see , you made me come .
Ever wanted to own a Panda Bear , but was worried about being attacked while you are sleeping ?
Introducing the Panda Dog , a dog that looks like a Panda Bear .
The Panda Dog hails from Asia and is available in Japan and China and is believed to be a Maltese Poodle mix bread specially for its panda looks , although some suggest funnily that it has Panda DNA .
I ’m not sure if these are available yet in the United States or elsewhere , but if they do become available you can see these being a Christmas gift for many years to come .
Here ’s some footage of a Panda Dog in action in Japan .
With almost every Monday night being a tapas night for my husband and me , we have tried many different menus .
Sometimes it is nice to return to a menu or dish that we liked , but other weeks we like to try a new set of recipes .
This Monday was one of those nights .
To make planning easier , both of us usually like to start with a theme , whether it be choosing an ethnicity , region , or style of cooking .
I suggested a French theme , which has had little representation in our dinners .
My husband questioned whether we could make a meatball that mimicked chicken cordon bleu .
I decided this would be a good challenge for my cooking skills .
I knew that I could incorporate the swiss cheese portion of the cordon bleu easily by placing a small cube of cheese inside each meatball .
However , it seemed a little more daunting as to how ham would be added .
I debated wrapping each meatball in a thin strip of ham , but that seemed unappealing both in texture and look .
I decided that dicing the ham and mixing it into the meatball mixture would be my best option .
I am pleased to say that these meatballs were tasty .
To make a richer recipe , a creamy white wine sauce could be used as an accompaniment .
These meatballs could be used as either a main course or an appetizer .
After spending each day worrying they could lose their lives to Jedi lightsabres , Rebel blasters , or Darth Vader 's choke grip in the halls of the Death Star , the Stormtroopers of Star Wars undoubtedly want to cut loose when they 're on their Christmas holidays .
They can't be evil all the time

Two ideal Bayesians cannot have common knowledge of disagreement ; this is a theorem .
If two rationalist - wannabes have common knowledge of a disagreement between them , what could be going wrong ?
The obvious interpretation of these theorems is that if you know that a cognitive machine is a rational processor of evidence , its beliefs become evidence themselves .
If you design an AI and the AI says " This fair coin came up heads with 80 % probability " , then you know that the AI has accumulated evidence with an likelihood ratio of 4:1 favoring heads - because the AI only emits that statement under those circumstances .
It 's not a matter of charity ; it 's just that this is how you think the other cognitive machine works .
And if you tell an ideal rationalist , " I think this fair coin came up heads with 80 % probability " , and they reply , " I now think this fair coin came up heads with 25 % probability " , and your sources of evidence are independent of each other , then you should accept this verdict , reasoning that ( before you spoke ) the other mind must have encountered evidence with a likelihood of 1:12 favoring tails .
But this assumes that the other mind also thinks that you 're processing evidence correctly , so that , by the time it says " I now think this fair coin came up heads , p=.25 " , it has already taken into account the full impact of all the evidence you know about , before adding more evidence of its own .
If , on the other hand , the other mind does n't trust your rationality , then it wo n't accept your evidence at face value , and the estimate that it gives wo n't integrate the full impact of the evidence you observed .
So does this mean that when two rationalists trust each other 's rationality less than completely , then they can agree to disagree ?
It 's not that simple .
Rationalists should not trust themselves entirely , either .
So when the other mind accepts your evidence at less than face value , this does n't say " You are less than a perfect rationalist " , it says , " I trust you less than you trust yourself ; I think that you are discounting your own evidence too little . "
Maybe your raw arguments seemed to you to have a strength of 40:1 , but you discounted for your own irrationality to a strength of 4:1 , but the other mind thinks you still overestimate yourself and so it assumes that the actual force of the argument was 2:1 .
And if you believe that the other mind is discounting you in this way , and is unjustified in doing so , then when it says " I now think this fair coin came up heads with 25 % probability " , you might bet on the coin at odds of 57 % in favor of heads - adding up your further - discounted evidence of 2:1 to the implied evidence of 1:6 that the other mind must have seen to give final odds of 2:6 - if you even fully trust the other mind 's further evidence of 1:6 .
I think we have to be very careful to avoid interpreting this situation in terms of anything like a reciprocal trade , like two sides making equal concessions in order to reach agreement on a business deal .
Shifting beliefs is not a concession that you make for the sake of others , expecting something in return ; it is an advantage you take for your own benefit , to improve your own map of the world .
I am , generally speaking , a Millie - style altruist ; but when it comes to belief shifts I espouse a pure and principled selfishness : do n't believe you 're doing it for anyone 's sake but your own .
Still , I once read that there 's a principle among con artists that the main thing is to get the mark to believe that you trust them , so that they 'll feel obligated to trust you in turn .
And - even if it's for completely different theoretical reasons - if you want to persuade a rationalist to shift belief to match yours , you either need to persuade them that you have all of the same evidence they do and have already taken it into account , or that you already fully trust their opinions as evidence , or that you know better than they do how much they themselves can be trusted .
It 's that last one that 's the really sticky point , for obvious reasons of asymmetry of introspective access and asymmetry of motives for overconfidence - how do you resolve that conflict ?
( And if you started arguing about it , then the question would n't be which of these were more important as a factor , but rather , which of these factors the Other had under - or over - discounted in forming their estimate of a given person 's rationality ... )
If I had to name a single reason why two wannabe rationalists would n't actually be able to agree in practice , it would be that , once you trace the argument to the meta - level where theoretically everything can be and must be resolved , the argument trails off into psychoanalysis and noise .
And if you look at what goes on in practice between two arguing rationalists , it would probably mostly be trading object - level arguments ; and the most meta it would get is trying to convince the other person that you 've already taken their object - level arguments into account .
Still , this does leave us with three clear reasons that someone might point to , to justify a persistent disagreement - even though the frame of mind of justification and having clear reasons to point to in front of others , is itself antithetical to the spirit of resolving disagreements - but even so :
Clearly , the Other 's object - level arguments are flawed ; no amount of trust that I can have for another person will make me believe that rocks fall upward .
Clearly , the Other is not taking my arguments into account ; there 's an obvious asymmetry in how well I understand them and have integrated their evidence , versus how much they understand me and have integrated mine .
Clearly , the Other is completely biased in how much they trust themselves over others , versus how I humbly and evenhandedly discount my own beliefs alongside theirs .
Since we do n't want to go around encouraging disagreement , one might do well to ponder how all three of these arguments are used by creationists to justify their persistent disagreements with scientists .
That 's one reason I say clearly - if it is n't obvious even to outside onlookers , maybe you should n't be confident of resolving the disagreement there .
Failure at any of these levels implies failure at the meta - levels above it , but the higher - order failures might not be clear .

On a vote of 73 - 21 , it passed a package of nearly 170 land and water bills and sent it to the House of Representatives , which was expected to give it final approval .
Barack Obama is set to sign it into law after he is sworn in as president on Tuesday , one of the first moves in what is likely to be a more aggressive approach toward the environment .
The Senate - passed measure would protect millions of acres ( hectares ) of America ’s parks , rivers , streams and trails from development .
Critics accused Bush of slowing down efforts at wilderness designation , easing environmental regulations and declining to address global warming .
A centerpiece of the Senate package is the National Landscape Conservation System Act .
It would make permanent a 26 million - acre ( 10.5 million - hectare ) system composed of the U.S. Bureau of Land Management ’s best lands and waters .
“ Congressional recognition of the National Landscape Conservation System is long overdue and very much worth celebrating , ” said William Meadows , president of The Wilderness Society .
Richard Moe , president of the National Trust for Historic Preservation , a nonprofit group , said , “ The national monuments , wilderness areas , scenic rivers , trails , and historic sites that make up the National Landscape Conservation System have correctly been called BLM ’s ‘ crown jewels . ’ ”
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , said the legislation , crafted by members of both parties , “ will protect and improve America by land and by sea . ”
There was some discontent in the Democratic - led Senate among Republicans who were refused a chance to offer amendments .
Democratic pushed for passage after months of Republican delays .
“ As we begin the new Congress , it ’s apparent that its business as usual for the Democratic majority and the so - called change coming to D.C. is only in words , not action , ” said Sen. Jim Inhofe , an Oklahoma Republican .
Democratic Sen. Jeff Bingaman of New Mexico called it one of the broadest conservation measures in decades .
Mostly Republican critics , however , said it would deny access to lands for possible oil and gas drilling .
The measure would designate as wilderness more than 2 million acres in nine states -- from Virginia to California -- and declare former President Bill Clinton ’s boyhood home in Hope , Arkansas , a national historic site .

Terry McDonald , chairman of the group , tells Unfair Park there are about 200 members of the Metroplex Atheists , a 20 - year - old nonprofit whose point is " to let people know they 're not alone . "
Says McDonald , " The idea is to present more of a united front for non-believer ideas . "
They 'll get the message in coming days :
The Metroplex Atheists say they already have enough money to get themselves a billboard and are settling the final details ; they 're currently looking at a spot on Stemmons Freeway .
One thing 's for sure , says McDonald , " It 'll be someplace very prominent . "
Maybe next to one of these billboards ?

Last week I wrote about my love affair with bacon , which included an attempt to find out whether the doggie treat Beggin ’ Strips taste like real bacon .
The answer : A big fat NO .
After reading about my love of all things bacon , Susan of the My Right Brain blog suggested I try out BaconSalt , a bacon - flavored seasoning for the times I want to baconize my food in the absence of the real thing .
According to their website , the makers of BaconSalt are “ on a quest to make everything taste like bacon . ”
Best .
Tagline .
Ever .
I got online that day and ordered up two containers of it : one for me , and one for my bacon - loving sister , Ann of the Shampoo Bag .
They arrived last night .
I gleefully took mine to work today in anticipation of making my Healthy Choice Chicken Parmigiana with Broccoli meal a little more palatable .
Here ’s my assessment :
1 . The stuff does n’t smell 100 % like bacon .
It smells more like barbecue sauce , but I salivated nonetheless .
I also sneezed .
2 . It ’s less like salt , and more like crushed up bacon bits .
I expected a powder substance , but it had a slight crunch to it .
3 . When it hit the food , it did n’t dissolve .
It just laid there like a bacon bit would .
4 . It did n’t taste all that much like real bacon , I suspect due to the absence of glorious grease .
5 . Because I bothered to buy it and wanted to give it a full assessment , I sprinkled another teaspoonful onto my lunch and decided I did n’t hate it .
But ……
BaconSalt has one major flaw .
Three hours after lunch , I realized I could still taste bacon , or some facsimile of such .
The thing to watch out for if you buy this stuff is the aftertaste .
Bring a toothbrush , mouthwash , gum and floss if you do n’t want everyone you come into contact with later in the day to know what you had for lunch .
And by all means , do n’t eat it if you have a dentist appointment within two days .
Unless you hate your dentist .
In that case , by all means , go forth and breathe heavily .
My sister
Ann has n’t received her order yet , and I ’m pretty sure she wo n’t want it now .
But ,
Ann , if you want your stinky bacon , come ‘n get it .

Road users are still being " needlessly killed " through the flouting of mobile phone rules five years after they were introduced , accident prevention chiefs said today .
A new law banning the use of hand - held phones while driving was brought in on December 1 2003 .
Last year , there were 23 fatal accidents , as well as 64 serious - injury and 259 slight - injury accidents , involving illegal mobile phone use .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents ( RoSPA ) , which campaigned for the mobiles law , said today that observational research had revealed a reduction in the number of motorists using mobile phones since 2003 , including a fall after harsher penalties for breaking the law were introduced last year .
But the society 's road safety head Kevin Clinton said : " It is disappointing that people are still being needlessly killed and injured on our roads because telephone calls or text messages are deemed more important than someone 's life .
" Our advice to drivers is clear : switch off your phone when you get behind the wheel and let voicemail do its job , and we urge employers to make this part of their road - risk policy . "
RoSPA said research shows that using a mobile at the wheel - whether hand - held or hands - free - made drivers four times more likely to crash .
Drivers caught using a hand - held mobile phone at the wheel face a £ 60 fine and three penalty points on their licence .

As with most things in TV land our story begins in another medium — film !
Back in the 50s THE designer who revolutionized opening credits was Saul Bass who favored a very graphic and illustrational approach to making opening titles an art form onto themselves .
To me his masterpiece was Anatomy of a Murder in 1958 which matched a striking musical score by Duke Ellington to a simple yet powerful animation :
This revolution in cinema from the late 50s had a huge impact on the golden age of television during the 60s .
Although TV was not a high brow medium ready to borrow modern art references and embrace primitivism — but what was interesting is that this freed up many shows from that era to have animated opening titles even though the television show itself was live action .
The first example I came across of this trend was the titles from the series My Three Sons from 1960 .
The color version shown here is a later version of the black and white opening titles :
A bit later in 1962 The Lucy Show came out which was a follow up to he popular series I Love Lucy .
What ’s interesting with these title is that they feature caricatures of Lucille Ball and Vivian Vance which are quite mod looking :
By 1964 the trend had taken off — these opening titles from Bewitched could easily stand up on their own as an animated TV show :
And of course I Dream of Jeannie from 1965 is even more exotic picking up on an Arabian Nights meets NASA visual theme :
What ’s interesting to me is that animated opening titles were n’t just limited to sitcoms , but could also be used for action and adventure television series .
Here ’s a good example from the opening titles of The Wild Wild West from 1965 :
In 1966 things came full circle when you had the Batman TV series which was based on a comic book turned into a live action drama — but what makes these titles so amazing is that they ’re picking up on the fine art notion of Pop Art .
These titles owe a great deal to Roy Lichtenstein who started to create paintings that were based on panels from comic books , but what makes these titles so cutting edge is that Lichtenstein was only doing those paintings just a few years before in the early 60s :
In 1967 the torch is carried by The Carol Burnett Show which kept the flame going until the mid-70s :
And of course no article on animated opening titles would be complete without a mention of 1969 ’s Monty Python which featured the brilliant animation of Terry Gilliam :
And on the hipster side The Partridge Family starts to bring in a hippy touch to the genre in 1970 :
Sadly with the 70s realism came back to television and even comedy shows started switching back to live action or straight graphic approaches to opening titles .
Although one last gem that I did find was the opening titles from Rhoda from 1974 which feature a photo collage technique which still stands up very well today :
I hate to say , “ I told you so , ” but I kinda did in December when I compared the hype over Twitter with the previous hype over SecondLife .
And , yes , I received my share of angry comments from dedicated users of both services when I pointed out the gap between the reported usage numbers and the number of users who actually continue to use the services for longer than a month .
According to this much publicized article from Nielsen about the “ Twitter Quitters , ” it turns out that diehard - fan love aside , I was n’t so far off the mark .
But I ’m not writing this to gloat .
That would be easy ( and fairly satisfying ! ) .
It would also be pointless .
Looking at Twitter , the associated hype , and its lack of a viable business model makes a great lens for examining future technologies and their usefulness for marketers .
Twitter makes a great case study for how “ eyeballs ” do n’t always equal “ great advertising opportunity . ”
It also makes a great example of how hype does n’t always equal dollars , especially if the technology that ’s being hyped is n’t set up from the beginning to be monetized .
According to the Nielsen study , 60 percent of registered Twitter users do n’t return after the second month .
For the last 12 months of the study , Twitter ’s retention rate was closer to 30 percent .
This kind of attrition means that at some point there just wo n’t be enough new users to replace the ones who are leaving .
Compare this to Facebook and MySpace .
Even though both services had a fairly high attrition rate , according to this social network loyalty chart , user loyalty was still twice as high as Twitter ’s .
And as they grew , retention skyrocketed up to 70 percent .
Bottom line ?
They ’re sustainable .
But what about the services that feed into Twitter , you may be asking .
Nielsen went back and added those services to its study .
The results were the same : 60 percent of people stopped using Twitter after the first month .
Does this mean the service is doomed ?
No .
Obviously , a lot of people still get a lot out of the service .
But what are they getting ?
Let ’s step back from the hype for a minute .
What is Twitter exactly ?
At heart , it ’s really just a way to send quick text messages out to a group of people who are interested in receiving updates about you ( and by “ you ” I mean “ whoever is sending out those messages , ” including the Mars Rover ) .
The Twitter user demographics tend to skew toward the young ( 18 - 24 ) and male ( about 10 percent higher than the Internet average gender mix ) .
Who else matches this profile ?
According to Scarborough Research , heavy texters match up pretty well .
There are more of them , but they also tend to be 18 - 24 and male .
They also spend a lot of time online and like to spend their money on technology .
Not all that surprising , I ’m sure .
It ’s not surprising because heavy Twitter users and heavy texters are doing the same thing .
They tend to be young people on the go who use short text messages to keep in touch with their extended networks .
And therein lies the main problem with Twitter ’s business model and , by extension , its ultimate usefulness to marketers .
Think about it : who ’s really making money from text messaging ?
The mobile carriers .
They control the means of message distribution and get paid every time someone sends one ( or , with an “ unlimited plan , ” get paid by those who want to send text messages ) .
Poor Twitter does n’t make a dime from the messages sent over the service .
By opening up its service via an API ( define ) , it ’s more or less eliminated any chance it could .
And the format means that advertising ca n’t be sent through the service , though there ’s plenty of advertising on some of the sites ( and apps ) that interface with the service .
Could n’t Twitter charge for messages ?
I suppose , but as newspapers found out , once the paid - content horse has left the barn , it ’s too late to shut the door .
And even if it decided to charge for premium content , chances are that someone else could provide it for free .
Unless everyone plays the pay - for - access game , nobody can play ( unless you have truly unique content that ca n’t be found anywhere else ) .
I ’m not arguing that Twitter ca n’t be useful for keeping your friends and clients ( and other followers ) up to date about our activities or as a channel for disseminating nifty links and other tidbits of information .
Nor am I arguing that it ’s not useful to use Twitter in real - time applications , such as commenting on TV shows together or passing virtual notes during speeches at conferences .
It ’s great for those things .
But is it a viable model for a sustainable business ?
As the Magic 8 - Ball likes to say , “ All signs point to No . ”
What does the future hold for Twitter ?
Perhaps
Twitter will end up becoming something like IRC , moving to more of a protocol that ’s maintained by volunteers in a decentralized fashion .
After all , with all the Twitter hype , nobody mentions the fact that IRC regularly serves hundreds of thousands of users at a time .
Or perhaps Twitter will be purchased by an entity like Facebook , which could then work to close the barn door and make the service available only to Facebook users .
Considering that Twitter has received over $ 57 million in venture funding from the likes of Union Square Ventures , Digital Garage , Spark Capital , and Bezos Expeditions , it seems that at some point those guys will want to make some money back .
Unlike a lot of dot - bomb ideas from the late 1990s and early 2000s , Twitter is undoubtedly a useful idea .
However , like a lot of the ventures that came out of that period , Twitter is also a case - in - point that eyeballs do n’t necessarily equal dollars , or even necessarily long - term viability .
It may be cool right now , but its high attrition rate and difficult - to - fathom business model means that its future might be a lot different than the hype today .
I ’m sure plenty of you will be tweeting about it .

Supreme Court to decide Ashcroft , Mueller immunity Agence France - Presse
Published : Wednesday December 10 , 2008
Print This Email This
The US Supreme Court will hear a case Wednesday on whether cabinet - level officials could be held accountable for controversial tactics President George W. Bush ordered as part of the US - led " war on terror . "
Former attorney general John Ashcroft and FBI Director Robert Mueller have sought immunity from the charges in a lawsuit filed by Javaid Iqbal , a Pakistani national .
Iqbal was among more than 700 Arab and South Asian Muslim men from the New York City area rounded up after the September 11 , 2001 attacks .
While they were all eventually charged with immigration violations or minor crimes , none was linked to terrorism .
In his lawsuit , Iqbal alleges that Ashcroft and Mueller targeted the men for investigation and punitive detention , sidestepping procedural protections usually granted to such detainees .
Iqbal , who was held at a maximum security section of a Brooklyn federal prison , says he was subjected to harsh treatment and discrimination and that federal officials classified him as a " high interest " suspect because he was a Muslim from Pakistan .
A June 2003 report by the Department of Justice inspector general found " significant problems " in the treatment of detainees like Iqbal .
Iqbal 's lawsuit says Ashcroft and Mueller approved the policy of holding post -September 11 detainees in restrictive confinement .
Ashcroft was among those who " willfully and maliciously approved of , endorsed , and / or ordered that these searches take place " and " knew of , condoned , and willfully and maliciously agreed to subject ( Iqbal ) to unreasonable , unnecessary and extreme strip and body - cavity searches , " according to the suit .
A federal court and an appeals court refused to remove the cabinet - level officials from the case .
Lawyers for Ashcroft and Mueller say their clients were not personally involved in the detainee mistreatment and did not know about Iqbal .
" A complaint must allege sufficient facts to cross the line between possibility and plausibility , " Solicitor General Gregory Barre wrote in his brief to the court .
Barre says Iqbal 's lawyers have failed to provide enough evidence linking Ashcroft and Mueller to Iqbal 's mistreatment .
Alexander Reinert , who will argue for Iqbal , challenges the government 's position as an attempt to avoid responsibility by high - ranking officials for mistreatment okayed by the Bush Administration .
" The government 's position will have the practical effect of ensuring that these officials will never be held accountable for unconstitutional conduct , " Reinert said in a statement .
Some critics have assailed Ashcroft over the Patriot Act , legislation that broadened law enforcement powers after September 11 , saying it did so at the expense of civil liberties .
Iqbal claims that during his five - month confinement he was held 23 hours a day in a constantly lit cell where the air conditioning was turned on in the winter and the heat was turned in the summer .
He says he was also beaten and strip - searched .
Upon release in 2003 , he had lost nearly 20 kilograms ( 44 pounds ) .
He was then deported to Pakistan with no terror - related charges filed against him .
Where is the love to be found ?
Wo n't someone tell me , cause life must be somewhere to be found — instead of Concrete Jungle .

Mwaaah , P.M. made a joke .
Putting a poll like this up on this site is akin to putting up a poll asking if people support the Green Shift on the Greenpeace website .
Both polls have absolutely zero validity .
But hey , if you need to find something to feel good about yourself for at least 10 minutes , be my guest .

For Canadians , the Conservatives have been wrong on almost every issue that has defined what Canadians believe in .
On the questions of universal healthcare , and small " l " liberal community standards , the Tories have been swimming upstream .
As a result they 've spent 90 % of so of the last century on the outside looking in .
Those of us " of a certain age " remember the vicious lying fight they put up against universal health care .
Harper has " won " two minority governments .
Despite an historic Liberal collapse in Quebec he was unable to win a majority .
Why ?
Because Canadians are not ready to hand over our " social network " to the " tender care " of the Religious Right and the Reaganite " Trickle Down , Deregulate , Government is the enemy " crowd .
As in the USA , the " right " does n't want government " leaner " it wants Government " gone . "
The US shows us the end game of that philosophy .
Canadians know better .
Polls always show a majority of Canadians as being " center / left . "
Harper 's hatred and disrespect of the opposition may have now created the " New Liberal Democratic Party " of Canada .
Thank you Mr. Harper , your disrespect is going to give Canadians the opportunity to elect , " Change we can believe in ! "

You should have moved all your money to NY .
The Dow only went down 8 % , not 9 % like the TSX .
Think of all the money you would have saved .
The crude oil price was down 9 % not because of lack of world demand but because of a possible Bloc - Liberal - NDP coalition government .

Do n't thank the opposition for reacting accordingly .
Thank your the conservative leadership under Harper for inciting this activity that only serves to create instability in an already uncertain time of our lives .
Let 's work together and find common goals that we all share .
What is wrong with that notion ?
It 's called minority government .
It is a mandate to cooperate and seek consensus .
Harper failed .
He failed Canada .
He failed the Conservative party .
And he failed himself .

Well this is the time to look at a seperate Western Canada .
As someone in my mid fifties I do not look foreward to my hard earned money being seized and wasted by a group of eastern scum .
As for Mr Harper , the man is a Saint could you imagine putting up with that group of Monkeys in Ottawa as long as he has .

As an Alberta Separatist I would welcome any and all WESTERN provinces and Territories that want to put an end to the miserable lie of " Kanada " , John .
I too have seen first hand the malice held against Alberta especially by my eastern " bretheren " .
I travelled Canada and talked to people about their impressions of Alberta .
Suffice to say we are not well regarded , as we are seen as inbred , dim witted , poorly educated , greedy and un-Canadian - and by that they mean we do n't lay down and take what Central Kanada intends on dishing out " for the good of the country " even if it means only WE are the ones that get raped .
Posted by : Gavin Anger | 2008-12-01 8:12:15 PM
I am NOT support of this move .
I voted and this was n't what I voted for .
Yes Conservative did n't win a majority and X number of people do n't want them , BUT even MORE do not want Liberal , Bloc or NDP in power !!!!!!
This is blatant disregard for Canadians , and an act against democracy !
If Conservative joined forced with the BLOC they'd be murdered in the headlines for joining the Separatists ..... Not for the libs and ndp's !
Gavin Anger - I 'm with you .
I never was a supporter of separation but to me separation is bettern than having Eastern Canada ( Ottawa ) ransacking and raping Alberta .
I 'd rather separate ...
It 's not worth reliving through the 80's or worse ...... We do n't forget the National Energy Program .
Posted by : Carlyn L. | 2008-12-01 9:11:49 PM
To add to what Gavin Anger has written , keep in mind the whole reason the three are joining forces is to break Alberta again , misery does love company .
And as Carlyn L pointed out none of us have forgotten the National Energy Program .
By the way I reside in Central British Columbia and we here will suffer from your downfall as we all work in the " Patch " , our own goverment haven forgotten us years ago .

Did the people not speak ?
The people of Canada returned a Conservative Government to Ottawa less than two months ago with an increased minority .
The people of this country spoke in a legal election .
So what difference should that make ?
To power hungry politicians it seems to make no difference at all .
At this time , when the world and our country face the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression , when it ’s going to take great political will to keep the country ’s economy afloat , it makes no difference to our opposition parties .
Why ?
What started this sad chain of events ?
The Conservatives decided to lead by example , a previously unheard of governmental strategy , and look at every area in government and its programs where money could be saved , like MPs having to take a taxi not a limo to work .
One of the areas they questioned was the $ 1.95 payment to all political parties for each vote they received in the August 14 election .
That amounts to about 28 million dollars of tax payer money .
This program the liberals under Chretien instituted to stop , supposedly , the large campaign contributions by big corporations and unions in exchange for granting favors to the contributors later on .
Could this scenario have been dealt with in other ways ?
You bet !
Governments make laws to stop activities not good for the country all the time .
But the Liberals had a lot to gain by this .
They had been getting majority governments .
This would guarantee filled Liberal coffers after expensive elections .
To me , giving my tax dollars to the Bloc , the party on record to break this great country up , is distasteful .
But the law is the law , right ?
What the Liberals , the New Democratic Party and the Bloc are planning to do on December 8 is not just distasteful .
It ’s undemocratic and hypocritical .
Those of us who love this country and believe in democracy must demand that our politicians answers several question .
What difference does the will of the people make ?
Did the Conservatives not back off cancelling the public subsidy that started it all ?
What had to be promised Gilles Duceppe to go along with this insanity ?
Does it matter that we will lose credibility with the industrialized nations ?
The questions the rest of us need to ask are :
Do we think that having the Bloc Quebecois , the party out to destroy Canada , as part of a coalition leading our nation is a good thing that will see us through tough economic times ?
Did we give Dion a mandate to become Prime Minister ?
Is democracy really important to us ?
Will we gain respect , not be the laughing stock among leaders of the world ?
What difference should the voice of the people really make ?

I totally support it .
The majority rules .
That 's democracy .
Harper called an early election because he thought he would get a majority .
Instead he got a minority , but was behaving like he had the majority .
So the opposition called him on it .
Harper could have totally avoided this if showed any sign of cooperation .
If the opposition parties can cooperate , they totally deserve to run the country because that is what we need during this economic crisis .
We needed action on the economy , and not the denial that of Flaherty and Harper .

I used to think if Chuck Norris fell into a river that Chuck Norris would n’t get wet , the river would get Chuck Norris’d .
But following what I saw at the Beverly Center in Los Angeles this weekend , I bet that pussy would drown .
It all started Saturday afternoon in the food court shortly after I noticed I was within ten feet of the real life Walker , Texas Ranger as he prepared to unleash his manly appetite on a Rubios fish taco .
I was waiting for him to shatter each of its covalent bonds and break its constituent molecules into biochemical fuel for the ass kicking engine that drives his lion ’s heart and keeps that ruthless , rock hard cock of his fucking first and asking questions later when two black toughs sat down at the table beside him and started giving him the business .
“ Maaaan , it smells like a dirty - ass pussy ‘ round here ! ” said the first guy , who bared a reasonable likeness to Tupac .
“ I hurd dat , ” said the second , who , ironically enough looked a little like Biggie Smalls , “ It smells like Red Lobster needs to be shut down , dogg ! ”
Snickering , Tupac tried to assume a serious tone long enough to lean over and say , “ Ay Chuck , yo’ pussy stank , ” but he began laughing in the middle , inducing more peels of laughter from his friend .
“ Yeah Chuck , you need to go home and wash that pussy , ” Biggie chortled , tears dripping down his cheeks .
Then , seconds after the thought went through my mind that the last thing going through these suicidal maniacs ’ heads was about to be Chuck Norris ’s right and left fists , IT happened .
IT being nothing .
The great and powerful Chuck Norris did nothing .
He just sat uneasily in his chair , squeezing and squeezing a single dried out lime wedge over his taco like a little bitch .
“ Faggot , ” one of them coughed what I assumed HAD to be his last word on Earth , what with Norris ’s well publicized efforts to promote Prop.
8 and his general disdain for anything remotely fruity and unchristian and all , but I thought wrong .
Again , he did nothing but squeeze the hell out of that same poor , desiccated wedge of fruit .
Completely flummoxed , I wondered , “ What the hell is going on here ? ” as Tupac kicked the back of Chuck ’s chair .
Has the world gone completely sideways ?
Here ’s the man I once considered the world ’s biggest bad ass being called a “ Fucking asshole ” by some sneering street urchin , and he ca n’t muster more than a , “ Come on guys , I do n’t want any trouble ” ?
Absolute bullshit .
At this point of time and space I figured Chuck Norris ’s hands should be garroting throats and gouging eyeballs at just below the speed of sound … not floundering to steady his Diet Coke from spilling to the floor from a jarring series of jolts delivered by the feet of some adolescent thug repeatedly slamming into the side of his table .
Incredulous , I watched the rest of the horrifying scene unfold , and meeting a sideways furtive glance from Chuck .
Our eyes met for a brief moment that will be indelibly etched in my mind as he made a slight , almost imperceptible shrug of resignation at the fact that one of his antagonists was shoving the last of his fish taco into his mouth – then let it all fall back out again , chunk by half - chewed chunk , onto his plate .
“ How do you eat this shit , Chuck ? ” he asked , spewing cabbage and fried fish skin , “ It tastes like dogshit ! ”
Disillusioned and deeply shaken , I left my own fish taco untouched , left the food court as Chuck was being given a Diet Coke shower , and as I walked out of the mall , the last thing that went through MY head was that Chuck Norris is n’t the least bit tough .
He is a sad , demented old pussy who uses the might of his celebrity and his crazy - ass church to further curb - stomp on those who ’ve already spent their whole lives being stomped on , and is therefore nothing but a punk - ass bitch .

Several recent studies point to the possible origination of both obesity and diabetes in the womb .
An article in the LA Times last year had a quote from Beverly Muhlhausler , a researcher at the University of South Australia and an authority on fetal diet and adult disease :
“ What research is now showing is that consuming an excessive amount of high - fat , high - sugar foods during pregnancy can alter the development of the baby in such a way that predisposes that individual to becoming obese later in life . ”
[ social_buttons ]
If we continue to wait until middle age to treat societal health issues like obesity and diabetes , we may not ever address the causes , which might already be treatable by changing the mother ’s diet or addressing maternal weight gain .
1 . Mother ’s weight gain during pregnancy is linked to childhood obesity .
A new study of 12,000 adolescents aged 9 - 14 and their mothers concludes that excess weight gain by mothers during pregnancy is directly associated with the risk of obesity in adolescence .
The researchers found that the high birth - weight risk was increased dramatically with a higher weight gain in the mother ( 35 % for a gain of 45 pounds or more ) .
The study came from participants in the Growing Up Today Study , and looked at the correlation between the mother ’s weight gain and their child ’s birth weight and body - mass index ( BMI ) later in life , specifically adolescents .
The abstract is here : Maternal gestational weight gain and offspring weight in adolescence .
2. Maternal gestational diabetes may increase the risk of children being overweight in adolescence .
Another study looks at the link between gestational diabetes and obesity in offspring .
“ Gestational diabetes mellitus ( GDM ) creates a metabolically altered fetal environment which is associated with high birth - weight , also associated with later obesity . ”
The study concludes :
“ Birth weight was directly related to risk of overweight 9 to 14 years later .
GDM , itself a determinant of higher birth weight , was also associated with increased risk of adolescent overweight , but much of this association was explained by the confounding influence of maternal BMI , perhaps owing to a combination of pre- and postnatal environmental factors as well as genetic inheritance .
Thus , GDM is a risk marker for offspring obesity , but to what extent it exerts a causal influence remains the subject of additional research .
Such research is vital , because rising rates of obesity in youth portend an increase in GDM , potentially resulting in a vicious cycle of increasing obesity for generations to come . ”

3. Maternal weight gain is linked to hyperinsulinemia .
An Arizona State University study investigated some conditions during pregnancy that may impact insulin metabolism in offspring .
The pilot study looked at associations between maternal weight gain and infant insulin concentrations , or hyperinsulinemia .
Hyperinsulinemia is a condition of excess levels of circulating insulin in the blood .
It is n’t diabetes , but is often associated with type 2 Diabetes .
“ These data show that maternal weight gain predicted infant insulin concentrations .
Our preliminary data support the contention that gestational weight gain should be carefully considered in overweight populations at high risk for diabetes .
Controlling weight gain during obese pregnancies may be advantageous and more studies of this nature are warranted . ”
Read the results in Diabetes Care journal : Maternal Weight Gain Is Associated With Infant Insulin Concentrations During the 1st Year of Life
For those working with pregnant mothers , education is paramount .
Muhlhausler says , “ One of my dreams as a researcher is to be able to get the message out that what you eat during pregnancy has a huge impact on your child ’s development and long - term health prospects . ”

Like Giz reader Brian , who had this sweet post - xmas story to tell us about his dad :
I went back to MI to my parent 's place this year for Christmas .
My dad 's gift this year was a new 10 mega pixel digital camera with all the bells and whistles .
While helping him figure out his new gadget I thought it would be fun to put pictures on the nice Kodak digital photo frame that I gave them for Christmas last year .
So I ask my dad , " where is your digital frame " ?
Imagine my confusion when he points the frame out to me .

If you 're like me , you 've occasionally wished that you could leave this world behind for the universe between the covers of a favorite book .
And while there is n't much hope for that , it is possible to bring the world of a book to life in the most mundane and wonderful of ways : on a T - shirt .
One enterprising anti-abuse organization , Protect.org , has gotten the OK from Nick Hornby , Chuck Klosterman , Andrew Vachss , Dennis Lehane and other authors to create T - shirts for the fictional establishments from their novels .
You may not be able to shop at Championship Vinyl , but you can now wear its shirt .
The T - shirts -- which they call Novel - Tees -- are all wonderful , but I wish there were more .
For no particular reason , my thoughts turn to Dickens .
That 's my imaginary T - shirt for the law firm from " Bleak House , " Jarndyce & Jarndyce .
If I were a more gifted graphic artist , I 'd have tried to create others ... for , say , the Fagan School for Boys or Miss Havisham 's Bridal Shop .
What about you -- what novelistic T - shirts would you like to see ?

The potential prison sentence is just tacked on to the end of the legislation for no obvious reason other than because it can .
The Government says these offences are all fully debated by Parliament , but many are brought in on secondary legislation which is hardly scrutinised at all ; and all Bills are timetabled in any case .
It does not make a newly - created crime any more palatable simply because it has been rammed through Parliament using a heavily - whipped government majority and by MPs who pay hardly any attention to what they are doing .
' Bionic ' Pair Seeks Webcams for Eyes An artist and filmmaker want to trade prosthetic eyes for cameras .
Nov. 19 , 2008  -- A San Francisco artist sent ripples through the blogosphere when she posted a " call for engineers " on her Web site , asking for advice on replacing an artificial eye with a webcam .
But now it seems that the bionic Eve has found her Adam , so to speak .
On Tuesday , a Canadian documentary filmmaker launched a blog to announce that he is already pursuing that goal and plans to have a working prototype by Christmas .
" Like Tanya Vlach , the ' bionic woman ' to my ' bionic man , ' I lost an eye and want to replace it with a wireless webcam eye .
I chatted with her and I think we are going to work together , " Rob Spence wrote on his blog .
" As far as I 'm concerned everyone who has a fake eye should turn it into a video camera , " said Spence , 36 , who lost his eye when he was 11 years old .
He was playing with a gun at his grandfather 's farm in Ireland ; it backfired and severely injured his eye .
Years later , he had his eye removed .
" When you 're a filmmaker and you have hole in your head , and you like ' Star Trek , ' it 's a natural progression , " he told ABCNews.com .
In talking to Vlach , he continued , he recognized his desire to turn a loss into an opportunity .
" As soon as I have a working prototype , I 'd be happy to give her one , " he said .
" She went through the same exact thought process that I went through . "
' An Experiment in Wearable Technology '
After Vlach lost her left eye in a 2005 car accident , the now - 35 - year - old artist launched a blog to document her experience .
Titled One - Eyed , the site is about " the future of sight , a chronicling of her adjustment to a monocular life , and why she looks so damn good in an eye patch , " she writes .
A self - proclaimed " sci - fi geek , " Vlach was intrigued by the possibilities that current technology could offer her .
" Ever since my accident I 've been fascinated about having a bionic eye , " she told ABCNews.com .
Recognizing that miniature cameras abound in cell phones , webcams and other mobile cameras , she wondered whether a camera small enough to fit in her prosthetic eye might also exist .
Vlach said that she 's been working on a documentary about her accident and researching the eye - cam idea for more than a year .
" It was my way of recreating the eye that I lost , " she said .
Calling it " an experiment in wearable technology , cybernetics and perception , " Vlach posted a challenge on her blog , asking engineers for help in creating a camera that could be implanted in her artificial eye .
The camera would not restore her sight , but would allow her to record her life from her lost eye 's point of view .
Vlach said she 'll decide how to use the video once she 's closer to actually having the device .
Once Wired magazine 's Kevin Kelly mentioned it on his blog , her post quickly caused a blogospheric stir .
Vlach said she expected some attention but has been surprised by the more than 100 blog comments and 50 or so e-mails she 's accumulated since her post went live last week .
But one of the most promising message she received has been the one from Spence .
As luck would have it , the Toronto - based filmmaker is actually not so far from Vlach this week , attending an imaging technology conference in Monterey , Calif .
The purpose of his trip ?
To make a presentation about his plans to enhance his artificial eye .
On Thursday , Vlach said , she plans to meet with Spence for the first time to learn more about his project .
Although it 's likely that the two will work together in some way , she said , she has other interesting responses she plans to review before making a decision .
Is a Bionic Eye Really Possible ?
In her original blog post , Vlach included a list of specifications she 'd gathered from her research on miniature cameras .
She challenged engineers to envision a Bluetooth type eye - cam with a remote trigger that would allow her to blink to zoom , focus and switch on and off .
Engineers and tech enthusiasts responded with a flurry of suggestions , including copying technology that enables endoscope cameras in pills that give doctors high - resolution video of a patient 's intestines .
But many supporters also voiced a few key concerns : namely , powering the device and creating enough room in the prosthetic to hold a camera , a power source and a transmitter .
Spence , however , said he has been working with Steve Mann , an MIT graduate and University of Toronto engineering professor , to overcome these issues .
A pioneer in wearable computing , Mann has lived for the last 30 years as a " cyborg , " with a wireless video camera that allows him to transmit the daily events of his life to the Internet .
The duo said they are four to six months away from a prototype that meets Vlach 's specifications .
Spence said that his ocularist has created a prosthetic roomy enough to house all the key components and that they are experimenting with batteries and wireless power .
He said they are also still tinkering with a prosthetic that will open , so that batteries can be inserted , and seal securely .
Eye - Shaped Cameras
For their part , eye experts say an " eye cam " would pose few medical risks .
William Danz , Vlach 's ocularist , said he supports the project and looks forward to creating the prosthetic encasement for the new technology .
Dr. Eli Peli , a senior scientist at the Boston - based Schepens Eye Research Institute and professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School , also said that the medical risks were minor .
However , he questioned the practicality of the pursuit .
" [ Vlach ] says that she wants a camera mounted in her prosthesis to compensate for visual field loss .
But when you lose an eye , you lose just a little , " he said .
So little , he said , that in every country in the world you 're allowed to drive with only one eye .
Another limitation Peli raised concerned the shape of camera sensors currently available .
Flat microchips commercially used as light sensors for cameras would distort the picture .
Viewers would get a " fish - eye " view , he said , resembling the image seen through door peepholes .
But hope may still exist with a team of engineers in the Midwest that , this summer , published its work on eye - shaped cameras in the journal Nature .
Instead of using a typical flat microchip as a sensor , John Rogers and Yonggang Huang , professors of engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign and Northwestern University , respectively , developed a sensor that is a flexible mesh wire of wire - connected light detectors .
" We are the first ones to demonstrate that this is possible .
You can pretty much use the camera on any shape you want , " Huang told ABCNews.com .
He also said that powering the device would be a significant hurdle .
But , Huang continued , because their technology transfers flat electronic components to any curved surface , like the human eye , it could be a perfect fit .
" With our technology this should be very possible , " he said .

' Crisis situation ' for Marin 's coho salmon MARIN COUNTY
Lack of rain leads to 89 % drop in the number of returning offspring of parents that spawned 3 years ago in local creeks
A male and female steel head salmon was spotted under a bridge at the main campground at Samuel P. Taylor State Park on January 8 , 2008 .

The lack of rain this winter has contributed to what fisheries biologists say is , so far , the worst return of coho salmon in the recorded history of Marin County 's Lagunitas Creek watershed , one of California 's most critical ecosystems for the endangered fish .
Only a smattering ofcoho were spotted and only 20 egg nests , or redds , were seen in the two main tributaries - Lagunitas and San Geronimo creeks - during the annual winter survey of fish , watershed biologists said this week .
The paltry showing of redds represents an 89 percent drop in the number of returning offspring of parents that gave birth in the lush western Marin watershed three years ago .
Last year at this time , 148 redds had been counted , then the lowest number in the 14 years that records have been kept , said Paola Bouley , the conservation program director for the Salmon Protection and Watershed Network , or SPAWN .
" It 's just frightening , actually , " Bouley said .
" We were expecting 70 redds , which is still a 63 percent decline .
It 's definitely a crisis situation . "
The waterway , which winds its way through the picturesque San Geronimo Valley on the northwest side of Mount Tamalpais , typically supports the largest wild run of salmon left in the state , historically about 10 percent of California 's coho population .
During the first winter rains , the spawning fish swim 33 miles from the open ocean into Tomales Bay and up the creek through the redwood - studded valley to lay their eggs and die .
The females lay their eggs only after they 've found the place where they were born three years before .
The decline this year is alarming given that 190 redds were counted in 2005 when the parents of these coho laid their eggs .
The plummeting coho numbers exacerbate a near catastrophic decline in the overall population of salmon along the West Coast .
So few chinook salmon returned to spawn in the Sacramento - San Joaquin river system last year that ocean fishing had to be banned in California and Oregon .
The number of coho eggs throughout the state declined about 70 percent last year .
The low number of coho in the Lagunitas watershed in 2007 was shocking given that a record 496 redds were counted in 2004 , the year they were born .
" We had our best year class in 2004 , " Bouley said .
" What happened is our best year class turned into our worst year class . "
This year is looking even worse .
Fisheries biologists believe the primary cause is the unusually dry weather in Northern California , which has prevented salmon from swimming up the creeks .
The rains in December were barely enough to breach sandbars on most beaches , forcing salmon up and down the coast to circle in the open ocean where they are vulnerable to sea lions and other predators .
" It 's not looking good , " said Sean Hayes , a National Marine Fisheries Service biologist who monitors salmon in Scott Creek , the southernmost coho run in California , north of Davenport ( Santa Cruz County ) .
" The fish have been hammered a couple of years in a row now .
If it does n't rain , there could be a spawning failure this year , which would be catastrophic . "
Threat of extinction
Bouley said a big rainstorm could turn things around , but hardly any rain is expected in the next two weeks .
If things do n't improve , she said , this year 's cycle of fish may go extinct .
The lack of salmon in Lagunitas Creek is a major concern , she said , because the watershed is a statewide model for fisheries restoration .
The first winter rains normally bring schools of coho wriggling up the creeks , drawing tourists , schoolchildren and naturalists to watch the fish leap from the foaming rapids .
" The Lagunitas population is critical to the viability of the entire central California coho population .
It is the keystone watershed along the coast , " Bouley said .
" Fisheries agencies look to Lagunitas as the key to the recovery for neighboring watersheds .
We wo n't have any streams left to seed them if this one is gone . "
The watershed is unique in that the primary spawning grounds are in the middle of developed communities .
Since coho were listed as endangered in 2005 under the Endangered Species Act , many residents have taken a proprietary interest in the fish .
Schools have become involved , organizing work parties and teaching children about the historic coho migration .
More than a century ago , about 6,000 coho spawned in the system of streams every year .
At that time , the salmon swam from Tomales Bay virtually to the top of Mount Tamalpais , spawning in tributaries all along the way .
But industry started taking a toll almost from the day Joseph Warren Revere spotted the valley in 1846 and saw " a copious stream , fed by mountain brooks . "
The redwood forests surrounding the creek were logged between 1860 and 1900 .
Subsequent homes and roads built along the waterway removed about 60 percent of the original riparian habitat .
The first major dam , which created Lake Lagunitas , was built in 1873 .
Six more dams were constructed over the next century , the largest being Peter 's Dam at Kent Lake , finished in 1953 and then raised 42 feet in 1982 .
The dams blocked 50 percent of the historic salmon habitat , reduced the amount of gravel and increased sedimentation in the creeks .
But the decline was slow .
Old - timers told how they used to spear fish from decks or garage hatches overlooking the creek .
In 1959 , when the habitat was already in serious decline , the largest recorded coho in state history , a 22 - pounder , was fished out of Lagunitas Creek .
Lobbying the county
The restoration effort began in the early 1980s when a group called Trout Unlimited began lobbying the county to stop the decline of the fishery .
SPAWN , which was created in 1996 , sponsors salmon - watching creek walks during spawning season and has saved more than 15,000 juvenile salmon and steelhead from drying pools during the summer .
The Marin Municipal Water District , which is required by the state to help the coho as mitigation for raising Peter 's Dam , started counting coho redds in the early 1990s and now works with SPAWN to monitor releases from the dam , install woody debris in the creeks and replant vegetation .
" This is the beacon of hope for the California watershed , " Bouley said , but " the fish are missing .
They are gone . "
A massive power blackout has hit Victoria with nearly 350,000 residents and businesses without power .
Homes and businesses in Sunshine , Melton , Woodend , Laverton , Werribee , Geelong , Torquay , Docklands , South Melbourne , Albert Park , Fishermen 's Bend , Brunswick , Northcote and Westgate have been hit by outages .
The city 's bright lights have dimmed with entertainment hotspots including the Docklands affected and traffic lights on Kings Way out .
The blackouts follow an order from the nation 's power wholesaler that Victorian power supplier , SP AusNet , shed 1000 megawatts to " ensure system security ' ' after a plant failure .
The cut has left 276,000 CitiPower customers and 63,500 Powercor customers in the dark .
Hoping to avert a growing catastrophe , the European Parliament has approved the creation of bee " recovery zones " across the Continent .
Intended to boost plummeting bee numbers – as well as stave off further agricultural losses – the measure garnered the support of an overwhelming majority of members when they voted on the measure late last month .
The recovery zones will provide bees places to buzz that teem with a diversity of plants rich in nectar and pollen , as well as free of pesticides .
Despite their ponderous bureaucratic moniker , the zones are based on a simple , age - old idea , says Raffaele Cirone , president of the Federation of Italian Beekeepers .
" They are just grassy lands left uncultivated and unfertilized , where flowers can grow freely , to the benefit of insects who feed on them , " Mr. Cirone says .
" Leaving areas uncultivated is part of the farming and beekeeping tradition in Italy and many other European countries . "
The idea is not just good for the insects .
Intensive agriculture can impoverish the land .
Bee - friendly production calls for alternating fields of crops with uncultivated grassy areas .
These grassy swaths are ideal places for apiaries .
Switzerland , which is not part of the European Union , already has a law setting mandatory quotas of " environmental compensation zones , " ranging from 1 to 2 percent of cultivated areas , says Theo Nicollerat , president of a Swiss beekeeping association .
" Rather than for recovering insects , they are mostly intended as a tool to preserve farming land . "
Now , the European Parliament is pushing for the creation of similar quotas across the 27 member states of the European Union .
The resolution does not set specific quotas , but its main proponent , British Member of Parliament Neil Parish , says he hopes governments promote the creation of enough recovery zones within their borders to transform at least 1 percent of the continent 's cultivated areas into havens for bees .
In addition , the resolution from Strasbourg promotes the idea of " compensation zones , " which would be cultivated with protein - rich flowers .
Poor nutrition from monoculture crops is believed to be one factor behind the trouble for bees .
Modern agricultural practices , in which few acres go untilled and where food crops have been shunned in favor of biofuels , has cut the amount of bee - friendly landscapes across Europe , Cirone says .
" In the past two decades , the improper use of pesticides has forced most of us to leave the areas close to cultivated fields and to move to the hills , " says Cirone , a beekeeper .
He welcomed the EU measure because it would encourage farmers to go back to traditional practices that benefit bees .
" It 's the least we can do if we want to stop this emergency . "
The rapid decline of bee populations continues to baffle scientists .
Discovered by North American beekeepers two years ago , the so - called Colony Collapse Disorder has since spread across much of Western Europe .
In the past two years , Italy has lost almost half of its bees .
The causes of the disorder are not thoroughly understood .
Originally , it was blamed largely on climate changes and excessive pesticide use .
A study published in May by researchers from the universities of Plymouth and Stirling , in Britain , and Poitiers ( in France ) suggests other factors are playing big roles , including the lack of nutritional food for bees .
Indeed , certain kinds of flowers , including white clover and wild mustard , produce nectar that is particularly rich in protein and other nutrients that are useful to the well - being of insects , according to the research .
The cultivation of much of Europe 's arable land with crops and vegetables that are favored by humans , but poor in nutritious nectars , have deprived bees of a major protein source .
The disappearance of bees has caused honey production to be cut in half .
Agriculture across Europe is also beginning to suffer :
Many fruit and vegetable crops – from almonds and pears to soybeans and cucumbers – depend on bees for pollination .
In fact , about three - quarters of all food grown in Europe is somehow dependent on bees , according to information provided by the EU Parliament .
Italy , which is home to some of the continent 's highest numbers of hives and one of the most valuable fruit and nut harvests , has already suffered $ 100 million in losses from the decline of bees , according to Italy 's beekeepers association .
Experts are now saying that southern Italy 's entire cherry crop could be wiped out within a few years .
Europe - wide , an estimated $ 1.25 billion in agriculture has already disappeared with the bees .
Last month , the RIAA announced that it was putting an end to its reviled legal campaign against P2P users and would not be filing any new cases , moving instead towards a graduated response plan .
There are a number of cases still in the pipeline , however , some of which have been slowly chugging along towards a conclusion of one sort or another .
But it appears that lawsuits directed at college students are quickly wrapping up , as the RIAA has dropped at least three John Doe cases in the past week .
The cases in question involve students at the University of North Carolina - Charlotte , North Carolina State , Rhode Island College , and the University of Michigan .
In each instance , the RIAA had filed its customary John Doe lawsuits seeking ex parte subpoenas , forcing the schools to turn over the names and addresses of the students using IP addresses flagged by ex-investigator MediaSentry .
In each case , the RIAA has voluntarily dismissed the cases without prejudice , meaning that the anonymous students could be sued if the labels were to have another change of heart .
But given that the RIAA is moving away from the litigation strategy that it has pursued for over five years , it 's likely that the students ' identities will never be known to the industry group .
Of the 14 students in North Carolina , two settled with the RIAA , presumably after receiving prelitigation settlement letters .
The 22 students at Rhode Island College may have been saved by the actions of the school 's ISP , Apogee Telecom , according to Ray Beckerman .
He points out that Apogee filed a motion objecting to the RIAA 's subpoena seeking identifying data on the students .
Seven students at the University of Michigan are also off the hook .
As we 've pointed out on numerous occasions , the RIAA 's campaign against college students has not gone as smoothly as the rest of the 30,000 or so lawsuits filed by the group .
Both students and colleges have appeared to be more inclined to challenge the record labels in court , with varying degrees of success .
Faced with opposition by the students in North Carolina , the ISP for Rhode Island College , and a ruckus surrounding MediaSentry 's legal status as a private investigator in the state of Michigan , the RIAA looks to have thrown in the towel rather than deciding to fork out more money for legal fees and court costs — arguably a wise decision given both its stated commitment to dropping the legal campaign and the tight economic climate .
With these and other cases being wrapped up , there are only a couple of high - profile remnants of the industry 's war against P2P users left on the agenda .
One is the scheduled retrial of Jammie Thomas later this year ; the other is the case against Joel Tenenbaum , who is being represented by Harvard Law School professor Charles Nesson and a host of students .
The RIAA feels confident about the evidence it has in the Thomas case and its chances for a victory in a second trial , but whether it has the stomach to actually go through with it remains to be seen .
The Tenenbaum case is shaping up to be another PR nightmare with the RIAA , as Nesson recently convinced the presiding judge to stream the court proceedings online , a decision the RIAA is anxious to see overturned .

Now council chiefs are sending heat detector vans down your street ... to snoop on ' wasters '
Town halls are photographing houses in the middle of the night to see whether they are wasting energy .
The thermal images , which show heat escaping though windows , doors and roofs , will be sent to homeowners to encourage them to insulate .
Tens of thousands of properties have been photographed over the past few months and there are plans to extend the scheme to every house in the country .
Glowing evidence : Thermal cameras are used to check how much heat is leaking
The images show warmer temperatures as whites , reds , yellows and oranges , and cooler temperatures as greens and blues .
So in the pictures above , the house with the mainly green walls is well insulated , only losing a little heat through the top of the garage door and upstairs windows .
The other property is radiating heat through the walls .
The company behind the taxpayer - funded Heatseekers scheme denies the photographs are an intrusion into privacy .
But the project will inevitably raise concerns about the rise of the Big Brother state .
At least 25 councils have signed deals with Heatseekers .
This week , the vans were touring Salford in the evening taking around 1,000 images an hour .
A spokesman for Salford City Council said : ‘ We hope people do n’t see it like Big Brother is watching you – it ’s about helping people cut their energy bills and save money .
' Depending on their age , address and circumstances people may qualify for free or grant - aided insulation . ’
Ride and seek :
The heat detector vans used by 25 local authorities in Britain
Experts say a typical home wastes hundreds of pounds on lost heat every year – mostly through windows , walls and lofts .
Some estimates suggest that one pound in three spent on household energy is thrown away .
Heatseekers , which is owned by the insulation company Mark Group , says that eight million homes in the UK need insulation .
It carries out its surveys using a fleet of seven marked vans fitted with thermal cameras which drive down streets at 10 mph .
The pictures are taken between 7 pm and 2 am in the autumn , winter and early spring when people are using central heating .
Two or three weeks after the van has passed down a street , families get a copy of the image and a letter explaining how they could save money on their bills .
The scheme is being funded by the Government ’s Carbon Emissions Reduction Target scheme .
I am closing both my new products to affiliates and putting that money into an affiliate account to help American families facing foreclosure
Today I celebrate my first full time year on the Internet but there is something that concerns me even more .
Those that have not had the luck I have in this last year .
Those that wonder how they are going to feed their kids and where they are going to live .
These people are called Americans .
Let ’s take this slow so it is easy to understand .
Normally I pay 40 % of my products sales out to affiliates .
To be able to sell large amounts of product I need big affiliates that will drive tons of traffic .
They get 40 % of every sale .
It ’s how business is done on the Internet .
Instead of putting that 40 % into some person ’s pocket that is already rich by most working class standards , I would rather take that money and save a family facing foreclosure .
So , I am going to no longer pursue super affiliates and instead : I have set an affiliate account to hold 40 % of all sales .
Anyone who buys through the links below will be sending 40 % of the sale into that special affiliate account .
Both my products are members only info product sites and the cost is only $ 27 .
The billing is thru 2Checkout.com .
$ 11 of every sale goes into the affiliate account and will remain there until it goes to pay off a families foreclosure directly to the bank .
We will be starting slow in my own city : Mesa , AZ .
If I can save just one family from being tossed in the street by the greedy banking system we put up with , I will have been successful .
At best I will be able to save 5 families a month .
That ’s $ 50,000 .
I will offer full disclosure and be detailing the process fully .
This will not become a money sucking scam non profit
More than anything this will not become a money sucking non profit paying me or someone else 100 K a year as CEO .
I will handle the funds myself , offer full disclosure here on this site and try to deliver as much as I can directly to the American families that we need to support .
If I have to handle it myself and save one family from losing their home , one family at a time , I will .
I am trying to set an example here
What if every business owner in America did the same thing ?
Save just one family from losing their home .
JUST ONE FAMILY !
The disaster that is befalling Americans like you and me would be over like that .
What if say , The Macaroni Grill donated $ 1 of every entree sold to save American homes ?
What if say : Microsoft donated $ 2 of every Windows license ?
What if say : HP donated $ 3 of every PC and Laptop sold ?
WHAT IF SOMEBODY DID SOMETHING BESIDES BITCH ABOUT IT ???
What if Frank Kern , Eban Pagan , StomperNet , Jack Humphrey , Howie Schwartz , and all the other MILLIONAIRES on the Internet just saved one family ?
I think they can afford it , do n’t you ?
After all they tell us they can teach us to be rich like them .
They certainly and afford $ 10 K to save one family from foreclosure and being thrown in the street .
Save kids from being thrown in the street ?
Or at least I would hope so …..
It ’s worse than you think in America
The government ai n’t gonna save our neighbors homes .
They already gave Trillions to the banks .
What did they do with the money ?
Bought other banks !!
Yeah , Obama ’s gonna save America .
How many more families will loose their homes in the next six months though ?
The only thing the feds have done so far is fund a crappy program with $ 450 million , that only 300 + have applied for and only accepted 133 families .
Meanwhile 3 MILLION homes have been repossessed .
The worst part is that those homes are not in MLS or on the market yet .
When those 3,000,000 homes go up for sale it will kill the already disastrous home values in America .
It will kill your home ’s value .
Your own home will soon be worth less .
Can you not see that if we the people do not put a stop to this now , we all are in for a shit storm of proportions we cannot even imagine ?
I pledge that if I have to save one family , one American home , your neighbor , KIDS , from being thrown in the street by a greedy bank that just wants money I will .
If I have to do it one family at a time , myself , go to the bank and pay the damn mortgage off I WILL .
If every business owner in America did the same we could put a halt to this now .
How can you help ?
Anyone in American can help , anyone anywhere really .
All you have to do is send traffic to the links below or just to this blog post .
The link will do the rest .
The buy link at the bottom of both products salesletters has a unique affiliate ID and it is 1345815 .
When anyone buys thru the link below , 40 % of every sale goes into the unique affiliate account I just set up , to save an American family .
When next month ’s billing comes , another 40 % of THAT sale goes into that affiliate account .
And the month after , and the next month , for the life of the subscriber .
After 6000 sales , there will be $ 66,000 a month I will have to save at least 6 families from foreclosure .
After I pay taxes on my end , I will make less than the fund will disburse .
I think that is fair .
Hey , I am going to be rich this year off these products either way .
This way I can help someone .
Why give the affiliate money to someone who does not need it ?
Think about this , you could easily do the same .
I have already hired one person to handle this and will be soliciting more donations of time and resources to handle the workload .
We will be starting in Mesa , AZ , by next month , paying off mortgages that are at imminent foreclosure .
We will start close to home and hopefully spread out .
American families with kids will come first and as I work out the requirements I will be making them public .

Linux : Should You Use Twice the Amount of Ram as Swap Space ?
Linux and other Unix - like operating systems use the term “ swap ” to describe both the act of moving memory pages between RAM and disk and the region of a disk the pages are stored on .
It is common to use a whole partition of a hard disk for swapping .
However , with the 2.6 Linux kernel , swap files are just as fast as swap partitions .
Now , many admins ( both Windows and Linux / UNIX ) follow an old rule of thumb that your swap partition should be twice the size of your main system RAM .
Let us say I ’ve 32GB RAM , should I set swap space to 64 GB ?
Is 64 GB of swap space required ?
How big should your Linux / UNIX swap space be ?
ADVERTISEMENTS
Old dumb memory managers
I think the ‘ 2 x swap space ’ rule came from Old Solaris and Windows admins .
Also , earlier memory managers were very badly designed .
There were not very smart .
Today , we have very smart and intelligent memory manager for both Linux and UNIX .
Nonsense rule :
Twice the size of your main system RAM for Servers
According to OpenBSD FAQ :
Many people follow an old rule of thumb that your swap partition should be twice the size of your main system RAM .
This rule is nonsense .
On a modern system , that ’s a LOT of swap , most people prefer that their systems never swap .
You do n’t want your system to ever run out of RAM + swap , but you usually would rather have enough RAM in the system so it does n’t need to swap .
Select right size for your setup
Here is my rule for normal server ( Web / Mail etc ) :
Swap space == Equal RAM size ( if RAM < 2GB )
Swap space == 2GB size ( if RAM > 2GB )
My friend who is a true Oracle GURU recommends something as follows for heavy duty Oracle server with fast storage such as RAID 10 :
Swap space == Equal RAM size ( if RAM < 8GB )
Swap space == 0.50 times the size of RAM ( if RAM > 8GB )
Red Hat Recommendation
Red hat recommends setting as follows for RHEL 5/6 :
The reality is the amount of swap space a system needs is not really a function of the amount of RAM it has but rather the memory workload that is running on that system .
A Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 system will run just fine with no swap space at all as long as the sum of anonymous memory and system V shared memory is less than about 3/ 4 the amount of RAM .
In this case the system will simply lock the anonymous and system V shared memory into RAM and use the remaining RAM for caching file system data so when memory is exhausted the kernel only reclaims pagecache memory .
Considering that 1 ) At installation time when configuring the swap space there is no easy way to predetermine the memory a workload will require , and 2 ) The more RAM a system has the less swap space it typically needs , a better swap space
Systems with 4GB of ram or less require a minimum of 2GB of swap space Systems with 4GB to 16GB of ram require a minimum of 4GB of swap space Systems with 16GB to 64GB of ram require a minimum of 8GB of swap space Systems with 64GB to 256GB of ram require a minimum of 16GB of swap space
CentOS Linux 7.x and RHEL 7 recommends the following rules :
Swap will just keep running servers …
Swap space will just keep operation running for a while on heavy duty servers by swapping process .
You can always find out swap space utilization using any one of the following command :
cat / proc / swaps
swapon -s
free -m
top
See how to find out disk I/O and related information under Linux .
In the end , you need to add more RAM , adjust software ( like controlling Apache workers or using lighttpd web server to save RAM ) or use some sort of load balancing .
You can rfer Linux kernel documentation for / proc / sys / vm / swappiness to fine tune swap space .
It is also possible to add a swap space on Linux without creating a new partitions .
A note about Desktop and Laptop
If you are going to suspend to disk , then you need swap space more than actual RAM .
For example , my laptop has 1GB RAM and swap is setup to 2GB .
This only applies to Laptop or desktop but not to servers .
Kernel hackers need more swap space
If you are a kernel hacker ( debugging and fixing kernel issues ) and generating core dumps , you need twice the RAM swap space .
Conclusion
If Linux kernel is going to use more than 2GiB swap space at a time , all users will feel the heat .
Either , you get more RAM ( recommend ) and move to faster storage to improve disk I /O .
There are no rules , each setup and configuration is unique .
Adjust values as per your requirements .
Select amount of swap that is right for you .

Enlarge By Bill Wolf , AP William Forsee , front , representing Nebraska 's Second Congressional District , signs one of five certificates of vote during the Electoral College meeting Monday .
In all 50 states and the District of Columbia , the 538 electors performed a constitutional process to legally elect Democrat Barack Obama the 44th president .
RICHMOND , Va. ( AP ) 
As 13 electors cast ballots Monday for the nation 's first black president in the Confederacy 's old Capitol , Henry Marsh emotionally recalled the smartest man he ever knew — a waiter , who could n't get a better job because of his race .
" He waited tables for 30 years , six days a week , 12 hours a day , from 12 noon to 12 midnight , and he supported his family , " Marsh , 75 , a civil rights lawyer and state senator , said of his father as he fought back tears .
" He suffered a lot .
He went through a lot . "
In all 50 states and the District of Columbia , the 538 electors performed a constitutional process to legally elect Democrat Barack Obama the 44th president .
More than 131 million voters cast ballots — the most ever in a presidential election .
But Obama 's election is not complete until Congress tallies the outcome of Monday 's Electoral College vote at a joint session scheduled for Jan .
6 . Monday 's voting was largely ceremonial , the results preordained by Obama 's Nov. 4 victory over Republican Sen. John McCain .
Obama was to win 365 electoral votes , to 173 for McCain .
With only Hawaii still to vote , all the electors had cast ballots in accordance with the popular votes in their states .
In many states , the formal , staid proceeding was touched with poignance , particularly among people old enough to recall a time when voting alone posed the risk of violence for black Americans .
The contrast at Virginia 's Capitol , where the Confederate Congress met , was particularly striking .
Gov. Timothy M. Kaine noted in his speech that the 200 - year - old Capitol was where lawmakers just 50 years ago orchestrated the state 's formal defiance of federal school desegregation orders .
But he also noted that it is where L. Douglas Wilder took his oath as the nation 's first elected black governor in 1990 .
" This temple of Democracy shines very brightly today , " Kaine told a standing - room - only crowd attending what had always been a sparsely attended afterthought .
In Florida , state Sen. Frederica Wilson , 66 , never thought she would see a black man elected president .
" White water fountains , colored water fountains .
You could n't sit at the lunch counter , go to the bank or get a hamburger , " Wilson said after signing a document certifying that Obama got all 27 of her state 's electors .
" The pain will always be there , but I think there 's a realization that people have evolved , " she said .
In North Carolina , 61 - year - old Janice Cole said Monday 's event was a joyous marker for black people to put old Dixie 's trouble past behind them .
" Sen. Obama reminds us that only in America could this story be possible , " Cole said .
As pro football legend , Franco Harris signs his autograph countless thousands of times .
But the signature he made as one of 21 Pennsylvania electors for Obama was the one the Pittsburgh Steelers great running back wo n't ever forget .
" That was special , " the Pro Football Hall of Famer said .
" This was the most valuable thing I 've ever signed my name to . "
In Augusta , Maine , the moment was freighted with emotion for Jill Duson , the first black mayor of Portland and chairwoman of Maine 's four electors .
" Every time I think of it , I get a little misty eyed , " Duson said .
" I am undone by the election of Barack Obama and what it says to me as a black American , and his victory in the whitest state . "
Sedrick Rawlins , a retired 81 - year - old dentist from Manchester , Conn. , traveled to Selma , Ala. , in 1965 to help the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. , with the bloody march to Montgomery .
The night Obama won the election , he said , he wept with joy .
On Monday , he could n't stop smiling .
" The election is one thing , but it 's really official when they seal those ballots with wax and send them off , " Rawlins said .
Colorado elector Wellington Webb , Denver 's first and only black mayor , said the chance to cast an electoral vote for the first black president was the honor of a lifetime , one that would have made King proud .
" He would find the dream fulfilled , " Webb said .

Did Barack Obama just break his first campaign promise ?
On the campaign trail , Obama railed against big oil companies .
He often criticized John McCain for backing tax cuts that would reward ExxonMobil and other top oil manufacturers .
But now Obama ’s proposal to apply a windfall tax on big oil has vanished … at least from his transition website .
The President - elect ’s transition team has n’t explicitly announced it will drop the windfall tax plan , but a transition aide , commenting on the condition he not be identified , backed off the promise in an email .
“ President - elect Obama announced the [ windfall profits tax ] policy during the campaign because oil prices were above $ 80 per barrel , ” he said .
“ They are currently below that now and expected to stay below that . ”
The windfall profits proposal was deleted from the transition website almost three weeks before the eagle - eyed American Small Business League ( ASBL ) , an advocacy group for small businesses , noticed the change and protested in a press release Tuesday .
The plan was mentioned in a version ( PDF ) of the site that existed after Obama ’s election win .
But when the transition website relaunched on November 8 , references to a excess profits tax on the oil and gas industry were gone .
Obama talked about a windfall profits tax as early as April .
As crude oil prices topped $ 110 a barrel , Obama promised to “ put a windfall profits tax on oil companies and use it to help … families pay their heating and cooling bills and reduce energy costs . ”
And in August , the Democratic nominee issued a campaign ad that promised “ a windfall profits tax on big oil to give families a thousand dollar rebate . ”
The windfall profits tax was a key point of contention between President - elect Obama and McCain in June , when McCain criticized Obama for the plan , calling it “ dangerous ” .
ASBL president and founder Lloyd Chapman says he was “ disappointed ” and “ surprised ” that Obama dropped the windfall tax plan .
He maintains that a reduction in the price of oil does not justify the policy shift .
“ There ’s not always a correlation between the price of a barrel of oil and what we ’re paying at the pump , ” Chapman said .
“ The oil and gas companies are clearly making excessive profits .
They ’ve taken advantage of the fact that there ’s no regulation of that industry and overcharged at the pump and hurt our economy .
The excessive profits tax is based on the excessive profits they ’ve made in the last eight years .
The tax was to get some of that money back for the American people . ”
James Galbraith , an economist at the University of Texas and a frequent Mother Jones contributor , says that Obama ’s change of course “ makes sense ” given the dramatically reduced amount of money a windfall profits tax would bring in now .
“ You could still pass the tax but the revenue from it would be much less , ” Galbraith wrote in an email Tuesday .
Cathy Landry , a spokeswoman for the American Petroleum Institute , which lobbies for the oil and gas industry , says that her organization had n’t heard any details of the Obama team ’s change in plans , but that the oil and gas lobby was happy to hear about it .
“ [ API ] is pleased that President - elect Obama is reevaluating his position , particularly considering the economic situation , ” Landry said .
“ The oil and gas industry has been one of the bright spots in the economy , and this would be a bad time to snuff out bright spots in the economy . ”
By the way , on October 30 , ExxonMobil reported its quarterly earnings .
It netted $ 14.83 billion , setting a national record for quarterly profits .
Bright spot , indeed .

Sometimes , this is what happens when you stay the course !
BOSTON ( Reuters ) - Homelessness and demand for emergency food are rising in the United States as the economy founders , a report said on Friday , and homeless advocates cautioned many cities were not equipped for the increase .

Homelessness and demand for emergency food are rising in the United States as the economy founders , a report said on Friday , and homeless advocates cautioned many cities were not equipped for the increase .
REUTERS / Mario Anzuoni
A survey by the U.S. Conference of Mayors showed that 19 of 25 cities saw an increase in homelessness in the 12 months to October , while four reported a drop and two cities lacked enough data for conclusive results .
On average , the cities in the survey saw a 12 percent rise in homelessness , the report said .
Although the results do not cover all U.S. cities , homeless advocates said they were in line with anecdotal evidence nationwide .
Homeless advocates say families are flooding homeless shelters across the United States in numbers not seen for years , camping out in motels or staying with friends and relatives following foreclosures on tens of thousands of homes during the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
“ It ’s very depressing because we have been making progress in getting it down in the past couple of years , ” Nan Roman , president of the Washington - based National Alliance to End Homelessness , said in an interview .
Demand for emergency food assistance rose in 20 of the 25 cities surveyed , the report added .
The report marks a reversal from a U.S. government survey released in July that showed the number of chronically homeless Americans declining by 15 percent to about 1.6 million people from October 1 , 2006 , through September 30 , 2007 .
“ We ’re seeing a new trend and I would expect the number to rise substantially , ” Roman said , noting a usual lag between when a family crisis occurs and when homelessness begins .
She said the strain on budgets from the yearlong recession could make it difficult for cities to handle the increase .
Philip Mangano , the homelessness czar appointed by President George W. Bush in 2002 , praised the mayors ’ report and said it would be a mistake to wait for conclusive figures when there was clear evidence of an unfolding crisis .
“ There is a crisis around families falling out into homelessness , ” he said .
He said the government under September ’s Housing and Economic Recovery Act had made $ 3.92 billion available to mitigate the effect of mortgage foreclosures and 25 percent of that was targeted at the lowest - income neighborhoods , where people are most vulnerable to homelessness .
SAN FRANCISCO SEES BIGGEST INCREASE
San Francisco , among the nation ’s priciest housing markets , reported the largest spike in homelessness in the survey with a 50 percent increase .
Gastonia , North Carolina , where foreclosures have been rising , saw a 46 percent rise .
Los Angeles , Phoenix , Miami and Cleveland were the only cities to report a decrease in homelessness .
Sixteen cities reported an increase in the number of families at homeless shelters , while two saw a decrease , four reported no change and three said they did not have enough data to answer the question , according to the survey .
President - elect Barack Obama has spoken broadly about boosting affordable housing and restoring public housing subsidies but he has said little about how he will help low - income families made homeless by a worsening economy .
Homeless advocacy groups have called for targeted housing subsidies that help homeless families get back into more permanent accommodation as well as helping those on the brink of foreclosure .

Marshall Auerback here .
Just yesterday , Ed wrote a good post on quantitative easing .
As much as I liked the post , frankly I think Ed omitted some crucial factors about Japan , which I will detail here for you .
Japan ’s policy makers generally procrastinated considerably in terms of implementing any kind of stimulative measures , as well as prematurely reversing the benign impact of policies which had some earlier success .
In terms of monetary policy , the BOJ did not actually embrace quantitative monetary easing until 2001 , eleven years after their bubble had burst .
Furthermore , the authorities waited until 1998 , a full 8 years after the real estate crash , before embarking on a program of banking recapitalization , the upshot being that the traditional mechanisms through which credit was to be intermediated were still severely impaired .
The benign impact of fiscal reflation was also undermined by a wrong - headed increase in the consumption tax in 1995 , which was followed on by the Asian financial crisis , creating an additional exogenous shock to an economy still recovering from the throes of a major credit bubble collapse .
Japan ’s lost decade can be divided into three sections : the 1991 - 93 recession , the temporary recovery of 1994 - 96 , and the deep recession of 1997 - 99 .
Each episode offers important lessons .
The post -1989 collapse of Japan ’s equity bubble was , at first , welcomed by the Bank of Japan .
Even though stock prices were falling rapidly , land prices continued to rise for another year at least , and the Bank of Japan remained concerned about inflation pressures .
The Bank of Japan actually boosted the discount rate from 4.75 percent to 6 percent in August 1990 and held it at that level until June 1991 .
As the collapse of equity prices intensified and land prices began to fall , the Bank of Japan reversed course and cut its discount rate rapidly by 275 basis points in the year following June 1991 .
Subsequent additional cuts of 150 basis points in 1993 brought the discount rate down to 1.75 percent by September 1993 .
Simultaneously , Japan pursued three major fiscal stimulus packages totalling 6 percent of GDP between August 1992 and September 1993 .
The effects on the economy of these extraordinary stimulative measures were limited .
Growth recovered only slightly –to just over 1 percent in 1994 – for several reasons .
First , the Bank of Japan was late to initiate its easing .
By the time of the first rate cut in June 1991 , Japan ’s nominal GDP growth , which in the long run should not be allowed to fall below policy interest rates , had dropped to about 2.5 percent , headed down to a negative level by 1994 .
That level was far below the 6 percent discount rate in place .
Simultaneously , falling land and equity prices were erasing household wealth and resulting in a sharp curtailment of credit because of the heavy exposure of Japan ’s banks to the commercial land bubble .
This was especially damaging because Japanese companies are far more reliant on banks for financing than American companies , which have access to broader credit markets .
More broadly , deflation began to emerge , which boosted real growth numbers artificially .
( Real growth is calculated by subtracting inflation from nominal growth or adding deflation to nominal growth . )
Real growth of 2 percent , generated by zero nominal growth and 2 percent deflation , is too weak .
Japan ’s large fiscal stimulus packages , which became legendary during the 1990s , were ineffective for several reasons .
First of all , the packages were not as large as advertised , often inflated by double counting as stimulus government programs that were already slated to be undertaken .
More importantly , the packages were poorly directed –largely toward unproductive public works projects and credits to small businesses that were no longer economically viable .
Also , the need to move production facilities abroad grew as the economic environment in Japan deteriorated and deflation strengthened the yen , making goods produced in Japan too expensive in world markets , which should have induced greater moves to induce aggregate demand , but instead was deployed in inefficient “ bridges to nowhere ” , given the continued dominance of the construction companies and the like on the Japanese political system .
Japan ’s sharp interest rate reductions and sizeable public works programs did help to boost the economy mid-decade .
The real growth rate reached nearly 4 per-cent in 1996 and early 1997 .
Yet an ominous period of deflation that emerged mid-decade and dragged down nominal GDP growth was largely ignored by Japan ’s policymakers .
The deflation , coupled with a loss of public confidence tied to the Kobe earthquake in January 1995 , resulted in an elevation of liquidity preference by Japanese households and firms .
The sharp rise in the demand for money was signaled by a rapid appreciation of the yen , which reached 79.8 per dollar on April 19 , 1995 .
As Japanese households sought to raise cash balances , Japan ’s external surplus created a strong demand for yen that was not offset by capital outflows .
The sharp appreciation of Japan ’s yen early in 1995 signaled a severe liquidity shortage , which resulted in a sharp drop in demand , even though market interest rates were low .
In 1995 , Japanese policymakers responded with another 125 basis points of rate cuts that brought the discount rate to 0.5 percent in September of that year .
Another two major fiscal stimulus packages in 1994 and 1995 , again totalling 6 percent of GDP , helped to sustain a recovery of growth until 1997 .
Japan ’s biggest policy mistake came in 1997 when the government raised its consumption tax from 3 to 5 percent .
The aim was to help compensate for the large run-up in Japanese debt that resulted from the series of unproductive fiscal stimulus packages expended largely on wasteful public works projects .
The combination of higher consumption taxes , the continued fall in land prices that persisted in preventing Japan ’s banks from operating as financial intermediaries because of their heavy exposure to real estate losses , and a rapid return to deflation in 1998 resulted in a virtual collapse of the Japanese economy .
Japan ’s poorly timed attempt to redress its large budget deficit and rapidly rising public debt provided a compelling reminder of the lessons that John Maynard Keynes taught in the General Theory of Employment , Interest , and Money .
Fiscal stringency in the form of a tax on consumption in an economy weakened by massive wealth losses and an erosion of confidence that results in a virtual liquidity trap is an extraordinarily harmful policy .
Japan ’s nominal GDP growth rate was below zero for most of the five years after 1997 , with most of its positive real growth resulting from the technical application of GDP deflators averaging about - 1.5 percent .
In a deflationary economy , it is important to watch nominal , not real , GDP growth .
Japan persisted in believing that monetary policy was extremely accommodative because of low nominal interest rates and the Bank of Japan discount rate at 0.5 percent .
But with deflation at 1.5 - 2 percent and negative nominal GDP growth , a 0.5 percent interest rate was actually restrictive .
After five years in a deflationary economic wilderness , the Bank of Japan switched during the spring of 2001 to a policy of quantitative easing –targeting the growth of the money supply instead of nominal interest rates–in order to engineer a rebound in demand growth .
Simultaneously , the energetic and innovative Junichiro Koizumi was elected prime minister in April 2001 , and he undertook aggressive measures to recapitalize Japan ’s banks , which were still heavily burdened by non-performing loans .
The need to recapitalize Japan ’s financial sector had been evident since late 1997 when Yamaichi Securities–a midsized Japanese securities house –collapsed , followed by failures of some regional banks in 1998 .
The persistent problem was non-performing loans whose total value rose as high as 20 to 25 percent of Japanese GDP .
While substantial public funds had been made available to Japanese banks in 1999 , balance sheet restructuring was undertaken only slowly and reluctantly , partly because of the stigma attached to revealing long - concealed losses and fears of losing control to foreign investors .
A lack of transparency in the balance sheets of Japanese banks and a passive approach by the Japanese government to restructuring those balance sheets contributed substantially to the prolonged period of economic stagnation .
Deflation exacerbated the problem by further depressing the land prices to which Japan ’s balance sheets were closely tied and by elevating real interest rates .
When cash–a riskless asset–was earning the deflation rate of 2 percent or higher , few wanted to leave their deposits in banks whose solvency was in question because of heavy exposure to the collapse in land prices and that offered interest rates to depositors that did not compensate for those perceived risks .
The move by the Bank of Japan to quantitative easing and the large increase in liquidity that followed helped to stabilize land prices by 2003 .
The Japanese economy then enjoyed modest growth averaging around 2 percent per year .
The Bank of Japan held interest rates at zero until early 2007 , when it boosted its discount rate back to 0.5 percent in two steps by midyear .
Since then , however , the slowdown in global economic activity and persistent deflation stayed the Bank of Japan ’s hand from further rate increases and raised the possibility of even returning to rate cuts in 2008 as the outlook for the Japanese economy worsened .
By contrast , everything that Japan did in terms of banking recapitalisation and quantitative monetary easing has been effected by the Bernanke Fed within a year of the credit crisis enveloping the U.S. economy .
And President - elect Obama has already promised major fiscal stimulus early next year .
The one aspect of the Japan analogy which does suggest ominous problems for the U.S. is the latter ’s exceptionally high debt to GDP ratio of 350 per cent which contrasts negatively with Japan ’s huge accumulated savings surplus at the time their bubble burst .
Of course , one could easily turn that argument around and suggest that the savings surplus gave Japan ’s monetary and financial authorities a significant margin of error in policy making , a margin which they comfortably exceeded through a combination of political inertia and economic incompetence .
It is possible that , for the time being , the existence of record leverage caused the U.S. stock market to undershoot its current quite disastrous fundamentals .
Of course , these fundamentals could get worse over time , warranting a yet deeper stock market decline .
The economic contraction could be more severe and sustained than anything in the post war period .
The price level could fall for the first time in the post war period .
The financial crisis could become far more severe .
And the market cap to GDP ratio is still well above the post war lows .
All this bad stuff has not yet happened , so I ’m not trying to say it ca n’t happen .
But there has never been so immense a policy response in history .
History says that , for the time being , this stock market probably overshot to the downside relative to current economic conditions and investor psychology when it hit 750 on the S&P about 10 days ago .
The explanation probably lies in record leverage .
I should add that the largest group of leveraged investors – the hedge funds – are probably now , in aggregate , net short .
Let ’s wait a bit before we start rendering definitive judgements about what we should do .
