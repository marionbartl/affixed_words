The Exiled
September 10 , 2008
You probably did n’t know that CNN censored Putin for being just too darn sensible .
Yep , it ’s true .
About two weeks ago , Putin gave the network an exclusive 30 - minute interview .
And you know what happened ?
Nothing .
It was never allowed to air .
CNN does n’t know it yet , but that decision might have cost them their Russian broadcasting rights .
CNN deleted Putin ’s historical roundup of relations between Russia , Georgia and South Ossetia going back to the 18th century .
On August 29 , Prime Minister Vladimir Putin met with senior political correspondent Matthew Chance for a CNN exclusive interview .
“ This was unprecedented access to Russia ’s powerful prime minister , the former KGB spy now increasingly at odds with Washington , ” an overly dramatic voice - over introduced the segment as Chance and Putin enjoyed pre-game banter and a walk through the courtyard of Putin ’s palatial Sochi residence .
Once seated , Chance did n’t waste any time with his provocative questions :
Matthew Chance :
But it ’s been no secret either that for years you ’ve been urging the West to take more seriously Russia ’s concerns about international issues .
For instance , about NATO ’s expansion , about deployment of missile defense systems in eastern Europe .
Was n’t this conflict a way of demonstrating that in this region , it ’s Russia that ’s the power , not NATO and certainly not the United States ?
Vladimir Putin :
Of course not .
What is more , we did not seek such conflicts and do not want them in the future .
That this conflict has taken place — that it broke out nevertheless — is only due to the fact that no one had heeded our concerns .
I think both you and your — our — viewers today will be interested to learn a little more about the history of relations between the peoples and ethnic groups in this regions of the world .
Because people know little or nothing about it .
If you think that this is unimportant , you may cut it from the program .
Do n’t hesitate , I would n’t mind .
It was a prescient comment .
Not only did CNN delete Putin ’s historical roundup of relations between Russia , Georgia and South Ossetia going back to the 18th century that followed , the network cut out almost everything else as well .
Despite the “ unprecedented access ” hook , for its U.S. feed , CNN reduced the 30 - minute interview into a series of sound bites that seized and ridiculed Putin ’s crackpot theory that the Republican party started the war to boost McCain ’s ratings .
CNN ’s international audience , enjoying the news from hotel rooms all round the world , got to see a little more of the the footage .
But most of it had to do with Russia ’s ridiculous “ non political ” decision to ban some American poultry importers from doing business with Russia because of their poor quality control standards .
CNN ’s intentions were clear : Putin must come off looking like a fool .
And it seemed Putin gave them the perfect material .
Embargoes on dead chickens and global neocon conspiracies ?
Gosh , what serious self - respecting world leader would start talking this kind of gibberish ?
Even Ahmadinejad does n’t sink that low .
Well , the chicken meat embargo might have been a little weak , but the neocon conspiracy I ’m not so sure about .
But more on that later .
( You can see the heavily edited interview clips on CNN website , but the network never made the full version available .
But you can see it on Russian TV . )
Not surprisingly , this did n’t go down none too good with the Prime Minister .
See , as it turns out , when Putin told CNN he would n’t mind if they cut some of his comments , he was n’t exactly being honest .
Not only did he mind , but he was sovereignly pissed off to find the entire interview censored .
After all , he is the one that usually does the censoring .
And it ’s not like he gives out TV interviews every month , or even every year .
If I ’m not mistaken , the last interview Putin gave to American TV was waaaay back in 2000 , when he was on Larry King Live making crude comments about the sinking of the Kursk submarine .
And then there ’s the issue of Saakashvili ’s CNN time .
Just in the past month , Saakashvili has appeared a dozen times on the network giving interviews averaging 5 to 10 minutes each .
As CNN correctly pointed out , Putin is a former KGB spy , so he knows all the details , down to the nearest second .
And that ’s exactly why he ’s taken it as a personal insult from CNN ’s headquarters ( and probably more proof of an international media / government conspiracy against him ) .
But he just might have the last word .
The word on the street here is Putin is out for blood .
It ’s payback time .
According to a source with high - level government connections , the Russians are planning punitive actions against CNN .
At this point , it is just a rumor , but they are preparing to kick out about half of the half - dozen Western journalists working at CNN ’s Moscow bureau .
Sooner or later they ’re going to have to apply for a visa renewal and that ’s when it ’s gonna go down .
They ’ll be denied , clean and quiet like .
We can only pray that the tool Matthew Chance is up for a new visa soon .
Matthew Chance : the soon - to - be - jobless hack .
Matthew Chance .
So why did CNN decide to cut the interview ?
The thing is , Putin came off pretty darn well .
Sure , the chicken embargo was embarrassing , but the McCain / neocon conspiracy theory was n’t as crazy as some would want you to believe .
Gary Brecher has been saying all along that this little war had the mark of a half - baked neocon plan for world domination .
As Gary says , Georgia ’s move makes no sense at all from a Georgian perspective .
Somebody must have told those idiots they ’d be safe to retake South Ossetia .
And who better than Cheney ?
In general , Putin was able to strike an unusually sympathetic chord during the interview .
It sure was n’t anything like the grotesque interview he gave eight years ago , where he made that cruel “ it sank ” Kursk joke .
This time around , he was level headed , reasonable and , most importantly , very convincing and believable — not what you ’d expect from the evil Stalin / Hitler hybrid personality being pushed on the American public .
And that worried the hell out of CNN editorial staff , enough to make them crudely censor the entire thing and hope no one noticed .
So , what parts of Putin did CNN leave on the cutting room floor ?
Putin the anti-Stalinist :
Therefore , those who insist that those territories must continue to belong to Georgia are Stalinists :
They defend the decision of Josef Vissarionovich Stalin .
[ It was Stalin who first split up Ossetia and gave the southern half to Georgia . ]
Putin the caring :
For us , it is a special tragedy , because during the many years that we were living together the Georgian culture — the Georgian people being a nation of ancient culture — became , without a doubt , a part of the multinational culture of Russia … .
[ C]onsidering the fact that almost a million , even more than a million Georgians have moved here , we have special spiritual links with that country and its people .
For us , this is a special tragedy .
Putin the peaceful :
You and I are sitting here now , having a quiet conversation in the city of Sochi .
Within a few hundred kilometers from here , U.S. Navy ships have approached , carrying missiles whose range is precisely several hundred kilometers .
It is not our ships that have approached your shores ; it ’s your ships that have approached ours .
So what ’s our choice ?
We do n’t want any complications ; we do n’t want to quarrel with anyone ; we do n’t want to fight anyone .
We want normal cooperation and a respectful attitude toward us and our interests .
Is that too much ?
Putin the conscientious business man :
Construction of the first gas pipeline system was started during the 1960s , at the height of the Cold War , and for all those years , from the 1960s until this day , Russia has been fulfilling its contract obligations in a very consistent and reliable way , regardless of the political situation .
We never politicize economic relations , and we are quite astonished at the position of some U.S. administration officials who travel to European capitals trying to persuade the Europeans not to buy our products , natural gas for example , in a truly amazing effort to politicize the economic sphere .
In fact , it ’s quite pernicious .
It ’s true that the Europeans depend on our supplies but we too depend on whoever buys our gas .
That ’s interdependence ; that ’s precisely the guarantee of stability .

John Steele Gordon on the Financial Mess : Greed , Stupidity , Delusion — and Some More Greed
John Steele Gordon , an author who specializes in financial and business history , has a helpful pedigree : both his grandfathers held seats on the New York Stock Exchange .
His 2004 book An Empire of Wealth : The Epic History of American Economic Power is a remarkably vivid chronicle of every boom and bust that our economic history has absorbed .
Last week , we asked two University of Chicago finance professors , Doug Diamond and Anil Kashyap , to explain the Lehman and A.I.G. meltdowns ( and more ) in lay terms .
Now we ’ve asked Gordon to put the current mess in historical perspective and give some further insights into its origins .
Greed , Stupidity , Delusion — and Some More Greed
By John Steele Gordon
A Guest Post
Looking just at the Friday closes , it was one of those ho - hum weeks in the stock market .
The Dow had ended the previous week at 11,421.99 , and last Friday it closed at 11,388.44 — down 33.55 points — a measly 0.29 percent .
To be sure , in between the two closes things got a tad volatile : down 504 points on Monday , up 141 on Tuesday , down 449 on Wednesday , up 410 on Thursday , and up 368 on Friday — all on huge volume ( with a record on Thursday of 10.2 billion shares ) .
And in this remarkable week , the landscape of American capitalism changed profoundly .
Great names like Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers will disappear , and government responsibility for backing up the financial system will increase considerably as the administration asks Congress for $ 700 billion in borrowing authority to handle the situation .
What happened ?
Simple : panic .
Vast amounts of assets in the financial system became unsellable as no one knew what they were worth , and thus they were useless as collateral for loans .
As a result , highly sophisticated bankers refused to lend to other highly sophisticated bankers overnight ; Ma and Pa Mainstreet rushed to take their money out of uninsured money - market funds and put it in Treasury bills paying practically nothing , and in gold , which pays nothing at all ( and indeed costs money for storage or insurance ) .
The world ’s financial system came perilously close to seizing up — like an engine without oil .
Had that happened , the consequences would have been very nasty indeed .
Let us hope that the market ’s bets on Thursday and Friday are a sign that the government is getting a handle on things .
But the first thing to do in a panic is … do n’t panic !
“ If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs , ” you ’ll be fine .
There have been headlines that this is the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression .
No .
It is a financial crisis .
The underlying American economy is not in bad shape .
Unemployment is at 6 percent ; that ’s a little high by the standards of the last decade or so , but not by longer - term standards ( unemployment reached 10.8 percent as recently as 1982 ) .
In 1933 , it was over 25 percent ( and actually far higher , with many working part time ) .
In 1933 , G.D.P. was little more than half of what it had been in 1929 .
G.D.P. has grown smartly in the last five years , even in 2008 .
Farm mortgages were being foreclosed at the rate of 20,000 a month in 1933 .
The nation ’s farmers have never been so prosperous as they are today .
When F.D.R. was inaugurated on March 4 , 1933 , banks were entirely closed in 38 states and restricted in the other 10 .
Over 5,000 banks had already failed by then , and had taken the savings of millions with them .
Today , millions of families have substantial savings , retirement funds , and equity in real estate .
In 1933 , exports were one - fifth of what they had been in 1929 .
American exports are booming today .
In 1933 , we were a country of haves and have - nots ; today , we are largely a country of haves and have - mores .
The poverty of the sort seen in the immortal photographs of Walker Evans simply does not exist today .
How we will get out of this mess is becoming clearer , and Congress will have to act very quickly .
But the members of Congress stared into the abyss along with the rest of us last week , so my guess is that even they will act responsibly for once .
But there is no doubt at all about how we got into this mess .
To be sure , there is plenty of blame to go around .
Greed , as it periodically does when traders and bankers forget the lessons of the past , clouded judgments .
Some very smart people talked themselves into believing in the repeal of one of the fundamental laws of economics : risk will always equal potential reward .
The idea that risk can be eliminated and high yields guaranteed is as idiotic as the idea that gravity can be suspended .
Remember Long - Term Capital Management ?
Ten years ago it figured out how to eliminate risk using highly sophisticated computer programs and rolled up annual returns averaging 40 percent — until it collapsed in a heap .
Credit ratings agencies such as Moody ’s and Standard and Poor ’s gave good credit ratings to securities they did n’t understand .
But at the heart of the problem is Congress and its deeply corrupt relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
Congress was equally at the heart of the savings and loan disaster 20 years ago and , obviously , learned nothing from it .
( For a history of what led to the savings and loan collapse , see here . )
Fannie and Freddie , two of the largest publicly traded financial institutions on earth , are headquartered in Washington , D.C. , where the next - largest non-governmental financial institution is probably a local credit union .
Big financial companies are headquartered in New York and other cities where capitalism is practiced .
That should tell you a lot about Freddie and Fannie : they were political to their fingertips .
Being “ government sponsored entities , ” they were able to borrow at lower interest rates than other profit - seeking companies , had less regulation , had lower capital requirements , and had an “ implied ” guarantee on their huge debts .
This was supposed to translate into more money available for mortgages , but was used instead to roll up big profits and , not so incidentally , big bonuses for their top management — which came not from the financial world but from the political one .
Franklin Raines , Fannie C.E.O. from 1999 to 2004 , had been budget director in the Clinton White House .
He cooked the books at Fannie to increase his compensation ( more than $ 50 million ) .
Jamie Gorelick , vice C.E.O. , was number two at the Clinton Justice Department before going to Fannie Mae .
She made $ 26 million .
Jim Johnson , a perennial Washington big- foot , was chairman from 1991 to 1998 .
He too , according to an official government report , cooked the books to increase his compensation and failed to publicly reveal how much he received .
The Wall Street Journal editorial page has been giving chapter and verse for years on why this was a disaster waiting to happen ( Pulitzer Prize judges , please note ) .
The Bush administration tried way back in 2003 to change the system .
It got nowhere .
Alan Greenspan , then the chairman of the Federal Reserve , frequently noted the danger of Fannie and Freddie ’s weak capitalization .
He was ignored .
Congressman Mike Oxley , then chairman of the House Financial Services Committee , introduced a bill in 2005 to correct the situation .
Lobbyists from Fannie and Freddie succeeded in gutting it to the point that Rep .
Oxley pulled the bill .
Why were Fannie and Freddie so successful at maintaining the status quo ?
Check it out .
Senator Chris Dodd — formerly ranking member and now chairman of the Senate Banking Committee , with oversight over Freddie and Fannie — recently said on Bloomberg Television : “ I have a lot of questions about where was the administration over the last eight years . ”
Excuse me ?
Just where the hell were you , Senator ?
Oh , right .
You were standing in line at the bank in order to deposit the political contributions Fannie and Freddie were lavishing upon you .
At least they got their money ’s worth — until the party ended and the American people got the bill .
Members of Congress — aided and abetted by their many waterbearers in the media — wonder why their collective approval rating is about on par with colon cancer ’s .
The reason is simple enough : Congress is the sick man of Washington ; a textbook example of the truism that institutions tend to evolve in ways that benefit their elites , at the expense of the people they were created to serve .
Last week was the Republicans ’ turn – they had their convention on national television , and put themselves on display for all the world to see .
We , the world audience , were invited to watch them as they presented their ideas and plans for guiding this wonderful nation , the next four years .
With that in mind , your faithful writer will ask you a few questions ; rhetorical in nature , they can not be answered directly .
However , you can answer them to yourselves and , based upon those answers , you should feel a ) so much better about our nation ’s future ; b) so much worse about our nation ’s future ; or c ) sick to your stomach about the prospect of having a new George Bush in the White House for four more years .
Start answering some questions , if you please …
Have we heard anything about the economy , or how they ’re going to fix it ?
Have they even acknowledged that their party has run the economy into the ground over the past seven years , being in the White House and having control of both houses of Congress ?
( Hint ) No ; not a word .
Have we heard anything about how much the War in Iraq has cost us - every day - in terms of money , or in terms of lives lost ?
Have they admitted that they sent our people to fight a war by lying to the people to get them to agree to send our military there ?
No ; not a word .
Have we heard anything about how the Republicans have n’t told us anything about details of their plans for the country , should they ( God forbid ) win the White house for the next four years ?
No ; not a word .
Because they have n’t a clue what they will do .
After all , they have ruined things , they can’t possibly figure out how to make things right again .
The Republicans have taken the longest period of peace and prosperity in modern times – the Clinton Presidency – and turned it into the largest deficit in the history of this country , along with the worst period of war – undeclared and unwarranted , and generated by lies they created and blamed upon the British .
They invaded Iraq and had no idea how to get out of there .
Even the president ’s father said not to invade , and he said especially not to do so , if they do n’t have an exit strategy … which they still have n’t been able to devise .
What we have heard , is lots of lies , misdirection , fear mongering , and negativity about the Democratic Party .
Only by telling the Big Lies , as did a certain European Party before World War Two , will the Republicans have a chance of stealing another election .
In spite of what we have heard , we still have not gotten a single idea , during the entire Republican convention , about the economy and how to fix what has been destroyed by Bush - McCain policies .
What we have seen is that John McCain 's campaign has decided that desperate lies and personal attacks -- on Barack Obama and Joe Biden and you , folks -- are the only way they can earn a third term for the Bush policies that McCain has supported more than 90 percent of the time .
I believe that the number is closer to 95 % of the time , but what ’s 5 % among the desperate voters of this great nation , who are looking to the President to fix the economy ?
Rather than admit the truth , that you do n’t have an idea how to govern , how to fix what you broke , you spend your time on national television by calling the opposition names , by using the Big Lies to try and convince the voting public that the other party is at fault .
So far , we have not heard one single word about how the McSame Party will fix what they broke ; only what they can lay at the feet of the Democratic Party , and say was their fault .
Before John McCain accepted the Republican nomination on Thursday , his campaign had to spend every last dollar of primary funds they 'd raked in from Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs .
Just the other day , they aired a new negative ad in 14 swing states .
His campaign manager even admitted that all McCain has to rely on is attacks , saying that for them , " This election is not about issues . "
John McCain is offering a third term of the disastrous Bush agenda , so it 's no wonder his campaign would choose to focus on attacks instead of issues .
Well , this time , the American voting Public is not going to be fooled again .
This time , we are not going to allow the Big Liars to win an election by cheating and lying about who and what they are .
That is simple : who and what - a bunch of bullies and liars who have n’t got a clue about how to run a government with honesty and integrity .
It really is a simple choice ; more than ever , we must look at this as Truth versus Consequences .
The Republicans ’ leaders are the people who ran the United States Government into the ground ; we can and must eliminate that group ’s control over Washington .
A protester burns the Russian flag outside the Russian embassy in Tbilisi Georgia has decided to cut diplomatic ties with Russia , days after Moscow recognised the independence of Georgia 's two breakaway regions .
Moscow said the decision would " not help bilateral relations " between the nations , who had a brief war this month over breakaway region South Ossetia .
Reports suggest Russia means to deepen its involvement with the two regions .
Meanwhile , a rights group has said UN satellite images prove ethnic Georgian villages in South Ossetia were torched .
Human Rights
Watch says the pictures of five villages near the South Ossetian capital , Tskhinvali , are " compelling evidence of war crimes and grave human rights abuses " .
The organisation called on the Russian government to prosecute those responsible .
Western governments have been fiercely critical of Moscow since Russian troops poured into the two regions in early August - forcing Georgian forces out .

Earlier this week , the powerful G7 group of nations said Moscow 's recognition of the two provinces ' independence broke international law .
The Kremlin has hit back , labelling the G7 statement " biased " and " groundless " .
EU states , Moscow said , were at a crossroads over the conflict and it hoped reason would prevail at next week 's EU summit , which will discuss the crisis .
' Georgia 's responsibility ' Georgia had already announced that it would scale back staffing at its Moscow embassy , and that its ambassador - who was withdrawn last month - would not be returning .
But the foreign ministry now says all of its diplomats will return from the Moscow embassy by Saturday .
Deputy Foreign Minister Grigol Vashadze said his ministry had received its instructions and " the final decision has been made " .
Russian foreign ministry spokesman Andrei Nesterenko said Moscow regretted Tbilisi 's decision .
" The possible end of diplomatic relations with Georgia is not the choice of Moscow , and Tbilisi will have to bear the entire responsibility , " the state - controlled Tass news agency reported him as saying .
It is expected the Russian embassy in Tbilisi will also now close down , the BBC's Richard Galpin reports from Tbilisi ..

Pictures ' show Georgia torching ' Q&A : Conflict in Georgia Voices from the Caucasus conflict Russia 's propaganda warfare Georgian officials did not give any reasons for the decision , but it comes amid reports that Moscow intends to extend its involvement in the two provinces - which both have Russian - backed governments .
South Ossetia 's parliamentary speaker Znaur Gassiyev said Russia would absorb the region within " several years " , according to a report by the Associated Press
He said the move had been agreed at high - level talks in Moscow earlier this week .
The Russian Interfax news agency reported that Moscow would sign an agreement next week allowing it to set up military bases in the region .
And Interfax also quoted Abkhazia 's foreign minister , Sergei Shamba , as saying his province " may become part of the Union State of Russia and Belarus " .
The Kremlin has not yet commented on the reports .
The conflict in the region began on 7 August when Georgia tried to retake South Ossetia by force after a series of lower - level clashes .
Russia launched a counter - attack and the Georgian troops were ejected from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
An EU - brokered ceasefire brought a formal end to the conflict , although each side has accused the other of breaking the agreement .

Russian woman put on trial in Dubai for drinking juice in public
A 28 - year - old Russian female , who visited Dubai on a tourist visa , and a 30 - year - old male citizen of Lebanon , a salesman in a local store , were put on trial for drinking juice in a public place in the daytime during Muslim fasting .
Russian woman put on trial in Dubai for drinking juice in public
The police caught the two people red -handed at a gas station in Dubai , Emirat .ru reports with reference to Gulf News .
In accordance with the Federal Penal Code of the United Arab Emirates , a public intake of food and beverages during daytime hours of the month of Ramadan is forbidden by Article 313 .
The article stipulates the punishment in the form of either a monetary penalty – up to 2,000 dirhems ( $ 555 ) – or even a term of up to one month in prison .
The young people told the court that they were not Muslims and were thus unaware of the fact that their actions could be punishable .
The court took the mitigating circumstances into consideration , but found the defendants guilty , since ignorance did not exclude responsibility .
The court ruled that the young people must pay the fine of 1,000 dirhems ( $ 278 ) each .
The case became the first one in Dubai in violation of Article 313 since the beginning of the month of Ramadan on September 1 .
Thousands of foreigners from Europe and Asia reside in the emirate of Dubai , the major tourist center of the Persian Gulf .
Dubai is known as a relatively liberal region in comparison with other territories of the UAE .
Tourists can be seen in the streets wearing shorts , whereas alcoholic beverages can often be available in bars and hotels .
This year , however , the authorities intend to remind all residents and guests of the emirate that they are staying on the territory of a Muslim country .
There have been quite a number of incidents recently when the local police in plain clothes arrested women sunbathing topless , nudists and other violators of public order .
Many tourists acknowledge that that they do not always understand how they should behave in Dubai .
Guide - books advise tourists should always carry their IDs , or better their copies , with them for the majority of police officers wear plain clothes and can be rather meticulous in their inspections .

pprocess - Tutorial
The pprocess module provides several mechanisms for running Python code concurrently in several processes .
The most straightforward way of making a program parallel - aware - that is , where the program can take advantage of more than one processor to simultaneously process data - is to use the pmap function .
For a brief summary of each of the features of pprocess , see the reference document .
A Note on Parallel Processes
The way pprocess uses multiple processes to perform work in parallel involves the fork system call , which on modern operating systems involves what is known as " copy - on - write " semantics .
In plain language , when pprocess creates a new child process to perform work in parallel with other work that needs to be done , this new process will be a near - identical copy of the original parent process , and the running code will be able to access data resident in that parent process .
However , when a child process modifies data , instead of changing that data in such a way that the parent process can see the modifications , the parent process will , in fact , remain oblivious to such changes .
What happens is that as soon as the child process attempts to modify the data , it obtains its own separate copy which is then modified independently of the original data .
Thus , a copy of any data is made when an attempt is made to write to such data .
Meanwhile , the parent 's copy of that data will be left untouched by the activities of the child .
It is therefore essential to note that any data distributed to other processes , and which will then be modified by those processes , will not appear to change in the parent process even if the objects employed are mutable .
This is rather different to the behaviour of a normal Python program : passing a list to a function , for example , mutates that list in such a way that upon returning from that function the modifications will still be present .
For example :
def mutator( l ) : l.append ( 3 ) l = [ 1 , 2 ] mutator ( l ) # l is now [ 1 , 2 , 3 ]
In contrast , passing a list to a child process will cause the list to mutate in the child process , but the parent process will not see the list change .
For example :
def mutator( l ) : l.append ( 3 ) results = pprocess .
Map ( ) mutator = results.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(mutator ) ) l = [ 1 , 2 ] mutator ( l ) # l is now [ 1 , 2 ]
To communicate changes to data between processes , the modified objects must be explicitly returned from child processes using the mechanisms described in this documentation .
For example :
def mutator( l ) : l.append ( 3 ) return l # the modified object is explicitly returned results = pprocess .
Map ( ) mutator = results.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(mutator ) ) l = [ 1 , 2 ] mutator ( l ) all_l = results [ :] # there are potentially many results , not just one l = all_l [ 0 ] # l is now [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] , taken from the first result
It is perhaps easiest to think of the communications mechanisms as providing a gateway between processes through which information can be passed , with the rest of a program 's data being private and hidden from the other processes ( even if that data initially resembles what the other processes also see within themselves ) .
Converting Map - Style Code
Consider a program using the built - in map function and a sequence of inputs :
t = time . time ( ) # Initialise an array .
sequence = [ ] for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : sequence .
append (( i , j ) ) # Perform the work .
results = map( calculate , sequence ) #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_map.py file . )
The principal features of this program involve the preparation of an array for input purposes , and the use of the map function to iterate over the combinations of i and j in the array .
Even if the calculate function could be invoked independently for each input value , we have to wait for each computation to complete before initiating a new one .
The calculate function may be defined as follows :
def calculate(t ) : " A supposedly time - consuming calculation on 't '. " i , j = t time . sleep ( delay ) return i * N + j
In order to reduce the processing time - to speed the code up , in other words - we can make this code use several processes instead of just one .
Here is the modified code :
t = time . time ( ) # Initialise an array .
sequence = [ ] for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : sequence .
append (( i , j ) ) # Perform the work .
results = pprocess.pmap( calculate , sequence , limit=limit ) #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_pmap.py file . )
By replacing usage of the map function with the pprocess .
pmap function , and specifying the limit on the number of processes to be active at any given time ( the value of the limit variable is defined elsewhere ) , several calculations can now be performed in parallel .
Converting Invocations to Parallel Operations
Although some programs make natural use of the map function , others may employ an invocation in a nested loop .
This may also be converted to a parallel program .
Consider the following Python code :
t = time . time ( ) # Initialise an array .
results = [ ]
# Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : results.append( calculate( i , j ) ) #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple1.py file . )
Here , a computation in the calculate function is performed for each combination of i and j in the nested loop , returning a result value .
However , we must wait for the completion of this function for each element before moving on to the next element , and this means that the computations are performed sequentially .
Consequently , on a system with more than one processor , even if we could call calculate for more than one combination of i and j and have the computations executing at the same time , the above program will not take advantage of such capabilities .
We use a slightly modified version of calculate which employs two parameters instead of one :
def calculate ( i , j ) : " " " A supposedly time - consuming calculation on ' i ' and 'j ' . " " " time.sleep ( delay ) return i * N + j
In order to reduce the processing time - to speed the code up , in other words - we can make this code use several processes instead of just one .
Here is the modified code :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
results = pprocess.Map( limit=limit ) #
Wrap the calculate function and manage it .
calc = results.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate ) ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : calc( i , j ) # Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_managed_map.py file . )
The principal changes in the above code involve the use of a pprocess .
Map object to collect the results , and a version of the calculate function which is managed by the Map object .
What the Map object does is to arrange the results of computations such that iterating over the object or accessing the object using list operations provides the results in the same order as their corresponding inputs .
Converting Arbitrarily - Ordered Invocations
In some programs , it is not important to receive the results of computations in any particular order , usually because either the order of these results is irrelevant , or because the results provide " positional " information which let them be handled in an appropriate way .
Consider the following Python code :
t = time . time ( ) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : i2 , j2 , result = calculate ( i , j ) results [ i2 * N+ j2 ] = result #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple2.py file . )
Here , a result array is initialised first and each computation is performed sequentially .
A significant difference to the previous examples is the return value of the calculate function : the position details corresponding to i and j are returned alongside the result .
Obviously , this is of limited value in the above code because the order of the computations and the reception of results is fixed .
However , we get no benefit from parallelisation in the above example .
We can bring the benefits of parallel processing to the above program with the following code :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
queue = pprocess .Queue( limit=limit) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Wrap the calculate function and manage it .
calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate ) ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : calc( i , j ) # Store the results as they arrive .
print " Finishing ... " for i , j , result in queue : results [ i* N+j ] = result #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_managed_queue .py file . )
This revised code employs a pprocess .
Queue object whose purpose is to collect the results of computations and to make them available in the order in which they were received .
The code collecting results has been moved into a separate loop independent of the original computation loop and taking advantage of the more relevant " positional " information emerging from the queue .
Replacing Queues with Exchanges
We can take this example further , illustrating some of the mechanisms employed by pprocess .
Instead of collecting results in a queue , we can define a class containing a method which is called when new results arrive :
class MyExchange ( pprocess .
Exchange ) : " Parallel convenience class containing the array assignment operation . " def store_data ( self , ch ) : i , j , result = ch.receive ( ) self .
D[ i * N+j ] = result
This code exposes the channel paradigm which is used throughout pprocess and is available to applications , if desired .
The effect of the method is the storage of a result received through the channel in an attribute of the object .
The following code shows how this class can be used , with differences to the previous program illustrated :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the communications exchange with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
exchange = MyExchange ( limit=limit ) # Initialise an array - it is stored in the exchange to permit automatic # assignment of values as the data arrives .
results = exchange .D = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Wrap the calculate function and manage it .
calc = exchange.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate ) ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : calc( i , j ) # Wait for the results .
print " Finishing ... " exchange.finish ( ) #
Show the results . for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_managed .py file . )
The main visible differences between this and the previous program are the storage of the result array in the exchange , the removal of the queue consumption code from the main program , placing the act of storing values in the exchange 's store_data method , and the need to call the finish method on the MyExchange object so that we do not try and access the results too soon .
One underlying benefit not visible in the above code is that we no longer need to accumulate results in a queue or other structure so that they may be processed and assigned to the correct positions in the result array .
Using Channels in Callables
For the curious , we may remove some of the remaining conveniences of the above program to expose other features of pprocess .
First , we define a slightly modified version of the calculate function :
def calculate ( ch , i , j ) : " " " A supposedly time - consuming calculation on ' i ' and 'j ' , using ' ch ' to communicate with the parent process . " " " time.sleep ( delay ) ch.send ( ( i , j , i * N + j ) )
This function accepts a channel , ch , through which results will be sent , and through which other values could potentially be received , although we choose not to do so here .
The program using this function is as follows , with differences to the previous program illustrated :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the communications exchange with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
exchange = MyExchange ( limit=limit ) # Initialise an array - it is stored in the exchange to permit automatic # assignment of values as the data arrives .
results = exchange .D = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : exchange.start ( calculate , i , j ) # Wait for the results .
print " Finishing ... " exchange.finish ( ) #
Show the results . for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_start .py file . )
Here , we have discarded two conveniences : the wrapping of callables using MakeParallel , which lets us use functions without providing any channel parameters , and the management of callables using the manage method on queues , exchanges , and so on .
The start method still calls the provided callable , but using a different notation from that employed previously .
Converting Inline Computations
Although many programs employ functions and other useful abstractions which can be treated as parallelisable units , some programs perform computations " inline " , meaning that the code responsible appears directly within a loop or related control - flow construct .
Consider the following code :
t = time . time ( ) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : time.sleep ( delay ) results [ i* N+j ] = i * N + j #
Show the results . for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple .py file . )
To simulate " work " , as in the different versions of the calculate function , we use the time .
sleep function ( which does not actually do work , and which will cause a process to be descheduled in most cases , but which simulates the delay associated with work being done ) .
This inline work , which must be performed sequentially in the above program , can be performed in parallel in a somewhat modified version of the program :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
results = pprocess .Map( limit=limit ) # Perform the work .
# NOTE : Could use the with statement in the loop to package the # NOTE : try ... finally functionality .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : ch = results.create ( ) if ch : try : # Calculation work. time.sleep( delay ) ch.send( i * N + j ) finally : # Important finalisation .
pprocess.exit( ch ) #
Show the results . for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_create_map.py file . )
Although seemingly more complicated , the bulk of the changes in this modified program are focused on obtaining a channel object , ch , at the point where the computations are performed , and the wrapping of the computation code in a try ... finally statement which ensures that the process associated with the channel exits when the computation is complete .
In order for the results of these computations to be collected , a pprocess .
Map object is used , since it will maintain the results in the same order as the initiation of the computations which produced them .
Reusing Processes in Parallel Programs
One notable aspect of the above programs when parallelised is that each invocation of a computation in parallel creates a new process in which the computation is to be performed , regardless of whether existing processes had just finished producing results and could theoretically have been asked to perform new computations .
In other words , processes were created and destroyed instead of being reused .
However , we can request that processes be reused for computations by enabling the reuse feature of exchange - like objects and employing suitable reusable callables .
Consider this modified version of the simple_managed_map program :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the results using a map with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
results = pprocess .Map( limit=limit , reuse=1 ) #
Wrap the calculate function and manage it .
calc = results.manage(pprocess.MakeReusable( calculate ) ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : calc( i , j ) # Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_manage_map_reusable .py file . )
By indicating that processes and channels shall be reused , and by wrapping the calculate function with the necessary support , the computations may be performed in parallel using a pool of processes instead of creating a new process for each computation and then discarding it , only to create a new process for the next computation .
Supporting Continuous Processes in Parallel Programs
Although reusable processes offer the opportunity to invoke a callable over and over within the same created process , they do not fully support the potential of the underlying mechanisms in pprocess : created processes can communicate multiple values to the creating process and can theoretically run within the same callable forever .
Consider this modified form of the calculate function :
def calculate ( ch , i ) : " " " A supposedly time - consuming calculation on ' i ' . " " " for j in range ( 0 , N ) : time.sleep ( delay ) ch.send ( ( i , j , i * N + j ) )
This function accepts a channel ch together with an argument i corresponding to an entire row of the input array , as opposed to having two arguments ( i and j ) corresponding to a single cell in the input array .
In this function , a series of calculations are performed and a number of values are returned through the channel , without the function terminating until all values have been returned for the row data .
To use this modified function , a modified version of the simple_managed_queue program is used :
t = time . time ( ) #
Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
queue = pprocess .Queue( limit=limit , continuous=1 ) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Manage the calculate function .
calc = queue.manage ( calculate ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : calc ( i ) #
Store the results as they arrive .
print " Finishing ... " for i , j , result in queue : results [ i* N+j ] = result #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_continuous_queue .py file . )
Although the inner loop in the work section has been relocated to the calculate function , the queue still receives outputs from that function with positional information and a result for the result array .
Thus , no change is needed for the retrieval of the results : they arrive in the queue as before .
Performing Computations in Background Processes
Occasionally , it is desirable to initiate time - consuming computations and to not only leave such processes running in the background , but to be able to detach the creating process from them completely , potentially terminating the creating process altogether , and yet also be able to collect the results of the created processes at a later time , potentially in another completely different process .
For such situations , we can make use of the BackgroundCallable class , which converts a parallel - aware callable into a callable which will run in a background process when invoked .
Consider this excerpt from a modified version of the simple_managed_queue program :
def task ( ) : # Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
queue = pprocess .Queue( limit=limit) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N * N # Wrap the calculate function and manage it .
calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate ) ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for j in range ( 0 , N ) : calc( i , j ) # Store the results as they arrive .
print " Finishing ... " for i , j , result in queue : results [ i* N+j ] = result return results
Here , we have converted the main program into a function , and instead of printing out the results , we return the results list from the function .
Now , let us consider the new main program ( with the relevant mechanisms highlighted ) :
t = time . time ( ) if " - - reconnect " not in sys.argv : # Wrap the computation and manage it .
ptask = pprocess.BackgroundCallable ( " task.socket " , pprocess.MakeParallel( task ) ) # Perform the work .
ptask ( ) # Discard the callable .
del ptask print " Discarded the callable . " if " - - start " not in sys.argv : # Open a queue and reconnect to the task .
print " Opening a queue . " queue = pprocess.BackgroundQueue ( " task.socket " ) #
Wait for the results .
print " Waiting for persistent results " for results in queue : pass # should only be one element #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i* N:i* N+N ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_background_queue.py file . )
This new main program has two parts : the part which initiates the computation , and the part which connects to the computation in order to collect the results .
Both parts can be run in the same process , and this should result in similar behaviour to that of the original simple_managed_queue program .
In the above program , however , we are free to specify -- start as an option when running the program , and the result of this is merely to initiate the computation in a background process , using BackgroundCallable to obtain a callable which , when invoked , creates the background process and runs the computation .
After doing this , the program will then exit , but it will leave the computation running as a collection of background processes , and a special file called task .
socket will exist in the current working directory .
When the above program is run using the -- reconnect option , an attempt will be made to reconnect to the background processes already created by attempting to contact them using the previously created task .
socket special file ( which is , in fact , a UNIX - domain socket ) ; this being done using the Background Queue function which will handle the incoming results in a fashion similar to that of a Queue object .
Since only one result is returned by the computation ( as defined by the return statement in the task function ) , we need only expect one element to be collected by the queue : a list containing all of the results produced in the computation .
Managing Several Background Processes
In the above example , a single background process was used to manage a number of other processes , with all of them running in the background .
However , it can be desirable to manage more than one background process .
Consider this excerpt from a modified version of the simple_managed_queue program :
def task ( i ) : # Initialise the communications queue with a limit on the number of # channels / processes .
queue = pprocess .Queue( limit=limit) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N # Wrap the calculate function and manage it .
calc = queue.manage(pprocess.MakeParallel(calculate ) ) # Perform the work .
print " Calculating ... " for j in range ( 0 , N ) : calc( i , j ) # Store the results as they arrive .
print " Finishing ... " for i , j , result in queue : results [ j ] = result return i , results
Just as we see in the previous example , a function called task has been defined to hold a background computation , and this function returns a portion of the results .
However , unlike the previous example or the original example , the scope of the results of the computation collected in the function have been changed : here , only results for calculations involving a certain value of i are collected , with the particular value of i returned along with the appropriate portion of the results .
Now , let us consider the new main program ( with the relevant mechanisms highlighted ) :
t = time . time ( ) if " - - reconnect " not in sys.argv : # Wrap the computation and manage it .
ptask = pprocess .
MakeParallel ( task ) for i in range ( 0 , N ) : # Make a distinct callable for each part of the computation .
ptask_i = pprocess.BackgroundCallable ( " task -%d.socket " % i , ptask ) # Perform the work .
ptask_i( i ) # Discard the callable .
del ptask print " Discarded the callable . " if " - - start " not in sys.argv : # Open a queue and reconnect to the task .
print " Opening a queue . " queue = pprocess .
PersistentQueue ( ) for i in range ( 0 , N ) : queue.connect ( " task -%d.socket " % i ) # Initialise an array .
results = [ 0 ]
* N # Wait for the results .
print " Waiting for persistent results " for i , result in queue : results [ i ] = result #
Show the results .
for i in range ( 0 , N ) : for result in results [ i ] : print result , print print " Time taken : " , time .
time ( ) - t
( This code in context with import statements and functions is found in the examples / simple_persistent_queue.py file . )
In the first section , the process of making a parallel - aware callable is as expected , but instead of then invoking a single background version of such a callable , as in the previous example , we create a version for each value of i ( using BackgroundCallable ) and then invoke each one .
The result of this is a total of N background processes , each running an invocation of the task function with a distinct value of i ( which in turn perform computations ) , and each employing a UNIX - domain socket for communication with a name of the form task - i.socket .
In the second section , since we now have more than one background process , we must find a way to monitor them after reconnecting to them ; to achieve this , a PersistentQueue is created , which acts like a regular Queue object but is instead focused on handling persistent communications .
Upon connecting the queue to each of the previously created UNIX - domain sockets , the queue acts like a regular Queue and exposes received results through an iterator .
Here , the principal difference from previous examples is the structure of results : instead of collecting each individual value in a flat i by j array , a list is returned for each value of i and is stored directly in another list .
Applications of Background Computations
Background computations are useful because they provide flexibility in the way the results can be collected .
One area in which they can be useful is Web programming , where a process handling an incoming HTTP request may need to initiate a computation but then immediately send output to the Web client - such as a page indicating that the computation is " in progress " - without having to wait for the computation or to allocate resources to monitor it .
Moreover , in some Web architectures , notably those employing the Common Gateway Interface ( CGI ) , it is necessary for a process handling an incoming request to terminate before its output will be sent to clients .
By using a BackgroundCallable , a Web server process can initiate a communication , and then subsequent server processes can be used to reconnect to the background computation and to wait efficiently for results .
Summary
The following table indicates the features used in converting one sequential example program to another parallel program :
Iran has condemned US Republican presidential candidate John McCain for joking about killing Iranians with cigarettes and said it showed his " warmongering " foreign policy attitude , media said on Sunday .
' Amber Light ' Given Report : US backs Israeli plan for strike on Iran Ynet Pentagon official says Bush told Israel to ' get on with preparations , stand by for immediate attack ' on Iran 's main nuclear sites if diplomatic efforts fail .
' This administration will not attack Iran .
This has already been decided , ' official tells Sunday Times Report : US backs Israeli plan for strike on Iran
McCain , who once sang in jest about bombing Iran , on Tuesday reacted to a report of rising US cigarette exports to the Islamic Republic by saying it may be " a way of killing 'em . "
Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Ali Hosseini said : " McCain 's crude remark on the indiscriminate killing of the Iranian nation not only testifies to his disturbed state of mind , but also to his warmongering approach to foreign policy . "
In a statement quoted by the website of Iran 's state Press TV satellite station , Hosseini added : " We condemn such jokes and believe them to be inappropriate for a US Presidential candidate .
It is most evident that jokes about genocide will not be tolerated by Iranians or Americans . "
' I meant that as a joke '
McCain , known for acerbic comments and for sometimes firing verbally from the hip , was responding to a report that US exports to Iran rose tenfold during President George W. Bush 's term in office despite hostility between the two countries .
A rise in cigarette sales was a big part of that , according to an Associated Press analysis .
" Maybe that 's a way of killing 'em , " McCain said to reporters during a campaign stop in Pittsburgh .
" I meant that as a joke , as a person who has n't had a cigarette in 28 years , 29 years , " he added , laughing .
His comments coincided with rising tension between Iran and its arch - foes , the United States and Israel , over the Islamic Republic 's disputed nuclear program .
US leaders have not ruled out military options if diplomacy fails to assuage fears about Iran 's nuclear work , which they suspect is aimed at making bombs but which Tehran says is only to produce electricity .
If the press will just do their job , all will be OK Thursday , September 11 , 2008 by Dave Winer .
Lots of must - read editorial following the release of the first part the ABC News interview with Republican VP candidate Sarah Palin .
It 's so totally appropriate that this interview took place on Sept 11 .
Because of that , and the fact that we 're all re-living that day 7 years ago , we should be aware of how incredibly important it is that our political leadership be involved in the world we live in .
Everything is so interconnected these days , it 's dangerously naive to think that you can assume leadership of this country with no knowledge or preparation for that complex job .
Listening to Bob Woodward about his interviews with President Bush in his last year of an eight - year Presidency , you can clearly see that he is still unprepared to be the leader of this country .
He has deligated essential Commander In Chief responsibilities to unelected aides , people who we do n't know anything about and he glosses over important parts of his decision - making process with the same unconfident imprecision that Sarah Palin does in her ABC News interview .
Joan Walsh writing in Salon this evening says " The fact that Sarah Palin sat for her humiliating interview with ABC's Charles Gibson on 9/11 is one of those strange serendipitous events that makes one believe there 's order in the universe .
Remember how 9/11 changed everything , especially our new seriousness about the larger world and foreign policy ?
Never again would we risk a president , maybe not even a senate candidate , without global experience and sophistication . "
Howard Kurtz , in the Washington Post , says the press is angry .
As they should be , because they , like everyone else , are being used by the Republicans , to try to slip another fast one by us , circumventing our democratic process , and taking advantage of a few voters who are n't paying attention .
As the title of this piece says , if the reporters do their job , we 'll be fine .
They do n't have to be referees , they just have to be finders of fact and tell everyone what they found .
There 's nothing hard about that job .
Barack Obama is n't a sexual pervert , the law that he voted for when he was an Illinois state senator was designed to protect small children from sexual predators .
The news should not report a controversy , they should report that McCain is telling a desipicable lie .
Until that lie is acknowledged , retracted and apologized for , both to Obama and to the electorate , McCain should not receive any of the services of the press .
The first question in any interview should be " Why are you lying and when will you admit that you are and stop . "
If he continues to lie , that 's the end of the interview .
The reporter wraps it up and leaves .
You can't continue to interview someone who you know is lying .
Reporters do it all the time , but this must stop now .
The Republicans can scream all they want , all that anyone will hear is that they are lying .
I do n't see how the press can avoid this .
We can all see it openly , Republicans and Democrats and independents , and people all over the world who do n't get a vote in our election , but whose respect for us they do control .
America will be judged by how we handle this .
We will not be able to hide behind the usual excuse " I did n't vote for him " because you are now called on to do more .
I think we made a lot of progress today , cleared a lot of things up .
Republicans could help by holding another convention and nominating a new ticket .
McCain is completely discredited , he could not serve as President with the support of anyone who has an education or who cares about the future of this country .
Yes I understand that we who are educated and have health insurance and jobs are elitist and different from those who live in small cities and towns , but my family comes from small towns , and my ancestors were not educated .
We have so much in common and so much at stake , we really can't afford to be split this way , again .
McCain 's gamble was too big , and it did n't work .
You can play a few more cards from the hand , but it 's not going to change the outcome -- he can't be President .
It wo n't work .
The sooner the Republicans acknowledge that and respond , the better we all will be .
Until that happens all the press has to do is report the news and stop being anything other than reporters .

The Flat Earth Wiki
General Information
Is this site a joke ?
What evidence do you have ?
Is Flat Earth Theory connected to a religion ?
People have been into space .
How have they not discovered that the earth is flat ?
There are many pictures on the internet and in other media depicting the earth as being round .
Why do these not disprove flat earth theory ?
This site is not a joke .
We are actively promoting the Flat Earth Movement worldwide .
There are , admittedly , several non-serious flat earth posters , but they are fairly easy to identify .
The evidence for a flat earth is derived from many different facets of science and philosophy .
The simplest is by relying on ones own senses to discern the true nature of the world around us .
The world looks flat , the bottoms of clouds are flat , the movement of the sun ; these are all examples of your senses telling you that we do not live on a spherical heliocentric world .
This is using what 's called an empiricist approach , or an approach that relies on information from your senses .
Alternatively , when using Descartes ' method of Cartesian doubt to skeptically view the world around us , one quickly finds that the notion of a spherical world is the theory which has the burden of proof and not flat earth theory .
Perhaps the best example of flat earth proof is the Bedford Level Experiment .
In short , this was an experiment preformed many times on a six - mile stretch of water that proved the surface of the water to be flat .
It did not conform to the curvature of the earth that round earth proponents teach .
Many other experiments demonstrating the lack of curvature in the earth may be found in '' Earth Not a Globe ' ' , by Samuel Rowbotham .
Flat Earth
Theory is neither officially nor unofficially associated with any religion .
Throughout the ages various religious institutions have championed a flat earth model for the world .
Unfortunately this leaves us with the vestigial thought that Flat Earth Theory and religions are symbiotic .
They are not , even though many religions today , both mainstream and otherwise , still teach its followers that the world is flat .
While they are not incorrect , believing in a flat earth is n't contingent upon believing in a deity or being a part of any religion .
The most commonly accepted explanation of this is that the space agencies of the world are involved in a conspiracy faking space travel and exploration .
This likely began during the Cold War 's ' Space Race ' , in which the U.S.S.R and USA were obsessed with beating each other into space to the point that each faked their accomplishments in an attempt to keep pace with the others supposed achievements .
However , since the end of the Cold War , the conspiracy is most likely motivated by greed rather than political gains .
Thus opening up a tremendous amount of funds to embezzle as it only takes a fraction of the total budget to fake space travel .
In light of the above , please note that we are not suggesting that space agencies are aware that the earth is flat and actively covering the fact up .
They depict the earth as being round simply because that is what they expect it to be .
In general , we at the Flat Earth Society do not lend much credibility to photographic evidence .
It is too easily manipulated and altered .
Many of the videos posted here to " prove a round earth " by showing curvature will show no curvature or even convex curvature at parts .
The sources are so inaccurate it 's difficult to build an argument on them in either case .
Furthermore , barrel distortion and other quirks of modern cameras will cause a picture to distort with little or no apparent altercation ; especially without references within the picture .
Photographs are also prone to distortion when taken through the bent glass of a pressurized cabin as well as atmospheric conditions on the outside .
With this litany of problems , it 's easy to see why photographic evidence is not to be trusted .
It 's also worth noting that if a person were to look down at the earth from high above , they would expect to see a circular shape where the sun 's spotlight was shining .
This explains why high altitude photographs are generally curved to produce the illusion of a round horizon .

[ An on - topic 30 - second spot from Media Needle . ]
Thomas Frank is the Wall Street Journal 's resident liberal , still , this has gotta hurt :
Last week , Republican presidential candidate John McCain called for a commission to " find out what went wrong " on Wall Street .
It was an excellent suggestion : Public inquiries into Wall Street practices served the country well in the 1930s .
And Mr. McCain has a special advantage to bring to any such investigation -- many of the relevant witnesses are friends or colleagues of his .
In fact , he can probably get to the bottom of the whole mess just by cross-examining the people riding on his campaign bus .
So the candidate should take a deep breath , remind himself that the country comes first , pull the Straight Talk Express over at a rest stop , whistle up his media pals , and begin .
Sniper shoots dead ' supergrass ' INSIDE French jail
A ' supergrass ' witness has been shot dead by a sniper perched on a hill overlooking the exercise yard of his jail .
Convicted gangster Sghair Larimi - a key police witness in an ongoing murder investigation - died from a bullet to the chest at Varces - Grenoble prison .
A second man in the exercise yard was hit in the hand by a second bullet in the shooting on Sunday evening , officials said .
The suspected sniper was arrested shortly afterwards as he tried to make off on a motorbike .
His rifle was still warm from the shooting .
Assassination : French police leave Varces - Grenoble jail after inmate Sghair Lamiri was gunned down inside the exercise yard
Varces - Grenoble Prison , in south - east France :
The inmate was shot dead by a sniper on a hill whose rifle was found still warm a short while later
The gunman was arrested within minutes of pulling the trigger , with his telescopic rifle ' still hot ' , French justice minister Rachida Dati told the French media .
Investigators believe Larimi , 29 , was being ' silenced ' by gangland rivals .
He was jailed for eight years earlier this year for robberies committed in 2001 , and had been due to give evidence in an investigation into a mafia - style massacre of nine men in Grenoble in 2007 .
Those killings were said to have been in revenge for the murder of Lassad Lamiri , the victim 's brother , several months earlier .
Scores of police were sent to the prison after the shooting and the exercise yard was cleared on convicts .
Prison security official Martin Parkouda said trouble flared when several prisoners refused to return to their cells after the shooting .
Others obeyed orders to return inside , then some threw flaming sheets and pillow cases onto a workshop causing a fire which was later put out .
Convicts were today not being allowed into the exercise yard of the prison , which is surrounded by mountains in the Alpine city in south east France .
Miss Dati did not name the suspected gunman , but said he was aged 58 and had been remanded in custody .
She added : ' He denies the facts , but he was arrested when he was getting to his motorbike which had a false licence plate and his rifle with telescopic sight was still warm . '
Miss Dati said it was the first time in France that a serving prisoner had been killed from outside the prison walls .
She said : ' It is an extremely rare incident , but also a very serious breach of security and a full investigation has been launched into how this came to happen . '
The Force Ouvriere prisons union spokesman Jean - Pierre Schiefer said the union had highlighted the potential dangers of the hill overlooking the exercise yard on several occasions .
He said : ' We had pointed out several times to prison officers there that prisoners could be targeted from the hill , from where there is clear view of the yard .
' They did nothing because this kind of crime had never occured before .
Steps must now be taken at all prisons in France to make sure this can never happen again . '
Alcohol abuse rises among US combat veterans : study David Edwards
Published : Wednesday August 13 , 2008
Print This Email This ( Reuters ) - A significant number of U.S. veterans back from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan begin abusing alcohol after returning , perhaps to cope with traumatic memories of combat , military researchers said on Tuesday .
Younger servicemen and women , those who were previously heavy drinkers , and call - ups from the National Guard and Reserves were the most likely to increase their drinking and to develop alcohol - related problems , according to the study .
" Increased alcohol outcomes among Reserve / Guard personnel deployed with combat exposures is concerning in light of increased reliance ( on these ) forces " by the Pentagon , the report said .
" Active - duty Marines were also found to be at increased odds of continuing to binge drink after deployment , as well as to experience new - onset alcohol - related problems , " wrote Isabel Jacobs and colleagues at the Naval Health Research Center in San Diego , California .
Men were considered heavy drinkers if they consumed more than 14 alcoholic drinks per week , women seven drinks ; binge drinking referred to downing five or more drinks in a day or occasion , four for women ; and alcohol problems constituted drunkenness or hangovers that interfered with work or other responsibilities .
Reasons for the increased rates of alcohol abuse among Guard and Reserve members may be that they receive less training and support services than other arms of the military , they must transition from civilian life to a war zone , and their units are less cohesive , the report said .
The researchers surveyed 48,400 service members before ( between 2001 and 2003 ) and after likely deployment ( 2004 to 2006 ) to identify heavy drinkers , binge drinkers , or those with alcohol - related problems .
Of those interviewed , 5,500 experienced combat and they were interviewed about a year after their return .
Combat veterans were 31 percent more likely to have begun binge drinking than those not exposed to combat .
Six percent of returning combat veterans started a new habit of heavy weekly drinking and 5 percent developed a drinking - related problem .
New cases of alcohol abuse also arose among those who had not been deployed or did not see combat , but the rate of new cases was lower compared with returning combat veterans .
Women also had different drinking habits than men .
" Women were significantly more likely to start drinking heavily but less likely to start binge drinking or have alcohol - related problems compared with men , which may be due to women turning to drinking as a coping mechanism , whereas men may have a higher propensity for risk - taking behaviors , " the researchers wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association .
The findings were consistent with a recent study of soldiers returning from Iraq that found 12 percent of active - duty personnel had alcohol problems , and 15 percent of Reserve and National Guard members did .
The researchers said they hoped to direct intervention efforts at younger soldiers and other groups prone to alcohol abuse .
They also pointed to the need to treat post - traumatic stress suffered by returning veterans who may try to drown their memories in drink .

Maybe the Obama campaign should just fire all their fact checkers .
Why vet your ads or even your resume when the McCain campaign keeps proving it does n’t matter ?
Right now , the Straight Talk Express is hurtling down a highway of lies .
If there are fact checkers hidden somewhere in the back of the bus , they ’re like the old Maytag repairman with nothing to do .
It ’s hard to single out just one lie .
Perhaps the most notorious is the McCain ad that trashes Obama ’s “ one accomplishment ” on education — a bill “ to teach comprehensive sex education to kindergarteners . ”
The nonpartisan Factcheck.org says the charge is “ simply false . ”
But it ’s not just McCain ’s attacks that show disdain for the truth .
The campaign ’s claims about Sarah Palin are often whoppers .
She did too travel to Ireland ( for an airport refueling stop ) .
And she went to the war zone in Iraq ( or at least to the Iraqi border to see an Alaskan re-enlist ) .
She ’s a reformer who ’s trying to suppress an ethics investigation and a foe of earmarks who ’s a champion pork barreler .
No falsehood is too egregious if it puts a bit of rouge on her pallid record .
( I hope I ’m spared more false outrage about “ sexism ” from McCain , who opposed the Equal Rights Amendment .
If Palin were a man , I ’d say the campaign was trying to put a toupee on a bald expanse . )
For now , the Republicans appear to be getting away with it .
Although the media increasingly report McCain ’s reckless disregard of the truth , they remain loath to call a lie a lie .
( If they did , they might be accused of liberal bias or be booed at Republican Conventions . )
In any event , the McCain strategists are betting that voters , at least their potential voters , do n’t care .
In campaigns and political advertising , facts are always supple things .
So why do n’t Democrats rush to meet McCain ’s low standard ?
It ’s not just virtue .
Democratic candidates actually , even fervently , care about the press .
When The New York Times , The Washington Post , the networks or Factcheck.org calls a Democratic presidential campaign about the accuracy of a TV spot or a speech , the staff races to deliver the proof .
Democratic ad makers have to negotiate with fact checkers to get a spot on the air .
By contrast , when McCain ’s spinners are questioned about their phony ads , they just shrug or lose their tempers .
“ We ’re running a campaign to win , ” McCain spokesman Brian Rogers told Politico .
“ And we ’re not too concerned about what the media filter tries to say about it . ”
Democratic campaign culture is reinforced by Democratic policymaking , which tends to be nuanced ( that dread word , suggestive of complex realities , which damaged John Kerry in 2004 . )
Obama does propose raising some taxes — on the very wealthy .
McCain can take that one fact and make it into a mountain of falsehood .
On the other hand , Republican positions tend to be hard - line and hard - edged like McCain’s .
( Thus every four years they troop to New Hampshire to swear an oath against raising taxes — no matter the economic or fiscal conditions . )
That makes it harder to lie about McCain , even if Obama wanted to .
The best he can do , and he ’s doing it now , is charge that McCain is lying about him .
McCain ’s deceptions advance a strategy of campaign as camouflage .
He ’d rather talk about anything — including whether his ads are deceitful — than have to address the economy , health care , his misjudgments on the war , or all the other issues that were driving him down until that dog sled pulled up in Arizona .
Frum thinks McCain has found a path to the White House .
I think McCain and Palin have peaked .
The debates are coming — where their camouflage will be stripped away .
Recession , McCain ’s echo of the Bush - Cheney policies , his admitted ignorance of economics , his indifference to 47 million Americans without health insurance and his bellicose unilateralism will all come home to roost .
Palin will remain interesting , but become increasingly irrelevant — unless she memorably reveals her vacuity .
If Obama does his part — and he will — the voters will figure things out .
Obama ’s victory wo n’t be a triumph of clean politics ; it ’s just that McCain does n’t have enough mud to cover reality all the way to November 4 .
Afterwards , Palin can go back to hunting moose ; maybe she can invite Dick Cheney along and teach him to shoot straight .
And McCain — well , he can stand in a corner of the Senate with Joe Lieberman .
And maybe he ’ll wish he had n’t lied quite so much .
Because the way he ’s headed , he ’s going to lose more than an election .
HARTFORD , Conn. , Sept. 10 ( UPI ) -- Two Connecticut Democrats circulating a petition to censure U.S. Sen.
Joseph Lieberman say the effort is gaining support from rank - and - file party members .
Lieberman , the independent Connecticut senator and one - time Democratic Party leader , now backs Republican U.S. presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
He angered state party members by speaking at last week 's Republican National Convention in support of McCain , prompting a petition to censure him and seek is ouster as a registered Democrat , the Hartford Courant reported Wednesday .
Advertisement
Audrey Blondin of Litchfield , Conn. , one of the petition 's authors , told the newspaper it 's drawing support from Democrats who viewed Lieberman 's RNC speech as the last straw in a series of perceived betrayals starting with his staunch support of the Iraq War .
" All of us have spent the past year really bending over backward to be tolerant of Joe , to give him the benefit of the doubt , to understand his dilemma , " Blondin told the Courant .
" But the RNC speech was just way , way out of line , and we realized that we had to exercise some leadership here and make it clear that he no longer represents Democratic values . "
Aiming to prove how serious he is about addressing the financial crisis , John McCain has instructed his staff to take all his campaign commercials off the air , a spokesman tells Politico .
" As John McCain said , now is the time to put partisanship aside and come together to do the work that the American people expect , " said Tucker Bounds .
McCain aides are now in the process of contacting TV station across the country to get their ads taken down , according to Bounds .
Asked how long they would go dark , Bounds only said : " We 're taking our guidance from Sen. McCain on that . "

Continuing westward shift : this based on the BAMD model , which is doing as well as the more sophisticated runs and is a lot faster ( this run based the 8 pm position and intensity estimates , so it 's almost real time as opposed to waiting 3 - 4 hrs for GFDL or HWRF ) .

Latest damage run based on BAMD
Chuck Watson update 3:44 pm 8/29 :
" This from the latest damage run based on the HWRF model .
Note how the storm stalls out after landfall as a tropical storm .
Bad news for recovery , especially if wet .
This scenarios results in a loss of nearly 50 % of the GOM production / processing capacity for the rest of the year .
Ouch . "
( Note : this analysis on oil / gas damage is based on HWRF run verifying )
Rig damage run based on latest HWRF

Port damage run based on latest HWRF
Refinery damage run based on latest HWRF
Though the Methaz runs based on HWRF model are among the most eastward of the ensemble models , ( Chuck has been east of consensus since storm begain ) the damage using the current official 5 pm NHC path is just as bad .
It shows a bit more production loss ( about 60 % of the rest of the year ) , plus about a month down time for the LOOP and inland pipeline damage .

Unfortunately it seems the favorable options for this storm are dropping off one by one .
I think we 're seeing a trend in the dynamic models towards the central LA coast and into a " target rich " environment with respect to oil production , as a strong enough storm to cause significant damage .
Our in - house models are now showing a 50 % chance of long term ( more than 10 % production loss for more than 30 days ) damage from this storm .
The GFDL scenario , for example , whacks the LOOP pretty hard .
Keep in mind that this storm is still not a hurricane ( although it may well be any time now ) ( * Ed note , it is now a hurricane ) , and while the track models have been fairly consistent , intensity forecasts are a very tricky business .
There are still some big unknowns with respect to shear the day or so before landfall .
A small change in wind speed ( 10 knots ) can make a big difference in damage since damage is proportional to the cube of the wind speed .
So a 110 knot storm might cause 10 % damage , but a 120 knots storm would cause 15 % to the same structure .
( 8:35 am 8/29 )
Gustav is a bit better organized this morning , and continuing to slowly drift westward , but there are signs the turn to the northwest has started .
But the track across the GOM oil / gas lease sites and potential impact on refineries is still very much an open question .
We 're pretty
sure it will turn north - northwest , and move across western Cuba or the Yucatan straits .
The key question is the timing of the interaction with a high pressure system that could cause a sharp left ( west ) turn is unknown .
That will also increase shear and weaken the storm , so it could well be the difference between this being a major disruption and a no - big - deal event depending on when the shear and turn kick in .
To repeat myself , we 'll know more when Gustav clears the Yucatan straits , which is looking like tomorrow evening .
Chuck has put together a dynamically updating page that will reflect the latest damage models / forecasts at this link : KAC / UCF models .
On current track , which the weather geeks ( and I use the term " geek " in kinship ... ) at http://easternuswx.com and Jeff Masters at WU say is too early to say for sure , but this could do a lot of damage .

PRODUCTION /INFRASTRUCTURE
MAPS AND REFINERY INFORMATION
Here 's a link to a really good map of oil refining / SPR storage facilities in respect to the path of Katrina ( NB : OLD TRACK MAP ! ) and here is a listing of production and refining capability for the state of LA .
Just to give you a rough idea of where things are , the map above is a probability swath for Katrina ( OLD TRACK MAP ! ) with the Thunder Horse platform as the red dot , and the other purple dot represents the Mad Dog development ( 100,000 bd ) ; the Holstein development that produces at peak , around 100,000 bd of oil ; and the Atlantis field that may have ramped up to around 200,000 bd in all .
Put together these projects have the potential of around 650,000 bd , but as can be seen , they were sitting in an uncomfortable spot relative to the track of the Katrina .
The white dot is where Port Fourchon is .
This is where the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port , or LOOP , is located .
Rigzone pointed out that this is where the foreign tankers offload , Google and Terraserve maps you can see that the area is very low - lying .
One of the big concerns is that there will be sub-sea landslides or other ground movement that might affect the LOOP .
Were this to be disrupted , then foreign tankers would need to be diverted elsewhere , with the likely port being Houston .
Here is a really good link / map ( from " Rod and Reel " no less ) of the LA southern coastline showing all of the Submersible and Floater Gulf rigs .
We have accumulated resources from previous hurricans below , but we'd like to find updated materials if you know of them .
Recent refinery maps , recent rig maps in the gulf , recent gas fields , SPR facilities , the Intercoastal Canal , pipeline stations and transfer points , etc. , etc . Leave links in the comments please .

Nov. 8 , 2007 -- Women who use oral contraceptives have an increased risk of developing cervical cancer , but the risk drops quickly once the pill is stopped .
Taking oral contraceptives for five or more years was associated with a doubling of cervical cancer risk in the newly published study .
But risk returned to that of never - users within a decade of stopping oral contraceptives .
The new analysis of data from 24 worldwide studies is one of the most rigorous examinations of cervical cancer risk in oral contraceptive users ever conducted .
Epidemiologist Jane Green , MD , who led the study team , tells WebMD that the findings should be seen as good news for women who take the pill or have taken it in the past .
The study is reported in the Nov. 10 issue of the journal The Lancet .
" We have known that women on the combined estrogen pill are at increased risk [ for cervical cancer ] , she says .
" What we have n't known is what happens after they stop taking the pill .
Now we know that the risk starts to fall pretty quickly and has gone away 10 years later . "
A few years ago , Constance Steinkuehler – a game academic at the University of Wisconsin – was spending 12 hours a day playing Lineage , the online world game .
She was , as she puts it , a " siege princess , " running 150 - person raids on hellishly difficult bosses .
Most of her guild members were teenage boys .
But they were pretty good at figuring out how to defeat the bosses .
One day she found out why .
A group of them were building Excel spreadsheets into which they 'd dump all the information they 'd gathered about how each boss behaved :
What potions affected it , what attacks it would use , with what damage , and when .
Then they 'd develop a mathematical model to explain how the boss worked – and to predict how to beat it .
Often , the first model would n't work very well , so the group would argue about how to strengthen it .
Some would offer up new data they 'd collected , and suggest tweaks to the model .
" They 'd be sitting around arguing about what model was the best , which was most predictive , " Steinkuehler recalls .
That 's when it hit her :
The kids were practicing science .
They were using the scientific method .
They'd think of a hypothesis –
This boss is really susceptible to fire spells – and then collect evidence to see if the hypothesis was correct .
If it was n't , they 'd improve it until it accounted for the observed data .
This led Steinkuehler to a fascinating and provocative conclusion : Videogames are becoming the new hotbed of scientific thinking for kids today .
This makes sense if you think about it for a second .
After all , what is science ?
It 's a technique for uncovering the hidden rules that govern the world .
And videogames are simulated worlds that kids are constantly trying to master .
Lineage and World of Warcraft are n't " real " world , of course , but they are consistent – the behavior of the environment and the creatures in it are governed by hidden and generally unchanging rules , encoded by the game designers .
In the process of learning a game , gamers try to deduce those rules .
This leads them , without them even realizing it , to the scientific method .
This is what Steinkuehler reports in a research paper – " Scientific Habits of Mind in Virtual Worlds " ( .pdf ) – that she will publish in this spring 's Journal of Science Education and Technology .
She and her co-author , Sean Duncan , downloaded the content of 1,984 posts in 85 threads in a discussion board for players of World of Warcraft .
What did they find ?
Only a minority of the postings were " banter " or idle chat .
In contrast , a majority – 86 percent – were aimed specifically at analyzing the hidden ruleset of games .
More than half the gamers used " systems - based reasoning " – analyzing the game as a complex , dynamic system .
And one - tenth actually constructed specific models to explain the behavior of a monster or situation ; they would often use their model to generate predictions .
Meanwhile , one - quarter of the commentors would build on someone else 's previous argument , and another quarter would issue rebuttals of previous arguments and models .
These are all hallmarks of scientific thought .
Indeed , the conversations often had the precise flow of a scientific salon , or even a journal series : Someone would pose a question – like what sort of potions a high - class priest ought to carry around , or how to defeat a particular monster – and another would post a reply , offering data and facts gathered from their own observations .
Others would jump into the fray , disputing the theory , refining it , offering other facts .
Eventually , once everyone was convinced the theory was supported by the data , the discussion would peter out .
" It blew my mind , " Steinkuehler tells me .
And here 's the thing :
The ( mostly ) young people engaging in these sciencelike conversations are precisely the same ones who are , more and more , tuning out of science in the classroom .
Every study shows science literacy in school is plummeting , with barely one - fifth of students graduating with any sort of sense of how the scientific method works .
The situation is far worse for boys than girls .
Steinkuehler thinks videogames are the way to reverse this sorry trend .
She argues that schools ought to be embracing games as places to show kids the value of scientific scrutiny – the way it helps us make sense of the world .
One of the reasons kids get bored by science is that too many teachers present it as a fusty collection of facts for memorization .
This is precisely wrong .
Science is n't about facts .
It 's about the quest for facts – the scientific method , the process by which we hash through confusing thickets of ignorance .
It 's dynamic , argumentative , collaborative , competitive , filled with flashes of crazy excitement and hours of drudgework , and driven by ego :
Our desire to be the one who figures it out , at least for now .
It 's dramatic and nutty and fun .
And it 's pretty much how kids already approach the games they love .
They 're already scientists ; they already know the value of the scientific method .
Teachers just need to talk to them in their language , so that the kids can begin to understand the joy of puzzling through the offline , " real " world too .
At one point , Steinkuehler met up with one of the kids who'd built the Excel model to crack the boss .
" Do you realize that what you 're doing is the essence of science ? " she asked .
He smiled at her .
" Dude , I 'm not doing science , " he replied .
" I 'm just cheating the game ! "

Editor 's Note : Each Wednesday LiveScience examines the viability of emerging energy technologies — the power of the future .
Wind energy might be the simplest renewable energy to understand .
Yet there are misconceptions about what makes the wind industry turn .
The United States now has nearly 17,000 megawatts of wind power installed , which can supply about 1.2 percent of the nation 's demand for electricity , according to a recent report from the Department of Energy ( DOE ) .
With these numbers projected to grow in the coming years , it might be good to be aware of a few myths that are blowing in the wind .
1 . Wind is cheap
No one owns the wind , so it might seem like wind energy should cost less than other technologies that require costly fuel , such as coal or natural gas , to operate .
However , the initial investment for wind energy is high .
Large scale wind turbines cost a few million dollars per megawatt to put up , which at face value appears competitive with new coal - fired power plants , but the wind does n't always blow .
In effect , wind turbines typically only produce electricity about 30 percent of the time , so it takes longer to pay back the building costs .
Taken together with government incentives and maintenance costs over a turbine 's 20 - year lifetime , wind energy ends up costing about 4 cents per kilowatt - hour , according to DOE estimates .
That 's slightly more than coal , but the two are getting closer all the time .
2. America is way behind the rest of the world
Denmark gets 20 percent of its energy from wind .
Germany has the most wind turbines of any country .
China is set to nearly double its wind energy capacity in just one year .
You might think the United States is dragging its heels , but in terms of the raw total , America produces more wind energy than any other country ( thanks to it being windier here than in Germany ) .
And more investment is on the way .
One recent headline grabber is the world 's large wind farm project in Pampa , Texas , proposed by oil magnate T. Boone Pickens .
This is part of the so - called Pickens Plan to invest $ 1 trillion on wind turbines throughout the wind corridor from the Dakotas down to the Texas panhandle .
3 . Wind turbines are loud
Wind turbines used to be loud , but newer designs are less so .
Some of the bad rap about noise can be attributed to a single wind turbine constructed in 1978 outside of Boone , N.C. , which generated low - frequency sound waves that rattled windows and made some people sick in nearby homes .
Since then , most new rotors turn slower and are mounted in front of ( not behind ) their towers .
These and other changes have dramatically lowered the noise , said Pat Moriarty of the National Renewable Energy Lab in Golden , Colo .
Still , some neighbors complain , and the wind industry continues to search for even quieter designs .
4 . Wind turbines kill birds
This one is actually true , but the problem is not as bad as some people claim .
The impression that all turbines are dangerous to birds comes from Altamont Pass Wind Resource Area in California .
This was one of the first big wind farms , and unfortunately it was placed in a migratory bird pathway , Moriarty said .
In addition , Altamont 's 4,800 small wind turbines — many installed in the early 80s — have rotors low to the ground and packed close together , which may be why more than 1,000 birds ( half of which are raptors ) die there each year .
Newer wind farms report fewer bird deaths probably because the turbines are taller and spread further apart .
And for comparison 's sake , studies show that many more birds die colliding with cars and buildings than die in turbine blades .
5 . Any house can own a windmill
Unless you have a good chunk of land around your house , it 's probably not a good idea to get a wind turbine .
If it 's too close to buildings or trees , the wind will be turbulent and wo n't produce the power that it 's supposed to .
But what do we know .
The small wind turbine market grew by 14 percent in 2007 .
Some of these are for boats , but others supply homeowners who live off the grid .

Are we dealing with an elaborate scam from the McCain campaign ?
Is McCain going through all this drama just so he can vote NO on the bailout package ?
That ’s a developing theme .
Taegan Goddard writes :
Democrats fear this morning that McCain is setting up a scenario in which he will vote against the bill , rally conservatives to his side and , most importantly , distance himself from both President Bush and Congress before the election .
Marc Ambinder has this :
My colleague Nora McAvalnah tells me that sources close to Senate Democratic leadership now fear that McCain ’s true motivation for calling off his campaign and coming back to DC is simply to cast a “ no ” vote against the bailout , despite his private statements to the contrary .
And it ’s a smart maneuver : nothing says “ maverick , ” like voting against Bush and standing with the American public , who remain very wary of the proposal .
Gee , no one could have predicted that .
McCain puts politics first .
But , wait .
Yesterday , the top of the Palin / McCain ticket , the one who is campaigning today in Pennsylvania , said if the bailout package does n’t pass , we ’re heading for another Great Depression .
Yes , she did .
On CBS , via AP :
Asked whether there ’s a risk of another Great Depression if Congress does n’t approve a $ 700 billion bailout package , Palin said , “ Unfortunately , that is the road that America may find itself on . ”
Palin said the answer to the financial crisis does n’t necessarily have to be the bailout plan that the Bush administration has proposed , but that it should be some form of bipartisan action to reform Wall Street .
When McCain votes against the bi-partisan bailout , according to his V.P. , he ’s voting for a Great Depression .
I am speaking on literary criticism , and in the world in which we are actually living that is almost as unpromising as speaking about peace .
This is not a peaceful age , and it is not a critical age .
In the Europe of the last ten years literary criticism of the older kind — criticism that is really judicious , scrupulous , fair - minded , treating a work of art as a thing of value in itself — has been next door to impossible .
If we look back at the English literature of the last ten years not so much at the literature as at the prevailing literary attitude , the thing that strikes us is that it has almost ceased to be aesthetic .
Literature has been swamped by propaganda .
I do not mean that all the books written during that period have been bad .
But the characteristic writers of the time , people like Auden and Spender and MacNeice , have been didactic , political writers , aesthetically conscious , of course , but more interested in subject - matter than in technique .
And the most lively criticism has nearly all of it been the work of Marxist writers , people like Christopher Caudwell and Philip Henderson and Edward Upward , who look on every book virtually as a political pamphlet and are far more interested in digging out its political and social implications than in its literary qualities in the narrow sense .
This is all the more striking because it makes a very sharp and sudden contrast with the period immediately before it .
The characteristic writers of the nineteen - twenties — T. S. Eliot , for instance , Ezra Pound , Virginia Woolf — were writers who put the main emphasis on technique .
They had their beliefs and prejudices , of course , but they were far more interested in technical innovations than in any moral or meaning or political implication that their work might contain .
The best of them all , James Joyce , was a technician and very little else , about as near to being a ‘ pure ’ artist as a writer can be .
Even D. H. Lawrence , though he was more of a ‘ writer with a purpose ’ than most of the others of his time , had not much of what we should now call social consciousness .
And though I have narrowed this down to the nineteen - twenties , it had really been the same from about 1890 onwards .
Throughout the whole of that period , the notion that form is more important than subject - matter , the notion of ‘ art for art 's sake ’ , had been taken for granted .
There were writers who disagreed , of course — Bernard Shaw was one — but that was the prevailing outlook .
The most important critic of the period , George Saintsbury , was a very old man in the nineteen - twenties , but he had a powerful influence up to about 1930 , and Saintsbury had always firmly upheld the technical attitude to art .
He claimed that he himself could and did judge any book solely on its execution , its manner , and was very nearly indifferent to the author 's opinions .
Now , how is one to account for this very sudden change of outlook ?
About the end of the nineteen - twenties you get a book like Edith Sitwell 's book on Pope , with a completely frivolous emphasis on technique , treating literature as a sort of embroidery , almost as though words did not have meanings : and only a few years later you get a Marxist critic like Edward Upward asserting that books can be ‘ good ’ only when they are Marxist in tendency .
In a sense both Edith Sitwell and Edward Upward were representative of their period .
The question is why should their outlook be so different ?
I think one has got to look for the reason in external circumstances .
Both the aesthetic and the political attitude to literature were produced , or at any rate conditioned by the social atmosphere of a certain period .
And now that another period has ended — for Hitler 's attack on Poland in 1939 ended one epoch as surely as the great slump of 1931 ended another — one can link back and see more clearly than was possible a few years ago the way in which literary attitudes are affected by external events .
A thing that strikes anyone who looks back over the last hundred years is that literary criticism worth bothering about , and the critical attitude towards literature , barely existed in England between roughly 1830 and 1890 .
It is not that good books were not produced in that period .
Several of the writers of that time , Dickens , Thackeray , Trollop and others , will probably be remembered longer than any that have come after them .
But there are not literary figures in Victorian England corresponding to Flaubert , Baudelaire , Gautier and a host of others .
What now appears to us as aesthetic scrupulousness hardly existed .
To a mid-Victorian English writer , a book was partly something that brought him money and partly a vehicle for preaching sermons .
England was changing very rapidly , a new moneyed class had come up on the ruins of the old aristocracy , contact with Europe had been severed , and a long artistic tradition had been broken .
The mid-nineteenth - century English writers were barbarians , even when they happened to be gifted artists , like Dickens .
But in the later part of the century contact with Europe was re-established through Matthew Arnold , Pater , Oscar Wilde and various others , and the respect for form and technique in literature came back .
It is from then that the notion of ‘ art for art 's sake ’ — a phrase very much out of fashion , but still , I think , the best available — really dates .
And the reason why it could flourish so long , and be so much taken for granted , was that the whole period between 1890 and 1930 was one of exceptional comfort and security .
It was what we might call the golden afternoon of the capitalist age .
Even the Great War did not really disturb it .
The Great War killed ten million men , but it did not shake the world as this war will shake it and has shaken it already .
Almost every European between 1890 and 1930 lived in the tacit belief that civilization would last forever .
You might be individually fortunate or unfortunate , but you had inside you the feeling that nothing would ever fundamentally change .
And in that kind of atmosphere intellectual detachment , and also dilettantism , are possible .
It is that feeling of continuity , of security , that could make it possible for a critic like Saintsbury , a real old crusted Tory and High Churchman , to be scrupulously fair to books written by men whose political and moral outlook he detested .
But since 1930 that sense of security has never existed .
Hitler and the slump shattered it as the Great War and even the Russian Revolution had failed to shatter it .
The writers who have come up since 1930 have been living in a world in which not only one 's life but one 's whole scheme of values is constantly menaced .
In such circumstances detachment is not possible .
You cannot take a purely aesthetic interest in a disease you are dying from ; you cannot feel dispassionately about a man who is about to cut your throat .
In a world in which Fascism and Socialism were fighting one another , any thinking person had to take sides , and his feelings had to find their way not only into his writing but into his judgements on literature .
Literature had to become political , because anything else would have entailed mental dishonesty .
One 's attachments and hatreds were too near the surface of consciousness to be ignored .
What books were about seemed so urgently important that the way they were written seemed almost insignificant .
And this period of ten years or so in which literature , even poetry , was mixed up with pamphleteering , did a great service to literary criticism , because it destroyed the illusion of pure aestheticism .
It reminded us that propaganda in some form or other lurks in every book , that every work of art has a meaning and a purpose — a political , social and religious purpose — that our aesthetic judgements are always coloured by our prejudices and beliefs .
It debunked art for art 's sake .
But is also led for the time being into a blind alley , because it caused countless young writers to try to tie their minds to a political discipline which , if they had stuck to it , would have made mental honesty impossible .
The only system of thought open to them at that time was official Marxism , which demanded a nationalistic loyalty towards Russia and forced the writer who called himself a Marxist to be mixed up in the dishonesties of power politics .
And even if that was desirable , the assumptions that these writers built upon were suddenly shattered by the Russo - German Pact .
Just as many writers about 1930 had discovered that you cannot really be detached from contemporary events , so many writers about 1939 were discovering that you cannot really sacrifice your intellectual integrity for the sake of a political creed — or at least you cannot do so and remain a writer .
Aesthetic scrupulousness is not enough , but political rectitude is not enough either .
The events of the last ten years have left us rather in the air , they have left England for the time being without any discoverable literary trend , but they have helped us to define , better than was possible before , the frontiers of art and propaganda .

Fired ' Troopergate ' figure accuses Palin of lying Nick Juliano
Published : Monday September 15 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is lying when she says she did not try to get her brother - in - law fired from the state 's police force then sacked the public safety commissioner who would not go along with her planned vendetta , the official at the center of the scandal says .
ABC News , which secured the first televised interview with the Republican vice presidential nominee , reports the accusations Monday : " She 's not telling the truth when she told ABC neither she nor her husband pressured me to fire Trooper Wooten , " said Walt Monegan , the Alaskan official whose dismissal by Sarah Palin is the focus of a state investigation known as " Troopergate " .
" And she 's not telling the truth to the media about her reasons for firing me . "
In an exclusive interview with ABC News.com , former Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan said he resisted pressure by the First Couple to re-open an old case against a state trooper , who was in a hotly contested divorce and custody battle with the Governor 's sister Molly .
Alaskan lawmakers are investigating whether Palin and her husband used the power of the Governor 's office to conduct a personal vendetta against their former brother - in - law , whose behavior during the 2005 divorce was described by the Palin family as " threatening . "
Monegan recently spent several hours of sworn testimony to a legislative body investigating whether Palin abused her power .
The results of the investigation are expected in October , although Palin has been trying to delay the proceedings until after the election .
Palin , who came to the GOP ticket touted as an honest , reform - minded candidate , has dodged inquiries about her and her husband 's involvement in Monegan 's firing .
Among 1,100 e-mails the governor 's office has refused to release in response to a public records request are dozens of exchanges among her husband and government aides regarding the public safety union that represents the state troopers .
Monegan said he thought it would be a misuse of his position to re-open an old case on Palin 's brother - in - law as he was in the middle of a messy divorce .
Monegan said he tried to persuade the first couple to drop the matter .
" As a cop for 35 years I 'm pretty familiar with issues that come up in divorce cases , " and said his argument to both Todd and Sarah was , " if this was so egregious , why did n't you bring it up sooner ?
Why did you wait until several years later ? "
While it will be some time before the full story of Sarah and Todd Palin 's involvement in Monegan 's firing becomes clear -- Todd Palin was served with a subpoena last week -- it certainly fits a pattern for the governor outlined in a separate New York Times article Monday .
Sarah Palin prized loyalty and punished dissent , the paper reported .
But an examination of her swift rise and record as mayor of Wasilla and then governor finds that her visceral style and penchant for attacking critics  she sometimes calls local opponents haters   contrasts with her carefully crafted public image .
Throughout her political career , she has pursued vendettas , fired officials who crossed her and sometimes blurred the line between government and personal grievance , according to a review of public records and interviews with 60 Republican and Democratic legislators and local officials .
Whether voters want that governing style in the White House will remain to be seen .
IF EVER there was a case that cried out for enhanced interrogation techniques , it was the appearance of the Pentagon 's former top lawyer in the US Senate .
William " Jim " Haynes II , the man who blessed the use of dogs , hoods and nudity to pry information out of recalcitrant detainees , proved to be a model of evasion himself as he resisted all attempts at inquiry by the Armed Services Committee .
Did he ask a subordinate to get information about harsh questioning techniques ?

A gunman has killed 10 people at a college in the town of Kauhajoki in Finland before shooting himself and later dying in hospital .
Media reports named the gunman as Matti Juhani Saari , 22 , a trainee chef at the vocational college .
The suspect posted a video of himself on the internet last week firing a gun .
As a result of this , police interviewed him on Monday but decided they did not have enough evidence to revoke his licence , the interior minister said .
Saari's YouTube postings had alerted the authorities to him The minister , Anne Holmlund , said an investigation would now try to determine whether mistakes were made .
Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen said this was a " tragic day " for Finland .
The attack echoed a shooting spree at a Finnish school last year which left nine dead , including the gunman , who had also posted an internet video .
Ski mask
The shootings in Kauhajoki , some 330 km ( 205 miles ) north of the capital , Helsinki , began just before 1100 local time ( 0800 GMT ) .
An estimated 150 students were thought to be in the college buildings at the time .
SCHOOL SHOOTINGS Tuusula , Finland , November 2007 - nine dead , including gunman Virginia Tech , US , April 2007 - 33 dead , including gunman Erfurt , Germany , April 2002 - 18 dead , including gunman Columbine school , Denver , US , April 1999 - 15 dead including two gunmen Dunblane , Scotland , March 1996 - 16 children , one teacher and gunman dead

The gunman , dressed in black and wearing a ski mask , was seen entering the building with a large bag .
Shots were fired soon afterwards .
School caretaker Jukka Forsberg told AFP news agency that two girls had told him a man was shooting .
" I saw a guy leaving a big black bag in the corridor and going into classroom number three and closing the door , " he said .
" I looked through the window and he immediately shot at me .
Then I called the emergency number .
Thank God I was not hit , he fired at me but I was running zigzag .
I ran for my life . "
Mr Forsberg added : " I heard constant shooting .
He changed another case in the gun .
He was very well prepared .
He walked calmly . "
Police ordered an evacuation and called for reinforcements as fires blazed in the building .
The gunman remained at large within the college grounds for some time .
Mr Vanhanen confirmed the gunman had shot himself .
Media reports said the gunman was treated for a bullet wound to the head at Tampere University Hospital but later died .
One victim also died in hospital , raising the initial toll from nine .
College headmaster Tapio Varmola told AFP : " Police have told me they suspect [ the gunman ] to be Matti Juhani Saari .
He is a second year culinary arts student at our school . "
Mr Vanhanen expressed condolences to the families of the victims and declared Wednesday a day of national mourning .
" We all as a society must be united so that events like these will not happen again , " he said .
Ms Holmlund said police questioned the man about the YouTube video , which showed him shooting at a firing range .
On the video , the gunman says " you die next " before firing three times at the camera .
FINLAND'S GUN CULTURE
All gun owners are required to have a licence Minimum age for buying a gun is 15 About 14 % of homicides in Finland are gun-related Ms Holmlund said : " Police were aware of this and spoke to him on Monday , September 22 .
However , the police officer on duty decided there was no need to terminate his gun licence . "
The gunman was given a " temporary licence " for a . 22 - calibre firearm this year , Ms Holmlund said .
In November 2007 , eight people and the gunman died in another school attack in Tuusula , Finland .
The gunman , Pekka - Eric Auvinen , posted a video on YouTube as a preview of his attack , pledging to " eliminate " those he saw as " unfit " .
In the wake of that attack , Finland 's government pledged to raise the minimum age for buying guns .
But the country has a long tradition of hunting and weapons - bearing .
An international small arms survey in 2007 showed an averaged total of 2.9 million firearms within a population of 5.2 million people .

Dear Straight Dope :
There 's a question that 's been plaguing me for some time .
So , we 've all known the stages of metamorphosis for butterflies and moths since we were children , but I can't seem to find a decent description as to exactly how the caterpillar in its chrysalis stage morphs into a butterfly or moth .
All I find is vague phrasings such as " hormonal changes " and " magical happenings " .
Simply asked , how exactly does a caterpillar , in the chrysalis stage of metamorphosis , morph its physical structure into that of a butterfly or moth ?
Mark Anderson
SDStaff Doug replies :
The transformation that results in a butterfly — or fly , or beetle , or wasp , or any other insect that undergoes complete metamorphosis , from larva to pupa to adult — is one of the most remarkable stunts pulled in the animal kingdom .
Saying it involves “ magical happenings ” is n’t so far off : it ’s an astounding trick , even when you know how it ’s done .
And , as with most magic tricks , the secret behind it involves some specialized apparatus — a gimmick that ’s hidden away from the audience , up the proverbial sleeve .
The first part of the explanation lies in understanding how insects are put together .
As is the case with other arthropods , the “ skin ” of insects is a single layer of cells on top of which they produce a tough covering called the exoskeleton .
If you read some of the more popularized stuff about insects , you ’ll likely see references to the “ chitinous exoskeleton , ” with the implication that “ chitinous ” means “ hard . ”
That ’s not accurate : chitin is a polysaccharide ( like cellulose ) that ’s the main constituent of the insect exoskeleton , but it ’s not intrinsically hard .
For a good idea of what chitin is like , think of the basic white mushrooms you find at the grocery store — it ’s pale and soft .
Some parts of the exoskeleton are more rigid than others .
There are solid plates , called sclerites , but in between these the exoskeleton is soft and flexible ; in some life stages — picture a caterpillar here — the soft and flexible part of the exoskeleton makes up pretty much the whole thing .
The trick here is that the skin cells of insects release chemicals into the exoskeleton above them that cause modifications of the molecules and the links between them , making some parts of the exoskeleton darker and harder than others .
The second part of the explanation deals with how insects and other arthropods grow larger .
The soft parts of the exoskeleton can be stretched as an insect grows , but not the hardened parts .
So , what happens is that when a certain limit is reached , the skin cells essentially detach from the exoskeleton above them , and manufacture a new exoskeleton underneath the old one — but the new exoskeleton is kept in a soft , flexible condition .
When the new exoskeleton is ready to go , the insect ruptures the old exoskeleton , and either crawls out of that shell , or shucks it off like a pair of pajamas , and then expands its new exoskeleton .
Only then will it release the chemicals that cause parts of the new exoskeleton to get darker and harder .
It ’s this brief vulnerable stage which we can thank for the culinary wonder known as soft - shell crab .
Mmm … soft - shell crab .
But I digress .
So , far , everything I ’ve said pretty much applies to all arthropods — crustaceans , arachnids , insects , etc .
Now comes the final part of the explanation , and the thing that makes insects that undergo complete metamorphosis so vastly different from everything else , including other insects and arthropods .
When one of these sorts of insects is an embryo , a number of tiny little buds of embryonic tissue , called imaginal discs , separate off from the rest , and just stay there inside the body cavity , doing nothing , all through the larval stages .
Those discs are the gimmick hiding up the sleeve .
The larva grows , sheds its skin several times , until it comes time to pupate .
Underneath the last larval exoskeleton , the skin cells form the exoskeleton of the pupa , and when that last larval skin is shed , the pupa is revealed .
In butterflies , the pupa is known as a “ chrysalis ” , though other insect pupae go by different names , and are different in appearance .
Now comes the trick : inside this pupal shell , most of the innards of the insect , including the skin , basically disintegrate , except for those tiny little discs of embryonic tissue .
They suddenly go into overdrive , consuming the nutrients and raw materials now floating in the body cavity and dividing , growing , and proliferating at a breakneck pace .
They grow into layers of new cells , then forming new organs , finally fusing together to form a new skin .
This entirely new skin manufactures an entirely new exoskeleton underneath the shell of the pupal exoskeleton .
That new exoskeleton is the body of the adult insect , and — generally speaking — bears hardly any resemblance at all to the larval stages that preceded it .
Now you know the secret : it ’s not a case of morphing one physical structure into another , it ’s a new physical structure altogether , formed by a spare set of embryonic cells that had been hidden away .
In essence , insects that undergo complete metamorphosis are born twice ( or , at least , reborn ) , which is pretty amazing and pretty novel .
Pretty good trick , huh ?

According to Felicia ’s website , her passions are “ video games , fantasy novels , web 2.0 , wordpress , cooking , playing with her cats and making people laugh . ”
Some reasons that Felicia is worthy : ( 1 ) she plays a level 66 gnome warlock and a level 63 priest in World of Warcraft , ( 2 ) she sang “ Still Alive ” ( the theme song from Portal ) with Jonathan Coulton at the recent Penny Arcade Expo , ( 3 ) she got into Julliard but went for a degree in math instead , ( 4 ) when told her television pilot for “ The Guild ” was too “ niche ” she just decided to make it for the web instead , and ( 5 ) she plays the violin .
I could probably go on .
As for her professional cred … well , she played potential slayer Vi in the last season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer .
She also gained some notice from her role in a USPS commercial .
She stars in ( and writes / produces ) the award - winning web series The Guild , about a group of WoW gamers .
She recently appeared as the female lead in Joss Whedon ’s Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog opposite Neil Patrick Harris and Nathan Fillion .
And tonight she ’s appearing in an episode of House , M.D. ( apparently she does not have Lupus ) .
One of the reasons that I find Felicia so endearing is that in every interview with her that I read / see , she comes off as so completely real .
She ’s just a normal person , a geek without being a stereotype , who just happens to act for a living .
She ’s also hilarious , which you can pick up just from watching “ The Guild . ”
Oh , and she ’s totally cute .
I kind of love her hair , even if I do n’t necessarily want to brush it like she ’s a pony .
If you ’re not watching “ The Guild , ” then you should be .
If you have n’t seen Dr. Horrible ’s Sing - Along Blog , then you definitely should .
But at the very least , you should watch her on House tonight , because I foresee big things in this geek ’s future .

LONDON ( MarketWatch ) --
The scandal over former Sen. John Edwards ' alleged fathering of a love child is rapidly being surpassed by a greater travesty -- not one single major media organization in the U.S is covering the story .
Edwards , who 's sought the presidency twice , actually was nominated for vice president once , and made millions as a trial lawyer by holding health maintenance organizations accountable for their alleged transgressions , is manifestly newsworthy and clearly a public figure .
Heck , he 's almost a celebrity .
Yet no major network or national daily paper is doing anything with the story .
Sure , it 's distasteful .
That 's one of the reasons it 's news .
But the National Enquirer owns the Edwards love child story the way the Washington Post WPO owned Watergate .
It 's August .
It 's the slowest news month of the year .
Newspapers are dying on the vine .
But nobody wants to touch a sordid tale about a politician 's love life ?
Former Rep. Gary Condit should have been so lucky .
Bill Clinton , Larry Craig , and Ted Kennedy can only gaze in wonder at the dearth of coverage .
In February , the New York Times NYT , - 0.61 % spilled barrels of ink , and clear - cut a forest to tell the world that -- hint , hint , wink , wink , nudge , nudge , know what I mean ?
-- Sen. John McCain allegedly had had an affair .
This was great stuff , until someone bothered to vet the story .
By those standards , the Enquirer 's reporting on Edwards is Pulitzer grade stuff .
( They have a picture . )
The guy 's up for a cabinet post at least , maybe even veep -- well , not any more .
But somehow , it 's just not relevant that he wo n't answer questions about why he was hiding from a couple of trashy tabloid reporters in a bathroom at the Beverly Hills Hilton at 2:30 a.m.?
Enquiring minds want to know .
No wonder nobody bothers to buy newspapers anymore .
The Reform Candidate ?
Created : September 01 , 2008 10:01 | Last updated : July 31 , 2020 00:00
ANCHORAGE — Plenty of voters are trying to figure out what to make of the national newcomer Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , Sen. John McCain ’s pick for vice president .
Even seasoned politicos were puzzled by the choice , as they listened to the little - known Alaskan stumping with veteran McCain in Ohio and Missouri these last few days .
Watching Palin , a self - described “ hockey mom , ” speak in the Midwest does not capture her true persona — personal or political .
To fully understand her , she needs to be placed in her element — where her politics makes sense .
This means : in her home state of Alaska .
I covered Alaska for TPMmuckraker , and I continue to follow the state ’s scandal - ridden political system .
The Washington Independent was convinced that coverage from Alaska would help explain Palin ’s story , so I am here to explore who she is and what sort of vice president she would make .

I landed Sunday afternoon in Anchorage , a city that has an international airport named for its senior U.S. senator , Ted Stevens .
He was just indicted on charges that he failed to disclose gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from a local oil services company — including a new first story for his home .
Callers on the conservative talk radio show I listened to on the drive to my hotel were thrilled at McCain ’s choice .
Palin is a conservative Alaskan ’s conservative — pro-gun and pro-drilling .
She ’s viewed as an anti-corruption candidate in a state that ’s seen nine public corruption indictments in the last two years — all for ties to Veco Corp. , the same oil services company as Stevens .
Several Alaskans touted her ability to turn her back on the old guard , which clearly still has its fans .
I saw a spattering of “ Stevens 08 ″ signs on Anchorage front lawns on the same drive .

So far , Palin has been introduced to the nation by the McCain campaign as the conservative talk show listeners described her — as a political maverick and reformer .
This pro-life mother of five - turned - politician has made a name for herself in Alaska by facing off with the state GOP over ethics concerns — particularly those related to oil companies .
In this way , Palin makes an ideal match for a man whose own political story involves breaking with the GOP on important issues when required , while skirting the scandals that plagued his fellow Republicans in Congress .
A look at Palin ’s rise to power in Alaska , however , raises questions about what “ reformer ” means here and whether it carries the same heft in her home state as it does with a national politician .
While Palin combated the cash - for - favors reputation of the Republican Party in Alaska , she has also found herself in the middle of two scandals that question her use of power .
The latest scandal has been percolating on national blogs for weeks and made the front - page of The Washington Post on Sunday .
Palin stands accused of having fired Alaska ’s public - safety commissioner because he would not dismiss her sister ’s ex-husband , a state trooper , who the Palins have been feuding with since before she became governor .
Though a full report from an independent investigator is due this fall , emails from Palin and a tape recording reveal that the governor at least pressured the commissioner to fire her ex-brother - in - law , after she previously denied having done so .
Palin has conceded that she was justified in pushing for the dismissal of her former brother - in - law , though she maintains it had nothing to do with her decision to replace the safety commissioner .
She has spoken about her willingness to cooperate in the investigation repeatedly on national TV .
This fresh scandal is an important part of what I plan to investigate during my time in Alaska .
As I have more information , I ’ll report it on The Streak .
Palin , a lifelong member of the National Rifle Assn. , started her career as a member of her local city council in Wasilla , Alaska , a town about 45 miles outside of Anchorage , in 1992 .
She was elected Wasilla ’s mayor in 1996 , when the city ’s population was about 4,600 , according to a 1997 press report ( via nexis ) .
In this role , Palin acted in a way that eerily foreshadows her recent actions while governor .
Early in her tenure as mayor , the city council threatened to recall her over accusations that she fired the city ’s police chief , Irl Stambaugh , and the library director , Mary Ellen Emmons , without warning .
She accused them in a letter saying : “ I do not feel I have your full support in my efforts to govern the city of Wasilla .
Therefore I intend to terminate your employment … ” ( The Anchorage Daily News , via nexis )
Ultimately , Palin let the library director have her job back ; though Stambaugh ’s position was not returned .
The police chief took the matter to court , where a judge sided with Palin , saying city law allows the mayor to fire the police chief without cause .
When questioned by the Anchorage Daily News at the time , Palin refused to give details on how Stambaugh had not supported her , saying only : ” You know in your heart when someone is supportive of you . ”
Perhaps years later Palin will have new perspective on the decision to fire these workers .
I ’m curious to find out what was her original motivation , as well .
I ’ll follow up with her at a press conference planned for Monday morning in Anchorage .
I ’ll also be visiting the city of Wasilla where I ’ll be able to pull the original court documents .
The matter did not follow her as she rose to higher positions in Alaska .
In fact , the first firing was nearly forgotten , even when the second firing scandal broke .
Perhaps in a state desperate for a reformer , Palin ’s anti-money - for - votes persona resonates more strongly .
In the coming weeks and months , we ’ll find out if does on the national stage as well .

Religious fanatics of the fundamentalist streak love to make up weird stuff about evolution .
There 's no evidence , scientists are in disagreement over it , lots of scientists do n't believe in it , and on and on .
It 's all lies .
One of my favorites is their trying to turn the tables , making it seem like evolution is a religion and therefore cannot be taught in schools .
First , science is not a religion .
It 's not faith - based .
Second , science represents reality .
When you inform people about science , you are teaching them .
You are not indoctrinating them .
Some folks seem to miss this subtle point ( subtle like an Alice Cooper concert is subtle , at least ) .
However , James McGrath , a religion professor , makes this point very clearly .
I suspect there is much in this world that Dr. McGrath and I would disagree on , but on this we are reading the same page .

A Darkened Sky
Credit & Copyright : Miloslav Druckmuller ( Brno University of Technology ) , Peter Aniol , Vojtech Rusin
Explanation :
For a moment on August 1st , the daytime sky grew dark along the path of a total solar eclipse .
While watching the geocentric celestial event from Mongolia , photographer Miloslav Druckmuller recorded multiple images with two separate cameras as the Moon blocked the bright solar disk and darkened the sky .
This final composition consists of 55 frames ranging in exposure time from 1/125 to 8 seconds .
It spans nearly 12 degrees , with the relative position of the Moon and Sun corresponding to mid-eclipse .
On the left is bright planet Mercury , but many stars are also visible , including the Praesepe star cluster ( also known as M44 or the Beehive cluster ) in Cancer , above and to the right of the silhouetted Moon .
Remarkably , the nearly perfect conditions and wide range in individual exposures allow the composite picture to register the lunar surface and follow the delicate solar corona out to a distance of nearly 20 times the radius of the Sun .
In fact , the composite presents a range in brightness beyond what the eye could see during the eclipse .

New twist in teen obesity : Some need liver transplants 1 / 1 Back to Gallery
TRENTON , N.J. —
In a new and disturbing twist on the obesity epidemic , some overweight teenagers have severe liver damage caused by too much body fat , and a handful have needed liver transplants .
Many more may need a new liver by their 30s or 40s , say experts warning that pediatricians need to be more vigilant .
The condition , which can lead to cirrhosis and liver failure or liver cancer , is being seen in kids in the U.S. , Europe , Australia and even some developing countries , according to a surge of recent medical studies and doctors interviewed .
The American Liver Foundation and other experts estimate 2 percent to 5 percent of American children over age 5 , nearly all of them obese or overweight , have the condition , called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease .
" It 's clearly the most common cause of liver disease , " said Dr. Ronald Sokol , head of public policy at the liver foundation and a liver specialist at Children 's Hospital and University of Colorado Denver .
Some experts think as many as 10 percent of all children and half of those who are obese may suffer from it but note that few are given the simple blood test that can signal its presence .
A biopsy is the only sure way to diagnose this disease .
Fat linked to cirrhosis
As fat builds up , the liver can become inflamed and then scarred over time , leading to cirrhosis .
Liver failure or liver cancer can follow , but if cirrhosis has not yet developed , fatty liver disease can be reversed through weight loss .
The disease is most common in overweight children with belly fat and certain warning signs , such as diabetes or cholesterol or heart problems .
However , it 's been seen in a few children of normal weight .
Genetics , diet and exercise level all play a role .
It is most prevalent among Hispanics , relatively rare among African - Americans , and more common among boys than girls .
" There are people in their 30s or early 40s that will require a liver transplant " from developing the condition as a child , predicts Dr. José Derdoy , head of liver transplants at Cardinal Glennon Children 's Medical Center in St. Louis .
" There are n't enough livers to go around , " says Dr. Philip Rosenthal of the University of California - San Francisco Children 's Hospital .
Transplant recipient
Dr. Rosenthal 's patient , Irving Shaffino , a Mexican - American who lives outside Lubbock , was lucky to get a transplant a year ago .
He was in end - stage cirrhosis and , at 5 - feet - 4 1/2 , weighed 180 pounds .
Irving , 15 , had been fat since age 6 because of a high - starch , high - fat diet , said his mother , Guadalupe Shaffino .
At age 8 , she said , he had a distended stomach and by his early teens , breathing problems kept him tethered to an oxygen tank .
Without health insurance , the family could n't find a local hospital that would do a transplant .
UCSF Children 's Hospital , with money from a state health program , agreed to do the transplant .
Rosenthal said without a new liver Irving would have died , maybe within months .
Soon after tests were completed and Irving got on a transplant waiting list , an organ was found .
" It felt like a miracle , because people say you could be on the transplant list for years , " Irving said .
Scant progress in losing
Sadly , however , Irving has made little progress in losing weight since the July 26 , 2007 , operation .
While he 's grown an inch and a half since his operation , he 's still obese , and his weight was up to 219 last month .
Specialists say many kids diagnosed with fatty liver disease come to subsequent checkups heavier , and at best , just one in four loses significant weight , the only treatment known to stop and reverse the disease .
" My patients that are successful , the whole family has bought in , " increasing exercise and changing diet , said Dr. Stephanie Abrams , a liver and obesity specialist at Texas Children 's Hospital .
" The problem is that we are n't changing society in favor of becoming lean . "
The scope of the disease has only been realized in recent years .
Just a handful of cases were reported in medical journals in the 1980s .
Only three liver transplants on American children with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease were recorded from 1990 through 2002 ; two were done last year .
Experts say the best way to fight the problem is to intervene early , while it can be reversed .
The critical part of the bailout is the price the government pays for the trash assets it buys from banks .
In short , if the government pays too much , the taxpayers will get hosed .
So it is interesting to note the difference between the price the government is proposing to pay and the price one of the world 's smartest investors -- Warren Buffett - - would be willing to pay .
To wit :
Bernanke and Paulson want to pay a phantom " hold - to - maturity " price that is above the prices at which the banks are currently valuing their trash assets .
The logic is that the banks ' carrying value is somehow artificially depressed by a lack of liquidity .
( This logic is weak :
If anything , the banks are trying to conceal how badly off they are by overstating the value of the assets ) .
Warren Buffett , meanwhile , thinks the appropriate price would be the " market value , " which he believes is below the price at which the banks are currently carrying their trash :
[ If ] they do [ the bailout ] right , I think they 'll make a lot of money ....
They should n't buy these debt instruments at what the institutions paid .
They should n't buy them at what they 're carrying , what the carrying value is , necessarily .
They should buy them at the kind of prices that are available in the market .
People who are buying these instruments in the market are expecting to make 15 to 20 percent on those instruments .
If the government makes anything over its cost of borrowing , this deal will come out with a profit .
And I would bet it will come out with a profit , actually ...
You can be pretty fanciful in marking positions in Wall Street , particularly when things are n't trading .
The one thing you want to make sure , when the Treasury is buying things , is the marks they have do n't make any difference .
Like I said , it would n't be a bad idea , if you 're buying ten billion of a security and you 're the Treasury , to have them sell five - hundred million , or something like that into the market , so you find out what the real market price is and then buy the other 9 - 1 / 2 billion at that price .
I really think , I really think the Treasury will make -- I think they 'll pay back the 700 billion and make a considerable amount of money , if they approach it in that manner .
Read that again .
Warren Buffett is not talking about paying any theoretical " hold - to - maturity " price .
He 's not even talking about the " don't - give - your - shareholders - all - the - bad - news - yet " carrying price ( the " fanciful " ones he describes above ) .
He 's talking about the market price .
And , unlike Bernanke , he 's not suggesting that market price is somehow artificially depressed by a lack of liquidity .
On the contrary , he 's saying the market price is the market price because that 's the price intelligent investors need to pay to offset their risk .
The goverment should not pay one cent more than the market price .
Why are n't Bernanke and Paulson suggesting that the government pay a " market price . "
Because they know the banks will continue to insist that this price is too low and wo n't play ball .
Fine .
The answer is NOT to pay them to help the country -- especially since they are a primary reason the company has gotten into this mess .
The answer is either to let them crash and burn and come begging for a bailout -- at which point you nuke their shareholders completely AND / OR put a time - limit on the bailout offer , so they have to weigh their own self - interest vs. possible self - destruction .
And in any case , you take equity , too , so you do n't get screwed while their shareholders zoom .
Remember :
You do n't need to save all the banks to save the country .
You only need to save some .

The financial crisis entered a potentially dangerous new phase on Wednesday when many credit markets stopped working normally as investors around the world frantically moved their money into the safest investments , like Treasury bills .
As a result , the cost of borrowing soared for many companies , while the stocks of Wall Street firms like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley that only a couple of weeks ago were considered relatively strong came under assault by waves of selling .
Investors were so worried that they snapped up three - month Treasury bills with virtually no yield and they pushed gold to its biggest one - day gain in nearly 10 years .
Stocks fell by nearly 5 percent in New York .
The stunning flight to safety , away from other kinds of debt as well as stocks , could cause serious damage to an already weakened economy by making it more expensive for businesses to finance their daily operations .
Some economists worry that a psychology of fear has gripped investors , not only in the United States but also in Europe and Asia .
While investors ’ decision to protect themselves may be perfectly rational , the crowd behavior could cause a downward spiral with broader ramifications .
My conference session How to Design a Good API and Why it Matters has always drawn large crowds ; on InfoQ was the third most viewed content last year .
When I presented this session as an invited talk at OOPSLA 2006 , I was given the opportunity to write an abstract for the proceedings .
In place of an ordinary abstract I decided to try something a bit unusual : I distilled the essence of the talk down to a modest collection of pithy maxims , in the spirit of Jon Bentley 's classic Bumper - Sticker Computer Science , Item 6 in his excellent book , More Programming Pearls : Confessions of a Coder ( Addison - Wesley , 1988 ) .
It is my hope that these maxims provide a concise summary of the key points of API design , in easily digestible form :
All programmers are API designers .
Good programs are modular , and intermodular boundaries define APIs .
Good modules get reused .

APIs can be among your greatest assets or liabilities .
Good APIs create long - term customers ; bad ones create long - term support nightmares .
Public APIs , like diamonds , are forever .
You have one chance to get it right so give it your best .
APIs should be easy to use and hard to misuse .
It should be easy to do simple things ; possible to do complex things ; and impossible , or at least difficult , to do wrong things .
APIs should be self - documenting :
It should rarely require documentation to read code written to a good API .
In fact , it should rarely require documentation to write it .
When designing an API , first gather requirements — with a healthy degree of skepticism .
People often provide solutions ; it 's your job to ferret out the underlying problems and find the best solutions .
Structure requirements as use - cases : they are the yardstick against which you 'll measure your API .
Early drafts of APIs should be short , typically one page with class and method signatures and one - line descriptions .
This makes it easy to restructure the API when you do n't get it right the first time .
Code the use - cases against your API before you implement it , even before you specify it properly .
This will save you from implementing , or even specifying , a fundamentally broken API .
Maintain the code for uses - cases as the API evolves .
Not only will this protect you from rude surprises , but the resulting code will become the examples for the API , the basis for tutorials and tests .
Example code should be exemplary .
If an API is used widely , its examples will be the archetypes for thousands of programs .
Any mistakes will come back to haunt you a thousand fold .
You can't please everyone so aim to displease everyone equally .
Most APIs are overconstrained .
Expect API - design mistakes due to failures of imagination .
You can't reasonably hope to imagine everything that everyone will do with an API , or how it will interact with every other part of a system .
API design is not a solitary activity .
Show your design to as many people as you can , and take their feedback seriously .
Possibilities that elude your imagination may be clear to others .
Avoid fixed limits on input sizes .
They limit usefulness and hasten obsolescence .
Names matter .
Strive for intelligibility , consistency , and symmetry .
Every API is a little language , and people must learn to read and write it .
If you get an API right , code will read like prose .
If it 's hard to find good names , go back to the drawing board .
Do n't be afraid to split or merge an API , or embed it in a more general setting .
If names start falling into place , you 're on the right track .
When in doubt , leave it out .
If there is a fundamental theorem of API design , this is it .
It applies equally to functionality , classes , methods , and parameters .
Every facet of an API should be as small as possible , but no smaller .
You can always add things later , but you can't take them away .
Minimizing conceptual weight is more important than class - or method - count .
Keep APIs free of implementations details .
They confuse users and inhibit the flexibility to evolve .
It is n't always obvious what 's an implementation detail :
Be wary of overspecification .
Minimize mutability .
Immutable objects are simple , thread - safe , and freely sharable .
Documentation matters .
No matter how good an API , it wo n't get used without good documentation .
Document every exported API element : every class , method , field , and parameter .
Consider the performance consequences of API design decisions , but do n't warp an API to achieve performance gains .
Luckily , good APIs typically lend themselves to fast implementations .
When in Rome , do as the Romans do .
APIs must coexist peacefully with the platform , so do what is customary .
It is almost always wrong to â€œtransliterateâ€ an API from one platform to another .
Minimize accessibility ; when in doubt , make it private .
This simplifies APIs and reduces coupling .
Subclass only if you can say with a straight face that every instance of the subclass is an instance of the superclass .
Exposed classes should never subclass just to reuse implementation code .
Design and document for inheritance or else prohibit it .
This documentation takes the form of selfuse patterns : how methods in a class use one another .
Without it , safe subclassing is impossible .
Do n't make the client do anything the library could do .
Violating this rule leads to boilerplate code in the client , which is annoying and error - prone .
Obey the principle of least astonishment .
Every method should do the least surprising thing it could , given its name .
If a method does n't do what users think it will , bugs will result .
Fail fast .
The sooner you report a bug , the less damage it will do .
Compile - time is best .
If you must fail at run-time , do it as soon as possible .
Provide programmatic access to all data available in string form .
Otherwise , programmers will be forced to parse strings , which is painful .
Worse , the string forms will turn into de facto APIs .
Overload with care .
If the behaviors of two methods differ , it 's better to give them different names .
Use the right data type for the job .
For example , do n't use string if there is a more appropriate type .
Use consistent parameter ordering across methods .
Otherwise , programmers will get it backwards .
Avoid long parameter lists , especially those with multiple consecutive parameters of the same type .
Avoid return values that demand exceptional processing .
Clients will forget to write the specialcase code , leading to bugs .
For example , return zero - length arrays or collections rather than nulls .
Throw exceptions only to indicate exceptional conditions .
Otherwise , clients will be forced to use exceptions for normal flow control , leading to programs that are hard to read , buggy , or slow .
Throw unchecked exceptions unless clients can realistically recover from the failure .
API design is an art , not a science .
Strive for beauty , and trust your gut .
Do not adhere slavishly to the above heuristics , but violate them only infrequently and with good reason .

Few things in life offer more visceral proof of the power of physics than a karate chop .
Punch a brick with your bare hand , and if you are untutored in the martial arts , you may break a finger .
Punch it with the proper force , momentum , and positioning , and you ’ll break the brick instead .
“ Amazingly , there are no tricks involved , ” says Michael Feld , a physicist at MIT .
“ What you have here is one of the most efficient human movements ever conceived . ”
In the late 1970s , when Feld was earning a brown belt in karate , his instructor , Ronald McNair , also happened to be his physics student .
( McNair died in 1986 while working as a scientist - astronaut aboard the space shuttle Challenger . )
The secret to karate , both men agreed , lies in the speed and focus of the strike .
But just how fast does a karate punch move ?
To find out , they joined with undergraduate Stephen Wilk and set up a strobe light that flashed either 60 or 120 times per second .
Then they photographed McNair and others throwing kicks and punches and counted how many times the strobe flashed until the foot or fist hit its target .
Feld and McNair found that beginning students can throw a karate chop at about 20 feet per second , just enough to break a one - inch board .
But a black belt like McNair could chop at 46 feet per second .
Hitting a piece of wood at that speed , a 11/2 - pound hand can deliver a wallop of up to 2,800 newtons ( one newton is roughly equal to the force exerted by the weight of an apple ) .
Splitting a typical concrete slab 11 / 2 inches thick actually takes less , about 1,900 newtons .
Of course , brute strength is not the only requirement for breaking concrete blocks — the nature of the chop is also important .
Karate students must learn that for a strike to have maximum momentum , it must have a follow - through ; golf and tennis players follow through with their swings for the same reason .
To understand how follow - through works , Jearl Walker , a former tae kwon do student who now teaches physics at Cleveland State University , set up a study much like Feld ’s and McNair’s .
A well - thrown fist , he found , reaches its maximum velocity when the arm is about 80 percent extended .
“ That ’s exactly what my tae kwon do master had taught me , ” Walker says .
“ You focus your punch in your imagination so that it terminates inside your opponent ’s body , rather than on the surface .
To deliver the maximum power , you want to make contact before the slowdown begins . ”
What happens after contact is also very important .
All materials are at least slightly elastic :
Whack them in the right spot and they will start to oscillate .
“ If you tweak a rubber band it goes up and down , and the same is true if you tweak a board or a brick with a much greater force , ” Feld says .
“ When they reach their elastic limits , they start to yield .
In other words , they break . ”
Fortunately for us , reaching the equivalent limit in the body ’s bones is no easy matter .
Feld says bone can withstand 40 times as much force as concrete , and a cylinder of bone less than an inch in diameter and 21/3 inches long can withstand a force of 25,000 newtons .
Hands and feet can take even more abuse , because skin , muscles , ligaments , tendons , and cartilage absorb a great deal of impact .
A well - kicked foot can absorb about 2,000 times as much force as concrete before breaking .
Feld has never fractured a finger in karate , even though he once broke eight one - inch - thick boards at a time .
If students want to break boards , they have to not only increase their speed and improve their aim but also toughen up their hands and feet by striking them against a post wrapped in foam and canvas .

Jay sez , " A new bottled water company is selling NY tap water in bottles and filling up people 's empties as a way of spreading the word that tap is good , it 's better for the environment than shipping bottles in from Fiji , it 's fun , it 's blablabla .
You get the idea . "
For my money , NYC tap water is delicious .
Year after year , bottled water companies have told us that their water was somehow healthier or better for us than our own water .
They spent billions of dollars on marketing to make us believe that we needed exotic water , in sleek packaging , from far away Arctic glaciers , tropical islands , and European volcanoes .
We fell for the fancy marketing gimmicks , too , and the brands we drank started to become status symbols .
But we 're New Yorkers and are ready for an honest change .

BELFAST , Maine ( CNN ) --
As an account manager for credit card giant MBNA , Cate Colombo spent four years speaking to customers , answering questions about interest rates and waiving late fees .
Cate Colombo and Kathy Elllingwood say they were told to use agressive selling tactics to push cash advances .
Kathy Ellingwood did the same .
She lasted only a year and a half before quitting this summer .
The women worked in different departments at the sprawling customer call center in Belfast , Maine , yet they share similar stories about aggressive selling tactics they claim they were told to use to push cash advances , sometimes getting customers to max out their credit cards .
" Every customer who calls in is a mark .
It 's a great big con , " said Colombo , who estimates that she alone sold almost a quarter of a billion dollars in the four years she worked for MBNA before it was bought in 2005 by Bank of America .
Americans now carry $ 850 billion in credit card debt .
Consumer groups are lobbying Congress to include better protection for credit card holders , demanding legislation to prevent what they call unjustified interest charges and deceptive practices , especially in light of the massive financial bailout now being considered .
Colombo and Ellingwood said that within seconds of a customer 's call , they would have his or her entire credit history on screen , and they were trained what to say to sell people money .
Ex - bank employees spill secrets »
" I would say 90 percent of the time , people were pragmatic .
They would say , ' I do n't need $ 100,000 , ' and we would find a way to convince them they needed the money , " Ellingwood recalled .
She said they would look for trigger words like , " I'm in financial difficulty " or " I can't make my payments . "
Colombo said other triggers were , " I have to send my son to college .
My car is not running .
I 'm moving . "
Colombo said some people even asked about getting a $ 50,000 cash advance -- usually at zero percent interest -- for a down payment on a house .
And although that 's illegal , the former employees say they were trained to get around it by saying , " I can not give you money to use as a down - payment on a home .
However , what I can do is , I can deposit some money into your checking account , and once it 's there , the funds are there , it 's yours to do with what you please . "
Bank of America told CNN , " Only customers in good standing and with good payment history are able to access cash up to available credit line . "
But Colombo and Ellingwood say they were told to sell hard to everyone .
Once the customer agreed , they say , they would speed through intricate disclosure notices .
Among the details , how a zero - percent or low interest rate could convert to as much as 28 percent if a payment was even a day late .
" You 're basically looking at people who need the money most , who may not be able to afford it , " Ellingwood said .
Colombo remembers having a conversation with one man in his 90s .
" He had all this available credit , maybe $ 100,000 .
I have my manager screaming , ' Colombo , you need to sell .
You need to sell .
You need to sell , ' " she said .
Bank of America calls its terms " clear and transparent . "
But credit card lending practices have now gotten the attention of Congress .
Consumer groups support a bill to curb what they call predatory lending .
The American Banking Association opposes it , saying , " Consumers have benefited from a competitive marketplace that allows for pricing based upon risk . "
Americans for Fairness in Lending , which put CNN in touch with Colombo and Ellingwood , wants deceptive credit card practices included in the financial bailout legislation that is now before Congress .
Its director , Jim Campen , said , " We have n't identified any illegal practices .
What we 've seen are practices that are highly unethical .
It 's extraordinarily common . "
The two women say their conversations were monitored , and the more they sold , the bigger their salaries .
" If you did n't do it , you got yanked off the phone , " Colombo said .
She said a manager once yelled , " You let your team down .
You let the bank down .
You let the stockholders down ! "
Bank of America said it does not talk about individual cases but calls the allegations by the former employees " incorrect . "
Spokeswoman Betty Reiss said , " Our call center associates are focused on serving customer financial needs and responding to questions about their accounts . "
But Colombo said her performance reviews -- which she provided to CNN -- tell a slightly different story about selling tactics .
In one , she is told by supervisors to be more aggressive : " You can not sell what you do n't offer . "
Another reads , " Understand the importance of selling at the highest possible rate . "
CNN asked whether the customer call center in Belfast was perhaps operating independently ; both women shook their heads and described an environment in which call centers across the country would compete with one another .
" I worked four 10 - hour shifts .
The goal was to make $ 25,000 an hour , which is $ 250,000 a day , which is $ 4 million a month , " Colombo said .
Although Colombo does not know whether the practices were widely known at Bank of America headquarters in Delaware , she said this about her immediate managers : " Everyone on that level knew what we were doing .
We were being told to do what we did . "
Do the women feel guilty about what they did ?
" Yes , without question , " Colombo said .
" Absolutely , " Ellingwood added .
Americans for Fairness in Lending said it wants the Senate to ensure that consumers are protected from what it describes as the deceptive practices of many of the same financial institutions likely to benefit from the $ 700 billion bailout .
The Credit Card Bill of Rights passed the House this week .
But it 's opposed by the banking industry and the White House , which said it would lead to less access to credit and higher interest rates for consumers .
For its part , Bank of America would not talk about individual cases or provide a copy of the disclosures that its accounts managers read to customers over the phone .
It also refused to answer questions about training procedures for account managers at call centers across the U.S .
However , the spokeswoman said the bank " has nothing to gain by extending credit to people who do not have the ability to pay back . "

BOSTON - More than half of 26,000 students across 70 colleges and universities who completed a survey on suicidal experiences reported having at least one episode of suicidal thinking at some point in their lives .
Furthermore , 15 percent of students surveyed reported having seriously considered attempting suicide and more than 5 percent reported making a suicide attempt at least once in their lifetime .
Presenting Sunday at the 116th Annual Convention of the American Psychological Association , psychologist David J. Drum , PhD , and co-authors at the University of Texas at Austin reported their findings from a Web - based survey conducted by the National Research Consortium of Counseling Centers in Higher Education .
The survey was administered in the spring of 2006 and gathered information about a range of suicidal thoughts and behaviors among college students .
The survey was reviewed by the participating campus counseling directors as well as two experts in suicidology .
Six percent of undergraduates and 4 percent of graduate students reported seriously considering suicide within the 12 months prior to answering the survey .
Therefore , the researchers posit , at an average college with 18,000 undergraduate students , some 1,080 undergraduates will seriously contemplate taking their lives at least once within a single year .
Approximately two - thirds of those who contemplate suicide will do so more than once in a 12 - month period .
The majority of students described their typical episode of suicidal thinking as intense and brief , with more than half the episodes lasting one day or less .
The researchers found that , for a variety of reasons , more than half of students who experienced a recent suicidal crisis did not seek professional help or tell anyone about their suicidal thoughts .
The researchers used separate samples of undergraduate and graduate students .
College sizes ranged from 820 to 58,156 students , with 17,752 being the average .
For the 15,010 undergraduates , 62 percent were female and 38 percent were percent male .
Seventy - nine percent were white and 21 percent were minorities .
Ninety - five percent identified themselves as heterosexual and 5 percent identified as bisexual , gay or undecided .
The average age was 22 .
For the 11,441 graduates , 60 percent were female and 40 percent were male .
Seventy - two percent were white and 28 percent were minorities .
Ninety - four percent identified themselves as heterosexual and 6 percent identified as bisexual , gay or undecided .
The average age was 30 .
Both undergraduate and graduate students gave these reasons for their suicidal thinking , in the following order : ( 1 ) wanting relief from emotional or physical pain ; ( 2 ) problems with romantic relationships ; ( 3 ) the desire to end their life ; and ( 4 ) problems with school or academics .
Fourteen percent of undergraduates and 8 percent of graduate students who seriously considered attempting suicide in the previous 12 months made a suicide attempt .
Nineteen percent of undergraduate attempters and 28 percent of graduate student attempters required medical attention .
Half of attempters reported overdosing on drugs as their method , said the authors .
From the survey , the authors found that suicidal thoughts are a frequently recurring experience akin to substance abuse , depression and eating disorders .
They also found that relying solely upon the current treatment model , which identifies and helps students who are in crisis , is insufficient for addressing reducing all forms of suicide behavior on college campuses .
The authors suggest a new model for dealing with the problem of student suicidal tendencies in order to address the entire continuum of suicidal thoughts and behaviors .
By focusing on suicidal thoughts and behaviors as the problem , rather than looking only at students in crisis , interventions can be delivered at multiple points , they said .
Furthermore , information from the survey can help match students who are at risk or who have already experienced suicidal thoughts and behaviors with the appropriate treatment .
This will reduce the numbers of students entering the suicide continuum in the first place as well as reduce the progression from thoughts to attempts , they said .
With growing levels of distress among college students and diminishing resources to handle the consequences , suicide prevention needs to involve a cross section of campus personnel - administrators , student leaders , advisers , faculty , parents , counselors - and not just involve the suicidal student and the few mental health professionals available .
" This would reduce the percentage of students who engage in suicidal thinking , who contemplate how to make an attempt and who continue to make attempts " said Drum .

Last week , Tarek ibn Ziyad Academy ( TiZA ) and the Minnesota Department of Education appeared to reach an understanding in the controversy over whether Islam is being promoted at this public school .
But behind the scenes , a storm may be brewing .
TiZA officials have " taken a confrontational road " in discussions with the department , according to Deputy MDE Commissioner Chas Anderson , the department 's No. 2 official .
Anderson says that the two sides have not yet reached an agreement on one key issue and that MDE will be closely monitoring TiZA 's performance in future months .
TiZA is a K - 8 charter school in Inver Grove Heights , financed by taxpayers .
Its students have scored well on standardized tests .
But like all public schools , it may not encourage or endorse religion , or favor one religion over another .
A number of facts raise questions about TiZA on this score .
Its executive director , Asad Zaman , is an imam , or Muslim religious leader .
The school shares a building with a mosque and the Minnesota chapter of the Muslim American Society , which the Chicago Tribune has described as the American branch of the Muslim Brotherhood -- " the world 's most influential Islamic fundamentalist group . "
Most of TiZA 's students are Muslim , many from low - income immigrant families .
The school breaks daily for prayer , its cafeteria serves halal food ( permissible under Islamic law ) , and Arabic is a required subject .
School buses do not leave until after - school Muslim Studies classes , which many students attend , have ended for the day .
Last spring , MDE opened an investigation after press reports raised questions about whether TiZA has been blurring the church / state line .
The investigation focused on the school 's 30 - minute Friday communal prayer event , among other issues .
The service -- led by adults -- has been conducted on school premises , and both students and teachers have attended .
In a report issued in May , the MDE concluded that TiZA 's Friday prayer event violated the law and since then has been working with the school to make changes .
" We wanted TiZA to do Friday prayers the way all other public schools " handle similar activities -- " as release time , under state law , " said Anderson .
In a release - time arrangement , students move off - site for religious activities .
But TiZA said no , according to Anderson .
Instead , the school will continue to hold Friday prayer on its premises .
Students will lead prayer and staff will be present only " to ensure student safety , " said Zaman in a letter to the MDE .
In a response to Zaman 's letter , Anderson wrote complaining of what she called the " defensive tone " of the letter in which he set forth the school 's intentions .
" It is inaccurate for TiZA to imply that MDE 's legal concerns regarding the school 's operations ... were unfounded , " she wrote , " and it is of utmost importance that TiZA take seriously its responsibility to comply with applicable state and federal laws . "
TiZA now says it will shorten Friday prayers -- whose length has been a potential concern because of instructional time requirements -- though it has not said by how much .
MDE has agreed that TiZA 's new arrangement on after - school bus transportation will bring the school into legal compliance on that issue .
But the department is highly skeptical that TiZA 's proposed arrangement for on - site , student - led Friday prayers will work .
Track the situation closely
We are " very troubled by it , " said Anderson in an interview .
" This may look good on paper .
But how can you have an assembly with older students in charge of younger students ? " she said .
MDE plans to track the situation closely and conduct site visits .
Asked to respond to MDE 's continuing concerns , the school issued a statement through spokesman Blois Olson saying : " TiZA Academy has reached agreement with the Department of Education ... and will continue to work with the department to ensure that we continue to be in compliance with all state and federal laws . "
Ofcom has finally made a decision on Sky's Picnic – the company 's plan to swap its current digital terrestrial channels for a mix of premium subscription channels – giving its agreement , but only if BSkyB makes wholesale changes .
Sky recently insisted that it was putting its Picnic planning in mothballs due to the delay in Ofcom 's decision on the matter – and it will not be considered a coincidence that that decision has now been reached .
However , far from opening the gates for Sky , the communications watchdog has insisted on a number of conditions to okay the plan , including making Sky sell its channels wholesale to other broadcasters for a reasonable cost .
Wholesale changes
" We are further consulting on a proposal to address our concerns by requiring Sky to wholesale premium channels on regulated terms , " said Ofcom in its official verdict .
" In the light of these views we reach the view in this document that it is highly unlikely that any competitor would be able to compete effectively with Picnic in the absence of a wholesale arrangement . "
The terms of that wholesale agreement could fundamentally change the UK broadcast market if Sky gives the go - ahead .
Ofcom insists on a ' wholesale must - offer arrangement , under which Sky would be required to supply its premium sports and movies channels on a suitable wholesale basis which is commercially viable , in particular , subject to certain conditions in relation to wholesale pricing .'
What do the wholesale changes mean ?
What this actually means is that Sky would have to offer its premium channels to ALL of its competitors ( Virgin Media for instance ) at a price that would allow those competitors to compete with Sky in price terms .
Competing retailers of pay TV services could obtain Sky's Core Premium channels on a wholesale basis .
It was not restricted to DTT but would apply in respect of pay TV platforms over all distribution technologies ( i.e. cable , DSat , DTT and IPTV ) .
It would offer a sufficient margin and certainty of supply so that competing retailers could compete effectively with Sky .
The relevant Sky channels could be received by STBs [ set top boxes ] using Nagra CA ( in excess of one million existing STBs ) as well as by Picnic STBs … "
Dominate pay television
Ofcom explained its conditions by pointing out that , without a wholesale deal in place , Sky could effectively dominate subscription based pay television on two of the three main viewing platforms – namely satellite and DTT , with only cable as a rival .
" If , as a result of Sky 's position in the wholesale provision of sports and movies channels , the proposal was to lead instead to Sky becoming the main provider of pay TV services on DTT as well as satellite , this in turn might lead to be the source of significant concern and potential consumer detriment in the long term , " adds the report .
" In the context of our pay TV investigation , we are consulting on a view that a wholesale must - offer arrangement , under which Sky would be obliged to supply its Core Premium channels on a suitable wholesale basis , would be the most appropriate solution to the competition concerns raised .
This would seek to create an environment to promote fair and effective competition . "
We have contacted Sky for its response – on what could be a huge day for British broadcasting .
Enlarge The ( Louisville ) Courier - Journal file photo Nova Simpson , 43 , said last year she rides four buses in a one - hour round - trip journey to the Kroger on West Broadway from her home near Cane Run Road .
The Transit Authority of River City in Louisville is bypassing people at bus stops on some routes because of overcrowding .
MASS TRANSIT BOOM MASS TRANSIT BOOM Cash - strapped public transit systems are cutting services and raising fares even as more Americans ditch their gas - guzzling cars for trains and buses , a survey of transit agencies out Tuesday finds .
People took 2.8 billion rides on public transit from April through June , up 5.2 % over that period last year , reports the American Public Transportation Association ( APTA ) , which represents transit agencies .
The increase marks the highest ridership for that period in half a century , says William Millar , APTA president .
" We 're seeing record ridership , but it is a double - edged sword , " he says .
" We 're going to see more ( fare ) increases and more service cuts at a time when the nation is trying to encourage people to use public transit . "
Of the 115 agencies that responded , 61 % are considering fare hikes to make up for budget shortfalls , while 35 % say they may cut services .
Only about one - third of costs are covered by fares , APTA says , so transit agencies rely in part on public funding .
Funds tied to the health of the economy , such as sales taxes , have been drying up , Millar says .
Gasoline prices also are hurting providers .
" We 've fought for years to have more people using mass transportation to reduce pollution and reliance on foreign oil , " says Rod Diridon Sr. , executive director of the Mineta Transportation Institute at San Jose State University .
" Now we have the market … but we do n't have the capital funding . "
Although 42 % of transit agencies increased frequency of service on existing routes in the past year , some have enacted or proposed service cuts or fare hikes : • The Greater Cleveland Regional Transit Authority proposed a 50 - cent fuel surcharge on fares and a 12 % cut in services because diesel prices are up and funding from a local sales tax is down , says general manager Joe Calabrese .
Riders protested the proposal , and Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland asked if money can be found elsewhere .
A decision will be made later this month .
" We understand cutting back is absolutely the wrong thing to do , " Calabrese says .
" We are also under an obligation to have a balanced budget . " • The Transit Authority of River City ( TARC ) in Louisville is bypassing people at bus stops on some routes because of overcrowding , says spokeswoman Nina Walfoort .
The APTA survey says 39 % of transit agencies have turned passengers away .
To make up for high diesel costs and reduced revenue from a local occupational tax , the agency raised fares 25 cents to $ 1.50 on July 1 and cut the frequency of some buses .
" We 're just tapped out right now , " she says .

The Rwandan government has called for the prosecution of a number of senior French politicians over the 1994 genocide of hundreds of thousands of Tutsis , after releasing a report from an official commission that accuses the former president François Mitterrand and more than 30 senior French officials of aiding the killers .
A two - year investigation by the commission also accuses French forces in Rwanda of crimes against humanity and of using a UN - sanctioned haven for refugees to help those responsible for the 100 days of mass slaughter to escape justice .
The 500 - page report is the latest salvo in a bitter struggle between France and Rwanda 's Tutsi leadership to pin responsibility for the genocide on each other .
Two years ago a prominent French judge accused Paul Kagame , Rwanda 's president today but in 1994 the leader of Tutsi rebels fighting the Hutu government , of ordering the assassination of the then president , Juvenal Habyarimana , which kick - started the killing .
The accusation outraged Kagame , whose Rwandan Patriotic Front went on to defeat the Hutu extremist regime that organised the murder of Tutsis .
The Rwandan commission named 13 French political leaders - including Mitterrand , who died in 1996 ; the former prime ministers Edouard Balladur and Dominique de Villepin ; and former foreign ministers Alain Juppe and Hubert Védrine - it says played a role in arming Hutu extremists .
It says they also helped cover up Paris 's role .
" The French support was of a political , military , diplomatic and logistic nature , " the report said .
It cites official papers abandoned by the defeated Hutu regime that investigators said proved France made large weapons shipments to the former Rwandan army and trained members of the Interahamwe militias who carried out the genocide .
The report also details how French soldiers were involved in frontline operations against Kagame 's forces .
In some cases they commanded artillery and flew helicopter gunships .
It accuses some of those soldiers of crimes .
" French forces directly assassinated Tutsis and Hutus accused of hiding Tutsis ... French forces committed several rapes on Tutsi survivors , " the report said .
The Rwandan commission heard from Hutu former soldiers who said they had served with French soldiers and journalists .
Among the witnesses was Isidore Nzeyimana , a former military instructor , who told the commission he worked with French officers who trained members of the Interahamwe .
The Rwandan justice ministry said yesterday : " [ We ask ] authorities to undertake all necessary actions to bring the accused French political and military leaders to answer for their acts before justice . "
The French foreign ministry said it would not respond until it had read the report .
Earlier this year the foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , denied French complicity in the genocide but said political errors were made .
The investigation was launched in response to an inquiry by France 's leading anti-terrorism judge , Jean - Louis Bruguière , who accused Kagame of responsibility for the genocide by ordering Habyarimana 's assassination and unleashing revenge killings against Tutsis .
Bruguière , who was unable to indict Kagame because he is a head of state , issued arrest warrants for nine of the Rwandan president 's closest aides .
However , the judge 's accusations are contentious because plans for the genocide were already well laid before they took place .
He has also been criticised for taking evidence from Hutu extremists .
Backstory
The 1990 invasion of Rwanda by Tutsi exiles living in Uganda laid the ground for the genocide of an estimated 800,000 Tutsis four years later .
France poured in weaponry , troops and military advisers to keep the Tutsi rebels at bay .
Hutu extremist politicians whipped up a campaign against Rwanda 's minority Tutsi population , accusing them of supporting the rebels and trying to take power .
The assassination of President Juvenal Habyarimana , probably by Hutu extremists , unleashed the planned mass killing of Tutsis that quickly spread across the country , led by the Interahamwe militia .
The killing lasted 100 days before the Tutsi rebel Rwandan Patriotic Front finally seized power .

After viewing it live and twice on TV Ross weighs in on Palin 's speech :
Instead of opening new vistas for conservative politics , it reinforced the perception - which is unfair , but not all that unfair - that the only thing John McCain 's GOP has to offer on the domestic front is a big yes to drilling , an end to earmarks , and a big no to Obama 's tax increases .
It 's possible that this is enough of a message to win this Presidential election ; it 's definitely not enough of a message to rebuild the GOP over the long haul .
Sarah Palin gave the kind of speech she had to give , and good for her .
But I hope she has some other kinds of speeches in her .
I feel for Ross as I feel for serious conservative foreign policy thinkers right now .
This pick is so unserious in so many ways it is as much an insult to intelligent conservatives as it is to the rest of the country .
And I have one nagging question : we are told she is a reformer .
Can anyone tell me anything she has actually reformed ?
Yes , she won against an aging , decrepit corrupt Republican party establishment on populist boilerplate .
But this was simply in her own self - interest as a rising Pentecostalist politician .
Yes , she championed new ethical standards for pols - but her record in that matter is no different than Obama's , only he did it on a national stage .
She then gave everyone in the state a big check from oil revenues .
I could do that .
So could you .
Is that it ?
The more I reflect on this decision by McCain , the more insane and reckless and shallow it gets .
I 've always respected McCain , even when I disagreed with him .
I find it very hard to square that with this decision .

French - Colombian politician Ingrid Betancourt and 14 other hostages have been freed after rebels holding them were tricked into handing them over .
Colombian soldiers - apparently posing as members of a non-government organisation - flew them to freedom in a helicopter .
Ms Betancourt said : " This is a miracle .
There is no historical precedent for such a perfect operation . "
Ms Betancourt was held by the left - wing Farc rebels for more than six years .
When the head of the operation to free the hostages told them they were free , " the helicopter almost fell from the sky because we all jumped , shouted , cried and embraced , " Ms Betancourt said .
" We could n't believe it , " she added .
Political aspiration
The Farc has been fighting to overthrow the Colombian government for 40 years , and Ms Betancourt was their highest profile captive .
Also released were three Americans and 11 members of the Colombian security forces , all said to be in relatively good health .
President Alvaro Uribe congratulated the army on the operation , in which no shots were fired , and urged Farc to release its remaining hostages and seek peace .

Born on 25 December 1961 Grows up in Paris 1989 : Returns to Colombia 1994 : Elected to lower house 1998 : Becomes a senator 2002 : Kidnapped by Farc rebels
Rescue deals Farc a blow
In pictures : Hostages freed Profile : Ingrid Betancourt A pale Ms Betancourt smiled as she emerged with other hostages from a military plane in the Colombian capital , Bogota , to be greeted by her mother and husband .
She appealed to Farc to free the other hostages and make peace .
She thanked Mr Uribe , against whom she was running as a presidential candidate when she was kidnapped , and said he " has been a very good president " .
" I continue to aspire to serve Colombia as president , " she said .
French President Nicolas Sarkozy , who had made the rescue of Ms Betancourt a foreign policy priority , was joined by her family at his residence , the Elysee Palace in Paris .
The freed hostage 's son , Lorenzo Delloye - Betancourt , told the news conference it was " the best moment of my life " .
His sister Melanie said it was like " emerging from a bad dream " .
The siblings are flying to Colombia to be reunited with their 46 - year - old mother .
Video pictures released last November had shown Ms Betancourt looking gaunt and frail .
Accounts from freed hostages that she was in danger of dying had heightened the sense of urgency surrounding her fate .
Naked and blindfolded
Also released were three US defence department contract workers who were captured after their light aircraft crashed in the Colombian jungle in 2003 .
The trio - Marc Gonsalves , Thomas Howes and Keith Stansell - have now arrived back in San Antonio , Texas , where they will undergo medical tests and be reunited with their families .

The 11 members of the Colombian security forces who were released had been captured in various rebel attacks .
Colombian Defence Minister Juan Manuel Santos said the Farc rebels had been tricked into handing over the hostages by soldiers posing as members of a fictitious non-government organisation that supposedly would fly the captives to a camp to meet rebel leader Alfonso Cano .
" The helicopters , which in reality were from the army , picked up the hostages in Guaviare and flew them to freedom , " he said .
Intelligence agents had infiltrated the guerrilla ranks and duped the local commander in charge of the hostages , alias Cesar , the defence minister said .
Cesar and another rebel who boarded the helicopter had been quickly overpowered and would now face justice , he added .
' Without a scratch '
Ms Betancourt later told a press conference she at first had had no idea she was being rescued until she saw her captor naked and blindfolded on the floor of the aircraft .

Absolutely safe and sound , without a scratch . "
The US ambassador to Colombia , William Brownfield , said there had been " close co-operation " from the Americans , including sharing of intelligence , equipment and training advice .
World leaders welcomed the news , and celebrations erupted on the streets of Colombian cities as crowds hailed the jungle rescue in a country plagued for decades by kidnappings .
The BBC's Jeremy McDermott in Medellin says the successful operation by Colombian security forces is a political and military coup for the country 's government .
The released American hostages have flown home
He adds that it is a major blow to the Farc , which had hoped to exchange some 60 political hostages for hundreds of rebels held by the Colombian government , and has now lost a powerful negotiating tool with Ms Betancourt 's rescue .
The Farc still holds more than 40 high - profile hostages , among up to 700 other captives .
Ms Betancourt has dual citizenship as the result of marriage to a French diplomat - since dissolved - which produced her two children , who worked hard to keep her captivity in the spotlight .
The politician was kidnapped in February 2002 while campaigning in territory controlled by the Farc .

What are these ?
The strange case of Netshare , the application that turns the iPhone into a modem - whenever it exists - became stranger still over the weekend , when it appeared and disappeared for a second time in the iPhone App Store .
Apple and AT&T ( widely assumed to be the bad guy here ) remained tight - lipped , leaving the world trying to figure out the significance of the strange and brief manifestations .
Once could have been a mistake , but twice ?
Netshare was certainly visible in the App Store during its second materialisation on Friday evening UK , where it could be purchased for £ 5.99 ( $ 9.99 US , standard crap deal , do n't get us started ) .
And it works - but in operation it is a way off of the ease of use and simplicity of your dull , old - style non -3 - Jesus phone hung off your Mac via Bluetooth . *
That is not the fault of the software 's developer , Nullriver , and it is not ( entirely ) the fault of AT&T or of Reg HQ 's local iPhone purveyor O2 .
It is the fault of Apple for borking the iPhone 's Bluetooth stack , and of network providers whose ' all you can eat ' deals will only work so long as customers do n't get into the habit of using them .
When it exists , Netshare is a " tethering " application .
In situations where you can't get onto a wifi network you can create a network between your computer and your iPhone , then the computer can use the phone 's data connection for Internet browsing .
It 's not exactly single click setup ( numerous walk - throughs have been published , the MacRumors one will give you an idea ) , but it 's something that could come in handy in circumstances where you do n't have anything else .
There are other iPhone applications that do the same job as Netshare , but they require a jailbroken phone .
Netshare 's claim to fame is that it's the first ' official ' ( oh yes it is - we have the Apple receipt ) app that will work with a normal handset .
In the absence of official comment from the Cupertino Curia , the various setup and use speed bumps provide one possible explanation for why the app appeared in the App Store , and why it might make future manifestations ( Nullriver says it did n't violate any agreements , and is hopeful it will return ) .
The networks ( let 's not just beat up AT&T ) do n't want great swarms of customers setting up their iPhones as wireless base stations and running their computers off them all the time , so they 're agin anything that could be imagined to facilitate this .
But it 's a stretch to imagine Netshare doing this - there 's some hocus pocus to setup , in order to work it has to fight against several aspects of the iPhone 's design ( the borked Bluetooth being one of them ) , and hey - if you 're in range of all you can eat wifi , what on earth are you doing using 3G instead ?
In most cases the wifi is going to be a lot faster .
So is this why it appears in the App Store ?
Only people who 're OK about hand - tooling their network settings are likely to use it , the connection will time out or the battery will get sucked dry , and this one app is not about to bring the networks to their knees .
Maybe at least somebody at Apple thinks this , but every time they post Netshare , the networks phone them up and shriek at them ?
* Macs these days get on famously over Bluetooth with most mobile phones , pairing with them , syncing data with them and even browsing the web with them .
Granted , the latter can involve some ferreting for scripts and incantations from the sainted Ross Barkman , but once it 's set up you need n't bother even taking your phone out of your pocket .
For two or three years now The Register has been using Novamedia 's launch2net , which for money , does the incantations for you most efficiently .
The maiming of the iPhone 's Bluetooth , on the other hand , is so blatantly cynical it 's almost funny .
Try to Bluetooth pair an iPhone with a Mac and you 'll get a message saying , effectively , ' nothing going on with this device mate , I 'd give up if I were you . '
For everybody else 's phone , wireless syncing , for the iPhone , it 's a cable with the iPhone at one end and the iTunes store trying to suck up your money at other .
Go figure . ®

Here it is fan - boys , this is a photo we 've waited patiently to see for what seems like an eternity .
This photo of the threesome of new muscle cars from Detroit is the first time the 2010 Chevy Camaro RS , a 2009 Ford Mustang CS and a 2008 Dodge Challenger SRT8 have all been captured in the same photo .
Yes , we traveled a great distance , risked a great deal and received quite a mouthful from one snarling PR person in order to bring you this first shot of the trio .
Although well worth it , at least one staffer on site was n't as happy to have a picture of Chevy 's new muscle car taken as we'd hoped he would be .
Whatever .
Credit Ford and Dodge for being pleased as punch to welcome back the Camaro to the muscle car war block in the best way they know how — by letting us rev the engines of their latest entries hard outside San Diego 's Hard Rock Hotel .
They would have preferred to do a burnout , but there were too many law enforcement officers around .
Check back later on tonight for the full story , complete with video as we show just how hot these muscle car wars are getting !
Many thanks to the Craig from Streetfire , Garage419 and Ned Hepburn !

An artificial meteorite designed by the European Space Agency has shown that traces of life in a martian meteorite could survive the violent heat and shock of entry into the Earth ’s atmosphere .
The experiment ’s results also suggest that meteorite hunters should widen their search to include white rocks if we are to find traces of life in martian meteorites .
The STONE - 6 experiment tested whether sedimentary rock samples could withstand the extreme conditions during a descent though the Earth ’s atmosphere where temperatures reached at least 1700 degrees Celsius .
After landing , the samples were transported in protective holders to a laboratory clean - room at ESTEC and examined to see if any traces of life remained .
The results were presented by Dr Frances Westall at the European Planetary Science Congress on September 25th .
The Foton - M3 capsule immediately after landing .
The STONE - 6 rock samples were fixed in the circular positions at the left side of the capsule .
In 1999 , ESA created the first artificial meteorite experiment in space , STONE - 1 , which tested the effects of entry into the Earth ’s atmosphere on samples of igneous and sedimentary rock as well as a simulated sample of martian regolith .
Since then , further STONE experiments have tested the effects on different rock types and biological traces .
During descent , the re-entry capsule reaches a velocity of 7.6 kilometres per second , slightly lower than normal meteorite velocities of 12 - 15 kilometres per second .
Recent missions have gathered compelling evidence for water and sediments on early Mars .
Potential traces of Martian life are more likely to be found in sediments that have been formed in water .
However , although about 39 known meteorites from Mars have been identified , all are basaltic rock - types and no sedimentary meteorites have been found to date .
Dr Westall said , “ The STONE - 6 experiment shows that sedimentary martian meteorites could reach Earth .
The fact that we have n’t found any to date could mean that we need to change the way we hunt for meteorites .
Most meteorites have been found in Antarctica , where their black fusion crust shows up clearly against the white snow .
In this experiment we found that the sedimentary rocks developed a white crust or none at all .
That means that we need to expand our search to white or light - coloured rocks . ”
The STONE - 6 experiment was mounted on a FOTON M3 capsule that was launched from Baikonur on 14th September 2007 .
Two samples of terrestrial sedimentary rock and a control sample of basalt were fixed to the heat - shield of the return capsule , which re-entered the atmosphere on 26th September after 12 days in orbit .
The basalt was lost during re-entry .
However , a sample of 3.5 billion year old volcanic sand containing carbonaceous microfossils and a 370 million year sample of mudstone from the Orkney Islands containing chemical biomarkers both survived .
On examination at ESTEC , the 3.5 billion year old sample of sand from Pilbara in Australia was found to have formed a half - millimetre thick fusion crust that was creamy white in colour .
About half the rock had ablated but the microfossils and carbon survived at depth in the sample .
Approximately 30 percent of the other sediment , a lacustrine sand from the Orkney Islands , also survived , as did some of the biomolecules .
The heat of entry resulted in mineralogical changes in both rocks .
The rocks also transported living organisms , a type of bacteria called Chroococcidiopsis , on the back of the rocks , away from the exposed edge .
Unfortunately the heat of reentry was so high , even with a protective two centimetre - thick rock coating , that the organisms were carbonised .
They died but their cells still remain as “ pompeified ” forms .
Dr Westall said , “ The STONE - 6 experiment suggests that , if martian sedimentary meteorites carry traces of past life , these traces could be safely transported to Earth .
However , the results are more problematic when applied to Panspermia , a theory that proposes living cells could be transported between planets .
STONE - 6 showed at least two centimetres of rock is not sufficient to protect the organisms during entry . ”
GREEN BAY , Wis. – More often than not , when Senator John McCain wraps up a rally or a political event , he will close by telling the audience about Matthew Stanley , a young man from New Hampshire who was killed in Iraq in December , 2006 , whose name is on a black bracelet Mr. McCain has worn since Mr. Stanley ’s mother gave it to him .
But when he wrapped up a big rally with Gov. Sarah Palin at a hockey arena here Thursday night , Mr. McCain closed with a stunning new line .
“ Every once in a while you have an experience that ’s very helpful to put into the right priority what this campaign is all about , ’’ he began , in much the same way he usually begins the Matthew Stanley story .
“ And that just happened to me a few hours ago . ’’
Mr. McCain said that a woman had greeted him at the airport in Wisconsin and handed him an envelope .
“ Then I got back on the bus and I saw this envelope , and the envelope was from Cheryl Lee Patrick from Ladysmith , Wis. , ’’ he said .
“ And on the front of the envelope it says : ‘ To Senator John McCain .
My son , Staff Sgt. Patrick Lee Lybert , K.I.A. June 21 , 2006 , Afghanistan .
And then the note goes on to say : please remember and support our troops in Afghanistan .
God bless you , Cheryl Patrick . ”
“ And then I opened up the envelope , ’’ Mr. McCain said , doing so on stage as a clinking sound was heard over the sound system , with many in the audience of the arena gasping audibly , “ and there was the dog tags . ’’
sudo gem install jscruggs - metric_fu -s http://gems.github.com
I just released version 0.7.6 of metric_fu and there 's all sorts of new stuff :
First , MetricFu is now a Ruby gem on GitHub at : Also , the Flog task can now flog any set of directories you like .
Just put this into your Rakefile : MetricFu::DIRECTORIES_TO_FLOG
= [ ' cms/app ' , ' cms/lib ']
And , the Flog reports are much nicer :
The Flog report generator now looks at a MD5 hash of the files its examining to determine if they files need to be re-Flogged -- which saves time .
The Saikuro report generator can also look at custom directories like so : MetricFu:: SAIKURO_OPTIONS
= { " -- input_directory " => ' " cms / app | cms/ lib " '} MetricFu started its life as a Rails Plugin , but I 'm trying to turn it into a flexible gem that can be used in any Ruby application ( but still have defaults that enable easy use in a Rails project ) .
Eventually I 'd like to create something that could tell you about methods that have high complexity ( Flog and Saikuro scores ) but low test coverage .
But that 's going to be a challenge .
Feel free to help , if you like .
I 'd like to thank Sean Soper for contributing a ton of work to this project .
He 's responsible for the gemification , the new Flog reports , and the MD5 hashing .
And David Chelimsky was nice enough to come over and personally show me around git and GitHub .

Rourke makes comeback in ' Wrestler '
Looking all grown up in a strapless black cocktail dress , Evan Rachel Wood told a Toronto International Film Festival audience that it was her 21st birthday .
The crowd burst into a round of " Happy Birthday . "
The best present she could have received had come over the weekend when " The Wrestler " - a gritty movie about an aging wrestler in which she plays his neglected daughter - was awarded the Venice Film Festival 's highest honor , the Golden Lion .
As hard as it is to imagine Mickey Rourke as fathering the delicately lovely Wood , the two pull it off .
" The Wrestler " is a comeback for Rourke , who took a bow at the Toronto screening .
Director Darren Aronofsky told the audience that before hiring him he heard " a lot of baloney " about how problematic Rourke was to work with .
There 's Oscar buzz about his unsparing performance .
Before Aronofsky learned that Fox Searchlight had bought the American rights for the film ( news that came later that day ) , he joked that if anyone wished to talk to him , he would be available after the screening .
-- As Bill Maher strode down the red carpet , he could hear chants of " Pray for Bill " emanating from protesters gathered nearby .
They were demonstrating against his documentary " Religulous " - his first foray into filmmaking - in which he takes on organized religion , comparing it to a comedy routine with its tall tales of talking snakes and Jonah living in the belly of a whale .
Demonstrators carried placards saying things like " Do n't mock my religion . "
Instead of hurting the film , their presence only drew more publicity for it .
Onstage before a screening , Maher asked how many in the audience were praying for him .
He indicated that his own prayers were answered by the selection of Sarah Palin as the Republican candidate for vice president .
" When I saw they had nominated a full - fledged Jesus freak , I knew it was going to be good for my movie , " Maher laughingly told the crowd .
-- Talking about politics , Spike Lee was as omnipresent at the festival - dashing from bookstores to interviews to news conferences for his new movie , " Miracle at St. Anna , " based on the novel of the same name - as he had been at the Democratic Convention a few weeks back .
He was pictured on TV wearing a T - shirt showing Barack Obamadunking a basketball over John McCain 's head .
" Everybody called me afterwards to find out how to get a T - shirt like that , " said Lee , who said he plans to do as much campaigning for the Democratic candidate as he can .
" Miracle at St. Anna " is the filmmaker 's first World War II movie .
It tells the story of the nation 's first African American infantry division .
The Buffalo Soldiers , as they were called , served in Italy .
--
It was somehow fitting that " Flash of Genius " should premiere on a rainy day in Toronto .
The deeply affecting movie tells the story of Robert Kearns , inventor of what is known as the " intermittent windshield wiper , " the device that stops and starts your wiper so it does n't run continuously .
At a news conference , Greg Kinnear , who gives the performance of his career as Kearns , suggested everybody turn on their wipers in tribute to him .
Kinnear said he was n't concerned about mimicking Kearns ' gestures and voice .
" This was n't like playing Nixon .
Nobody has got an idea of what the guy who invented the intermittent windshield wiper looks like . "
--
On the other hand , many people know what Orson Welles looked like , even if it was just from his wine commercial .
Director Richard Linklater considers himself fortunate to have found someone who looks uncannily like Welles to play the maddening genius in " Me and Orson Welles " - a movie about Welles ' early years on the Broadway stage .
When Christian McKay came onstage before a festival screening , the audience gasped at the resemblance .
The film also stars Zac Efron as a young actor beguiled by Welles .
Efron is a celebrity among teens for his role in " High School Musical . "
When Linklater tapped him to be in " Me and Orson Welles , " I was like ' thank you , somebody , for offering me a serious role , ' " Efron told the audience .
Ajaxian recently posted about a fun JavaScript implementation of PacMan .
After spending way too much time on it I wondered how well an emulation of the old arcade game hardware would go in JavaScript .
I 've written a few 8080 arcade game emulations before in different languages so I had a go at implementing it in JavaScript .
You can try the work in progress at my JavaScript 8080 Emulation page .
It runs surprisingly well on modern JavaScript engines .
The page first loads with the arcade game Space Invaders loaded .
You can run a set number of instructions , or step through one at a time .
It displays the disassembled output .
Pressing ' Animate ' will run the game in a timer and it can be played .
It is a general 8080 arcade game emulator , for the games that use similar hardware to Space Invaders .
The buttons at the top load the code for Space Invaders , Lunar Rescue or Balloon Bomber .
If you have a bleeding edge version of Firefox 3.1 with Ogg Vorbis < audio > support , pressing the ' Enable Audio ' button will enable sound .
The sound support uses < audio > to play the samples when requested by the emulator .
This turns out to make a good test case for my audio support and it may need the fixes from bug 449159 and 454364 to work .
If you 're interested in the other emulators I 've done :
The implementation does not get traced with the TraceMonkey tracing JIT yet .
I 'll look into the reasons why and as TraceMonkey and my implementation improves it 'll get faster I 'm sure .
Even so , it runs very close to full speed .
This implementation uses Canvas , audio for sound and should work on browsers with a fast JS engine and these technologies .
For the emulator loop I run a set number of instructions during a timer that is run via ' setInterval ' to prevent the ' script is running too long ' message .
One thought that Robert O'Callahan suggested was to run the emulator in a worker thread and have communication for input / output via messages to the browser .
I 'll play with this idea and see how it goes - it 'll give me a chance to try out Firefox 3.1 worker threads implementation .
The emulator can be run ( without the GUI ) from a JavaScript shell for testing purposes .
I used the shell to test the implementation by running my Factor version and logging all the state of the emulated CPU , doing the same with the JavaScript version , and making sure the output was the same .
Although it 's not quite perfect , it 's currently playable , and shows that the types of games that are written as Java or Flash applets can be done in standard HTML and JavaScript in the latest browsers .

Seven years .
It 's been seven years since George W. Bush promised to capture one elderly , infirm , diabetic and dependent on regular dialysis , former personnel clerk turned poet and part time terrorist mastermind " dead or alive . "
You 'd think it was difficult , or something .
Seven years since the World Trade Center crashed to the ground , crushing to death just a hair under 2,000 people .
There are people in America who are old enough to vote who were still in grade school , who have no conscious memory of the World Trade Center towers before they caught fire , no sense of what the New York skyline looked like seven years ago and a day except a vague sense they got from old movies and old photographs .
And , of course , the site of the disaster is only barely just upgraded from a hole in the ground ; seven years later , it 's a hole in the ground with a couple of steel beams sticking up .
Seven years since we found out that the mastermind of those attacks was the deputy defense minister of Afghanistan , who had his headquarters in Kandahar , Afghanistan .
Seven years since we told the religious party that was governing that country that they could either give him up to us or defend him .
They chose to defend him , and mere months later we rolled right over that headquarters building in Kandahar , and that 's good .
But it occurred to me last night that we almost certainly have troops in Afghanistan , still fighting that religious party , still trying to keep that mastermind from moving his headquarters back into that building in Kandahar , who were stillon that day .
Can they possibly remember , really , what it is that they 're fighting for there ?
What does our fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan mean to someone who was just about to turn 11 years old when the Taliban chose to side with bin Laden against the whole world ?
Seven years since we found out the hard way what the Israelis had been warning us about since the 1950s , that a policy of automatic surrender to air pirates was a disaster waiting to happen .
Seven years since we turned the defense of our airports over to the same old rent - a - cops , but instead supervised by incompetent political appointees at three times the price .
Seven years , and not once have they passed an internal audit or a journalist 's test with any better than a 30 % score , seven years that we 've known that on any day that new air pirates chose to try to smuggle weapons or explosives on board , if there are three or more planes targeted , two of them are getting through .
Seven years that we 've known that we really did need to get on the stick , do what we should have done after the Lockerbie bombing and find some better way to screen cargo and luggage and some better way to supervise ground crews .
Seven years of instead harrassing thousands of Americans for having names that sort of sound like someone the department of homeland security thinks might be a terrorist , not that they know for sure ( or else they 'd just go get them ) , while not even inconveniencing any hypothetical terrorist minimally bright enough to use a fake name .
Seven years of searching everybody 's shoes and Taking Shampoo Away because our leaders are still too dumb to tell the difference between scientific and engineering reality and a bad movie plot device made up by some guy who knows that if he does n't think of some terrorist conspiracy to pretend to know about , we 'll keep treating him the exact same way that the Viet Cong treated John McCain .
It 's a damned good thing we shut down their headquarters and made huge inroads into their ability to money launder in the first few months after the attack , because if we were depending on the DHS and the TSA to keep us safe , we'd have all gone up in flames by now .
* sigh * I know it 's not supposed to be a day for politics .
But after seven damned years , I 'm sick and tired of being governed , at a time like this , by a President from a political party that does n't believe that government can possibly do anything right , a party that thinks that government spending exists only to enrich government contractors , that thinks that since all government iscorrupt there 's no point in even trying to appoint honest people or keep the people in government even mininally honest .
If nothing else , I can't shake the suspicion , today , that if the US Supreme Court had done with a century and a half of US and Florida law required them to do and declined to hearand what happened seven years ago had happened anyway , then at least one of the things we 'd done about it in the last four years would have been right .
All of them ?
Maybe not .
But if we'd been governed by a party that at least theoretically believes in the possibility of minimally honest and minimally competent government , we'd have at least a couple of more successes to cheer us up on this , the 7th anniversary of 9/11 .
In Alabama it is illegal to recommend shades of paint without a license .
In Nevada it is illegal to move any large piece of furniture for purposes of design without a license .
In fact , hundreds of people have been prosecuted in Alabama and Nevada for practicing " interior design " without a license .
Getting a license is no easy task , typically requiring at least 4 years of education and 2 years of apprenticeship .
Why do we need licenses laws for interior designers ?
According to the American Society of Interior Designers ( ASID ) because ,
Every decision an interior designer makes in one way or another affects the health , safety , and welfare of the public .
This hardly passes the laugh test .
Moreover as Carpenter and Ross point out in an excellent article in Regulation from which I have drawn :
In more than 30 years of advocating for regulation , the ASID and its ilk have yet to identify a single documented incident resulting in harm to anyone from the unlicensed practice of interior design …
These laws simply have nothing to do with protecting the public .
Most states do not have license laws for interior designers but the unceasing lobbying efforts of the ASID have expanded such licenses .
Fortunately , unlicensed interior designers are fighting back !
I love that unlicensed designers in New Hampshire have formed a anti-license league , Live Free and Design .
Tuttle Lives !
For the past few months , I 've become more and more disillusioned by the current state of Ruby 's scripting support .
Sure , we have optparse , and a gamut of other solutions , but there 's no full - stack package for writing robust binaries .
Enter thor .
The idea behind thor initially came from my work on a textmate binary ( more on that later today ) , which would manage installed Textmate bundles .
Sure , there 's the getbundle bundle , and you can manually get bundles from subversion , but I wanted a single binary that handled all of that .
While I was building it , I decided to map the commands that people could enter to a class and its methods .
I created a small file that I included with the textmate binary called class_cli , and created some syntax for mapping things , like so ( note that this is not the final syntax ) :
class MyApp include CLI desc " list [ list ] " , " list some items " def list ( list = " stuff " ) puts list.split(/,\s*/).join ( "
" ) end end MyApp.start
Assuming the binary is called app , you could then do app list " one , two , three " , which would print :
one two three
In the case of the textmate binary , I created methods for list , install , installed , and uninstall .
This worked nicely , so I wanted to extract it out for use in other tools .
I started the Hermes project on github , but while drinking with Chris Wanstrath , I was convinced that the name
Thor would be more appealing .
Oh , the things that alcohol can do .
I was also convinced of a couple other things ( again , in a slightly inebriated state ) :
rake and sake needed to be replaced for scripts , not as a replacement for make
, not as a replacement for make nobody was going to use hermes thor if they need extra boilerplate like MyApp.start
Long story short , Chris convinced me to make
Thor a full - fledged scripting solution .
So I did .
Thor , as it exists today , has two components :
The Thor superclass , which works exactly like CLI / Hermes , except that you inherit from it instead of including it ( class MyApp < Thor ) .
The Thor runner , which can run Thortasks that are in a local directory or installed from a remote location
The thor runner allows you to make files like :
# module : random class Amazing < Thor desc " describe NAME " , " say that someone is amazing " method_options : forcefully => : boolean def describe ( name , opts ) ret = " # {name} is amazing " puts opts [ " forcefully " ] ?
ret.upcase : ret end desc " hello " , " say hello " def hello puts " Hello " end end
If you call the file . thor or Thorfile and place it in your current directory , any directory above you , or tasks /. thor , you can then invoke the thorfile in any of the following ways :
$ thor - T Tasks ----- amazing : describe NAME [ -- forcefully ] say that someone is amazing amazing : hello say hello $ thor amazing : hello Hello $ thor amazing : describe " This blog reader "
This blog reader is amazing $ thor amazing : describe " This blog reader " -- forcefully THIS BLOG READER IS AMAZING
You can also install local tasks or remote tasks to your system thor cache and make them available anywhere :
$ thor install task .
thor Your Thorfile contains : # module : random class Amazing < Thor desc " describe NAME " , " say that someone is amazing " method_options : forcefully => : boolean def describe ( name , opts ) ret = " # {name} is amazing " puts opts [ " forcefully " ] ?
ret.upcase : ret end desc " hello " , " say hello " def hello puts " Hello " end end Do you wish to continue [ y / N ] ?
y Storing thor file in your system repository $ thor installed Name Modules ---- ------- random amazing Tasks ----- amazing : describe NAME [ -- forcefully ] say that someone is amazing amazing : hello say hello $ thor amazing : hello Hello ... same as above ...
You can also specify a URL instead of a file name ; like sake , thor uses open - uri to get the files .
You uninstall or update thor modules based on the short name that was provided ; if # module : name exists at the top of the file , thor will use that by default .
You can also use thor install task .
thor -- as my_short_name .
If you do n't provide a short name , thor will ask for one .
Later , you can do thor update short_name and thor will remember where you got the module from and try to update it .
thor uninstall short_name will remove the module from your list of installed modules .
Of course , thor - T ( or thor list ) will list local tasks and system - wide tasks in the resulting list , so you do n't need a separate tool to track your thortasks , and a local task can be made into a system task trivially .
Finally , thor itself is self - hosting ; the thor runner uses the Thor superclass .
As a result , I added some more features to the superclass as I built the runner :
You can map short names to their full name : map " - T " => : list , which is why thor - T and thor list are identical
, which is why and are identical
You can provide additional options that get passed in as a Hash ( method_options : as => : required ) .
The available option types are : required , : optional , and : boolean .
The resulting hash is passed in as the final parameter to your method and the pretty - printed help automatically includes them in the usage screen .
Take a look at the thor repository on github , and specifically , the thor runner for more information on how it all fits together .
When early humans mastered the use of fire , their immediate rewards were warmth , light , and protection from nocturnal predators .
Investigators have assumed that our ancestors also quickly realized the advantages of flame - cooked food — easy chewing and digestion — though clear evidence has been hard to find .
A new study bolsters that idea , showing that we share our fondness for cooked grub with our wild cousins , the great apes .
Victoria Wobber and her graduate advisor at Harvard University , Richard Wrangham , along with a third colleague , gave a choice between cooked and raw food to a number of captive apes .
Chimpanzees clearly preferred cooked carrots , sweet potatoes , and beef over the raw alternatives .
They did not express any preference in the case of white potatoes and apples — perhaps , the scientists say , because both remain relatively unchanged by cooking .
A few bonobos , gorillas , and orangutans were also tested , and except for a penchant for cooked beef , not many expressed a preference , but those that did agreed with the chimps .
The findings concur with research showing that cats favor cooked meat and rats opt for cooked starch .
If animals with no regular access to cooked food nevertheless prefer it , it is plausible that our ancestors would have readily roasted their own victuals once they got the chance — a fine story to tell your guests around the barbecue this evening .
The findings were detailed in the Journal of Human Evolution .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Berkshire Hathaway is investing $ 5 billion in Goldman Sachs .
Too bad Warren Buffett does n't have another $ 695 billion lying around so that taxpayers would n't have to foot the bill for the bank bailout .
Seriously though , the Oracle of Omaha 's decision to take a stake in Goldman is good news ... for Goldman ( GS , Fortune 500 ) .
That 's because it 's getting $ 5 billion in capital .
The company also is raising another $ 5 billion through a sale of common stock .
But make no mistake .
Even though many bank stocks enjoyed a bit of a pop on Wednesday morning along with shares of Goldman , investors should not interpret Buffett 's Goldman investment as a sign that the worst is over for the financial services industry .
Buffett is not calling a bottom for the sector .
He may just be calling a bottom for Goldman .
It 's also worth noting that Buffett did n't buy shares of Goldman 's common stock .
Berkshire is investing in preferred shares that will pay a whopping 10 % dividend and that can be called at any time for a 10 % premium .
Buffett is n't being an altruist .
He 's being an opportunist .
What Buffett is signaling is that he 's identified a solid company he thinks is undervalued and he is seizing the chance to invest in that firm .
That 's what he always does .
He is a stock picker , not an index fund manager .
Along those lines , it 's worth noting that the six financial stocks that Berkshire ( BRKA , Fortune 500 ) owned as of June 30 have fared much better than the overall market and banking sector this year .
The Berkshire six are down an average of just 6.7 % this year compared to a 19 % drop in the S&P 500 and 28 % plunge in the S&P Banking Index .
What 's more , three of the bank stocks Berkshire owns -- Wells Fargo ( WFC , Fortune 500 ) , U.S. Bancorp ( USB , Fortune 500 ) and M&T Bank ( MTB ) -- are actually up this year .
That 's an astonishing feat given the negativity surrounding the financial sector and is a testament to the fact that Buffett only invests in quality companies .
These three banks have not been hit nearly as hard as others during the credit crisis because they were more conservative than many of their rivals .
And all three have continued to report profits even as many competitors bleed red ink because of exposure to soured subprime mortgages .
Now of course , not every Berkshire investment turns to gold .
The firm's other three financial services investments , SunTrust ( STI , Fortune 500 ) , American Express ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) and Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , have all suffered double - digit percentage losses this year .
Yet , these three companies also have remained profitable during the credit crunch .
So if investors should take anything from Berkshire 's investment in Goldman , it should be this .
Not all banks are toxic .
Some values if you do your homework
As I pointed out last week , there is a negativity bubble surrounding financial companies .
Many reasonably healthy banks have been unfairly punished simply because they are banks .
This is a time for patient investors to do their homework and find , like Buffett did , companies that will be the survivors in this brave new financial world .
Don Wordell , manager of the Orlando , Fla. - based RidgeWorth MidCap Value fund , said he likes two smaller investment banks , regional firm Raymond James ( RJF ) and New York boutique Lazard ( LAZ ) .
Wordell believes they will benefit from the rapidly changing landscape on Wall Street now that Goldman and Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) have become bank holding companies .
Matt Kaufler , co-portfolio manager of the Touchstone Value Opportunities fund , said he 's also seeing some values in beaten down financials .
His fund owns regional banks Fifth Third Bancorp ( FITB , Fortune 500 ) and KeyCorp ( KEY , Fortune 500 ) , for example .
Even though both Midwestern - based banks have been hit hard in the credit crunch , he likes the fact that both firms have solid assets they could sell to raise more capital .
Fifth Third has a lucrative credit - card processing division while Key owns money manager Victory Capital .
Kaufler added that he also likes specialty insurer Assurant ( AIZ , Fortune 500 ) and asset management firm Invesco ( IVZ ) .
But Wordell said it 's not time to aggressively buy traditional bank stocks since there is still so much uncertainty regarding the bailout .
" The problem is that there 's not enough information .
I need to know what the exact terms of the bailout will be , " he said .
Kaufler agreed .
If Buffett is not making big bets on the entire industry , neither should you .
" We are nibbling in financials but we still think it 's best to be very cautious .
You can't go out and indiscriminately buy bank stocks , " Kaufler said .

Q : How do you make the object of your affections fall in love with you ?
A : Take them for a ride on a rollercoaster
If you fancy someone and want them to fall for you the usual plan of action involves flowers , chocolates or just a few meaningful glances .
But if you really want to win hearts get them on a rollercoaster .
If there 's not one within screaming distance , you could always try bungee jumping or white - water rafting instead .
Adventure sports cause a rush of a hormone which makes us fall in love
White - knuckle pursuits apparently create a rush of the hormone that makes us fall in love , a science conference heard yesterday .
Phenylethylamine is vital in the science of attraction , according to author Richard Robinson .
Mr Robinson , whose books include Why The One You Fancy Never Fancies
You , said : ' Phenylethylamine is secreted when you see someone across the room that you really , really fancy .
' It is the hormone of euphoria , it is the hormone of joy and ecstasy . '
He told the British Association 's Festival of Science in Liverpool that not wearing perfumes to let your own natural scent shine through was also important .
A person 's smell provides clues about their genetic make - up .
We are programmed to sniff out those whose genes are different to our own .
This apparently helps ensure any children born will have broad immunity against disease .
Those looking to impress should also keep conversation to a minimum and concentrate on their appearance .
Research shows that 55 per cent of first impressions are based on how we look rather than what we say .
Getting off the sofa and out and about is also important .
' Meeting a lot of people is key , ' Mr Robinson said .
' Sitting there moping and eating chocolate is not going to get you anywhere . '
Where Are Sarah Palin's Tax Returns ?
Vice presidential candidate has yet to share her filings .
 --
As election day comes ever nearer , Democrats and open - government advocates are pressing for the GOP vice presidential candidate to release her tax filings , a campaign tradition that extends at least to the post - Watergate era .
Instead , Palin has to date declined to share the documents , becoming part of an ever - more - select historical group of candidates who waited until this late in a campaign year to release their tax filings .
Since 1976 , every major - party presidential and vice - presidential candidate has provided that information to the public , according to an analysis by ABC News .
Until Palin , only three hopefuls have held onto their tax returns this late :
In 1984 , George H.W. Bush , then the Republican presidential candidate , held onto his tax returns until Oct.
3 . Bush said he had set up " the biggest blind trust possible " to prevent conflicts of interest , and said he was concerned releasing information on the trust 's holdings would violate its terms .
He relented under pressure and after receiving assurances from government ethics experts .
In 2000 , then - White House hopeful George W. Bush released his tax returns on Oct. 21 .
He had received two extensions from the IRS , and did not file his returns until Oct. 15 .
Also in 2000 , Democratic vice presidential candidate Joe Lieberman waited until Sept. 22 to release his tax returns .
When he did so , he released only summary information on income , assets and taxes that was characterized in news reports as " bare bones . "
" Voters deserve to know as much as they can about the candidates who are asking for their vote , " said Massie Ritsch of OpenSecrets.org , a Washington , D.C. - based watchdog focused on politics and money .
Last week the Obama - Biden campaign released 10 years ' worth of tax returns for Sen. Joseph Biden , D - Del. , in a move intended to pressure the McCain - Palin camp to do the same for Palin , currently governor of Alaska .
A spokesman for Palin Thursday reiterated the campaign 's stance on the matter .
" We plan to release Governor Palin 's tax returns well before the election , " said Taylor Griffin .
For Ritsch , that 's not good enough .
" A campaign that is touting what it will do to make government more transparent can take a first step by making the candidates transparent . "

MY husband and I were sitting down to dinner when the police called .
It was a female dispatcher whose voice I recognized from previous incidents involving my 20 - year - old son , Andrew , who has autism .
In recent years , this police department has picked him up for shoplifting , taken reports from restaurants where he had dined and dashed , and once even brought him back from the airport after he tried to stow away on a plane .
Roughly half of the force has lectured me about keeping a closer eye on him , placing him in a secure facility , and finding a better psychiatrist , while the other half has been sweet and apologetic , concerned about how I ’m bearing up .
On this occasion the dispatcher explained that my car , which I had earlier reported stolen , had been found on the side of the highway some 70 miles away in St. Cloud , Minn .
 scratched , filthy and out of gas but otherwise undamaged .
I would need to retrieve it from the impound lot .
My son , unhurt , was waiting at the station .
When would I be able to pick him up ?

There has been fierce fighting in the breakaway Georgian region of South Ossetia , where Georgian troops have been attempting to regain control from rebels .
Georgia said it moved in to " restore peace " in South Ossetia after recent clashes between its forces and separatist militias .
Russian troops have also entered the region and President Dmitry Medvedev has said that anyone who kills Russian citizens " will receive a deserved punishment " .
Georgia has accused Russia of arming the separatists , who have been trying to break away since a civil war in the 1990s .
Moscow denies the claim .
Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said that any involvement by Russian forces in the conflict would result in " all out war " .
Georgia has accused Russian jets of attacking airports and military bases , but Russia has denied any of its fighters have entered Georgian airspace .
Georgian troops have evacuated women and children from the regional capital Tskhinvali , where rebels claimed to be in control .
There are reports of many civilian deaths as well as military casualties .
Russia says 10 of its peacekeeping troops have died .
Residents of Tskhinvali have been sheltering in basements as massive explosions rock the city and hospitals were reported to be struggling to cope with the numbers of injured .
People in the town of Gori , close to Tskhinvali , studied lists of the wounded to find the names of friends and family .
South Ossetian rebel leader Eduard Kokoity says Georgia has launched an all - out attack on Tskhinvali , in what he calls " a perfidious and base step " .

JOHN McCAIN , HERO OF WALL STREET ….
Katie Couric interviews Sarah Palin about reforming the finance industry :
COURIC : You ’ve said , quote , “ John McCain will reform the way Wall Street does business . ”
Other than supporting stricter regulations of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac two years ago , can you give us any more example of his leading the charge for more oversight ?
PALIN : I think that the example that you just cited , with his warnings two years ago about Fannie and Freddie — that , that ’s paramount .
That ’s more than a heck of a lot of other senators and representatives did for us .
COURIC : But he ’s been in Congress for 26 years .
He ’s been chairman of the powerful Commerce Committee .
And he has almost always sided with less regulation , not more .
PALIN : He ’s also known as the maverick though .
Taking shots from his own party , and certainly taking shots from the other party .
Trying to get people to understand what he ’s been talking about — the need to reform government .
COURIC : I ’m just going to ask you one more time , not to belabor the point .
Specific examples in his 26 years of pushing for more regulation ?
PALIN : I ’ll try to find you some and I ’ll bring them to you .

What 's on the desk
In a picture supplied by Sarah Palin 's family to the Associated Press , Palin appears with some rather odd reading matter :
The magazine of the ultraconservative John Birch Society .
The picture , dating to 1995 , when Palin was a member of the Wasilla City Council , ran beside a profile of Palin in Saturday 's New York Times .
The magazine , The New American , is sitting on top of her calendar on her desk , unopened .
The current , and then - , president of the group , John McManus , confirmed that the cover fit the description of a 1995 issue of the magazine .
The headline , " Con-Con Call , " refers to discussion at the time of a constitutional convention .
The headline appears above a picture of then - Utah Governor Mike Leavitt , who had floated the notion as a way of returning the balance of power back toward the states .
But the author warned that the convention could actually be a devious ploy aimed at increasing government power .
McManus said Palin would n't have had to have any connection to the society , or the journal , to have wound up with that issue on her desk .
" Any attempt to link her to the John Birch Society would be ridiculous , " he said of speculation on the liberal blogs that first noticed the magazine , first noted by the photo site BAGNews .
" This photo from the early to mid 90s shows the Governor having her photo taken in front of a three ring binder of information from local citizens presented regularly to Wasilla council members by the town clerk , " said Palin spokesman Michael Goldfarb .
" These binders featured material given by members of the public to all council members . "
" We sent thousands of copies of that newsletter out to all kinds of people trying to forestall the constitutional convention , " McManus recalled .
" The plan at that time was for us to send copies of that newsletter to county commissioners , mayors , state legislators , local officials . "
" Our nation 's best informed citizens need to voice their opposition loudly and clearly .
Governors and legislators who understand the Constitution and know it is not flawed must be willing to speak out in opposition to this elaborate plan to alter it ..
We must not permit the calling of a state - authorized Conference imbued with federal convention powers at this point in our history . , " said the piece .
McManus said the Birch Society should get credit for stopping the convention , and said they have a similar effort underway to halt a supposed North American Union plan .
Did Florida election officials accidentally trash uncounted ballots ?
David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday September 11 , 2008
Print This Email This More than 3,000 ballots that went missing after a local primary election in Florida could have been inadvertently thrown out on election night , and there are calls for state officials to step in and take over elections operations in the chronically plagued Palm Beach County before November .
" Are the 3,478 missing ballots in a landfill ?
were they inadvertently thrown out by election officials who thought they were trash ? " local anchor Tim Malloy asked in a Wednesday night broadcast .
" NewsChannel 5 has exclusively learned that is the leading theory on officials ' minds . "
Malloy reports that officials at a Boynton Beach precinct may have placed bundles of uncounted ballots into nondescript black plastic trash bags before having them transported to the Palm Beach County Board of Elections .
Ballots are supposed to be placed into zippered bags like those used for bank deposits and transported to the board offices in duffle bags , but precinct officials apparently ran out of the duffle bags .
" A reliable law enforcement source tells us it is believed the garbage bag was thrown out .
mistaken for trash on a very busy night , " Malloy reports .
" It would adequately explain , our source says , the mystifying disappearance of thousands of ballots . "
The ballots disappeared between the county 's Aug. 26 primary and a recount the following weekend .
Three nonpartisan election integrity groups have asked the state to supervise Palm Beach County during the Nov. 4 presidential election .
Florida continues to be one of the most closely fought states in the election , and its vote again could decide the presidential election this year .

Yet it remains unclear who can stop the popular Mr. Bloomberg from changing the law and coasting to an election victory next year .
The concept of a third term has broad support among City Council members , business leaders and newspaper editorial boards , all of whom Mr. Bloomberg has assiduously courted behind the scenes .
On Wednesday , The New York Times published an editorial calling for term limits to be abolished .
The New York Post and The Daily News have already endorsed Mr. Bloomberg ’s bid for a third term .
Image Representative Anthony D. Weiner called the notion illegal .
Credit ... Librado Romero / The New York Times
And , according to a person who has advised the mayor in the past , he “ does not care what it costs ” to win a third term .
In 2005 , Mr. Bloomberg , a billionaire , spent more than $ 70 million and won nearly 60 percent of the vote .
Mr. Bloomberg was observing the Jewish New Year on Tuesday and his press aides did not return several e-mail messages and telephone calls .
During marathon telephone conversations in recent weeks , Mr. Bloomberg has debated with his friends and advisers the pros and cons of running again .
“ This has been thoroughly thought out by the mayor , ” said the person who has advised the mayor in the past .
“ It ’s not like he just woke up one morning and decided to do it . ”
With his decision , Mr. Bloomberg is overruling the advice of his top three assistants at City Hall  Deputy Mayors Edward Skyler , Patricia E. Harris and Kevin Sheekey  who have expressed opposition to a third term .
Those aides have told the mayor  at times forcefully  that any campaign to challenge the term - limits law would look like an end run around voters , and could sully his legacy as a reform - minded outsider .
Others have told the mayor that they may not remain for a full third term .
Top 10 : Unknown Serial Killers
Ten Serial Killers With Crazier Stories Than Robert Durst's
Call it the craziest ending of an HBO program since Tony Soprano went out to the sounds of Journey and a black screen .
At the end of the show The Jinx : The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst , an HBO six - part documentary about the oddball , eccentric son of a major real estate mogul , the 71 - year - old seemed to make a shocking confession .
With his mic unknowingly still on , he muttered off - set that he had " killed them all . "
Durst was surrounded by death throughout his life ; his first wife disappeared in 1982 .
When the case was reopened in 2000 , his long - time friend Susie Berman was murdered .
In 2001 , he fell under suspicion again for the murder of his elderly neighbor , Morris Black , even admitting that he dismembered the body .
He was tried and eventually cleared of the crime however , found to be innocent .
Almost immediately following the airing of the last episode of the six - part documentary , Durst was arrested yesterday in New Orleans for the 2000 killing of Susie Berman , with folks speculating he had been nabbed because of his last - minute " confession . "
Of course , Durst has n't been convicted of anything , and in fairness , his " killed them all " remark might have been a bit of black humor .
But if there 's one thing the uproar over Durst shows , and just the possibility that he might have confessed to three killings , even jokingly , it 's that there 's nothing that gets our fancy up like serial killers .
Robert Durst was the third most searched trend on Google yesterday , after all .
So , history buffs and fans of the lurid and grotesque , let 's take a trip through 10 actual serial killers .
To be clear , we 're not picking the low - hanging , well - know , Jack The Ripper - esque fruit : these are all ones you probably have n't heard of .

Get a daily rundown of the top stories on Urban Milwaukee
“ Gasoline and alcohol do n’t mix , ” says the American slogan .
Of course they do .
Our urban planners mix them all the time and in great doses .
See the zoning codes for confirmation .
– Ray Olderburg , The Great Good Place
As a society we say “ do n’t drink and drive ” but in this case actions speak louder than words .
Zoning and land use policies have an impact on the built environment that often promotes driving and limits other transportation options .
These regulations to some extent mandate how we get home from work and unfortunately how we get from the tavern , home .
Many regulations are involved in this problem but with adjustments to the three below a real reduction in drunk driving can be promoted .
Minimum parking requirements for bars and taverns
Zoning that insures separate land uses
Zoning that promotes low population density and discourages mass transit
In most communities throughout the U.S. minimum parking requirements exist for various land uses .
Unfortunately these minimum parking requirements encourage automobile travel and even extend to taverns .
For example , Franklin , Wisconsin ’s Unified Development Ordinance : Zoning , Development and Land Division requirements show , in the table on page 254 , the parking requirements for various land uses including bars or taverns .
Use Minimum Required Parking Spaces per 1,000 Square Feet of Floor Area Other Required Standard(s )
for Off - Street Parking Spaces
Bar or Tavern 10
Or 1 space per 2 seats or stools , plus 1 space
per employee , whichever is greater
Clearly this indicates that a significant number of patrons have the expectation of driving to a bar or tavern and that this is an acceptable practice .
Not only does this set the expectation of available parking but it goes a step further and actually encourages people to drive because they know a space will be available .
If parking were limited this could encourage other modes of transportation such as walking , mass transit , or cab service to become the preferred method and thus reduce the number of drunk drivers .
Many zoning regulations came out of the efforts to separate polluted industrial factories from residential homes but unfortunately this was just the start of separating uses .
The separation of uses has spread to the point that now in many communities it is illegal to have a store or a tavern in the neighborhood .
Without the corner tavern that is accessible by foot , or by mass transit then people have little choice but to drive .
This has added to our long run increase of the number of vehicle miles traveled and although the Alcohol - Related Fatalities and Fatality Rates by State report put out by the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration points out that the number of fatalities per vehicle miles driven has dropped we can do more .
Alcohol - related traffic fatalities per vehicle miles driven has also dropped dramatically — from 1.64 deaths per 100 million miles traveled in 1982 down to 0.56 in 2005 ( the latest year for which such statistics are available ) .
The NHTSA data do permit comparison of automobile fatality rates by city .
In general , denser cities with more extensive public transportation systems have lower automobile fatality rates ( including drivers and passengers but excluding pedestrians ) : 2.65 per 100,000 population in New York , 6.98 in Philadelphia , 5.57 in Chicago , 2.54 in San Francisco , and 4.17 in Portland , compared to 9.97 in Houston , 12.55 in Phoenix , 11.53 in Dallas , 10.65 in Tampa , and 11.21 in Atlanta .
Specifically the next step in reducing alcohol - related traffic fatalities is to reduce the number of vehicle miles traveled .
This gets to the heart of urbanism , in that walking can be a primary mode of transportation .
This would go a long way towards the reduction of the number of drunk drivers by simply taking them of the road .
Similar to the problems created by the separation of land uses , zoning for low density development encourages people to drive by making the distances between home and destination further apart .
The report Urban Sprawl and Public Health , put out by the Department of Environmental and Occupational Health at the Rollins School of Public Health of Emory University , makes the connection between density , the availability of mass transit , and automobile fatality rates .
Although these numbers attest to all automobile fatality rates the connection between density , access to mass transit , and automobile fatalities is apparent .
By increasing population density and providing a variety of mass transit options people have choices of how to travel to their destination of choice .
Further by having a higher population density this generally supports the availability of entertainment options nearby and again allows for people to make better transportation choices when drinking .
I ’ve touched on just a few of the zoning regulations that promote drunk driving and alluded to the solution .
The solution I propose can be called Smart Growth , New Urbanism , Urbanism or just plain old city living but all of these refer to one essential idea .
The idea of creating neighborhoods where you can live , work , and play .
Essentially we need to get people out of their cars before they get to the tavern .
To be clear I ’m not arguing that city living will be the end of drunk driving .
But when we legislate that you drive to the bar and when we build the physical environment so that people are encouraged to drive to the tavern , then the end result will be drunk drivers .
So if we want to change this outcome and combat drunk driving we need to begin by changing our regulations to encourage dense , walkable , mixed - use neighborhoods .
A reader notes :
A few years ago , my house got broken into in the middle of my term in grad school .
I was still expected to turn in my homework on time .
McCain should debate .
If McCain were a rational candidate wanting to demonstrate leadership in a time of crisis , he would simply suggesting refocusing Friday 's debate on economic issues , and holding it in Washington , D.C. , so that he and Senator Obama could be present on the hill for a vote if one were to be called .
Alas , he 's yet again demonstrated a callow , vainglorious attitude in his campaign for the Presidency .
He 's demonstrably unfit for the job .
Within hours of his demise in 1955 , Albert Einstein ’s brain was salvaged , sliced into 240 pieces and stored in jars for safekeeping .

DENVER ( MarketWatch ) --
The Republican Party may hold off on its national convention next week if Tropical Storm Gustav turns into a hurricane and strikes the Gulf Coast , a spokesman for presumptive presidential nominee John McCain said Thursday .
Gustav was gaining momentum off the coast of Jamaica and headed on a trajectory toward New Orleans , which was hit three years ago Friday by Hurricane Katrina .
If it strikes the Gulf Coast by Monday , that would occur right as the GOP is convening its quadrennial gathering in St. Paul , Minn. , on the heels of the Democratic convention this week .
Arsenal were last night desperately trying to sign Xabi Alonso before the transfer window closed after submitting an improved offer , thought to be around £ 14 m , for the Spanish international midfielder .
Earlier the Liverpool manager , Rafael Benitez , had insisted Alonso was not for sale but it is understood that he was always prepared to do a deal if his valuation was met .
The Arsenal manager , Arsène Wenger , who rejected Cardiff City 's attempt to take Aaron Ramsay back on loan , has played a delicate game of brinkmanship in trying to secure Alonso , whom he wants to partner Cesc Fabregas in central midfield .
Wenger regards the 26 - year - old as a player who can add the experience and steel which have been missing from his team .
A bid of £ 12 m was rejected last month as Wenger hoped to capitalise on Liverpool 's attempts to sign Gareth Barry from Aston Villa .
It was a busy day as Benitez attempted to balance the books .
Liverpool completed the £ 8 m purchase of the Espanyol winger Albert Riera , who has signed a four - year deal , and also secured two teenagers : 18 - year - old Brazilian striker Vito Flora on a free transfer from Botafogo and another 18 - year - old , Hungarian goalkeeper Peter Gulacsi from MTK Hungaria .

They sold Steve Finnan to Espanyol for just £ 1 m , with the full - back signing a two - year deal while the Ukrainian striker Andrei Voronin returned to the Bundesliga with a season - long loan at Hertha Berlin .
The German club also signed the Manchester City striker Felipe Caicedo .
Benitez was , meanwhile , trying to offload Jermaine Pennant , although the winger , who had hoped to switch to Blackburn Rovers , was resisting a £ 4 m move to Stoke City .
Across Stanley Park , Everton were attempting to pull off one of the biggest deals of the final day with an astonishing £ 12 m bid for the Standard Liège defender Marouane Fellaini .
The fee for the 20 - year - old , born in Belgium to Moroccan parents , would be a club record .
He starred in Standard 's recent Champions League tie against Liverpool and the Everton manager David Moyes , who travelled to Belgium to watch Fellaini in action on Sunday , wants to play Felliani as a holding midfielder .
Everton confirmed the signing of Louis Saha , with initially no fee payable to Manchester United , although that will change depending on appearances , while the 34 - year - old goalkeeper Carlo Nash arrived from Wigan Athletic on a free transfer .
However , Everton failed with a £ 3.5 m bid for Reading 's Stephen Hunt and were frustrated in their attempts to secure a work permit for the Nigerian winger Victor Obinna after an appeal hearing .
Chelsea were also frustrated .
Having missed out on Robinho , pulling out of the bidding after Manchester City 's offer , they appear to have failed in their attempts to sell Paulo Ferreira to West Ham United , with the Portuguese international not keen to switch to Upton Park .
Talks were held after West Ham sold the left - back George McCartney to Sunderland for £ 6 m .
The 26 - year - old will be reunited with Anton Ferdinand which means West Ham have taken £ 13 m off Sunderland in the last week .
McCartney had been the subject of a Sunderland bid earlier in the summer but was persuaded to sign a new contract instead .
However , his partner has not settled in London and he becomes Roy Keane 's 10th summer signing , the outlay being approximately £ 36 m .
On Tyneside speculation was rife that Joey Barton was on the move .
But that appeared to be generated by his agent Willie McKay with the midfielder , who was at St James '
Park to watch the reserve team match between Newcastle United and Sunderland , insisting he wanted to stay in the North - east .
Portsmouth had been linked with a bid .
At the same time there was no official confirmation from Newcastle that the Deportivo La Coruña striker , Xisco was arriving in a £ 7.7 m deal with £ 5.7 m up front .
Valencia also said that Ignacio Gonzalez , a 26 - year - old Uruguayan international midfielder , would be spending the season on loan at St James ' Park .
Spurs , who announced the £ 12.5 m arrival of Roman Pavlyuchenko from Spartak Moscow , also finally completed the £ 8.5 m signing of Vedrun Corluka from Manchester City , with the 22 - year - old Croat signing a six - year deal .
They were in talks to secure the 24 - year - old striker Sergio Garcia from Real Zaragoza for £ 9 m but may have lost out to Real Betis .
That blow was softened , however , with Frazier Campbell 's arrival on loan from Manchester United , which derailed Hull City 's £ 7 m bid for the striker .
Spurs ' attempts to sign another Zaragoza striker , Diego Milito , which had looked likely earlier in the day , failed with the Argentina international rejoining his former club Genoa .
The Premier League newcomers were all busy .
Hull secured the Rangers striker Daniel Cousin , signed the Crystal Palace midfielder Tom Soares for £ 1.5 m and also captured Sunderland 's Paul McShane on loan with a view to a permanent £ 2 m deal , but a move for Fulham 's Seol Ki-Hyeon foundered on issues regarding the Korean 's work permit .
Stoke re-signed their former defender Danny Higginbotham , for just over £ 2 m , although a £ 6 m move for Cardiff City 's Joe Ledley was rejected .
West Bromwich Albion signed their third player from the Eredivisie with Ryan Donk arriving from AZ Alkmaar on a season - long loan , with a view to a permanent deal .

Edit :
This article was intended to specifically address certain types of of open source advocates , as stated in the title .
This article is not intended to label all open source advocates as hypocrites .
See comments by the author below .
Today , and almost every day , I ’ll read an article about a proprietary computer company ( Microsoft , Apple , etc ) and “ open source ” technologies and communities .
Every time I read them I see a large percentage of “ user participants ” in comments , responses , etc. that make me cringe .
Today ’s example was ZDNet ’s article “ Open source should support Apple over Psystar “ .
I thought it was a great , simple article :
I have been wracking my brain all day for an angle on this Apple - Psystar story ( great work by Adrian Kingsley - Hughes ) and I can’t come up with one .
Save this .
Open source should be supporting Apple here .
The writer goes on to basically say that the Open Source world relies on users respecting the licenses and agreements made by the people who download their software .
Apple has a EULA and Psystar is basically breaking that agreement .
She admits that Apple ’s EULA is nasty and removes any rights for a user , but that user by choice bought an Apple product .
However , what kind of comments show up ?
If you accept Apple EULA you give your soul to the devil ( and all your possession must be Apple approved , you cannot use the software to its full potential : like on a REAL computer , you surrender all freedom and you are sucked down into the whorst artificial monopoly ever witness by mankind )
However their kernel choice is an open source kernel , and if this is the part that is being modified then the issue is moot .
Apple does n’t support Open Source .
Where ’s my version of iTunes for Linux ?
Glad to see they were able to take KHTML and make Safari out of it .
Where ’s the love in return ?
There is n’t any .
Recompiling iTunes for another * nix kernel would be trivial .
It ’s missing because they do n’t think the open source community matters to them .
I say let ’em swing in the wind .
hell no open source should not support apple over psystar .
i have download the os 10.5 patch myself along with a copy of os 10.5 .
why would i pay apple 2400 dollars for a computer that is not as fast as the one i am using , that i built for less than 1500 dollars ( including xp ) .
as far as the eula is concerned it means nothing to me .
i signature is not their .
as i have stated before once i buy a piece of software i will do whatever i want with it .
Here is the problem in a nutshell : Proprietary Companies ( Microsoft , IBM , etc ) have legally fought Open Source to snuff out competition .
Open Source people fought back for their rights and defend them .
They declared that open source “ is about choice ! ”
Its allowing people to choose different software than the typical proprietary solutions .
These open source projects have adopted licenses to prevent people abusing their Intellectual Property .
While Open Source people might scream at me for saying that , in essence that is what all of these open source projects are : intellectual property that is owned by the public , instead of by a person or corporation .
So open source advocates scream and yell when people violate the intellectual property of the public .
However , when it is the intellectual property of a company , especially someone like Microsoft or Apple , that it does n’t matter because they are “ evil . ”
Regardless of the hundreds , thousands , millions , and billions of dollars they have invested into their IP , its okay to disregard that due to the fact their “ business principles do n’t line up with mine . ”
It is a double standard that thousands and thousands of Open Source users are taking .
It is a total crime for a business to abuse open source licenses , however its okay to for users to abuse business ’s licenses .
When companies mess with open source , open source users run to the law for protection .
Yet when the roles are reversed , open source users say “ screw the law ” and go with their own ‘ moral compass ’ .
My question to these people are : what about my choice ?
I ’m willing to pay for my copy of windows .
I support Microsoft in their endeavor to make better products .
I enjoy programming in .NET because it saves me time .
That is my choice .
I love my MacBook Pro . I like the quickness and responsiveness I get from it .
It is my choice to buy from a company whose value is in their Quality Control .
But hypocritical open source advocates tell me I ’m wrong and evil because I ’m making the “ wrong ” choice .
I ’ve seen a serious trend with open source users that instead of arguing for choice , are arguing what I should choose .
Yes !
By all means you can choose whatever you want to do .
If you want to run only on open source technologies , more power to you .
But do n’t call me “ evil ” for being willing to pay for software that makes my life easier .
I support open source .
I love what it is doing to the technology industry .
However , there are many open source users that I cannot stand .
Stand up for choice , but stop being hypocrites when telling me that my choices are wrong , because thats not choice at all .
“ But I hazarded a guess that his longevity of existence was probably severely curtailed , ” she said .
Still , the team reached a conclusion that surprised them : “ There was no real compelling reason to think of bringing him back to Florida , ” Father O’Loughlin said .
“ We needed to focus on getting help to him or him to help in Guatemala . ”
Help has been slow in arriving .
When The Times took the trek to visit him in late June , Mr. Jiménez had not budged from his hilltop home since returning there and no medical professional had visited him , either .
With his mother too frail to move him into his wheelchair , his life had shrunken to the confines of his bed , across from his mother ’s .
During the visit , Mr. Jiménez , wearing a nubby Adidas hat and a ski jacket , sat wrapped in a Guatemalan blanket ; his mother , who wore a traditional woven skirt , with a floral scarf braided through her long gray hair , stood by his side .
She patted his head ; he reached out to pick lint from her sweater .
A few days prior , he had suffered a particularly violent seizure .
“ He was almost dead , ” his mother , Mrs. Gervacio , said in Kanjobal , which was translated into Spanish by a school principal serving as interpreter .
“ For many years , I am caring for him like he is a baby , changing his diaper , washing him .
But this is worse .
I am worried to leave him alone at all . ”
She is right to worry , said physicians consulted for this article .
Patients suffering seizure disorders run the risk of injuring themselves  and of increasing their brain damage .
Still , Mrs. Gervacio does leave from time to time , she said , to go to Mass , shutting the door behind her and hoping for the best .
“ It scares me a lot when you leave , Mama ! ” Mr. Jiménez blurted out , revealing that he was intently following the conversation that at first took place as if he were not there .
The Washington Post reports today that Sarah Palin " accepted gifts valued at $ 25,367 from industry executives , municipalities and a cultural center whose board includes officials from some of the largest mining interests in the state . "
On a somewhat related note , Mark Kleiman asks :
When are we going to see Sarah Palin 's tax returns ?
‘ DIVORCED ’ FROM EVERYDAY CHALLENGES ….
At last night ’s forum on national service , John McCain made an unusual concession : “ Listen , mayors have the toughest job , I think , in America .
It ’s easy for me to go to Washington and , frankly , be somewhat divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have . ”
The context was n’t helpful .
Instead of explaining how he really can relate to everyday challenges facing regular Americans , McCain simply moved on to talking about how much he admires mayors and others who get involved in their communities .
Now , I suppose I know what McCain was trying to say .
His point , I guess , was that those who serve at the local level see firsthand the challenges people face in their daily lives , while for long - time congressman , like McCain , those problems can be more of an abstraction .
I doubt he was literally admitting , on national television , that he ’s wildly out of touch .
Nevertheless , that is what he said .
Not only was it a foolish remark , but it happens to play directly into one of the Obama campaign ’s most frequent criticisms of McCain .
It could , in theory , be a moment akin to H.W. Bush ’s checkout - scanner flap from 1992 .
( I know most of that story is bogus , but the myth lingers . )
Indeed , it ’s surprisingly straightforward — Obama accused McCain of being out of touch , and McCain told a national television audience that he finds it “ easy ” to be “ divorced from the day - to - day challenges people have . ”
So , here ’s my question : why is n’t this the single biggest story of the day ?
Why would n’t this rival , say , the “ lipstick on a pig ” nonsense ?
Why are n’t the cable networks spending the afternoon analyzing the consequences of McCain ’s horrendous and humiliating mistake ?
Put it this way — imagine if Obama told a national television audience last night that he feels like a “ celebrity , ” and finds it easy to think that he ’s “ better and smarter than everyone else . ”
What do you suppose the reaction would be from the political world ?
Before you say , “ The Obama campaign is n’t pushing this aggressively , ” realize that the Obama campaign held a conference call this morning , with Dick Durbin and Rahm Emanuel , precisely to push this story as hard as they could .
And yet , this probably is n’t going anywhere .
Joe Scarborough said this week that the media will talk about “ whatever the McCain campaign wants us to talk about . ”
NBC News Washington bureau chief Mark Whitaker praised the McCain campaign for its ability to “ drive the news cycle day after day . ”
I get the feeling there ’s a media decoder ring , and the Obama campaign does n’t have one .
On the last day of January 2005 , Steven D. Green , the former Army private accused of raping a 14 - year - old Iraqi girl and murdering her family , sat in a Texas jail on alcohol - possession charges , an unemployed 19 - year - old high school dropout who had just racked up his third misdemeanor conviction .
Days later , Mr. Green enlisted in a soldier - strapped Army , and was later assigned to a star - crossed unit to serve on an especially murderous patch of earth .
He arrived at the very moment that the Army was increasing by nearly half the rate at which it granted what it calls “ moral waivers ” to potential recruits .
The change opened the ranks to more people like Mr. Green , those with minor criminal records and weak educational backgrounds .
In Mr. Green ’s case , his problems were emerging by junior high school , say people who knew him then .
Mr. Green ’s
Army waiver allowed a troubled young man into the heart of a war that bore little resemblance to its original declared purposes , but which continued to need thousands of fresh recruits .
This week on Exiled , Meleny , a 20 - year - old from Long Island and the proud owner of Juicy Couture velour tracksuits in every color of the rainbow , was sent to live in the mountains of Peru .
When she got there and got a look at the sub - standard ( her standards , mind you ) living conditions , she cried and informed her host that she did n't want to do any work .
She was later offered a fried guinea pig as a gift and the next morning , threw it all up ( to be honest , when I visited Peru in March , it was a meal of guinea pig that finally loosened my bowels after an 8 - day stretch of being stopped up . )
Sick of all her whining , her host ended up telling her that she says " stupid things . "

Another theory is that typical approaches to problem - solving may decay or weaken during sleep , enabling the brain to switch to more innovative alternatives .
A classic switching story , recounted in “ A Popular History of American Invention ” in 1924 , involves Elias Howe ’s invention of the automated sewing machine : after much frustration with his original model , which used a needle with an eye in the middle , Howe dreamed that he was being attacked by painted warriors brandishing spears with holes in the sharp end .
He patented a new design based on the dream spears ; by the time the patent expired in 1867 , he had earned more than $ 2 million in royalties .
Spear - wielding savages make for compelling stories , but creative insights directly induced by dreams are rare .
In general , people are unaware of sleep ’s effects on their performance .
Dr. Ellenbogen ’s research at Harvard indicates that if an incubation period includes sleep , people are 33 percent more likely to infer connections among distantly related ideas , and yet , as he puts it , these performance enhancements exist “ completely beneath the radar screen . ”
In other words , people are more creative after sleep , but they do n’t know it .
This lack of awareness makes it hard to identify specific aha !
insights that have been prompted by sleep .
“ It ’s more that sleep brings a change of approach , ” explains Mark Holmes , an art director at Pixar Animation Studios who worked on the film “ Wall - E . ” “ You can get tunnel vision when you ’re hammering away at a problem .
You keep going down this same path , again and again , just tweaking , making incremental changes at best .
” He continues : “ Sleep erases that .
It resets you .
You wake up and realize  wait a minute !
 there is another way to do this . ”
Business attitudes toward sleep may be starting to shift .
Claire Stapleton , a spokeswoman for Google , says “ grassroots ” interest in sleep led to an on -campus talk by Sara C. Mednick a napping expert .
Google also installed EnergyPods , leather recliners with egglike hoods that block noise and light , for employees to take naps at work .

ANCHORAGE , Alaska , Sept. 20 ( UPI ) --
The Alaska state legislator leading an investigation of Republican U.S. vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin says the probe will be completed by Oct. 10 .
Alaska state Sen. Hollis French , a Democrat , said Friday that even without the cooperation of three key witnesses , including the Alaska governor 's husband Todd Palin , the investigation of the so - called " Troopergate " scandal will wrap up before the November presidential election , The New York Times reported .

French said investigator Stephen Branchflower has assured him the probe of whether Sarah Palin improperly pushed for the ouster of Alaska 's former public safety commissioner over a personal matter involving a state trooper will be completed despite the lack of cooperation of key witnesses Todd Palin , Ivy Frye and Randy Ruaro .
Gov. Palin initially pledged cooperation with the investigation , but that has changed , with her supporters now saying French 's investigation has turned into an attempt to affect the political fortunes of GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain of Arizona .
Gov. Palin initially denied pressing former Alaska Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan for action against her ex-brother - in - law , state trooper Mike Wooten , CNN reported .
But last month she admitted her aides had contacted Monegan 's office nearly two dozen times about Wooten .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Federal officials on Sunday unveiled an extraordinary takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , putting the government in charge of the twin mortgage giants and the $ 5 trillion in home loans they back .
The move , which extends as much as $ 200 billion in Treasury support to the two companies , marks Washington 's most dramatic attempt yet to shore up the nation 's housing market , which is suffering from record foreclosures and falling prices .
The sweeping plan , announced by Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and James Lockhart , director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , places the two companies into a " conservatorship " to be overseen by the Federal Housing Finance Agency .
Under conservatorship , the government would temporarily run Fannie and Freddie until they are on stronger footing .
" A failure [ of Fannie and Freddie ] would affect the ability of Americans to get home loans , auto loans and other consumer credit and business finance , " Paulson said at a press conference in Washington .
" And a failure would be harmful to economic growth and job creation . "
Fannie ( FNM , Fortune 500 ) and Freddie ( FRE , Fortune 500 ) , which were created by the U.S. government , have been badly hurt in the last year by the sharp decline in home prices as well as rising mortgage delinquencies and foreclosures .
All told , the two firms have racked up about $ 12 billion in losses since last summer .
On Sunday , officials stressed that both Fannie and Freddie will be open for business on Monday morning , although the firms will have undergone a dramatic facelift by then .
Freddie CEO Richard Syron and Fannie CEO Daniel Mudd will no longer run the agencies , while the FHFA will assume control of the boards .
Regulators took care not to foist blame on the two executives , adding that they would stick around to help with the transition .
Syron and Mudd will be replaced by two finance veterans charged with restoring the mortgage titans to health .
Herb Allison , the former chairman and CEO of pension provider TIAA - CREF , will head Fannie Mae.
Allison formerly served as president of Merrill Lynch .
David Moffett , who served as vice chairman and chief financial officer of U.S. Bancorp until early 2007 and then joined the Carlyle Group private - equity firm as a senior adviser , will take over Freddie Mac .
At the same time , dividends on both common and preferred shares will be eliminated in an effort to conserve about $ 2 billion annually .
All of the firms ' lobbying and political activities will be halted immediately and charitable activities reviewed .
In addition , the Treasury Department announced a series of moves targeted at providing relief to both housing and financial markets .
Paulson said Treasury would boost housing by purchasing mortgage - backed securities from Freddie and Fannie , as well as offering to lend money to the companies and the 12 Federal Home Loan Banks .
The home loan banks advance funds to more than 8,000 member banks .
( Read what Paulson said . )
The Treasury , with fellow regulator FHFA , will also buy preferred stock in Fannie and Freddie to provide security to the companies ' debt holders and bolster housing finance .
The government , in agreeing to backstop the firms , said it would receive $ 1 billion in each company 's senior preferred stock .
The government will also receive a quarterly dividend payment and the right to own 79.9 % of each company .
How we got here
Sunday 's announcement brings an end to months of speculation about the fate of the two firms .
Shares of Fannie and Freddie , which have fallen more than 80 % as of the end of Friday 's session , were hammered this summer among concerns they would need to raise additional funds to cover future losses or need to be taken over by its federal regulator .
Investors feared that either step would reduce or wipe out the value of current shareholders ' stakes .
In mid-July , the Treasury Department and Federal Reserve announced steps in to make funds available to the firms if necessary and Congress approved the sweeping proposals later that month .
Shortly thereafter , regulators stepped up their review of Fannie and Freddie .
Paulson announced in August that he had tapped Wall Street firm Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) to help him examine the firms .
Sources familiar with the matter told Fortune that Morgan Stanley had determined that both Freddie and Fannie faced " meaningful " capital issues before deciding last week that government intervention was necessary .
Morgan Stanley has called a firm - wide meeting on Monday morning to explain the deal .
Officials ruled out a capital infusion - a less drastic option than convervatorship - after considering questions such as whether the government would have to keep putting money in and how best Treasury officials could protect taxpayers , according to one of the sources .
In the end , the route taken amounts to " a timeout , not a liquidation , " says the source .
" Conservatorship leaves all options open for the next administration . "
Following an exhaustive review , FHFA 's Lockhart said Sunday that the two companies could not continue to operate without taking " significant action . "
Fannie and Freddie have become virtually the only source of funding for banks and other home lenders looking to make home loans .
Their ability to do so is crucial to the recovery of the battered home market and the broader U.S. economy .
The two firms buy loans , attach a guarantee , then sell securities backed by the loans ' income stream .
All told , they own or back $ 5.4 trillion worth of home debt - half the mortgage debt in the country .
Reaction to the news
The Treasury - FHFA plan , which was widely anticipated after financial markets closed on Friday , drew praise from regulators , lawmakers and some market experts .
President Bush called the move " critical " to the housing market recovery .
" Americans should be confident that the actions taken today will strengthen our ability to weather the housing correction and are critical to returning the economy to stronger sustained growth in the future , " he said .
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke , who along with Paulson has led efforts to help get the U.S. housing market and the broader economy back on track , endorsed the move by Lockhart and Paulson .
" These necessary steps will help to strengthen the U.S. housing market and promote stability in our financial markets , " Bernanke said in a statement .
Sen. Charles Schumer , D - N.Y. , a member of the Senate Banking Committee , said that Paulson had " threaded the needle just right " with the plan , noting that it will likely be met with praise from other lawmakers .
At first blush , Wall Street seemed encouraged by the news , although the true test will come when financial markets around the globe open Monday .
Pimco's Bill Gross , a widely followed bond fund manager , said that the Freddie - Fannie plan was the right move .
" This is a significant step and almost exactly what we had hoped for , " Gross told CNNMoney.com Sunday .
In addition to confirming the government 's sovereign credit rating , Standard & Poor 's affirmed its sterling AAA rating on both Fannie Freddie on the news , adding that its outlook for the two firms is stable .
Unanswered questions
The cost of the government intervention remains unclear however .
Experts argue that it will depend in large part on the structure of the rescue , the direction of home prices and mortgage default rates .
Still it seems almost certain it will run into the billions and will most likely eclipse such other high - profile government bailouts including than the Federal Reserve 's $ 29 billion backing of Bear Stearns assets when it was taken over by J.P. Morgan Chase .
Paulson said that the cost to taxpayers would largely depend on the future financial performance of Fannie and Freddie .
Another unintended yet unavoidable consequence may be the impact to the nation 's banks .
Some of the nation 's largest financial institutions including JPMorgan Chase ( JPM , Fortune 500 ) and Sovereign Bancorp ( SOV , Fortune 500 ) own a big chunk of the estimated $ 36 billion in preferred shares of Fannie and Freddie , according to research published last month by Keefe , Bruyette & Woods , an investment bank that specializes in financial firms .
Those stakes are at risk of being wiped out as a result of Sunday 's announcement .
Top banking regulators , including the Federal Reserve as well as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , said in a joint statement Sunday that a limited number of smaller institutions have significant preferred share holdings in Fannie and Freddie .
They added they are prepared to work with these institutions to come up with a plan should they need to raise capital .
Still , the rescue of Fannie and Freddie could go a long way toward its intended aim - bringing stability to the housing market while making it easier for consumers to obtain affordable mortgages .
An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the government would invest $ 1 billion in each company 's preferred stock .

As people on Wall Street and Main Street hold their breath to see if a federal bailout of the nation 's financial institutions will work , Americans are starting to speak — not whisper — the word " depression . "
In a sign that anxiety is growing , 33 % of 1,011 adults surveyed over the weekend by USA TODAY and Gallup said the economy already is in a depression ( though by economists ' measures it is not ) .
Just 12 % said that 10 months ago .
THE BILL : Read the proposed bailout plan from Congress KEY QUESTION : Will bailout plan work ?
" From the working people 's point of view , we 're losing jobs and have rising unemployment , " says Charles Dooley , 64 , of Audubon , N.J. , who delivers newspapers for The Philadelphia Inquirer .
" Yes , I think we 're in a depression . "
Seventy - three percent said U.S. financial troubles will get worse before they get better .
They expect their taxes to go up , and many worry about affording retirement or maintaining their standard of living .
Nearly half worry about their homes losing value ; 20 % are seriously looking at taking money out of the stock market .
Trust is shifting from stocks and real estate to federally insured bank CDs .
And nearly 30 % have postponed , or are thinking about postponing , a big purchase .
Almost half of those with jobs are more worried than before that the Wall Street crisis will mean their pay or benefits will be cut .
But beyond the current woes , 58 % of Americans see better economic times ahead — in just a year .
Only 3 % think the economy is growing now , but 42 % expect it to be growing a year from now .
While 69 % say we 're in a recession or depression , only 36 % think it will be that bad in a year .
And in fact , the economic woes are nothing close to the Great Depression , even if it feels that way to some .
We 're nowhere near the days of wandering homelessness evoked in John Steinbeck 's 1939 Pulitzer Prize - winning novel , The Grapes of Wrath .
Starting in 1929 , the U.S. economy shrank for four consecutive years .
In 1940 , the economy still was smaller than in 1929 before the stock crash .
The economy today , though wounded , continues to expand .
It grew at an annual rate of 2.8 % in the second quarter .
Unemployment in the 1930s was staggering , above 20 % for four years .
In 1933 , 24.9 % of the labor force was jobless .
Today , it 's 6.1 % .
The Dow is down 21 % from its October 2007 high .
That 's less than it lost in the first two days of the rout that brought on the Great Depression .
Among poll respondents who do n't buy talk of depression is Richard Dotson , 55 , of Roscommon , Mich. , who works for an air conditioning company .
" We 're not in a depression , " he says .
" A depression is soup lines , is people sleeping in tents .
The ( political ) leaders are exaggerating and trying to get people 's attention . "
But regardless of whether people think we 're in a recession or a depression — or neither — Americans are changing their financial habits .
Here 's how : Cutting back spending Fifteen percent of those surveyed said they have postponed a major purchase because of economic uncertainty , and another 14 % are thinking about it .
Erin Stephens , 42 , a recent college graduate in Salt Lake City , thought this year would be a little easier for her family .
Her husband is making 5 % to 10 % more than last year and her new degree in social work should have meant a job soon , but has n't .
Instead , the family is eating out less , shopping less and planning less exotic vacations .
She considered a trip to the Galapagos Islands , charging it on her credit card and paying it off later , but decided now's not the right time for such a big expense .
Stephens and her husband also dropped plans to buy a cabin this summer .
" I was afraid to have the money out there , " she says , " because now we 're getting paid a little more but we 're barely breaking even . "
Stephens says she has n't quite figured out why money feels so tight this year .
" I do n't know .
I was a little careless before , and I was n't really budgeting myself , " she says .
" I was just kind of cruising along . "
The economic problems this year were " a wake - up call , " she says .
" Now I 'm concerned about it , and I watch what I spend . "
Maintaining living standards
Twenty - four percent of Americans are " very " worried about maintaining their standard of living , double the percentage in April 2002 .
And 32 % are " moderately " worried , up from 23 % .
Doreen Mangels , a 44 - year - old learning specialist from Old Lyme , Conn. , says rising costs are squeezing her family 's already tight income .
A disability forced her husband to retire early a few years ago , and they might have to tap their 401 ( k ) funds sooner than expected .
Says Mangels , " I see our 401 ( k ) accounts shrinking because of the financial crisis , and it makes me nervous . "
Her biggest concern now is the coming winter .
She 's already putting away money to pay for higher home heating oil prices she expects this winter , and is looking to pick up more hours at work .
" We 're trying to save money now , anticipating that we 're going to have to lay out big sums later on for heating , " she says .
" We 're cutting back on repairs we would do around the house . …
We did n't take any vacations this year , and we have n't been to the movies or eaten out in months . "
Mangels thinks her situation , due to her husband 's disability , is not the norm , but , " Our personal story is exacerbated by what 's going on in the whole country . "
Affording retirement Sixty - four percent of those surveyed are worried about having enough money for retirement .
And the percentage who are " very " worried has risen to 33 % from 25 % in April 2002 .
They 've also grown more conservative in saving : 31 % say the best long - term investment is a savings account or CD , vs. 16 % in July 2002 .
It 's the opposite for real estate :
It went from 50 % in 2002 to 26 % .
Judy Perotti , 59 , of Winsted , Conn. , is an underwriting assistant .
She is so concerned about the economy that she decided to delay retirement .
High travel costs mean fewer trips to see her young grandchildren .
And she 's putting off purchases .
" We 're in a depression .
Just the way people are struggling to maintain homes , provide food for families .
They 're very cautious about how they 're spending their money , " she says .
" I do n't purchase anything unless it 's essential .
Before , I would buy something and not think about it .
Now I 'm worried about providing for myself . "
Retirement anytime soon is n't likely , she says .
" I had hoped to retire in the next year and see more of my grandchildren , but now I think that 's not possible .
I 'll have to stay working .
Maybe I 'll retire at 65 .
A couple of years ago , I was confident . "
Paying higher taxes
The vast majority of Americans surveyed — 72 % — are sure about one thing :
The financial bailout will mean higher taxes .
" I 'm afraid someone will want to raise the federal tax on retirement income , " says Richard Gallagher , 66 , a retired schoolteacher from Cornelia , Ga .
He says rising gasoline and travel prices already are pinching his retirement .
" We like to travel , " he says .
" We 're supposed to go ( on vacation ) , but unless I can locate ( affordable ) gas , we may not go . "
Still , he is optimistic about the long - term health of the economy .
" It 's going to come around .
This is not the time to sell your stock .
I think we 'll pull out of this .
I first started teaching in 1966 and I earned $ 3,600 a year .
So I 've seen my station in life go up . "
Losing job security Only 26 % of Americans are worried about losing their jobs , but 46 % worry about benefit cuts and 44 % worry that they 'll earn less in the future .
Dan Egan , a 50 - year - old former Marine who runs a pest - control business in Los Angeles , says it feels like the country is in a depression .
While he 's optimistic about his personal situation , he has family members and friends who have lost their jobs .
His brother was laid off from his job with the phone company ; his sister was laid off as a teacher at a Catholic school .
A friend who has owned a restaurant for 25 years has seen business fall off 50 % , forcing him to lay off staff .
" It 's trickling through the whole system , " he says .
But Egan keeps thinking about advice his parents gave him .
" My mom and dad lived through the Depression , " he says .
" They said , during the Depression , it was the people who could work with their hands that made a living .
I can do anything .
I can fix things , I can build houses , I can do electrical , plumbing , I can fix cars . "
Egan says he's not sure if the economy has hit bottom , but he 's investing in something many people are running away from : real estate .
He 's looking at buying foreclosed properties .
Paying monthly bills Forty - four percent of Americans are worried about paying monthly bills , and the anxiety is growing .
Those who are " very worried " about paying their bills doubled to 20 % from 11 % in April 2002 .
For 37 - year - old Shauna Peterson of Las Vegas , high gas prices turned her world upside down .
She 's been staying at home , caring for her baby daughter , and relying on her fiance 's paychecks .
Last year , they made ends meet .
But when gas topped $ 4 a gallon , they could no longer afford to fill up his pickup so he could get to welding jobs .
Now they 're struggling to come up with gas money for the 10 - mile drive to social services to apply for help paying their rent .
They 've tried riding bikes , but their bicycles were stolen .
" No matter which way we seem to turn , it gets worse , " she says .
" The poor man is stealing from the poor man so he can get by .
I can't necessarily shake my finger and say , ' Shame on you , you should go to hell , ' because they 're just trying to get by like we are .
I try to keep my head up and stay positive . "
The plan now is to leave Las Vegas for Oklahoma , where family will help them with jobs and day care .
But first , they 've got to raise gas money for the 1,000 - mile drive .
She is selling her 1985 Camaro , her fiance is selling a flatbed trailer and an engine hoist .
Then , maybe , they 'll have enough to go .
" Moving out of state , " Peterson says .
" That 's about the only way we can solve our problems . "
Now that sounds a bit like the Great Depression .

Andrew Leonard has an interesting theory about what Paulson and Bernanke may be thinking — namely , that mortgage - related securities are wildly underpriced , and that the Treasury can create a market that will lead to major upward revaluations , and we ’ll all live happily thereafter .
I would quarrel with that theory — at least so far , the losses acknowledged by the financial system still fall short of the true , “ hold - to - maturity ” losses we can expect given the decline in housing prices ; plus , does it really take $ 700 billion to create “ price discovery ” ?
But even before we get to substantive discussion of the theory , here ’s the thing to notice : this is n’t what we know Paulson is thinking , it ’s an attempt to infer , based on very few clues , what Paulson might be thinking .
Why does n’t he just tell us ?
The two striking things about the Paulson push since last Friday have been ( 1 ) demands for complete discretion , with zero accountability and ( 2 ) a complete refusal to explain the theory of the case — to explain why this thing is supposed to work , so that we can have an open discussion of whether he ’s right .
The whole premise of the bailout push has been “ We ’re the grownups , we know what we ’re doing , just trust us . ”
Sorry , but that ’s how Colin Powell sold the Iraq war .
Fool me once , shame on you , fool me twice … you should n’t get fooled .
And that , by the way , is why Paulson ’s whopper about oversight matters .
On one hand , the secretary poses as the adult providing supervision , with no need to explain his decisions ; on the other , caught with his hand in the cookie jar , he offers childish excuses .
No more taking this administration on faith — and Paulson ’s performance over the last few days has made it clear that yes , he is a Bush administration official , with the trademark inability to take responsibility for his own actions .
Explain what you ’re doing and why — or get out of the way , and let Chris Dodd and Barney Frank write the plan .
A further thought :
This “ price discovery ” stuff is , when you think about it , closely related to the face - slap theory of central bank intervention .
And $ 700 billion is a lot to pay for slapping markets in the face , yet again .
John McCain likes to call Barack Obama a “ celebrity ” – but guess who ’s been using a superstar makeup crew ?
Us Weekly reports McCain paid beauty - school grad Tifanie
White – who ’s done faces for “ American Idol ” - $ 5,583.43 to get him camera ready for TV spots .
The candidate , 72 , spent over twice as much touching up his face as Sarah Palin did on her Valentino jacket , which she wore during her acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention .
Sarah Palin
DIGG THIS
No one who has anything nice to say about Ron Paul can be all bad .
Sarah Palin has said nice things about Ron Paul ( see here , here , here , here and here ) .
Ergo , therefore , as a result , it cannot be denied , it logically follows , Sarah Palin can not be all bad .
That is , she can not be all bad no matter what else she is guilty of ( within reason of course . )
So , what are the criticisms of her ?
First and foremost , she is accused of not having enough experience .
I admit it !
She does not have enough experience .
Enough experience , that is , to become emperor of the world .
Yes , John McCain , Barack Obama and Joe Biden do seek this post of planetary domination , now held by George Bush .
That is , these three show every evidence of wanting to continue the U.S. role as hegemon of the entire globe .
Now , it may well be that Palin will in future be seduced into this sort of ambition .
But , at least as of right now , there is little or no evidence of it ( apart from some pro-war sentiment ) .
Of the four presidential and vice presidential candidates , her present experience shows the least desire to rule the world .
So , her " lack of experience " is a good thing , not a bad one .
Does she have enough " experience " to be president of a country with a limited government , and no aspiration to be world dictator ?
Of course she does .
And , again , she has more experience in this regard than either McCain , Obama or Biden .
She , alone of the four of them , has had executive experience as the Governor of the great state of Alaska , while the other three have been whiling their way in a relatively unimportant institution , in this era of presidential power .
So , do n’t talk to me about experience , as a critique of this lady .
Second , it is said that with five children , she has too many other obligations to take on the role of vice president .
Give me a break .
She ca n’t vote in the senate when there is a tie ?
C’mon !
This charge emanates from left - wing feminists , of course .
Suppose Hillary were to have had five children the ages of Sarah’s .
Would the legions of her supporters be making this case with regard to Mrs. Clinton ?
To ask this is to answer it .
In that case , Hillary ’s ascendency would only serve as evidence that " You can have it all . "
The hypocrisy of these " feminists " stinks to the high heavens .
They do not support the idea of women breaking through the so - called glass ceiling .
Rather , they favor left - wing socialist females being given positions of authority and responsibility .
This is something very different .
It is a rare occasion that these feminists have been caught with their contradictions so much in the public eye .
All those sick and tired of these harridans ought to thank Sarah for this one boon alone .
Third , a criticism made by some libertarians is that her adherence to our principles is only skin deep ; she has raised some taxes , considered banning some books from libraries , engaged in public - private ventures regarding oil pipelines , she is altogether too friendly to US foreign aggression .
Yes , yes , she is no libertarian , certainly not of the purist variety .
She is no Ron Paul .
But , a little context here , please .
She stands head and shoulders above McCain , Obama and Biden .
What about matching her up against all the other 49 governors ?
Well , Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is not all bad as far as these things go , and there might be another half dozen of this breed , mainly in the poorly populated states west of the Mississippi , but surely Sarah Palin fits comfortably into this category .
According to this source , tax freedom day arrives earliest in Alaska , of all 50 states .
Not too shabby , at least in this context .
She favors drilling in the ANWR , and that alone is worth the price of admission .
Another critique emanating from this quarter is that even if Sarah is n’t all that bad in terms of libertarianism , at least compared to her peers , as soon as she goes to Washington D.C. as Vice President , she will " grow in office " and become more acceptable to socialists such as those who plague the New York Times , Newsweek , NBC and the other major media outlets .
Well , yes , I suppose , this could happen .
But , again , let us not lose sight of context .
This has already taken place for the likes of McCain , Obama and Biden , who have been located in the beltway for many , many years .
And , yes , there are indeed " libertarian " think tanks now located inside the beltway whose adherence to this philosophy has , sadly , deteriorated in the last little while .
But there is no necessity that this disease will afflict Sarah .
Indeed , there are groups , organizations and people who serve as counterexamples , and illustrate the concept of free will .
Exhibit " A " is of course Ron Paul .
He has been a denizen of Washington D.C. for decades now , and shows no signs of yielding to this affliction .
George Ayittey is as strong a supporter of the free society as he was when he first became a professor of economics at American University many years ago .
Tom DiLorenzo is located near the beltway in Baltimore , and is second to none in his adherence of libertarianism .
Then , too , there are a whole host of libertarians on the faculty of nearby George Mason University .
The Mises Institute itself , bastion of liberty and world headquarters of the Austro - libertarian movement , was for a time located in the DC environs .
They departed , but not at all out of fear of compromising with the principles of freedom .
Now that we have dealt with the spurious criticisms , what are the benefits of the Palin candidacy ?
First and foremost , just sit back and relax for a moment , and consider this scenario .
The McCain ( ugh ! ) — Palin ( whoop - di - do ) ticket is elected in November .
The duffer kicks the bucket after a heart attack in early 2009 , and our girl is now President of these here United States .
Who does she choose as Vice President ?
Why , a certain Congressman from Texas .
I ’m not at liberty to reveal his name at the present time , but I ’ll give you a hint : he is widely known by both friends and enemies as " Dr. No . "
Double whoop - di - do , say I .
No , quadruple .
Unlikely ?
Yes .
But politically impossible ?
No .
Did you notice how Sarah is widely referred to , when in formal mode ?
Yes , as Mrs. Palin , not Ms. Palin .
Is n’t that wonderful ?
Does n’t that really stick it to the socialist feminists ?
Yes , indeedy do .
And , there is no group that more deserves such a come - uppance than they .
They have long striven to stuff this horrid bit of nomenclature ( see here ) down our collective throats , and , on all too many occasions have succeeded .
It is time , it is long past time , that we jettison this insufferable politically correct attack on traditional gender distinction .
She delivers a hugely deserved kick in the teeth to those limousine liberals who infest both east and west coasts of our country .
I ’m talking about the intellectual - academic - cultural " elites " who dismiss the rest of the populace as inhabiting " fly over " country .
Here is a rifle toting , moose killing , basketball playing , beauty contest winning , charismatic and eloquent long happily married conservative hockey mom who has made something of herself in a very competitive field , who has not gone to finishing school at Harvard , Yale or Princeton .
She does not revere the mainstream media ; far from it .
She is a breath of fresh air blowing in from our northernmost state .
God bless her .
Sarah has almost entirely pushed Obama off television , and newspaper headlines .
The timing of McCain ’s announcement of her candidacy as Vice President could not have been better .
It took focus off Obama ’s windy , insufferable , socialist but , yes , eloquent , acceptance speech like no other announcement could have done .
If that , alone , was Sarah ’s only accomplishment , it would have almost been worth it .
True confession time .
Before Palin ( BP ) , I was leaning toward Obama .
I thought he was marginally less likely to drop a nuclear bomb on some hapless third world country than mad bomber McCain .
I regarded , and still do , foreign policy as more important than domestic , given that " war is the health of the state . "
And , there was very little to choose between the Republocrats and the Demopublicans on economics .
Socialism from both quarters ( although I admit it , the prospect of Alan Dershowitz on the Supreme Court did give me pause for thought ) .
But now , after Palin ( AP ) , I am shifting my allegiance to the Republicans .
Go , Sarah , go !
But what about the libertarians ?
Do n’t speak to me about the libertarians !
The Barr - Root ticket is arguably less libertarian than Sarah Palin .
Barr in particular has been a gigantic disappointment ( see here and here ) .
Actually , the man is a thief .
He has stolen our Libertarian Party from us , and I ’ll not again support it , at least not on the national level , until all vestiges of his theft have been wiped away .
I have sympathy for the Constitution Party and for the Boston Tea Party , but they will be on too few ballots to even seriously consider them .
So , one cheer for the Republicans ; God help me .
( I know Murray is up there , somewhere ; Murray , please do n’t read this last sentence . )
A side note .
Anyone notice the stupendous similarity , not to say identity , between Barack ’s proposed tax policies , and Milton Friedman ’s negative income tax ?
In the former case , Obama would lower income taxes for just about everyone , except of course for those who make the greatest contributions to the economy and to society .
But what about the really poor , who now pay no income taxes at all ?
It would be unfair not to give them any tax reduction benefits , of course , at least for the Democrats .
So , B.O. will give them a tax benefit in the form of a subsidy .
But , is this not precisely the Friedman negative income tax plan ?
Thus , it would appear , Obama is a Friedmanite , or , Friedman was a precursor to Obama .
Take that , all you critics of those of us who have long considered Friedman to be a socialist ( on that see here , here , here , here , here , and here ) .
When Ludwig von Mises walked out of a session at the first meeting of the Mont Pelerin Society , saying " You ’re all a bunch of socialists , " it was presumably some version of this plan to which he was objecting .

The Best of Walter E. Block

Murray aims to become the first British man since 1936 to win a Grand Slam Britain 's Andy Murray completed a sensational victory over world number one Rafael Nadal to reach his first Grand Slam final at the US Open .
The Scot , 21 , resumed the rain delayed semi-final leading by two sets but trailing by a break , and Nadal soon cut the deficit by winning the third set .
But Murray recovered from a break down in the fourth set to beat the Spaniard 6 - 2 7 - 6 ( 7 - 5 ) 4 - 6 6 - 4 .
He faces four - time defending champion Roger Federer in Monday 's final .
Murray is aiming to become the first British man to win a Grand Slam singles title since Fred Perry won the US Open in 1936 .
The final will take place a day late , at 2200 BST , after the rain disruption on Saturday that resulted in Murray being agonisingly halted , having won the first two sets .
It brought back memories of Murray 's predecessor as British number one , Tim Henman , who famously lost a Wimbledon semi-final to Goran Ivanisevic in 2001 when rain seemingly stopped the home favourite in his tracks .
Murray has already equalled Henman by assuring himself of a world ranking of four after the tournament and he has matched Greg Rusedski's run to the US Open final in 1997 .
But he has surely proved himself to be a greater talent than either of his compatriots with victory over the seemingly unbeatable Nadal .
The Spaniard came into the semi-final with a 5 - 0 record against Murray , having won the French Open , Wimbledon and the Olympic title in recent months and eyeing a first US Open crown .
It 's awesome to beat him , a great feeling
Andy Murray Murray , in contrast , was playing his first Grand Slam semi and had to put a crushing defeat by Nadal at Wimbledon out of his mind .
He did so magnificently - and it was all the more impressive as he effectively had to win the match twice .
Murray had played superbly on Saturday to take charge on the Louis Armstrong Stadium , totally dominating on serve and breaking three times as he forged two sets clear before Nadal grabbed an early break in the third .
606 : DEBATE
It seemed the rain might have come at the right time for Nadal and he began in much more positive fashion when play resumed on Sunday , with the match switched to the 23,000 - seater Arthur Ashe Stadium .
Murray managed to earn one opportunity to get the break back in game 12 of the third set but Nadal fired down an ace before converting his second set point .
Both players hit the heights in the early stages of the fourth set but it was Murray who was keen to take the initiative .
After saving an early break point with an ace , the Scot fashioned seven chances to break in game two but Nadal just would not yield .
And having escaped from that crucial game he immediately broke Murray to love and appeared to be closing on a fifth set .
I did a good semi-final and when I arrived I had too many matches on my shoulders
Rafael Nadal But Murray remained undaunted and continued to press , breaking back at 3 - 3 as he dictated the rallies and forced errors from Nadal .
A place in the final was within sight now for the Briton and he shrugged off a missed break point in game eight , easily holding serve before setting about the Spaniard 's serve again at 5 - 4 .
Murray got a huge slice of luck with a net cord on the first point and at deuce he made his move , darting into the net to punch away a volley before chasing down a poor drop shot on match point and making the backhand pass .
" It 's awesome to beat him , a great feeling , " said Murray afterwards .
" He 's beaten me five times in a row , so that was tough , and to do it in a semi meant it was really difficult .
" With the rain delay yesterday , and it was windy today , there were a lot of different things but I 'm happy I came through in the end .
" It was really tough to serve from the near end , it was very windy , so I knew I was going to have chances to break and I just had to hang in . "
Nadal stated : " I 'm disappointed but at the same time I 'm happy .
I did a good semi-final and when I arrived I had too many matches on my shoulders .
I leave the US Open with positive memories .
" He added : " I go on court all day with calm , try to fight as much as I can , going home knowing I tried everything .
" I had my chance in the fourth set .
I just did n't come back . "

Canadians have become more accepting of small -c conservative ideas in recent years , Conservative Leader Stephen Harper said Saturday , adding that his party needs to stay with the mainstream of political thinking to remain in office .
At a campaign stop in Fredericton , N.B. , Harper said public debates when he first got involved in politics were about free trade , balanced budgets , fiscal responsibility and how to lower taxes .
Now all of those are a reality , he said .
" We saw the Liberal party in the 1990s flip all of its previous positions on these issues , and adopt small - c conservative positions , " the prime minister said .
" This is where the Canadian public is in this day and age . "
He said his opponents in this campaign were reverting to old positions that the public had long ago turned away from .
" What ’s surprising to me in this election is to see all of the other parties , including the Liberal party , go basically to a pre-free trade , Cold War kind of approach to the economy , where they ’re against free trade , they want to spend more and if they have to raise taxes , that ’s fine , " he said .
Harper admitted that some members of his Conservative party were perhaps to the right of the " broad majority of Canadians " on some issues though .
" Not only do we want to pull Canadians towards conservatism , " he said , " also Conservatives have to move towards Canadians if they want to continue to govern the country . "
Small business measures announced
Harper was in Fredericton to visit a riding held by the Liberals since 1993 where incumbent MP Andy Scott is retiring .
The Conservatives believe they have a chance of winning it .
Speaking at a local contractor ’s office , the prime minister said a re-elected Conservative government would cut taxes and simplify federal paperwork requirements for small businesses .
Most of the measures he outlined had already been included in the 2008 federal budget , or other legislation .
They included :
A 20 per cent reduction in federal paperwork required of small business owners , to be implemented before the end of this year .
Easier access to a government venture capital fund to help budding technology companies sell their ideas and products .
Indexing lifetime capital gains tax exemptions to inflation to allow the handover of businesses to children and heirs .
Raising the threshold of the small business tax rate to $ 500 thousand .
Harper ’s next stop Saturday was Newfoundland and Labrador , where Progressive Conservative Premier Danny Williams has been harshly critical of the prime minister ’s leadership .
He told a crowd at the community centre in the town of Harbour Grace that the war of words with Williams did n't really matter .
" I can't tell you how to vote .
No one can tell a Newfoundlander and a Labradorian how to vote .
It 's not about personality fights .
It 's about your own best interests , " Harper said in the lone reference to the row with Williams .
Two of three Conservative MPs in Newfoundland are retiring before the Oct. 14 federal election , and CBC ’s Julie Van Dusen says Harper is keen to shore up his party ’s support in a province where the premier is urging people to vote " anything but Conservative . "
" It ’s a pretty feisty Stephen Harper who ’s heading off to Newfoundland and Labrador , " Van Dusen says .

Thanks for posting this Brad .
Forwarding to everyone I think could help get it taken up on high .
Just as with the Patriot act this was all planned out in advance , and is part of the reason for all of the rush .

A sustained orgy of excess and reckless behavior that neither The Fed nor Congress has been willing to address .
Again , for the peanut gallery : 1 . Level III assets must be fully disclosed along with all formula and models for their marks , quarterly , in the 10Q/10 K .
2. Derivatives must all be moved to a regulated exchange with a central counterparty to guarantee margin supervision .
No exceptions .
3. Leverage must be reduced to no more than 12:1 across the system .
No exceptions .
The right thing is to address the root cause of the problem as identified in the three points above , then for any firm that cannot make it on their own , force it through involuntary receivership and execute the conversion of debt ( bondholder stakes ) to equity .
Fuck Half - Measures .

It is high time to enact LaRouche 's Home Owners and Bank Protection Act , as desired by the Legislatures of a number of States .
The HBPA will do EVERYTHING to save the economy that the bailout would allegedly do , and be a whole Hell of a lot less expensive and dangerous !

Again , I assert one of the surest ways to get our country back is to strip corporations from having the rights of indiviuals .
Profit and domination is their bottom line , not the welfare of humanity .
War and global warming anyone ?
I 'm not saying all corporations are bad , but given human nature we have to use laws to curb its temptation to excess .
CORPORATIONS ARE NOT HUMANBEINGS , limit that legally !
As far as the meltdown , I think the new proposed plan is a starting point to stabilize the markets , but congress has to maintain oversight and ultimate control and use the money in increments to be paid back .
I like the idea of the public maintaining a portion of ownership in the investment banks , maybe finally a say in steering investments for public good instead of just elite greed .
Homeowner bankruptcy laws need addressed , and congress needs to remain flexible in addressing further uncovered problems and crimes and not allow itself to be rushed .
Screw emperor paulson 's proposal and mcsame 's hypocracy .

Grossly invalid actions and procedures are VOID AND OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT .
That would be the fate , no doubt , of any such Microsoft scenario .
But , this hypothetical illustrates the dangerous sweep of the law , nonetheless , which is a good thing .
You can get around the usual bars to lawsuit in this way , usually , in an analogous way to which one can escape an otherwise binding contract via unconscionability ( and lack of congressional intent to make a taking of the stock of every MS shareholder ) Patently unconstitutional .
But now , if the shoe is on the other foot , its doubtful even with the best of arguments if the little guys , similarly stripped of fundamental rights , would get relief from ANY court ANY where .
Somehow , when the big boys hired by the corporations from the big law firms show up with a gaggle of supporting attorneys , judges perk up and listen more closely to the case , in my observation .
Conversely , if one is representing oneself pro se , most judges try hard but it is difficult to get the same level of quality out of the judge when pro se , for one the judge has to work much harder to get to the crux of the issue without good lawyers on both sides .

Under these rules what is to stop the Treasury Secretary from using some of his $ 700B to game the market .
Buy up a bunch of shares ( that his friends or family have been told to buy ahead of time ) or any other tradable item , and drive up the price .
He would be using taxpayer dollars to enrich himself , his friends and family , and he can't be sued or indicted for insider trading .
Putting so much financial power into one person 's hands is not only anti-free market , but by making the Treasury Secretary above the law , you are making him / her a financial king .
A lot of economic damage to publically traded companies can be done in four years .
The Treasury Secretary 's job would be the most sought after job in the cabinet ( by the most ruthless and greedy individuals in the country ) .
If these kinds of powers are needed ( which I doubt ) , then there should be a sunset clause where he would have to go back to Congress and get renewed powers .
Limit the powers so that after the " crisis " is over we no longer have a financial king .

The only people we are bailing out with this $ 700B is the crooks .
Take out these people and freeze their accounts , all of them .
I think you will find $ 1,000T or more sitting in off shore accounts .

Grossly invalid actions and procedures are VOID AND OF NO FORCE AND EFFECT .
That would be the fate , no doubt , of any such Microsoft scenario .
True , but only if
1 ) the courts agree to take the case
2 ) rule against the motion for summary dismissal under section 8
3 ) AFTER the confiscation has occurred .
The establishment clause of Article III section 1 grants Congress the power to limit jurisdiction of courts inferior to the SCOTUS .
The no review clause of section 8 applies to district and appellate courts .
Thus , you will need a dismissal in federal district court , lose the appeal in federal circuit court , and be granted certiorari , before the section 8 Congressional limitation on review is finally before the SCOTUS to which that limitation in jurisdiction does not apply .

The deal to license First Division insignia riles veterans and congressional leaders .
Army , Sears clothing deal irks lawmakers
From Cantigny , France , and the Argonne Forest to North Africa , Normandy , Vietnam ’s Iron Triangle and Iraq — and now hauteconcept.com ?
Foreign battles are n’t new for the 1st Infantry Division , but this firefight is from another world , a clash between the New Army and Old over plans to commercialize the 1st Division ’s historic “ Big Red One ” insignia in a sportswear line at Sears .
Advertisement
After days of questioning , the Army confirmed Monday the arrangement was first reached in June 2007 on the advice of an outside licensing agency , The Beanstalk Group in New York , but the full scope of the royalties to be earned has yet to be disclosed .
“ I ’m astounded , ” said Rep. John P. Murtha ( D - Pa. ) , who chairs the House appropriations panel overseeing the Pentagon ’s nearly half - trillion - dollar budget .
“ There is a great deal of concern among the senior Army brass about this deal , ” said a Defense official .
But Sears , Roebuck and Co. is already moving to market its 1st Division “ collection ” this fall , and All American Apparel Inc. , a privately held New York manufacturer , told Politico on Saturday that it had license from the Pentagon to proceed .
Caught most by surprise are combat veterans of the 1st Infantry Division , who see their familiar red-and - green shoulder patch splashed across Internet websites celebrating soldier chic .
“ The U.S. Army launches an all - out fashion offensive , ” reads the headline on stylelist.com .
A Sears corporate press release quotes an unnamed Army spokesman extolling the new line for melding the “ Army ’s timeless traditions with iconic styling . ”
And following the Republican convention , the fashion blog Haute Concept added this note : “ Now gun-toting soccer moms like Sarah Palin [ can ] get all their fight gear with one stop ! ”
Charles Horner , a retired Army officer now working for Murtha , is n’t happy .
He served with the 1st Division in Vietnam , as did his father in World War II , including landings in North Africa , Sicily and Normandy .
“ That patch is to be worn by only people who served in the 1st Division , ” said Horner .
“ What right does the Army have to sell our patch ? ”
Ed Burke , president of an association for veterans of 1st Division ’s 28th Infantry — in which this reporter served in Vietnam as an infantry medic — is more philosophical .
“ Surprise is what I hear most — and not knowing what is going on , ” he said of the reaction to the Army ’s venture .
“ [ Defense ] did n’t talk to anyone . ”
Where the money goes — and how much — is a concern for the larger House Appropriations Committee , which has pressed the Pentagon for more answers .
All American Apparel refused to discuss any financial details when questioned by Politico but said it will pay a royalty to the Army on each item sold by Sears .
Burke said there is already substantial Internet trafficking in 1st Division items not sanctioned by the military .
And as part of their marketing appeal , Sears and All American emphasize that the sanctioned products will yield revenue to help the troops .
But the Pentagon ’s own internal directives suggest that the licensing fees initially will go to a “ clearing account ” that is first used to defray the costs of the Defense Department ’s larger efforts to enhance its “ brand ” with future young recruits .
How this breaks down exactly is unclear .
House Appropriations staffers said that the Army estimates $ 2.5 million has made its way into the morale and welfare account since the licensing program was authorized in 2005 .
But little apparently has been spent , staffers said .
And a December 2007 Pentagon directive lists “ providing financial support to morale , welfare and recreation activities ” as seventh among the responsibilities assigned to the program .
Higher priorities include “ enhancing the name , reputation and public goodwill of the DOD Components ” and supporting the recruitment and retention of personnel .
“ Strong brand identification through retail sales of products potentially can enhance the Army ’s recruiting efforts and the public ’s general goodwill towards the Army and its activities , ” the Army said in its statement Monday evening .
“ The various marks can help build unit pride and esprit de corps , raise public awareness of the Army , support its recruiting effort . ”
In a statement Saturday attributed to its president , Bob McGuinness , All American told Politico it had been granted a license by the Army “ to use the Army ’s unique marks and insignia on apparel that is designed and sold by our company . ”
“ All American Apparel Inc. is legally registered to do business as All American Army Brand , ” the company said .
“ All of our apparel is designed in the U.S.
Our production is sourced globally and is manufactured in facilities that meet all required labor and workplace standards .
Our efforts have resulted in a great product at a great price that people can wear , enjoy and show their support for our troops . ”
Robyn Kures , a Los Angeles - based spokeswoman for the fashion launch , said “ every tag , label , design and final product sample must be approved by the Army before it is sold . ”
“ The apparel is inspired by the rich tradition of the U.S. Army ; there are no political statements , just high - quality and high - style apparel , ” she said .
“ All American Army Brand will roll out several collections , consisting of a range of styles and silhouettes , from T - shirts , hoodies , henleys and denim to knits and outerwear . ”
Organized in 1917 as the 1st Expeditionary Division , the 1st Division was among the earliest U.S. combat units in France in World War I and , after being reorganized in 1942 , fought in North Africa and Europe in World War II .
In 1965 , it was sent to Vietnam and suffered an estimated 20,770 casualties before being pulled out in 1970 .
It has since seen combat in both the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the current Iraq war , as well as peacekeeping operations in the Balkans .
The full reach of this history is illustrated by the 28th Infantry , which earned the name The Black Lions of Cantigny in France in 1918 .
A half - century later , units of the same 28th were still wearing Black Lions patches and assigned to fight communist forces in the old French colonial - era Michelin rubber plantation region of Vietnam .

Stephanie Rice has joined Shane Gould , Jodie Henry and Petria Thomas as triple Olympic gold medal winners from one Games after teaming with Bronte Barratt , Kylie Palmer , and Linda Mackenzie in a memorable upset win in the women's 4 x 200 m freestyle relay .
After gold in the 200 m and 400 m individual medleys earlier in the program , Rice was a part of a team which caused one of the biggest boilovers in Olympic swimming history , upsetting red - hot favourites the United States , who had to be satisfied with bronze after China beat them for the silver .
And to make it even more amazing , the Australian time of 7 min.44.31s took a stunning 5.78s off the old world record mark set by the US at last year 's world championships in Melbourne .
To read Alan Prendergast 's blog about the Denver jail 's heavily redacted policy on pain meds and release procedures , click here .
They let Timothy Thomason go shortly before 8 p.m. on August 26 , 2006 .
He had spent less than 24 hours in the downtown Denver jail , but they were among the worst hours of Thomason 's entire life .
He moved slowly , dazedly through the exit door , and once he hit the street , he was n't sure what to do .
Part of him wanted to flee as fast as his wobbly , aching legs could take him — get home , take the pain medication his body was screaming for , climb under the covers and try to forget everything that had happened since his arrest the night before .
Part of him knew that he could n't forget .
And that he would never have a night 's peace until he found out a few things .
He stood there for several moments , then went back inside and approached the deputy sitting at the front desk .
" Excuse me , " he said .
" What 's the name of the officer in charge of the second floor ? "
Before the man could reply , the officer in question emerged from the elevator .
Thomason 's heart sank .
Was the whole nightmare going to start again ?
But the officer just stared at him , then brought some papers to the desk .
He was close enough that Thomason could read the nameplate on his uniform : CLEVELAND .
Thomason slipped away .
He repeated the name to himself during the slow , arduous walk home to his Capitol Hill apartment .
Cleveland .
Deputy Sheriff Cleveland .
The deputy was n't the only source of his fear and misery — far from it — but for now , the name made for a convenient reference point .
During the previous 24 hours , Thomason 's attitude toward law enforcement had been turned upside down .
The Denver police officers who'd come to his apartment the night before to arrest him on a charge of cultivation of marijuana — they could n't have been cooler .
He 'd told them that his brother had been LAPD and was now a cop in Montana ; they were n't going to have any trouble with him .
He 'd told them he had cancer , terminal Stage IV non-Hodgkin lymphoma , and was taking massive amounts of Oxycontin for pain and Xanax for anxiety .
They 'd agreed to bring his pills when they took him in , and told him not to worry .
A female officer had driven him to the downtown jail , also known as the Pre-Arraignment Detention Facility ( PADF ) .
She 'd promised to call his mom , and she 'd told the jail staff that he was sick , that he had prescribed medications , and that they should treat him nicely .
But the PADF has its own way of doing things .
Thomason had spent the night in teeth - gritting agony , his pleas for access to his painkillers repeatedly ignored .
The next morning , a judge had ordered his release — but then he'd spent several more hours in the jail , apparently on the whim of a single deputy , until he had a seizure , banging his head on the cement floor of his cell .
Thomason did n't understand any of it .
What had happened was not right .
He could have died from being without his meds for so long .
How did the system get so screwed up ?
Jails are n't known for their compassion .
Still , what passes for medical care at the PADF these days can be costly and even fatal .
In May , Denver Health Medical Center agreed to pay $ 4 million to the family of Emily Rae Rice , who died in custody in 2006 after a car crash and DUI arrest .
Rice had suffered damage to internal organs that went undetected at Denver Health , and her efforts to get treatment at the jail were ignored ( " Rae of Sunshine , " March 9 , 2006 ) .
Settlement negotiations continue between the family and the city over the conduct of PADF staff ; amid allegations of coverup and falsified documents , one employee has resigned and three others have been disciplined .
Rice 's death may be an instance of exceptional neglect , but there are plenty of horror stories about the downtown jail .
The facility processes 48,000 detainees a year , most of them moving through the place in a day or two — just long enough to make bond or get to court .
With the Democratic National Convention looming — and with it the prospect of hundreds , if not thousands , of protester arrests — the jail 's procedures for booking and release and dealing with medical emergencies have come under increasing scrutiny .
The ACLU of Colorado recently tried to obtain a copy of the jail 's policy manual .
City officials refused to provide the document .
The ACLU sued .
The city grudgingly handed over heavily redacted excerpts .
The two sides are now wrangling over the blacked - out portions , and ACLU executive director Mark Silverstein wonders if the city is truly prepared for the onslaught of citizens it might soon be taking into custody .
Silverstein notes that the city shifted its tactics for dealing with Columbus Day protesters , from " cite and release " ( simply issuing tickets ) to hauling them in for the entire booking process .
Last year 's haul of more than eighty protesters led to significant delays in processing , he says , requiring long waits for release even after bond had been posted .
" If you can't process eighty people in a prompt manner , what 's going to happen when you have 1,500 ? " he asks .
In recent months , the ACLU has been sharply critical of several incidents of mistaken identity that left innocent people languishing at the PADF for days after they were arrested on someone else 's outstanding warrant .
Thomason 's experience raises other questions about the way the jail handles individuals who have dire medical needs , as well as the degree to which a prisoner 's actual time of release can be left up to the discretion of individual deputies .
Thomason has filed a lawsuit against the city and Denver Health , claiming " serious deprivations " of his constitutional rights .
( Point of disclosure : Thomason 's attorneys in the case are Anna Cayton - Holland , John Holland and Erica Grossman ; the first two are related to Westword staff writer Adam Cayton - Holland , who had no involvement in this story . )
The litigation has unearthed some troubling revelations about the way the city treats prisoners suffering from severe , chronic pain — a policy of profound denial that Thomason wants to see changed .
" I like Denver , " Thomason says .
" I love Denver .
Up until that day , I really had a lot of faith in the city and felt safe here .
But this incident scared me more than anything I 've ever been through .
I still have bad dreams about it .
I do n't believe I deserved to be treated like that .
Nobody does . "
Before his arrest two summers ago , Thomason 's brushes with the law were " pretty comical , " he says .
He 'd had some minor juvenile and adult infractions for marijuana , and there was also a ticket for not having his dog on a leash and a warrant out of Leadville over some unreturned movie rentals .
At one point , he 'd even been questioned , then cleared , because of a vague physical resemblance to a burglary suspect on a grainy surveillance video .
Yet there 's nothing humorous about the circumstances that landed him in jail in 2006 .
The arrest was a result of the twelve marijuana plants in his apartment — plants that the former waiter was relying on to help him deal with serious , debilitating illness .
Born in Florida , raised in Arizona , Thomason spent a few years after high school traveling across the country and Europe .
He worked in Yellowstone National Park , lived in Boulder for a time , then moved on .
In 2002 , he returned from a trip to the Netherlands to discover that his girlfriend had committed suicide in Ohio ; her body had already been cremated , the ashes scattered at Martha 's Vineyard .
Awash in grief , he headed back to Colorado , to be with friends in Denver , and took a job at a Highland Square restaurant .
He felt lethargic and depressed for months .
A dentist noticed lumps on the side of his neck and asked him if he was having other health problems .
Thomason began to tell her about the suicide and his lack of energy .
" That 's not depression , " the dentist told him .
" You need to go to the emergency room . "
Thomason went that day .
The biopsy results came back a week later : follicular B - cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma , a cancer that attacks the immune system .
The typical NHL patient is a male in his late sixties ; cases among young men are rare .
Thomason was only 28 , but his case was advanced and would require aggressive treatment .
The doctors told him he probably had seven to nine years to live , and started him on a regimen of chemotherapy , pain medication and anti-anxiety drugs .
Over the next three years , Thomason rode the ebb and flow of the disease .
As the pain in his bones increased , so did the dosages of Oxycontin prescribed to him .
By 2006 he was taking 240 milligrams of Oxy a day : three 40 - milligram tablets in the morning , another three at night — the analgesic equivalent of 48 Percosets a day .
Plus liquid morphine as needed .
Plus Xanax .
He was also growing and smoking marijuana .
With his doctor 's support , Thomason obtained a state permit for medical marijuana in 2005 .
Weed eased the nausea from chemotherapy , he found .
It also helped his appetite .
When he'd first been diagnosed , he 'd lost fifty pounds in four months , and he could n't afford to lose much more weight .
But Thomason did n't renew his license the following year .
Living on disability checks that amounted to $ 625 a month , he did n't have the ready cash for the $ 110 license fee .
He 'd also heard conflicting rumors about the feds cracking down on the state 's medical marijuana users and did n't want to attract attention to himself .
" I was told that as long as I had a doctor 's signature on file , I was good to go , " he says .
Even with the heavy meds Thomason was taking , or perhaps because of them , at times he became disoriented and frightened .
He experienced panic attacks so severe that he felt he might be dying .
Two years ago , in the grip of one such attack , he called a friend , who became so concerned that she phoned 911 on his behalf .
Police and paramedics responded .
The paramedics checked out Thomason and took him to the emergency room at Denver Health .
The police took note of the plants and the absence of a valid license .
They returned a couple of days later to arrest him .
Thomason let them in and signed a form allowing them to search the premises .
They seized the plants and $ 1,200 in cash , which his mother had recently sent Thomason to pay bills and buy a plane ticket to Phoenix .
They explained that he was being charged with felony cultivation .
( The charge was later dismissed . )
He would have to go to jail and face a judge in the morning .
He asked if he could take his Oxy and Xanax , and they retrieved the pills for him .
" The police treated me with complete dignity and total respect , " Thomason says .
" I assumed I was going to be put into the infirmary . "
The city maintains a secure ward for sick prisoners at Denver Health , known as the Correctional Care Medical Facility .
But getting there proved to be more complicated than Thomason had thought it would be .
The officers took him to the PADF , where his pills were promptly confiscated , along with his personal property .
Nancye Zimmer , a nurse employed by Denver Health at the jail , reviewed his medications , obtained records of the prescriptions by fax — and told him that narcotics were not allowed in the PADF .
The substitute for his pain medication would be Motrin , a brand name for ibuprofen .
Thomason was speechless .
He could gobble a bottle of Motrin and it would n't begin to approximate the kind of narcotic medication he depended on .
He had n't had his evening dose of Oxy before the cops arrived , and he was already starting to feel its absence .
Sudden withdrawal from high levels of Oxycontin is comparable to kicking heroin cold turkey ; the shock to the system can cause seizures and heart failure .
According to Thomason , the conversation he had with Zimmer was brief — and appalling .
" Is detoxification going to be a problem for you ? "
Zimmer asked .
" Going from 240 milligrams a day to zero can kill me , " Thomason said .
" Stopping Xanax can kill you , too , " Zimmer replied .
" You 're going to have to find a way to bond out or find a way to the infirmary . "
But Zimmer was n't forthcoming with any ideas for how Thomason was supposed to get to the infirmary , and his pleas for something stronger than ibuprofen were ignored .
So were the pleas of his mother , Judy Largo .
True to her word , the police officer who'd brought Thomason to the PADF called Largo in Phoenix to let her know about the arrest .
Largo then spoke with another jail deputy by phone , describing her son's condition and begging that he be taken to the infirmary .
The deputy was n't sympathetic .
" She just said , ' He 's eighteen , he can speak for himself , ' " Largo remembers .
" I told her I was going to hold her responsible if anything happened to him . "
Thomason spent the night in a cell with two other prisoners .
His bed was a mat on the floor , tucked under another man 's cot .
He sweated .
He shook .
He writhed .
And he felt the pain devour him , right down to the core .
He knew something about pain .
He 'd had long needles poked into his bone marrow .
He 'd undergone cycle after cycle of chemo that left him puking and helpless .
But that was all just amateur hour compared to this .
It felt like an elephant was standing on his back and his legs .
It felt like some gung - ho mechanic was taking a wrench to his bones and twisting them , tightening them until they snapped .
A nurse on rounds saw him sweating profusely on the floor and asked him what was wrong .
He told her he needed his medication .
She offered him ibuprofen .
Around mid-morning he heard names being called out : people going to court .
Then he heard his name .
The judge released him on his own recognizance .
The deputies took him back to the jail , to a holding cell where people being released wait while their paperwork is processed .
" I just told myself , ' Hang on , ' " he recalls .
" ' In an hour or two you 'll have your medication and you 'll be fine . ' "
Around two in the afternoon , they let him out of the cell and handed him his personal property .
Thomason asked a deputy how he would go about getting his $ 1,200 back .
The deputy , whose name was Joseph Cleveland , seemed to take offense at this .
He threw down Thomason 's papers and called him a " fucking asshole , " according to Thomason .
" You picked the wrong fucking day to fuck with me , " Cleveland said .
" I 'm here to help .
But you do n't appreciate my help , so you get to spend my shift with me . "
Cleveland took him back to the holding cell .
And left him there .
The PADF computerized record shows that Thomason was released from custody at 1:45 p.m. on August 26 , 2006 .
Actually , he was n't allowed to leave for another six hours .
He was an off - the - books prisoner — right up until his condition became so alarming that the jail staff wanted nothing more to do with him .
What happened during those six hours remains a matter of dispute .
Thomason has accused Cleveland of threatening him , spraying spit on him and calling him a " faggot " and a " beatnik . "
Cleveland has denied being abusive or making threats , and told investigators that Thomason was " argumentative " during the release process .
But Thomason 's attorneys say their client 's version is supported on key points by other witnesses and by the images on a jail surveillance video , which is currently sealed under a protective order in the lawsuit .
According to Thomason 's complaint , the video shows Cleveland " following Mr. Thomason into the holding cell and getting in his face . "
Another deputy told investigators that he heard Cleveland loudly announcing that Thomason had " picked the wrong day to fuck with me . "
He did not recall Cleveland telling the prisoner to shut up or he would " fuck him up . "
Certain details are beyond dispute , however .
Other prisoners were released .
Thomason had to stay behind .
Cleveland took him upstairs to yet another cell , and his medications were again taken away from him .
Thomason asked other officers why he was being held and received no explanation .
According to Thomason , his inquiries only further irritated Cleveland , who made comments about Thomason trying to " rat " on him and whispered , " I have your address . "
( Cleveland has denied these statements ; his attorney did not respond to a request for comment . )
Around 7:30 p.m. , deputies on the second floor were alerted by other prisoners banging on their cell doors and yelling , " Man down ! "
Thomason had suffered a seizure on the floor of his cell and hit his head , which was throbbing when he came to .
Cleveland and another officer soon showed up with his property .
He was free to go .
Thomason asked for a nurse .
He asked for a gurney or a wheelchair , saying , " I 'm going to have trouble walking . "
He asked someone to call 911 .
None of these requests were granted .
According to Thomason 's complaint , Cleveland told him that if he wanted medical attention , he would have to stay another night in the jail .
The deputy gestured at the front door .
" There 's your fucking 911 , out there , " he allegedly said .
Thomason walked home .
He took his medications and tried to sleep , but his head and legs hurt too much .
After a few hours , he called 911 .
An ambulance took him to the emergency room at Denver Health , where he was treated for post - seizure symptoms .
Asked to rate his pain on a scale of one to ten , he gave it a nine .
When her son told her what had happened at the jail , Judy Largo filed a complaint with the Denver Sheriff Department internal investigations unit .
The investigators found merit in three of her allegations , mostly dealing with the conduct of Cleveland , and dismissed the rest , either because of a lack of witnesses or a finding that policy had been correctly followed .
According to court documents , Cleveland has offered varying explanations for why Thomason was held so long after a judge ordered his release .
He has said that Thomason was missing property and he took him upstairs to look for it ; that the prisoner was disorderly and had faked a seizure ; that he refused to leave .
Investigators found that the deputy had " willfully departed from the truth " in the matter , and he was suspended for two months without pay .
But when it came to the larger questions about the jail 's medical care and its release procedures , the investigation found no cause for disciplinary action .
" Mr. Thomason was given medication for his pain in accordance to the medical staff 's guidelines , " Major Phil Deeds , the internal affairs commander , wrote to Largo .
" Denver Sheriff Department procedures prohibit the administration of narcotics in all facilities . "
Actually , it 's not clear what sort of medication is allowed to PADF prisoners ; the policy has undergone some curious gyrations in recent years .
Thomason 's attorneys discovered that the PADF 's accreditation was called into question in 2004 by the National Commission on Correctional Health because of the practice of having jail nurses substitute ibuprofen for prisoners ' prescribed medication , without any consultation with a physician .
Jail officials then assured the NCCH that they had developed a procedure to treat prisoners who need narcotics for pain .
That procedure is described in the jail policy manual for 2006 as follows : " Patients requiring narcotic pain relief ... will be housed on the Correctional Care Medical Facility ( CCMF / Ward 18 ) to obtain these .
Physician staff will make arrangements for transfer of the inmate to the CCMF by calling the facility and speaking with the nursing staff there . "
Thomason 's attorneys discovered that prisoners with a need for pain medication were almost never transferred to the CCMF , however .
The city has acknowledged only two such transfers in the past five years — and the last one was three years ago .
The clause requiring such transfers was deleted when the policy manual was updated last year .
But that does n't mean cases like Thomason 's are all that rare .
The legal and illegal use of powerful prescription narcotics such as Oxycontin has soared in the past decade .
As many as one in five adult Americans reportedly suffer from chronic pain , and an estimated 3 percent of the population is physically dependent on prescription meds .
And many chronic - pain patients are finding their way to jail .
When Nancye Zimmer was deposed in the Thomason case , the PADF nurse told the attorneys , " I make substitution with 800 [ milligrams ] of Motrin for narcotics every night that I work , almost .
It 's a usual procedure that 's done all the time . "
Apparently detaining prisoners hours after the records reflect that they 've been " released " is done all the time , too .
In depositions , several jail employees told Thomason 's lawyers that the deputies have great discretion with regard to how they go about releasing individual inmates , particularly belligerent ones .
The attorneys could discover no written policy or formal training on the issue .
Some officers , including Cleveland , stated that they were n't aware of any rule requiring officers to let someone go prior to midnight on the day of their release .
Lindy Eichenbaum Lent , spokeswoman for Mayor John Hickenlooper , says the city is reviewing jail operations as part of its preparation for the Democratic convention .
No decision has been made yet about opening a temporary pre-arraignment facility to provide additional capacity , but Lent says city officials intend to have " adequate resources " in place to address medical care and efficiently process those arrested .
Asked about current release procedures , Lent provided excerpts from the policy manual .
As in the response to the ACLU lawsuit , the documents were so heavily redacted that key passages were incomprehensible .
" The ( deleted ) will then escort the prisoner to the ( deleted ) on the ( deleted ) . "
Settlement discussions between the city and Thomason 's lawyers continue .
" I 'm impressed that the city appears to recognize the seriousness of what happened here , " attorney John Holland says .
" Manager of Safety [ Al ] LaCabe assured us that he wanted to learn and would learn from this case . "
In the twenty months since his arrest , Thomason estimates that he 's spent less than a dozen nights sleeping at his own apartment .
Instead , he 's stayed with friends or his mother , who relocated to Denver to help take care of him .
He finally moved out of the place last June .
Cleveland 's alleged statement about knowing where he lives still haunts him , he says , and he still has nightmares about being deprived of his medication .
" I feel like I deserve — not an explanation , because there is no explanation for it , " he says .
" But I feel someone from the city should stand up and say , ' We were wrong . ' "
At this point , one of his goals is to put an end to the city 's ban on pain medications for prisoners who need them .
" I do n't want anybody else to go through what I went through , " he says .
" I want the policy to be changed . "
Thomason says he no longer keeps marijuana plants and no longer smokes anything .
He is going through yet another series of chemotherapy sessions and trying to get his body in shape for a possible stem - cell transplant procedure .
It 's been five years since his diagnosis , and he has no time now for anything but hope .

In a stinging editorial in today ’s Anchorage Daily News , the newspaper claimed that Gov. Sarah Palin is hiding behind the hired guns of John McCain to avoid accountability and cooperation with the Troopergate investigation .
The newspaper asked why Palin is n’t accountable to her own constituents , “ The governor who said , “ Hold me accountable , ” is hiding behind the hired guns of the McCain campaign to avoid accountability .
Is it too much to ask that Alaska ’s governor speak for herself , directly to Alaskans , about her actions as Alaska ’s governor ? ”
The editorial wondered if Palin can’t handle her own defense , “ Is the McCain campaign telling Alaskans that Alaska ’s governor can’t handle her own defense in front of her own Alaska constituents ?
Way back when , before John McCain chose Palin as his vice presidential running mate , Palin promised to cooperate with the investigation .
Now she wo n’t utter a peep about it to Alaskans .
Nor will her husband , Todd , who definitely needs to explain his role in Troopergate . ”

The editors pointed out that it is offensive to see an out of state politician muscle in on an investigation , “ Instead , Alaskans have to sit back and listen to John McCain ’s campaign operatives handling inquiries about what Alaska ’s governor did while governing Alaska .
Residents of any state would be offended to see their governor cede such a fundamental , day - to - day governmental responsibility to a partisan politician from another state .
It ’s especially offensive to Alaskans . ”
This is the problem with the McCain campaign ’s overly heavy handed response to the investigation .
By trying to squash the investigation it makes it look like Palin has something to hide .
They are creating a scandal where one might not have existed if the governor and her husband would have stuck to their original intent to cooperate .
I think it would be offensive for the residents of any state if a presidential nominee and his campaign injected himself into a state investigation about a state incident .
If there really is nothing to Troopergate , then Palin should cooperate , and let the investigation run its course .
If she did nothing wrong , then she should welcome the investigation as a chance to clear her name .
By allowing the McCain campaign to do what they are doing , Palin is destroying her credibility as an independent voice , because Palin is accountable to the people who put her into office .
The McCain campaign is somehow managing to undo all of their publicity about Palin being a new kind of politician and a reformer , by responding as if she is nothing more than a guilty politician who abused her power , and now needs to cover her tracks .
As usual with the McCain folks , they have found a way to turn a positive into a negative , and nothing is going to cost John McCain more that his campaign ’s ability to consistently pick the wrong strategy .

Analysis : Speech launches a new fight
ST . PAUL 
When his campaign imploded last summer and nearly everyone counted him out , John McCain headed back to New Hampshire and held dozens of the town hall meetings he favors , arguing his case and , ultimately , winning that crucial first primary .
No surprise , then , that the Arizona senator had the stage at the Xcel Energy Center reconfigured to suggest that familiar setting , a long arm edged in lights that stretched into the center of the arena floor so he could be surrounded by people as he accepted the hard - won nomination Thursday night .
The speech launches another difficult fight .
Formally accepting the presidential bid he lost eight years ago , McCain now faces a confident and well - funded Democratic opposition and an anxious American public .
The speech Wednesday by his running mate , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , energized Republicans in the convention hall with us-versus - them appeals to middle America and jabs at Democrat Barack Obama as a naif and a pretender .
What McCain needed to do in his speech was more difficult : Convince independent - minded voters watching on television that he is a maverick , tied not to the unpopular President Bush but to his own legacy as someone who is willing to shake things up .
McCain offered a brief word of praise for Bush for his leadership after the 9/11 attacks , but he made it clear he wanted to break with the GOP 's current course .
" I fight to restore the pride and principles of our party , " he said .
" We were elected to change Washington , and we let Washington change us , " mentioning corruption and the failure to move toward energy independence .
" We 're going to change that , " he went on .
" The party of Lincoln , Roosevelt and Reagan is going to get back to basics . "
The speech was interrupted by an antiwar protester in one of the upper tiers of the arena .
Convention delegates immediately drowned out her shouts with chants of " U - S - A " as she was carried out of the arena .
McCain did n't seem phased .
" Americans want us to stop yelling at each other , " he said .
He ticked through a laundry list of conservative causes :
More oil drilling , increased school choice , low taxes , small government and " a culture of life . "
He talked about families he had met — all those he cited happen to live in battleground states — who feel hard - pressed by the economy .
He promised help .
Combative exchanges
Still , it 's almost as if the two contenders are running in different races .
Democrats calculate that the presidential election will turn on bread - and - butter issues .
To judge by their speeches at the convention , Republicans are convinced it will be defined by questions of character and trust .
Through the evening 's program leading up to McCain 's speech , there were more references to the Iraq war , the 9/11 attacks and national security than there were to the economy .
Then there was the contrast between the setting for the nominees ' acceptance speeches .
A week earlier , Obama spoke before a crowd of 84,000 people who filled Invesco Field at Mile High : a display of candidate charisma and organizational muscle .
McCain 's setting was deliberately downsized , aiming for a more intimate air in an arena that seated about 20,000 people .
Every seat was taken .
His reception was energetic , but before he arrived on stage the crowd was less animated and the message less sharply focused than on Wednesday night , when Palin and Rudy Giuliani had come out swinging in their speeches .
The people closest to McCain gave an hour of speeches leading up to his own :
His wife , Cindy , and two of his closest friends , South Carolina Sen .
Lindsey Graham and former Pennsylvania governor Tom Ridge .
They talked not about the programs he would institute but about his courage in past battles , about duty and patriotism and about his heroism during 5 ½ years as a Vietnam POW .
He was introduced by a video that focused on his family 's military service and war narrated in part by his 96 - year - old mother , Rebecca .
' His hand at the wheel '
" It 's going to take someone of unusual strength and character — someone exactly like my husband — to lead us through the reefs and currents that lie ahead , " Cindy McCain said walking on stage with McCain 's seven children .
" I know John .
You can trust his hand at the wheel . "
In his speech , Graham focused on McCain 's support for increasing U.S. troop levels in Iraq despite the political perils of doing so .
He accused Obama of offering U.S. troops there " a patronizing pat on the back . "
Ridge contrasted McCain with Obama .
" Now , more than ever , we need a leader who fits the times , not a candidate who merely thinks it 's his time to lead , " he said .
" The challenge of our times is not simply to change .
The challenge of our time is to leave nothing to chance . "
" You know , I 've been called a maverick , Someone who marches to the beat of his own drum , " McCain said .
" Sometimes it 's meant as a compliment and sometimes it 's not .
What it really means is I understand who I work for .
I do n't work for a party .
I do n't work for a special interest .
I do n't work for myself .
I work for you . "
In his speech , McCain said the word " country " 25 times , and " fight " 22 .
" Let there be no doubt , my friends , " he said in a line that drew one of the loudest bursts of applause .
" We 're going to win this election . "
For every congenial character who can warm a room , there ’s another who can bring a draft from the north , a whiff of dead winter .
And even if the thermometer does n’t register the difference , people do : social iciness feels so cold to those on the receiving end that they will crave a hot drink , a new study has found .
The paper , appearing in the current issue of the journal Psychological Science , is the latest finding from the field of embodied cognition , in which researchers have shown that the language of metaphor can activate physical sensations , and vice versa .
Just as spreading a bad rumor can make people feel literally dirty , so did research subjects who felt socially excluded perceive a significantly lower room temperature than those who felt included .
“ We know that being excluded is psychologically painful , ” said the lead author , Chen - Bo Zhong , a psychologist at the University of Toronto , “ and here we found that it feels just like it ’s described in metaphors , ” like icy stare and frosty reception .
As the big game of chicken continues in lower Manhattan this morning , the favored plan to deal with Lehman appears to be a " Bad Bank " strategy : Sell Lehman 's " Good " businesses ( equities ) to Barclays , then put all of Lehman 's balance - sheet crap in a " Bad Bank " bag and get the rest of Wall Street to add some equity .
The other Wall Street firms are said to be resisting this solution ... and who can blame them ?
Why should they throw money down the Lehman balance - sheet rat hole , while Barclays runs off with the good parts ?
Especially when they need every dollar they have .
The answer is a threat :
If you do n't do it , Lehman will dump all this stuff on the market on Monday morning , and you 'll all be hosed , too .
Given the alternatives , this logic makes no sense .
There are two sensible solutions to this mess :
1. Sell Lehman to a bank or consortia of banks , which can then do what Lehman itself failed to do over the past 7 months : keep the good parts and ditch the bad assets at pennies on the dollar .
Some people still think that , when all is said and done , Lehman is worth something ( the market did on Friday , for example ) .
If this is the case , then someone -- Bank or America , Barclays , HSBC , China , et al - - should step up and buy the company .
If they do n't , move to solution 2 ...
2 . File for bankruptcy .
It is in the interest of BOTH the rest of Wall Street AND Lehman 's creditors to avoid dumping Lehman 's balance sheet crap on the market all at once ( the big fear being used to bludgeon Wall Street into contribution to a Lehman Crap Capital Fund ) .
A bankruptcy filing would put the company in the hands of a court appointed liquidator , which would take years to sell off everything .
This would wipe out Lehman 's equity and hit its debt , but the liquidation sale would happen in an " orderly " fashion .
It might take so long , in fact , that some of the assets might start appreciating in value before the end of the process .
Neither of these solutions would force the rest of Wall Street to come up with money it does n't have .
The solutions do n't require a government bailout , and they would prevent all the assets from hitting the market at once .
So it 's no wonder Merrill ( MER ) , Citi ( C ) , et al , are standing their ground .
The Fed should intervene here , but not with taxpayer money .
Ken Wilson , the former Goldman banker who is now Hank Paulson 's right - hand man at Treasury should send the following simple message to all possible Lehman bidders :
All bids due at 3PM
If no bids , Lehman will file for bankruptcy .
Either way , the world wo n't come to an end .

If it 's September , it 's time for creationism in schools .
That 's how some would like it , anyway .
Sure , evolution is the linchpin of modern biology , explaining everything from antibiotic resistance in bacteria to the progression of species found in the fossil record .
That did n't stop Republican vice presidential nominee , Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , from expressing the idea that creationism — the biblical notion that God created Earth and its life forms a few thousand years ago–should get equal footing with evolution in public school science classes .
" Teach both , " she said during a 2006 televised gubernatorial debate .
" You know , do n't be afraid of information . "
She is n't the only one who feels that way .
In the past , proponents of creationism have tried to sell it as " creation science " or " intelligent design " — the idea that life is too complex to have evolved without divine intervention .
But after a landmark legal setback in Pennsylvania ( teaching intelligent design in the public schools was found to violate the constitutionally mandated separation of church and state ) , creationists have retooled their approach .
This year 's buzzwords were " academic freedom " and " strengths and weaknesses " .
Lawmakers in several states drew inspiration from a petition published in February by the Discovery Institute , a Seattle - based group promoting intelligent design .
The petition argued that teachers should not be penalized for " objectively presenting the scientific strengths and weaknesses of Darwinian theory " and students should be allowed to express their views on those same strengths and weaknesses .
Creationists chalked up a notable win with this approach in Louisiana , where Republican Gov. Bobby Jindal in June signed into law the Louisiana Science Education Act .
Similar bills were introduced this year in Florida , Missouri , Michigan , South Carolina and Alabama .
In Texas , the state school board is one vote short of approving new educational standards in March that allow a curriculum that highlights the " strengths and weaknesses " of evolution .
It 's all part of a gradual rhetorical shift away from talking about creationism and intelligent design toward casting doubt on evolution , says Joshua Rosenau , spokesperson for the National Center for Science Education in Oakland , Calif .
" They have this idea , " he says , " that it 's a zero - sum game , so anything you can do to knock evolution down actually promotes creationism without having to say the word . "
GMU sued for Zotero
Via “ David Levine ” : http://www.againstmonopoly.org/index.php?perm=1253, it appears that George Mason University is “ being sued ” : http://www.courthousenews.com/2008/09/17/Reuters_Says_George_Mason_University_Is_Handing_Out_Its_Proprietary_Software.htm for over 10 million dollars by the owner of EndNote ( which happens to be Thomson - Reuters ) .
The complaint states , “ Dr. Daniel J. Cohen , Associate Professor , Department of History and Art History , and the director of GMU ’s Center for History and New Media , developed Zotero , which is a freely distributable , open - source software based research tool that allows users to gather , organize and analyze sources , including citations , and freely share the results with others . ”
The Center for History and New Media release “ a new beta version of Zotero to the general public ” on July 8 .
Reuters adds , “ A significant and highly touted feature of the new beta version of Zotero , however , is its ability to convert – in direct violation of the License Agreement – Thomson ’s 3,500 plus proprietary .ens style files within the EndNote Software into free , open source , easily distributable Zotero .csl files . ”
Now , I ’m obviously not an intellectual property lawyer ( fwiw the “ Wikipedia article ” : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_engineering on reverse engineering , which may or may not be reliable but is certainly more reliable than me , suggests that suits over interoperability are of dubious legal merit ) .
But I am an academic , and thus part of EndNote ’s core end - user market .
And I say that , regardless or not of whether it ’s legal , this is a bullshit move on Thomson - Reuters ’ part .
There are a lot of academics out there who have used EndNote in the past and created styles for the journals that they submit to etc .
EndNote ’s owners are clearly worried that these academics will be tempted to move their styles from EndNote to a software package which in my view ( and I ’ve used both ) is clearly superior .
This is a no-brainer .
There is _no significant innovation or value - added_ to EndNote ’s specific file format .
Nor is there reason to believe ( given the existence of Zotero ) that protecting this file format and EndNote ’s purported intellectual property rights over it will encourage innovation in this particular marketplace .
On the broad social merits , Reuters ’ attempted shakedown is indefensible .
Nor is this as trivial an issue for academics as it might seem .
As Scott has “ suggested ” : http://insidehighered.com/views/2007/09/26/mclemee
“ in the ” : https://crookedtimber.org/2007/09/26/zoteromania/ “ past ” : https://crookedtimber.org/2007/12/12/archival-zotero-fication-or-possibly-vice-versa/#more-6498
Zotero and projects like it are at the heart of an effort to bring something like the semantic web to academia .
Zotero combines bibliographical database management with social tagging and other fun stuff – it is gradually becoming a platform through which academics can share metadata and other interesting things with each other .
Which means that this battle is likely to have long term consequences in determining whether or not new forms of academic collaboration are likely to be controlled by academics themselves , or take place through some kind of commercially controlled intermediation , with all the forms of stupidity that are likely to go along with that .
For my part , I ’m going to refuse to use Reuters ’ software in future , strongly discourage graduate students from buying EndNote , and try to get this message out to my colleagues too ( at least those of them who are n’t using Zotero or some BibTex client already ) .
If I taught any classes where Thomson printed relevant textbooks , I would be strongly inclined not to use these texts either .
I encourage you to do the same ( and , if you ’re so minded , to suggest other possible ways of making it clear to Reuters that this kind of behaviour is intolerable in the comments ) .
People have argued that the music industry has screwed up badly by suing its customers – whether that ’s true or not , makers of academic bibliography software should be told that suing universities for what appear to be entirely legitimate actions is not likely to do their reputations any good .

In an interview a month ago , Sarah Palin dissed the job , saying it did n’t seem ' productive . '
Palin dissed veep job
Count Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as one of the most surprised that she was chosen as the running mate for Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) .
In an interview just a month ago , she dissed the job , saying it did n’t seem “ productive . ”
Advertisement
In fact , she said she did n’t know what the vice president does .
Larry Kudlow of CNBC ’s “ Kudlow & Co. ” asked her about the possibility of becoming McCain 's ticket mate .
Palin replied : “ As for that VP talk all the time , I ’ll tell you , I still ca n’t answer that question until somebody answers for me what is it exactly that the VP does every day ?
I ’m used to being very productive and working real hard in an administration .
We want to make sure that that VP slot would be a fruitful type of position , especially for Alaskans and for the things that we ’re trying to accomplish up here for the rest of the U.S. , before I can even start addressing that question . ”
Her evident distaste for the office would be part of her appeal :
It would show McCain is running an anti-Washington , reformist campaign .
But it also points to a huge negative for her :
It robs Republicans of their most effective argument against Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) — that he lacks experience .
Before Palin ’s election in December 2006 as the state ’s first woman governor , she served two terms on the city council of Wasilla , Alaska ( population 6,700 ) , and two terms as the mayor / manager of Wasilla .
こんな日記を見に来るようなひとには本来不要な本なんですが、HTMLを手書きではじめて１０年選手な人こそ読んでみて時代の流れを感じられる素敵な本。
内容は、本当に１０年前からあったようなHTMLの入門書です。FFFTPのインストールとか、メモ帳の立ち上げ方（！）とかから載ってるようなやつで、HTMLのサンプルを作りながらタグを説明していきます。最終的にできるのは、「グルメページ」と「プロフィールページ」の２つだけ、という最低限の構成。ページ数も１８０ページ足らずなのに文字も大きめで図版も多い、という、ほんとに「最初の１冊目」感あふれる本になっています。
が、この本の特筆すべき点は、まずは紹介されるタグの種類にあります。全８章のうち、２章から４章までがタグの紹介になっているのですが、ここで紹介されるタグは以下の通り。
2章：html、head、body、title、h1、h2、h3、p、br、ul、li
3 章：hr、img、table 、tr、td ,
4章：a
なんかすごく少ないと思いません？ そう、bとか、strongとか、fontとか、その手の装飾用タグの説明がない、というか、最後までぜんぜん出てこないのです。おかげでここまででできあがるHTMLはひどくそっけないページになってしまってます。
そして、その代わりに出てくるのは、もちろんスタイルシート。５章ではスタイルシートの概要説明、６章ではスタイルシートによる文字の装飾、７章ではページデザインが説明されています。ここまで来て、はじめて見栄えのよいページができあがります。つまり、文書構造はHTML、見た目はスタイルシート、という理想的な使い分けが、一寸の疑いもなしに徹底されているのです。それもごく自然体で。
そんなわけで、 「文字の大きさを変更してみよう」というところでは、
body { font - size : 14px }
とか書かれているし、 「文字や文字の背景に色をつけよう」という節では
h2 { color : # ffffff ; }
とか書かれてしまうわけで。さらには画像の回り込みとかテーブルの枠線を説明する前に、インライン要素とボックス要素の説明があったりするし。
そしてここまで現代的な流れの説明になっているにも関わらず、Web標準とかなんとかというお題目は何も説明されません。「なんでタグで装飾するの？
ふつうスタイルシートでしょ？」という暗黙の空気。
そろそろゼロ年代も終わりにさしかかる今日このごろですが、HTMLの入門書もここまで現代化されるのか、としみじみ感じました。
会社のプログラマなひとと、「 こういう本でHTML勉強したひとがレガシーなサイトみて、「fontタグってなんですか？」「なんでここでテーブル使ってるんですか？」「セルごとにタグ書くんだったら、スタイルシート使った方が速そうなのになんでこんな書き方してるんですか？」とか素で質問されたらすごく嫌だよねえ」という話をして笑ってました。そういう新人さんの出現を予想させる、時代の流れを感じられる一冊です。
Once upon a time , a politician took campaign contributions and favors from a friendly constituent who happened to run a savings and loan association .
The contributions were generous :
They came to about $ 200,000 in today ’s dollars , and on top of that there were several free vacations for the politician and his family , along with private jet trips and other perks .
The politician voted repeatedly against congressional efforts to tighten regulation of S&Ls ; , and in 1987 , when he learned that his constituent ’s S&L ; was the target of a federal investigation , he met with regulators in an effort to get them to back off .
That politician was John McCain , and his generous friend was Charles Keating , head of Lincoln Savings & Loan .
While he was courting McCain and other senators and urging them to oppose tougher regulation of S&Ls ; , Keating was also investing his depositors ’ federally insured savings in risky ventures .
When those lost money , Keating tried to hide the losses from regulators by inducing his customers to switch from insured accounts to uninsured ( and worthless ) bonds issued by Lincoln ’s near - bankrupt parent company .
In 1989 , it went belly up -- and more than 20,000 Lincoln customers saw their savings vanish .
Keating went to prison , and McCain ’s Senate career almost ended .
Together with the rest of the so - called Keating Five -- Sens. Alan Cranston ( D - Calif. ) , John Glenn ( D - Ohio ) , Don Riegle ( D - Mich . ) and Dennis DeConcini ( D - Ariz . ) , all of whom had also accepted large donations from Keating and intervened on his behalf -- McCain was investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee and ultimately reprimanded for “ poor judgment . ”
But the savings and loan crisis mushroomed .
Eventually , the government spent about $ 125 billion in taxpayer dollars to bail out hundreds of failed S&Ls ; that , like Keating ’s , fell victim to a combination of private - sector greed and the “ poor judgment ” of politicians like McCain .

The $ 125 billion seems like small change compared to the $ 700 - billion price tag for the Bush administration ’s proposed Wall Street bailout .
But the root causes of both crises are the same : a lethal mix of deregulation and greed .
Today ’s meltdown began when unscrupulous mortgage lenders pushed naive borrowers to sign up for loans they could n’t afford to pay back .
The original lenders did n’t care :
They pocketed the upfront fees and quickly sold the loans to others , who sold them to others still .
With the government MIA , soon mortgage - backed securities were zipping around the globe .
But by the time many ordinary people began to struggle to make their mortgage payments , the numerous “ good ” loans ( held by borrowers able to pay ) had gotten hopelessly mixed up with the bad loans .
Investors and banks started to panic about being left with the hot potato -- securities backed mainly by worthless loans .
And so began the downward spiral of a credit crunch , short - selling , stock sell - offs and bankruptcies .
Could all this have been prevented ?
Sure .
It ’s not rocket science : A sensible package of regulatory reforms -- like those Barack Obama has been pushing since well before the current meltdown began -- could have kept this most recent crisis from escalating , just as maintaining reasonable regulatory regimes for S&Ls ; in the ‘ 80s could have prevented that crisis ( McCain learned this the hard way ) .
But , despite his political near - death experience as a member of the Keating Five , McCain continued to champion deregulation , voting in 2000 , for instance , against federal regulation of the kind of financial derivatives at the heart of today ’s crisis .

Shades of the Keating Five scandal do n’t end there .
This week , for instance , news broke that until August , the lobbying firm owned by McCain campaign manager Rick Davis was paid $ 15,000 a month by Freddie Mac , one of the mortgage giants implicated in the current crisis ( now taken over by the government and under investigation by the FBI ) .
Apparently , Freddie Mac ’s plan was to gain influence with McCain ’s campaign in hopes that he would help shield it from pesky government regulations .
And until very recently , Freddie Mac executives probably figured money paid to Davis ’ firm was money well spent .
“ I ’m always in favor of less regulation , ” McCain told the Wall Street Journal in March .
These days , McCain is singing a different tune .
“ There are no atheists in foxholes and no ideologues in financial crises , ” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke said last week , explaining the sudden mass conversion of so many onetime free marketeers into champions of robust government intervention .
Fair enough .
But as you try to figure out what and who can get us out of this mess , beware of those who now embrace regulation with the fervor of new converts .

The following is the introduction to Why Washington Hates Iran : A Political Memoir of the Revolution That Shook the Middle East , a new Socialist Voice pamphlet published by South Branch Publications .
The entire pamphlet is available for free download from http://readingfromtheleft.com/PDF/WhyWashingtonHatesIran.pdf.
The author , Barry Sheppard , was a member of the US Socialist Workers Party for 28 years , and a central leader of the party for most of that time .
In 2005 , Resistance Books published the first volume of his political memoir , The Party : The Socialist Workers Party 1960 - 1988 .
The new pamphlet is a chapter from the second volume , now in preparation .
* * *
By Barry Sheppard
The United States and its client garrison state of Israel are openly saber - rattling against Iran .
The immediate issue is Iran ’s nuclear program .
Both Washington and Tel Aviv have stated that it would be “ unacceptable ” for Iran to develop the capacity to make nuclear weapons , and threaten a pre-emptive military strike possibly including atomic weapons .
Iran states its nuclear program is for peaceful uses only .
But even if Iran wants to have a future capacity to develop its own bomb , the US and Israeli stance is patently hypocritical , as both are armed to the teeth with nuclear weapons .
They seek to preserve Israel ’s status as the sole nuclear power in the Middle East .
However , more is involved .
Washington seeks to turn back Iran ’s growing influence in the region resulting from the failed US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
Widening the war to include Iran and possibly Pakistan , however irrational it would be , could be a desperate gamble for the US to somehow pull its chestnuts out of the fire .
If there is such an attack , the Iranian people will unite to oppose it .
Iran has many cards to play .
Its armed forces are stronger than Iraq ’s were before the US invasion .
It has middle - range missiles .
It has important influence with its ally , Syria , and armed sympathizers in Iraq , Lebanon and Palestine Partisans of Iran are capable of waging irregular warfare ( “ terrorism ” in Washington ’s jargon ) against US interests throughout the world .
The recent escalation of tensions between Washington and Moscow has redrawn the map of international relations and thrown a monkey wrench into any plans to attack Iran .
As of this writing cooler heads are prevailing in the US administration , but this could rapidly change in the current unstable situation .
The confrontation with Iran is the latest manifestation of the hostility the US has maintained against that country for three decades , since the 1979 Revolution .
A central thrust of that Revolution was the overthrow of US imperialism ’s direct control of Iran through its proxy regime of the Shah .
This anti-imperialist aspect of the revolution was very deep and survives to this day , which explains why any attack on Iran will be met with a mobilization of the Iranian people .
This pamphlet consists of a chapter which will appear in the second volume of a political memoir of my time as a central leader of the US Socialist Workers Party and earlier of its youth group , the Young Socialist Alliance .
It tells the story of the first year of the revolution from the prism of my involvement in it .
I was in Tehran during the February 1979 insurrection , and returned twice .
It is n’t a history of that year , and it does n’t cover the development of Iran in the following years and decades .
Other chapters of my book will include information on the years 1980 - 1988 in Iran , including the violent suppression of the left and the US - backed Iraqi war against Iran .
My companion Caroline Lund and I were living in Paris in 1979 .
We were part of the leadership team of the Trotskyist Fourth International , representing the Socialist Workers Party .
I was assigned to go to Iran early in 1979 , and Caroline went back to New York while I was in Iran .
That is how I happened to be there during the insurrection .
I agree with the editors of Socialist Voice that publication of this chapter at this time , before the book is published , will help explain US hostility toward Iran and the anti-imperialism of the Iranian people as a background to the present crisis .
The chapter also , I believe , sheds light on the contradictions of the Iranian Revolution , contradictions which persist to the present day .
Many on the left internationally have a one - sided view of the Iranian Revolution , and tend to dismiss it because of the capitalist Islamic clerical regime that emerged from it .
It is beyond the scope of this pamphlet to describe present - day Iranian reality , but the contradictions between the capitalist regime and the demands of the workers , peasants , women and oppressed nationalities continue , with the regime being forced to make concessions while at the same time continuing repression to maintain its rule .
Iran ’s response to the imperialist threats suffers from the fact that it is governed by a capitalist regime , beset by corruption and conflict within its leadership , while the workers ’ movement in the country is not politically independent although it has waged some militant struggles for better wages and living conditions .
Another aspect of this chapter is the heroic role that was played by Iranian revolutionists , in spite of the small size of their organizations , in the cauldron of the revolution .
They got it right .
They were intransigent supporters and defenders of the revolution unlike many Iranian leftists who turned against it in face of the repression of the new capitalist regime .
At the same time , as they formed the Iranian Socialist Workers Party , they retained their independence and intransigent defence of the workers , peasants , women and oppressed nationalities — the backbone of the Iranian Revolution .

Republican vice - presidential nominee Sarah Palin eats moose - burgers and paints her toenails pink .
John McCain likes reality television .
Win or lose , the Obama family is getting a dog this fall .
That is some of the big news in a corner of the media that is getting growing attention from the campaigns : the celebrity press .
People magazine got ...
The other nurses from my floor came in with the crash cart , and I got the board .
Doing CPR on a soft surface , like a bed , does n’t accomplish much ; you need a hard surface to really compress the patient ’s chest , so every crash cart has a two - by - three - foot slab of hard fiberboard for just this purpose .
I told one of the doctors to help pick her up so I could put the board under her : she was now dead weight , and heavy .
I kept doing CPR until the condition team arrived , which seemed to happen faster than I could have imagined : the intensivists  the doctors who specialize in intensive care  the I.C.U. nurses , the respiratory therapists and I ’m not sure who else , maybe a pulmonologist , maybe a doctor from anesthesia .
Respiratory took over the CPR and I stood back against the wall , bloody and disbelieving .
My co-workers did all the grunt work for the condition : put extra channels on her IV pump , recorded what was happening , and every now and again called out , “ Patient is in asystole again , ” meaning she had no heartbeat .
They worked on her for half an hour .
They tried to put a tube down her throat to get her some oxygen , but there was so much blood they could n’t see .
Eventually they “ trached ” her , put a breathing hole through her neck right into her trachea , but that filled up with blood as well .
They gave her fluids and squeezed bags of epinephrine into her veins to try to get her heart to start moving .
They may even have given her adenosine , a dangerous and terrifying drug that can reverse abnormal heart rhythms after briefly stopping the patient ’s heart .
The sad truth about a true cardiac arrest is that drugs cannot help because there is no cardiac rhythm for them to stimulate .
The doctors tried anyway .
They went through so many drugs that the crash cart was emptied out and runners came and went from pharmacy bringing extras .
When George Clooney and Juliana Margulies went through these routines on “ E.R. , ” it seemed exciting and glamorous .
In real life the experience is profoundly sad .
In the lay vernacular of Hollywood , asystole is known as “ flatlining . ”
But my patient never had the easy narrative of the normal heartbeat that suddenly turns straight and horizontal .
Her heartbeat line was wobbly and unformed , occasionally spiked in a brief run of unsynchronized beats , and at times looked regular , because chest compressions from CPR can create what looks like a real cardiac rhythm even though the patient is dead .
It has been two months since the popular social news site reddit decided to release ( most of ) its code into the wild and allow others to create reddit clones of their own .
Now , those parties ( known as " redditors " ) can take their individual reddits a step further by customizing them however they please with a design , and even domain name , of their very own .
No longer will custom reddits be restricted to a subdirectory on reddit 's domain or just a customized logo .
" Starting today , you 'll be able to totally modify your CSS and use custom CNAMEs , " reddit wrote on its blog .
" Now your reddit can be restyled to look however you want — like any WordPress blog . "
The team cites Bacon Reddit as an example of a reddit that could benefit from a more customized design and domain name , like BaconBuzz.com .
When reddit decided to go open source in June , it generated a lot of buzz — mostly because it was hard to understand exactly why a successful social news site would essentially give away all of its secrets for free .
The site 's cofounder , Steve Huffman , told Ars that reddit was n't worried about competitors one - upping the site with its own bread and butter .
If the competition was going to pounce , " they would 've replaced reddit by now . "
Indeed , the decision to release 95 percent of its code seems to have only made users happier by allowing them to create whatever crazy specialized reddits they want while generating more buzz for reddit itself .
The company wants to continue fostering its new community of redditors , and so it is also announcing a new contest to go along with the customization announcement .
The contest involves creating a new reddit ( or being the owner of one that has fewer than 250 users ) and trying to grow it as much as possible over the next month .
The idea is to get friends , family , other bloggers , and the general Internet community excited about the spinoff sites ( without spamming , of course ) , and the winner will get a MacBook Air , a $ 1,500 Apple gift card , and " a stockpile of schwag . "
Disclosure : Reddit is owned by Condé Nast , Ars Technica 's new parent company .
Bacon Day is a day of Bacon ... think Iron Chef but all day and the secret ingredient is Bacon .
Breakfast traditionally consists of bacon waffles , with a side of bacon , and any other concoctions thought up .
Throughout the day there are showings of Kevin Bacon movies and any other movies with leading roles given to pigs , e.g. Babe , Piglet 's Big Adventure .
Lunch must have BLTs and there are snacks around and slices of bacon everywhere .
Dinner is a fight for your food quite literally .
It is more a tasting of all things bacon and everyone wants a taste .
Due to the vast quantities of bacon cooked , the grill outside is the best bet .
If you are invited to a Bacon Day celebration , it is traditional to bring something to eat ( of course containing bacon ) which can be made there if the host allows , and drink ( which may or may not include bacon ) .
The creator of Bacon Day is Seth .
His friends helped put together the logistics ( a BIG thanks to Evan and Brandon and possibly me Alexa : ) ) and as we are starting to all move on from our grad student days , we plan to bring bacon day with us .
This blog is to help spread , coordinate future bacon days , and share .
The first Annual Bacon Day was held in 2005 .
If you have any questions or want to hear the full story about Bacon Day and how it was created , feel free to email us at international .

DRM - free tracks mean music can be transferred to other audio devices Classical music lovers in the UK will now be able to download their favourite works from the web , thanks to a new resource launched today .
Passionato is providing the world 's biggest collection of high - quality classical downloads , first in the UK and later worldwide .
The company says more than 18,000 recordings are available .
Many fans of classical music have previously shunned MP3 downloads because of disappointing quality .
Passionato offers its downloads - single tracks , works or albums - at high - quality 320 kbps MP3 or lossless FLAC ( Free Lossless Audio Codec ) .
Major labels
All are free from Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) which means they can be transferred to any computer or portable music players including the iPod and be burnt to a CD .
The website provides access to catalogues from major classical labels as well as key independent labels and there are plans to sign up more labels and add new releases on a weekly basis .
Passionato 's founder is James Glicker , a veteran of the music industry and a former president of the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra .
He told the BBC that although it did its early research in the US , it chose to launch in the UK for two reasons .
Founder James
Glicker hopes to boost the classical music industry " First , the UK and Europe have an incredibly vibrant classical music scene in terms of concert attendance , record labels and journalism - though of course the US is the biggest single country in terms of actual classical music sales , " he said .
" Second , the UK has several innovative entities that sponsor creative projects , including the Creative Capital Fund , which invested in Passionato .
So another reason for setting up Passionato in the UK is to take advantage of the financial support that was being offered to us . "
He described classical music aficionados - of which he is one - as " a fastidious lot " who had been slow to switch to digital because of the relatively poor quality of compressed files .
" Online music stores have typically offered MP3s at 128 kbps , ie very compressed files , which is fine for pop music but it's not exactly high - fidelity , " he said .
" There are a handful of online stores currently offering small catalogues of classical music at 320 kbps .
This is high quality audio and our research tells us people can't readily distinguish between 320 kbps MP3s and CD quality wavs .
We are offering 320 kpbs and also lossless FLAC . "
Passionato will face competition from established online classical music stores such as eclassical as well as from large download stores such as iTunes which have some classical works in their catalogues .
Retailers closing Mr Glicker said he hoped Passionato would boost the classical music industry .
" This is a major motivation for us , " he said .
" It 's ironic that while classical music concert attendance is on the rise , labels are reducing their recordings and physical retailers are shutting down like there is no tomorrow .
" So the future of classical music distribution is online .
The only thing that has stopped this inevitable shift from happening to date has been audio quality , plus the DRM issue . "
The BPI , the UK's recorded music industry association , issued a statement welcoming the launch .
" Digital distribution already offers great choice as to how music fans can access and enjoy music online , and its potential is even greater .
We expect the new Passionato service will greatly enhance the digital music offering for classical music aficionados and we warmly welcome innovation of this type in music retail . "
Visitors to the Passionato online store can listen to 60 - second samples before deciding whether to buy a track .
A free music player and organiser is also available for download .
As part of the launch , anyone registering at passionato.com can claim 10 free pre-selected tracks including a 30 - minute work .

What are these ?
June 26 , 2008
You can mark this as one of the more exciting days of my life .
Let me back up .
I grew up in a household where one respected the Oxford English Dictionary .
We had the condensed version , two enormous volumes with a special drawer to hold a magnifying glass with which to examine the shot - down copy .
I ’m sure my mother coveted the full 20 - volume edition , but the second edition did n’t even come out until 1989 and right now has a street price approaching a thousand dollars .
Once I escaped adolescence , I had my own fully - formed lexical passion .
The OED became a symbol of pure scholarship , reverence for the language , glowing hotly in my psyche .
When I was 22 , a group of friends and I pooled money and bought the OED ( again , condensed version–even those are about $ 250 ) for a friend .
Sadly , I do not even to this day , own my own .
We stood around drinking beer and looking for weird words ( I still remember from that day , one of my favorites : quaquaversal , “ [ d ] ipping , pointing , or occurring in every direction . ”
In my jejune reckoning , I wanted to write a novel entitled “ View from the Quaquaverse . ” ) .
Soon thereafter I decamped for England , presumably for graduate studies but more accurately for dampness , inebriation and shiftlessness .
Through a wild turn of coincidences involving the Baltic States and a motorcycle accident , I befriended one of my Matts ( many know that all of my close friends in England were called “ Matt , ” this was “ Wolverhampton Matt ” ) .
I must ’ve let it drop that I had a serious hankering for the OED .
“ Oh , ” he said .
“ I have a friend who works on the OED . ”
I thought he was full of it until he suggested that we head down to Oxford ( I lived in Birmingham ) for a weekend to visit said friend and his wife .
In the interest of anonymity ( I ’m not sure he would want me recounting these tales in such a public forum ) , I ’ll call him William .
This first weekend visit turned into a few more .
As soon as I had verified that he indeed worked on the OED –in a capacity that identifies new words for inclusion , no less –I started in on my assault .
It ’s embarrassingly juvenile : I wanted him to consider the word “ nugry , ” promoted by my friend Tom , who was active on ( I believe ) alt.
puzzles or somesuch similar problem - solving - related newsgroup .
The definition of nugry ?
Essentially : “ The third word in the English language ending in ‘ - gry ’ ” , existing for the sole purpose of being an answer to a puzzle - riddle I ’ve long since forgotten .
You can see why I failed in this regard .
Besides , William was fairly nonchalant ( at best ) about his occupation .
He found it bemusing that I held such reverence for the establishment .
“ Eh , ” he would say , “ really we ’re all just a bunch of tossers . ”
One night we went to London to celebrate William ’s birthday .
We all went to a pub in Camden Town called , if memory serves , the Ram and Tup ( a rather bawdy reference ! ) .
Everyone got fair well plastered except myself and Matt .
We trundled William into the back of Matt ’s car , all spinny - headed and dreamy .
I was sitting in the passenger seat .
“ Lyza .
I have something that is going to make your week . ”
“ Yeah ? ”
“ Your word is going to be in the next edition . ”
“ Really ? ! ”
“ Except not the one you think .
I kept hearing you use ‘ food coma . ’
I did some research and it turns out it is in common enough usage .
So it will be there .
The definition will be ‘ a lethargic state induced by eating too much food . ’ ”
“ William , you just made my year . ”
That was 2001 .
The full Third Edition of the OED is not due out until something wild like 2018 or 2037 .
Over the years , I ’ve told the story , but my own belief of it had flagged .
Maybe William was making fun of me .
Maybe he did n’t work for the Oxford English Dictionary at all ( and actually , there ’s no one listed on Oxford ’s staff page with his ( real ) name ) .
Maybe he was just drunk .
Maybe I imagined the whole thing .
This week I am reading The Meaning of Everything by Simon Winchester , a history of the creation of the OED .
It has me rabidly enthused .
Near frantic with interest .
And so it occurred to me that I wanted to find out once and for all .
The Oxford University Press releases updates , towards its Third Edition , in the online version .
It costs a fair chunk to subscribe to the online version , however , and I could n’t be sure the “ Fs ” were all updated , at least not without legwork , and I ’m lazy .
I emailed my mother this morning to ask if the Multnomah County Library was a subscriber .
She emailed back to tell me that they not only subscribed , but anyone with a valid library card ID number could access it via the Library ’s Web Site .
Holy Mackerel !
I was over there in a flash , logged in and searched .
Lo .
And behold :
“ food coma n. U.S. a lethargic state induced by eating , esp. a large quantity of ( freq. rich or unhealthy ) food . ”
This has again made my year .
As an aside , the first known use of ‘ food coma ’ , as cited in the entry , was in 1991 .

McCain says he would fire SEC chairman Associated Press

CEDAR RAPIDS , Iowa ( AP )  Republican John McCain , buffeted by criticism about his response to Wall Street 's financial problems , said Thursday he would fire the SEC chairman and create a special trust to help strengthen weak institutions .
In all but calling for the firing of Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher Cox , McCain turned on a fellow Republican and former 17 - year House member who served on committees overseeing investor protection and U.S. capital markets .
President Bush appointed Cox in 2005 .
McCain also tried to counter Democratic rival Barack Obama as the two White House contenders jockeyed to explain how , as president , they would prevent the sort of financial tremors that have shaken the financial industry and consumer confidence this week .
Economic issues traditionally favor Democrats and were expected to be especially potent for Obama in an election cycle after eight years of a Republican White House and a Congress controlled mostly by the GOP .
McCain has a long history of opposing government regulation and receives economic advice from former Texas Sen .
Phil Gramm , an advocate of free - market principles .
In addition , McCain has served on and has been chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee , which has regulated  and deregulated  vast parts of the economy .

Aufruf zur Demo in Berlin am Samstag , den 11 .
Oktober ab 14:00 Uhr
Bürgerrechtlerinnen und Bürgerrechtler rufen bundesweit zur Teilnahme an einer Demonstration gegen die ausufernde Überwachung durch Wirtschaft und Staat auf .
Am Samstag , den 11 .
Oktober 2008 werden besorgte Bürgerinnen und Bürger in Berlin unter dem Motto " Freiheit statt Angst - Stoppt den Überwachungswahn ! " auf die Straße gehen .
Treffpunkt ist der Alexanderplatz um 14.00 Uhr .
Der Überwachungswahn greift um sich .
Staat und Unternehmen registrieren , überwachen und kontrollieren uns immer vollständiger .
Egal , was wir tun , mit wem wir sprechen oder telefonieren , wohin wir uns bewegen oder fahren , mit wem wir befreundet sind , wofür wir uns interessieren , in welchen Gruppen wir engagiert sind - der " große Bruder " Staat und die " kleinen Brüder und Schwestern " aus der Wirtschaft wissen es immer genauer .
Der daraus resultierende Mangel an Privatsphäre und die Vertraulichkeit gefährdet die Freiheit des Glaubensbekenntnisses , die Meinungsfreiheit , die Pressefreiheit , die Koalitionsfreiheit , Unternehmensintegrität , die Arbeit von Ärztinnen und Ärzten , Beratungsdiensten und Rechtsanwältinnen und Rechtsanwälten .
Die vielfältige Agenda der Reform des Sicherheitssektors umfasst die Aufhebung der Trennung von Polizei , Geheimdiensten und Militär , und gefährdet damit die Gewaltenteilung und - balance .
Unter Einsatz von Massen - Überwachungstechnologie führt die grenzenlose Zusammenarbeit von Militär , Geheimdiensten und Polizeibehörden zum Aufbau von " Festungen " in Europa und anderen Kontinenten , die sich gegen Flüchtlinge und anders aussehende Menschen richten , aber zum Beispiel auch politische Aktivisten , arme und unterprivilegierte Menschen und Sportfans betreffen .
Menschen , die sich ständig beobachtet und überwacht fühlen , können sich nicht unbefangen und mutig für ihre Rechte und eine gerechte Gesellschaft einsetzen .
Massenüberwachung setzt damit die Basis einer demokratischen und offenen Gesellschaft aufs Spiel .
Massenüberwachung gefährdet auch die Arbeit und das Engagement von Organisationen der Zivilgesellschaft .
Überwachung , Misstrauen und Angst verändern unsere Gesellschaft schrittweise in eine Gesellschaft unkritischer Verbraucher , die " nichts zu verbergen haben " und dem Staat gegenüber - zur vermeintlichen Gewährleistung totaler Sicherheit - ihre Freiheitsrechte aufgeben .
Eine solche Gesellschaft wollen wir nicht !
Wir wissen , dass der Respekt vor unserer Privatsphäre einen wichtigen Teil unserer menschlichen Würde darstellt .
Eine freie und offene Gesellschaft kann ohne bedingungslos private Räume und Kommunikation nicht existieren .
Die zunehmende elektronische Erfassung und Überwachung der gesamten Bevölkerung bietet keinen verbesserten Schutz vor Kriminalität .
Sie kostet Millionen von Euro und gefährdet die Privatsphäre unschuldiger Bürger .
Wo Angst und Aktionismus regieren , bleiben gezielte und nachhaltige Maßnahmen zur Stärkung der Sicherheit ebenso auf der Strecke wie ein Angehen der wirklichen , alltäglichen Probleme der Menschen ; zum Beispiel Arbeitslosigkeit und Armut .
Um gegen Sicherheitswahn und die ausufernde Überwachung zu protestieren , gehen wir am Samstag , den 11 .
Oktober 2008 in Berlin unter dem Motto " Freiheit statt Angst - Stoppt den Überwachungswahn ! " auf die Straße .
Treffpunkt ist der Alexanderplatz um 14.00 Uhr. Der Protestmarsch durch die Stadt wird mit einer großen Abschlusskundgebung vor dem Brandenburger Tor enden .
Wir rufen alle Bürgerinnen und Bürger auf , an der Demo teilzunehmen .
Die Politiker sollen sehen , dass die Bürgerinnen und Bürger für ihre Freiheiten wieder auf die Straße gehen !
Auf der Demo- Homepage ( http://www.FreiheitStattAngst.de) finden sich jeweils die neuesten Infos zur Demo , zu Anreisemöglichkeiten und zu Möglichkeiten , mitzuhelfen .
Unsere Forderungen

BANGKOK ( Reuters ) - Thailand ’s Samak Sundaravej accepted his party ’s nomination on Thursday to return as prime minister , the official party spokesman said , resuming a collision course with protesters hell - bent on stopping him .

“ The party chief declared his determination at the meeting to return to work for the country again , ” chief spokesman Kudeb Saikrachang told reporters after Samak met officials at the headquarters of his ruling People Power Party .
“ Tomorrow , the PPP and other coalition parties will re-elect Samak as the prime minister again , ” Kudeb said , two days after a court removed him from office after finding him guilty of a conflict of interest .
The People ’s Alliance for Democracy ( PAD ) , whose protesters are occupying the seat of national government in Bangkok , said they would not accept Samak , who also faced opposition from within his own party ahead of Friday ’s parliamentary vote .
A spokesman for a PPP faction claiming to have 70 MPs said they would abstain from the vote , saying Samak ’s return would exacerbate weeks of political tension and damage the party .
The Constitutional Court ruled on Tuesday that Samak , accused by the PAD of being a puppet for ousted prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra , broke the law in hosting cooking shows on commercial television while in office .
“ The main principle is that Samak , who violated the constitution many times , should not become PM again , ” Somsak Kosaisook , a PAD leader , said at Government House .

“ No one in the PPP should become prime minister or a minister in the government , ” he added , suggesting the PAD would continue with its action that has paralysed government and unsettled investors .
The court ’s ruling against 73 - year - old Samak removed him from office but did not ban him from returning .
The PPP , which has close to an outright majority in parliament with 225 of the 470 seats , has called the chamber into special session on Friday to vote for a new prime minister .
CARETAKER LEADER IS THAKSIN KIN
The country is being run by a caretaker cabinet under Somchai Wongsawat , a brother - in - law of Thaksin .
The controversial former prime minister is now in exile in London , having skipped bail last month along with his wife to avoid corruption charges .
Army commander Anupong Paochina urged Somchai to lift the state of emergency Samak imposed last week after a man was killed in street battles between pro- and anti-government groups .
Anupong , who pointedly refused Samak ’s request for the army to use force to evict the PAD from Government House , argued that the emergency rule , which appears to be largely symbolic , was damaging the country ’s image and economy .
The situation has become much calmer , although underlying political tensions remain .
At least 2,000 police would be deployed to parliament on Friday to prevent clashes between government supporters and protesters , a senior officer told Reuters .
Another 3,000 police would be mobilised to man key government buildings .
Consumer confidence is low , falling in August to its lowest level this year .
Finance Minister Surapong Suebwonglee has said this was one reason why the government ’s economic growth target would be missed .
It had forecast 5 to 6 percent for 2008 .
The stock market turned lower in the afternoon after news of Samak ’s nomination , ending down 1.33 percent .
It has fallen around 25 percent since the street protests began in late May .

Forget where you left your keys this morning ?
Or maybe you left your umbrella in the office before a rainy evening .
Do n't worry , it 's probably not a sign of Alzheimer 's — everyone is a little forgetful now and then .
But the prevalence of Alzheimer 's and other types of dementia , which slowly deteriorate the brain 's capacity to make new memories , retrieve older ones and perform other mental and physical tasks , is on the rise as the baby boomer generation hits retirement age .
A 2007 Alzheimer 's Association report estimated that more than 5 million Americans were currently living with the disease and that that total could reach 16 million by 2050 .
Scientists are still trying to unravel the many mysteries of the brain — how our brain processes information , how memory works , how the brain ages and how diseases like Alzheimer 's develop — so that we better understand our own minds and how to keep them healthy .
But while there is still a lot to learn about our noggins , several studies have worked out a few ways to help keep your thinking organ in shape , now and as you age .
1 . Eat Your Brain Food
You are what you eat , or at least your brain is .
A diet of junk food can junk up your brain , as things like trans fats and saturated fats , common in heavily processed foods , can negatively affect the brain 's synapses .
Synapses connect the brains neurons and are important to learning and memory .
On the other hand , a balanced diet rich in omega - 3 fatty acids — found in salmon , walnuts and kiwi fruit — can give the synapses a boost and help fight against mental disorders from depression to dementia .
2 . Hit the Gym Giving the rest of your body a workout can also improve your memory , make you think more clearly and decrease the risk of developing cognitive diseases , several studies have suggested .
Because exercise is a mild stressor to your body , eating up the precious energy needed by the brain , it triggers the release of chemicals called growth factors that make the brain 's neurons stronger and healthier .
Half an hour every other day will do it , experts say .
And do n't forget to stretch : Stretching can help reduce stress , which can impact the memory centers of your brain .
3 . Mind Benders
Give your brain a workout , too , with brainteasers , crossword puzzles and memory games — studies have shown that using these tools to stay mentally active can reduce the risks of developing dementia by building and maintaining a reserve of stimulation in your brain .
Even following the current political campaign can provide a boost to the systems that control attention and learning that are hard - wired into the brain .
4 . Memory tricks Keeping information stored in your memory banks and retaining that memory with age may also be a simple matter of mind control .
For example , confidence in your cognitive abilities could actually affect how well your memory functions , particularly for the elderly .
Because some older adults tend to blame memory lapses on age , regardless of whether or not that is the cause , they can keep themselves from even really trying to remember .
Prediction can also enhance memory :
If you have a good idea of the information you 'll need to recall later , you 're more likely to remember it .
5 . Give it a Rest Sleep gives your brain a chance to replay the memories of the day and consolidate them for long - term storage .
One study suggested that the brain can do its reviewing much faster when you 're asleep than when you 're wide awake — so no more all - nighters , students .
A 90 - minute mid-afternoon nap can even help solidify long - term memories , such as events or skills you are trying to master .
Siesta anyone ?
Of course , none of these mind - enhancing tips is fool - proof .
Some studies have suggested that developing Alzheimer 's and other types of dementia is partly a matter of genetics .
One such study , presented in July at the Alzheimer 's Association 's International Conference on Alzheimer 's Disease , hinted at a connection between mothers who develop Alzheimer 's and the chances their children will become afflicted in old age .
Another suggests that having a specific pattern of proteins is a risk factor for the debilitating disease .
But for now , no one can predict exactly who will or wo n't develop dementia .
While scientists work on better indicators and cures , doing your own part to keep your body and brain healthy is probably the best you can do .
Kay Underwood says many people think she is joking when she collapses A Lincoln - based student wants to raise awareness about a condition which could paralyse her if she gets the giggles .
Kay Underwood , 20 , of Barrow Upon Soar , Leicestershire , has cataplexy , which means her muscles weaken when she laughs , causing her to fall over .
The University of Lincoln architecture student has in the past collapsed 40 times in a single day .
She said many people think that she is joking when her condition does make her fall over .
Emotion cause Ms Underwood was diagnosed as having cataplexy a year ago , but believes she has had it for about four or five years .
She said : " I think a lot of people , if I 've told them about it and they 've not seen it , would quite like to see me do it ( collapse ) , so they try to make me laugh .
" Quite a few people have thought I 'm still strange and ' Is she making it up ? '
" And if I collapse a lot of people have thought I 'm just putting it on . "
Cataplexy is a sudden weakening of the muscles brought on by strong emotions like excitement or anger , but Ms Underwood 's condition is triggered by laughter .
Her condition also includes narcolepsy , which means she can experience sudden bouts of sleepiness .
Doctors are not quite sure what causes it , but it may be hereditary .
Ms Underwood has shown some improvement after being referred to Leicester General Hospital 's sleep disorders service and a course of medication .
She now hopes to get back her driving licence , which she had to surrender on health grounds .

Desperate Campaign Ad Features Corrupt Florida Congressman Hoping to Fool Voters
Real Story Available Here at The BRAD BLOG and in New Documentary Film ...
Brad Friedman Byon 9/23/2008 , 11:49 am PT
Rep. Tom Feeney ( R - FL ) --- cited for the third year in a row by a public interest watchdog as one of the " Most Corrupt Members of Congress " --- has finally decided to " apologize " for going on that $ 75,000 lobbyist - funded junket to play golf in Scotland in 2003 , along with the disgraced , and convicted , Jack Abramoff .
The " apology " comes in the form of a desperate , 30 - second campaign ad ( at left . )
Feeney is the last remaining member of Congress to have gone on one of those Abramoff - funded private jet trips to hit the links in St. Andrews .
The other two , Tom Delay ( R - TX ) , who went in 2001 , and Bob Ney ( R - OH ) , who went in 2002 , have both left Congress in disgrace and under indictment .
You 'll note that the ad --- in which Feeney never bothers to mention that he 's a Republican --- ends , laughably , with : " Because public service is about being honest , even when you make a mistake . "
That line might more appropriately , at least for Feeney , have been : " Public service is about admitting that you broke the law , five years after you took a huge favor from a corrupt lobbyist and were finally forced to admit it outloud in a desperate , last - ditch attempt , to save your Congressional meal ticket . "
But he might have had trouble getting all of that into his :30 spot .
The ad also says , on screen : " Get the facts : Tom Feeney.com "
Might we suggest if you really want the facts on Tom Feeney , one of the filthiest players remaining in Congress , that you see instead our special coverage page about him , and former Republican computer programmer Clint Curtis .
Curtis worked at the same company as Feeney , back when Feeney was both the powerful Speaker of the Florida House and a lobbyist for the software firm with millions of dollars in state contracts .
The same company also employed undocumented Chinese aliens working on systems for NASA and others , even as Feeney has continued to protect that company to this day ( he was also their one - time general counsel ) and has housed his campaign headquarters in their building .
It was back then , when they both worked at Yang Enterprises in 2000 , when Curtis alleges , via sworn affidavit , video - taped testimony to Congress , and lie - detector test , that Feeney asked him to create vote - rigging software for touch - screen voting machines .
A remarkable documentary film , Murder , Spies & Voting Lies , covering that story , and The BRAD BLOG 's attempts to tell it over the last four years , has just been released .
If you 'd rather learn the facts in movie form , please check out that film !
NOTE : It 's terrifying and includes untold details on at least two grizzly deaths related to the Curtis / Feeney scandal .
Curtis himself eventually switched to the Democratic Party following the incident and , after Congress refused to take action on Feeney , he ran unsuccessfully against him in 2006 .
His attempts to do so again this year were derailed by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ( DCCC ) , which backed wealthy opponent Suzanne Kosmas in the primary .
With polls showing the well - funded Kosmas in a tight race with Feeney , clearly , one of the dirtiest Republicans in America is now running very scared .
Adventurer Makes History With Solar - Powered Joy Ride Man travels around the world in a car powered by nothing but the sun .
Sept. 6 , 2008  --
Swiss adventurer Louis Palmer is tackling the world 's global energy crisis on three wheels at 35 miles per hour .
More than a year after he set off from the European Sustainable Energy Forum in Lucerne , Switzerland , 36 - year - old Palmer is on track to become the first person ever to travel around the world in a car without a drop of gas -- proving , he says , that free fuel for life is not a fantasy of the future .
" I am on a mission to teach people that we already have the solutions we need to make a better world , " Palmer told ABCNews.com this week .
The brightly painted two - seater , about the size of a go - cart , was first conceived when Palmer was 14 years old .
Twenty - two years later , the bright lines of his colored pencils have come to life as a joint venture between four Swiss universities .
The project took three years and grew to include more than 200 students .
Palmer says he decided to give up the two hours he spent watching television each day and use the time to recruit sponsorship for his project .
In the end , it was two German , not Swiss , companies that provided Palmer with what he calls " the heart and soul " of the vehicle .
The German company Q - Cells agreed to provide the solar panel trailer , worth more than $ 5,000 .
On a sunny day , these panels provide around 60 miles of power .
Zebra Battery provided the two 250 - pound recyclable batteries , worth $ 15,000 dollars each , which store combined energy from the solar panels and the regular electric power outlets Palmer plugs into each night .
In total , the car can go 200 miles without recharging .
Upon his arrival at George Washington University Law School , in Washington , D.C. , Wednesday , Palmer and his crew of three had driven 27,000 miles , visiting 28 countries and hundreds of cities .
At each stop , Palmer seeks out audiences to make his case with a 45 - minute Power Point presentation .
" I cannot change the world by myself , " Palmer said .
" But I can spread the word and the message that we can stop global warming and be independent of fossil fuels . "
But how soon the full transition from biofuels to more sustainable forms of energy can be made remains up for debate .
Palmer admits his solar car is not designed for mass production , but he maintains that a similar and safer model could be mass - produced for around $ 10,000 , not including the solar panels .
Sustainable energy experts in the United States seem to agree the solution to the global energy crisis will be largely powered by the sun and the wind .
" You can drill all you want , but that 's not really going to be an option down the road , " said Ken Zweibel , director of the Institute of Analysis for Solar Energy .
" The solution is to electrify transportation . "
Zweibel says what Palmer is doing demonstrates solar power is a viable alternative to biofuel , but that in the future the location of the solar panels will not be on a trailer behind the car , but rather in large solar fields or on rooftops .
" Solar energy just is n't realistic in small sizes , " he said .
" You need large areas to make it economically sound . "
The challenge and the solution remain in achieving economies of scale .
Energy that comes from coal costs about 6 cents for a kilowatt hour , which is enough electricity to run a hair dryer for an hour , according to the Emerging Energy Research .
Natural gas costs about 9 cents a kilowatt hour .
While solar energy is currently the most expensive , averaging about 20 cents per kilowatt hour , biting the bullet and investing in solar will likely prove significantly less expensive over time .
" The idea is essentially being able to fill up your gas tank for free , " said Neal Lurie , director of marketing for the American Solar Energy Society .
" Solar energy has the potential .
We just need to create the culture . "
Renewable energy already generates 8.5 million jobs in the United States , according to the National Green Collar Job Study , and with coal and electricity prices rising , the dawn of a solar - and wind - powered world may not be as far off as once thought .
" The cost [ of solar power ] drops about 5 percent a year as production and volume go up , " he said .
" I think there is going to be a tipping point in the next 18 months . "
Palmer 's solar - powered globe trot , however , will likely draw to a close before any sort of tipping point is reached .
Palmer plans on stopping by the World Climate Change Conference in Poland before heading home in December to celebrate his epic , record - setting journey around the world .
But do n't count on this Swiss pioneer to remain in park .
Palmer is already planning an 80 - day , solar - powered race around the world , scheduled for some time next year .
Mental health problems appear to be worse than those suffered after Sept. 11
Half the residents of New Orleans were suffering from poor mental and physical health more than a year after their homes and community were devastated by Hurricane Katrina in August 2005 , according to research published in the September issue of the UK - based Journal of Clinical Nursing .
Researchers from Point Loma Nazarene University , San Diego , California , spoke to 222 local residents 15 months after they survived one of the worst natural disasters to hit the USA .
They discovered that some health problems tripled in the post - Katrina period , compared to a survey of Louisiana residents carried out before the hurricane .
" Our results add to the growing body of evidence that disaster survivors continue to suffer from poor mental and physical health for prolonged periods of time after the initial impact " says lead researcher Professor Son Chae Kim .
" The health problem rates we recorded were considerably higher than those reported by Louisiana residents to the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System ( BRFSS ) in 2003 .
The BRFSS is the world 's largest , on - going telephone health survey system and has been tracking health conditions and risk behaviors in the United States every year since 1984 . "
Key findings of the survey include :
52 per cent of the respondents reported a day or more of poor mental health in the past month , with 18 per cent reporting daily mental health problems .
These figures were two to three times higher than the pre-Katrina levels recorded in 2003 among Louisiana residents .
Then , 26 per cent reported a day or more of mental health , with six per cent reporting daily mental health problems .
The mental health problems appear to be worse than those reported five to 15 months after the September 11 terrorist attacks , in which 33 per cent of survivors reported having a day or more of poor mental health .
People were more likely to suffer from poor mental health if they were female or had experienced poor physical health in the past month .
Respondents diagnosed with depression before the incident were 19 times more likely to experience poor mental health and people who felt unsafe from crime were four times more likely .
Just under half of the residents ( 48 per cent ) reported a day or more of poor physical health , with 11 per cent reporting daily physical health problems .
These are approximately one and half times the pre-Katrina levels recorded in 2003 among Louisiana residents .
Then , 33 per cent reported a day or more of poor physical health , with seven per cent reporting daily physical health problems .
Poor mental health during the past month , lack of money for food and pre-Katrina arthritis were significant predictors of poor physical health during the past month .
" Some of the findings did surprise us " says Professor Kim .
" Being unemployed and having missing family members were not correlated with poor mental health , but they did correlate with poor physical health .
" Also , difficult access to clean drinking water did not correlate with poor physical health , but it did correlate with poor mental health . "
The aims of the study were to assess the medium - term post - Katrina mental and physical health of New Orleans residents and to determine the demographic , social and environmental factors that predict these problems .
The 222 residents were interviewed by University nursing students and faculty members , in partnership with the non-profit organisation Heart to Heart International .
They were carried out during door - to - door visits and a community health fair in December 2006 , 15 months after Katrina .
Just under two - thirds of the respondents ( 64 per cent ) were aged between 35 and 64 years of age and 47 per cent had some college education .
Sixty per cent were female , 77 per cent were black and 47 per cent were unemployed .
More than a quarter had no healthcare insurance , ate less than they should because of lack of money , lived below the poverty line and said their current house was unsafe due to major damage .
Almost a quarter ( 23 per cent ) felt unsafe from crime .
" Our findings indicate that the Katrina survivors are likely to suffer from persistent poor mental and physical health for the foreseeable future unless concerted interventions are put in place " says Professor Kim .
" The study suggests that post - Katrina efforts should focus on protecting the residents from crime , improving mental health services to those who are depressed and improving food supplies to the poor .
" We also hope that our findings will provide valuable guidance for healthcare professionals and policy makers involved in future disasters , by helping them to anticipate and deal with the mental and physical health problems that are left behind once the initial crisis has been dealt with . "

Students in public schools have math scores that are just as good if not better than those of students in private schools , according to a new national study .
The research focused across several years on 9,791 kindergarten through fifth - grade students .
" These data provide strong , longitudinal evidence that public schools are at least as effective as private schools in boosting student achievement , " said researcher Christopher Lubienski of the University of Illinois .
Combined with other , yet - unpublished studies of the same data , which produced similar findings , " we think this effectively ends the debate about whether private schools are more effective than publics , " said Lubienski , whose research has dealt with all aspects of alternative education .
This is important , he said , because many current reforms , such as No Child Left Behind , charter schools and vouchers for private schools , are based on the assumption that private schools offer better education than public schools .
The new study , detailed in May issue of the education journal Phi Delta Kappan , also involved doctoral student Corinna Crane and education professor Sarah Theule Lubienski , both of the University of Illinois .
Unlike literacy , math is viewed as being less dependent on a student 's home environment and more an indication of a school 's effectiveness , Sarah Lubienski said .
A previous study by the Lubienskis heated up controversy over the quality of private school education .
It showed that students ' math scores are better at public schools than at private schools , when controlling for socioeconomic status , but some critics said that study failed to show the possible effect over time of different types of schooling .
The data for the new study addresses the criticism with data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study , Kindergarten Class of 1998 - 99 ( or ECLS-K ) , administered by the National Center for Education Statistics ( NCES ) , part of the U.S. Department of Education .
The ECLS -K database includes student achievement and background information drawn from a nationally representative sample of more than 21,000 students , starting with their entry into kindergarten in the fall of 1998 .
The most recent data available for the University of Illinois study was gathered in 2004 , in the spring of the students ' fifth - grade year .
The sample used for the study included students in 1,531 schools ( 1,273 public , 140 Catholic and 118 other private schools ) .
After controlling for demographic differences among students and schools , the researchers found that public school students began kindergarten with math scores roughly equal to those of their Catholic school peers .
By fifth grade , however , they had made significantly greater gains , equal to almost an extra half year of schooling , Sarah Lubienski said .
Part of the explanation , she said , might lie in the fact that Catholic schools have fewer certified teachers and employ fewer reform - oriented mathematics teaching practices .
Public school students also " rivaled the performance of students in other ( non-Catholic ) private schools , " the researchers wrote .
After adjusting for demographics and initial kindergarten scores , they found that achievement gains between kindergarten and fifth grade were roughly equal .
" School type alone does n’t explain very much of why these scores vary … in truth , whether the school is public or private does n’t seem to make that much difference , " Sarah Lubienski said .
The researchers go on to write that they " personally see private schools as an integral part of the American system of education " and " there are many valid reasons why parents choose private schools and why policymakers may push for school choice . "
Academic achievement , however , may no longer be one of those reasons , they write .
" Claims that simply switching students from one type of school to another will result in higher scores appear to be unfounded , " they write .
Let 's remember , shall we ?
An unprecedented and major crisis - which the president says could destroy the country .
The answer ?
Appointing a member of his administration to have near - total power over the enterprise , unfettered by checks and balances , with unlimited resources to dispense with as he wants .
Yes , there 's some oversight in the package that has emerged today - but not much :
" The administration 's original proposal was a non-starter , " Sen. Chris Dodd ( D - Conn . ) said this afternoon .
" They wanted a blank check and we could n't give it to them . "
At the same time , Paulson will get direct hiring authority for building the staff that will carry out the bailout , the ability to set regulations , and the power to designate financial institutions as agents of the government .
I understand that something almost certainly had to pass .
But the impulse behind the Bush administration 's " strongman " approach to government is as dangerous in the economy as in the war :
It is now extremely clear that , in the run-up to the Iraq war , Congress and the press failed in their duty .
We were much too credulous toward an administration ’s certainty in the face of great peril .
We let deliberation cede to pure action .
When reality started to seep through the propaganda , the administration responded by smearing the press , demonising the opposition and running election campaigns on the basis of fear and deference to presidential authority .
In the face of the current economic crisis we surely must n’t make the same mistake again .
We have to demand transparency , deliberation , debate and factual data .
We must not be rushed into anything rash .
Handing a financial dictator a trillion dollars to do with as he wishes is not a democratic impulse ; it is antidemocratic .
This is a critical moment for real conservatives to stand up and be counted .
Edmund Burke , the founder of Toryism , was concerned above all with checks on concentrated power .
Nothing appalled him more than naked , unchecked executive power  as the third and fourth US presidents , Thomas Jefferson and James Madison , also understood .
And yet that is what has consumed the American constitution for the past seven years , aided and abetted by so - called conservatives who have let fear override reason , power trump freedom and terror displace the rule of law .
In some ways what we are seeing now is also reassuring .
It is the end of a great , recent American illusion .
The illusion that you can delegate self - government to a great leader .
You can ’t .
The illusion that wars are won purely by saying they ca n’t be lost .
The illusion that you can borrow and borrow and spend and spend and the day of reckoning will never come .
But that day is here .
And it is long overdue .
In the resistance to the bailout from men like Cantor and Pence , we may be seeing the saplings of the conservatism that could emerge after what may well be the Big Liberal Leap of the Bush - Obama years .
Well , I guess you 've got to start somewhere .

We want to hear what you think about this article .
Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com .
Since atheism refers to the lack of theistic belief , militant atheism must be something like an aggressive or impassioned lack of theism .
Confused yet ?
Yeah , me too .
Once we understand what atheism is , it becomes evident that " militant atheism " is meaningless , at least in this context .
Consequentially , the terminology , militant atheists , should be understood not as an expression that refers to the elements in society who possess the intellectual tenacity to hold to scrutiny the mythology that continues to dominant the worldviews possessed by the religious ; the flocks of mindless followers .
To the contrary , the unfortunate phrase is best understood as the projection upon the reasoned and rational , by those who lack such lucid deliberations , of the very shortcomings that impede the intellectual maturation of the faithful .
Richard Dawkins was greeted with accusations of " militant atheism " when he published The God Delusion .
Based on the book 's title , even many Christians who never read the book could assume that it was an attack on their god -belief .
That was all it took .
Dawkins dared to criticize their religious beliefs ; this made him " militant . "
For those who did actually read the book , it was clear that Dawkins had committed an even worse offense than criticizing religion - he encouraged others to do so .
Yep , he was militant alright .
Militant for writing a book .
And now we have PZ Myers , widely accused of " militant atheism " for mocking Catholicism in the Crackergate incident .
What exactly was Myers ' offense ?
He criticized religion on his blog , encouraged others to do the same , spoke out against religion in various interviews , and destroyed a wafer obtained from a Communion ritual .
This makes him militant ?
Really ?
These may have been two of the most prominent examples , but there have been countless others accused of " militant atheism . "
The pattern which emerges is quite clear : a militant atheist is an atheist who does not keep his or her feelings about religion hidden .
That is , you might be a militant atheist if you express yourself on the subject of religion .
Exercising your freedom of speech makes you militant .
In a previous post on the subject of militant atheism , I wrote , In all other contexts in which the word " militant " is applied , it refers to behavior rather than one 's viewpoint .
Moreover , the " militant " descriptor is typically reserved for violent behavior .
According to State of Protest , " Real militant atheism is literally taking up a weapon and fighting those who support religion , and in some cases those who merely do n’t support real militant atheism . "
For example , when The Uncredible Hallq searched Google for " militant Christian " and " militant Muslim , " he found that they were used to depict persons or groups committing acts of violence .
Catholics issuing death threats to PZ Myers seems to fit the bill ; criticizing religion does not .
So what is really going on when a Christian uses the " militant atheism " accusation ?
According to Russell Cole of the Midwest Populist Party Rather than acknowledging that those trying to improve society might have legitimate reasons to seeking change , it is easier for those in power to demonize them .
We saw this with the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s , and we are seeing it now as atheists seek equality Future posts will explain how accusations of " militant atheism " are a form of anti-atheist bigotry and will explore how atheists should respond to such accusations .
For now , I highly recommend this video .

news Lawrence of A-rack-ia
When we first got a tip from Andrew Hunter that “ someone has installed a new type of bike post along Yonge north of Lawrence , ” we were concerned that it might be the vanguard of the Coordinated Street Furniture onslaught of mass - produced uniformity .
When we went down ( yes , down ) to visit the area , however , we were quite relieved to discover not Kramer - designed brontosaurus ribs but elegant , artfully crafted flourishes of metallic whimsy .
Inspired by a similar project in which psychiatric survivors designed bike stands for the curb in front of the Parkdale Activity and Recreation Centre ( PARC ) , the Yonge Lawrence Village BIA commissioned two of the artists behind that project , Phil Sarazen and Jack Gibney , to fashion sixteen pieces , each featuring “ a different aspect of community living . ”
Studded into each block on both sides of Yonge Street north from Lawrence to Yonge Boulevard , they succeed in being everything that Astral ’s street furniture is not , and should serve as an inspiration to all neighbourhoods and BIAs as to what is possible when you ’re willing to invest in your community rather than sell it out .

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks next to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke ( R ) after meeting with Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson ( 2nd L ) , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) ( L ) and other congressional leaders in the U.S. Capitol in Washington September 18 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Mitch Dumke
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Treasury was expected to deliver to Congress within 24 hours a proposal to calm the financial markets and deal with illiquid debt instruments , congressional aides said on Friday .
The proposal was expected to contain some legislative details , but fall short of qualifying as an actual bill , said the aides , all of whom asked not to be identified .
“ We ’re expecting more than general principles but less than legislative language , ” said one Senate aide .
Congress is preparing to move swiftly once those principles are converted into legislation .
House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer , a Maryland Democrat , said he expects to bring legislation to the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives “ early next week ” for passage .
The Senate also would have to approve the Wall Street bailout before sending it to U.S. President George W. Bush for signing into law .
One aide said the Treasury proposal would likely make suggestions on what kind of debt instruments should be purchased under the program to soak up subprime mortgage - backed securities , and possibly other types of broken debt instruments , that are paralyzing world credit markets .
The aide said the proposal may also call for locating the program initially within the Treasury Department and then possibly migrating it later into an independent entity , as long as that could be done without slowing the market rescue process .
It was still unclear who might be in charge of the program and how much taxpayer money it will likely cost , aides said .
Kids : do not try this at home .

The Demopolis Rooster Bridge is located about 10 miles west of Demopolis , Alabama on U.S. Highway 80 , across the Tombigbee River .
It 's called the Rooster Bridge because part of its funding came from a rooster auction held in Demopolis on August 14 - 15 , 1919 .
The photos below date from the spring flood of 1979 .
The tug released its barges on the lower side , but then ran into trouble and did turn over as the pictures show .
This drawbridge has since been replaced by a clear span .
Fortunately , no one was injured in this incident and the tug is still in operation on the Tombigbee .

A side dish from the Dark Side :
Sculpt Jar Jar
Binks out of a root vegetable .
Like just about every other kid growing up in the late twentieth century , I could never get enough of Star Wars .
So it 's no surprise that a grown - up Jedi- wannabe with a knack for the culinary arts would turn to Star Wars food carvings for entertainment .
There was just one problem ... after hours of carving , I was n't sure I 'd be able to destroy my handiwork .
After all , who wants to squash a sweet potato that 's been lovingly crafted to look like Admiral Akbar ?
Or demolish a Daikon radish in the form of cult hero Boba Fett ?
Not me , that 's for sure .
But what if I could create a Star Wars figure that I wanted to destroy ?
Surely then I 'd be able to slice into it without remorse .
Choosing a character did not turn out to be difficult .
Jar Jar Binks was easily the worst thing about The Phantom Menace .
If I could create a scrumptious salad out of him and serve him up with a tasty crostini , perhaps I might have my revenge .
Jicama proved to be just the right medium for my sculpture — it 's a tuberous root vegetable that is perfect for food carvings .
It 's crisp , cuts easily and does n't dry out quickly .
Jicama does n't taste like much but readily absorbs the juices and flavors of a marinade or sauce .
No Lightsaber Required
Carving a Gungan out of a jicama is fun , but time - consuming and a little tricky .
It 's a lot easier if you have a good variety of carving tools at your disposal .
You wo n't be surprised to hear that professional food carvers use all sorts of fancy gadgets for their food carvings .
But you do n't need upscale tools for this project .
You 'll need a sharp knife with a mid-sized blade for removing large chunks of the jicama and at least one smaller blade for detail work .
In the accompanying picture , you can see my choice of tools : a Kershaw Ken Onion Leek and an old Swiss Army knife .
I also used a Forschner 3 - inch Paring Knife .
That 's shown in one of the pictures below .
You 'll also need toothpicks , a mid-sized paintbrush and a fine - point brush for coloring Jar Jar .
Any kind of food coloring will do , but I chose Chefmaster powdered food color because that 's what I had in the house .
Ingredients
1 large jicama .
Though you might want to get an extra as a backup !
2 large carrots
1 cup red onion
1 red pepper
1 yellow pepper
1 large tomato
2 ripe limes
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
1 teaspoon honey
2 tablespoons olive oil
Pinch of ground cayenne pepper
Salt and pepper
2 tablespoons cilantro
Creating Jar Jar
Find some good pictures to use as a reference while you work .
You 'll need more than one , preferably from different angles , since you 'll be creating JJ in 3D .
Start by fleshing out the basic shape .
Carve away large chunks of the jicama using your mid-sized blade .
It should n't take long before you 've got the major features in place .
Now for the detail work .
A few key intricacies give Jar Jar his telltale look : his wrinkles , his eyes , and his goofy smile .
The wrinkles are created by making small notches all around his nose and ears .
Eyes are just round jicama balls that are attached via toothpicks after coloring is done .
Eyelids are separate as well and just sit on top of the eyeballs .
Last up is the food coloring .
Paint the majority of his body greenish - brown .
Jar Jar has a mottled look , so it 's okay if you do n't get this part perfect .
Assembling the Salad
There 's a lot of chopping to be done in making this salad .
But hey , this is a cooking site .
Around here , we look for excuses to chop !
Julienne the carrots , onion , peppers and tomato .
Do n't know how to julienne ?
No problem -- just cut up the veggies into oversized matchsticks .
Combine in a large bowl .
Squeeze the limes into a separate , small bowl and whisk in the vinegar , honey , olive oil and cayenne pepper .
Salt and pepper to taste .
Pour the lime mixture over the chopped veggies , add the chopped cilantro and toss .
Carefully place Jar Jar in the middle , then let sit for 30 minutes .
Serving Suggestions
How to present Jar Jar is really up to you .
If you and your guests are anything like me , you 'll be chomping at the chance to sit down at the dinner table and slice Jar Jar to bits .
I suggest putting some sharp knives around the edge of the bowl .
Let your guests slowly dismember JJ and enjoy munching his eyes , ears and ridiculous smile .
If , on the other hand , you liked Jar Jar in Star Wars , you might want to preserve him a bit longer .
In that case , carve up a second jicama and add that to the salad instead .
Let Jar Jar be a garnish and keep him intact until the party 's winding down .
Above you 'll see the final product -- a single serving of Jar Jar Binks Jicama Salad .
Mr. Binks may look gross , but he gets tastier and tastier as his insides absorb the lime - vinegar juice .
Mmmmm ...
Mesa happy to eat da Jar Jar salad !

I had a lot of fun creating this salad , but food carving is actually a serious business .
Want to see some amazing food sculptures and get an inside look at what it 's all about ?
Check out this recent New York Times article on food carving .
If you do decide to make a Jar Jar Jicama Salad , drop me a line and let me know how it went .
Or , better yet , invite me over and I 'll help you slice him up !
The BC paps finally caught up with our favorite sideline reporter .
Notice how shaky the camera was as our dreamy Erin Andrews got within inches of our position next to the ESPN GameDay set .

It actually lasted about 8 seconds .
She jumped off the ESPN field set and started walking quickly back towards her security detail and assistants .
But not before we went paparazzi .

Palin Derangement Syndrome : Obama 's Worst Enemy ?
There 's a new affliction sweeping the nation , and it 's known as Palin Derangement Syndrome .
The phenomenon is similar to Bush Derangement Syndrome , a term coined by political columnist Charles Krauthammer to describe the personal animosity and irrational hatred directed at President Bush by his leftist opponents .
But this time , Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's running mate , Sarah Palin , is the object of wrath .
The feeding frenzy began with the news of Palin 's selection , but it was her electrifying speech at the Republic National Convention last month that really set it off .
In one fell swoop , Palin managed to energize the Republican base , breathe life into the McCain campaign , launch some very effective jabs at Barack Obama , and quite possibly , attract the support of the 18 million Hillary Clinton voters .
The attacks on Palin have ranged from patronizing to vicious to fantastical .
She has been caricatured as an inexperienced rube , a baby - making automaton , an uneducated underachiever , a bad mother , trailer - park trash , a rightwing religious fanatic , a sexual fantasy , and of course , a fascist .
No subject has been deemed taboo in the effort to take Palin down .
What her detractors do n't seem to realize is that in the process of insulting Palin , they are insulting the majority of the country .
If being a self - made success story , a working mother , a church - going member of a small - town community , and a believer in moderate to conservative political viewpoints disqualifies Palin , what does that say about mainstream America ?
The inherent condescension at the heart of the anti-Palin campaign is coming across loud and clear and it may actually be boosting her popularity .
The sexist tenor of the attacks on Palin is only furthering this process .
Some of the worst comments have emanated from self - professed feminists who seem to resent the path Palin has taken in life , even as it parallels their own .
The always independent - minded Camille Paglia is a notable exception , but by and large , the liberal , female establishment has turned on Palin .
Never mind that Palin -- with an amazing record of professional accomplishment , a happy marriage , and five beautiful children -- is the personification of the feminist " women can have it all " ideal .
What all the attackers have in common is an almost pathological hatred and attendant desire to project upon Palin all of their worst fears , prejudices , and in some cases , fantasies .
In the pages of Salon Magazine , for instance , writer Gary Kamiya likened her to a " dominatrix , " while University of Michigan Middle East studies professor Juan Cole compared her to a " Muslim fundamentalist " and a member of the Taliban .
In what constitutes the lowest of the low , a number of Palin 's opponents have focused on her children or rather , their apparent resentment that she has chosen to have children .
The National Review's Byron York catalogued several of these in a recent column for The Hill .
As he noted : Wendy Doniger , the Mircea Eliade Distinguished Service Professor of the History of Religions at the University of Chicago Divinity School , wrote that Palin's " greatest hypocrisy is in her pretense that she is a woman " and denounced " the Republican Party 's cynical calculation that because [ Palin ] has a womb and makes lots and lots of babies -- she speaks for the women of America .
" Carol Fowler , the chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party , said that Palin's " primary qualification seems to be that she has n't had an abortion . "
Other adversaries have questioned Palin 's ability as a mother and in particular , a mother with a special needs baby , while still others have used her teenage daughter 's pregnancy to undermine her credibility .
But Palin 's domestic challenges are shared by millions of Americans and tend to elicit more sympathy than condemnation .
And everyone knows a male politician would never be asked such questions .
Always eager to proffer their political opinions , a host of Hollywood celebrities have issued their own high - minded objections to Palin .
Lindsay Lohan weighed in with her condescending belief that Palin is only " qualified to be " a " television anchor .
" Matt Damon likened Palin 's candidacy to a " really bad Disney movie , " and Gina Gershon went so far as to impersonate Palin in a vicious and unfunny clip that culminates in her stripping down to a bikini .
The list goes on , but every time another one of these desperately out - of - touch with America celebrities tries to belittle Palin , it has the opposite effect .
Despite her impressive resume , Palin has been dogged by accusations that she lacks experience and foreign policy know - how .
Democrats have pointed to the first part of her recent interview with ABC's Charlie Gibson as a " gotcha " moment simply because Palin asked Gibson to clarify what he meant by the Bush Doctrine .
As columnist Charles Krauthammer points out , the Bush Doctrine has held four different definitions over the course of the last eight years and has never been finally determined by the Bush administration .
The term was , in fact , originated by Krauthammer .
But Palin 's detractors have ignored this inconvenient fact , as well as failing to notice that Gibson 's pompous manner and ridiculously suspicious questions have become the real story .
Generally speaking , a public backlash over perceived media bias against Palin may be brewing .
US Weekly 's decision to run a trashy cover story on Palin titled , " Baby , Lies & Scandal " ( two months after a glowing cover story on the Obamas ) has reportedly resulted in thousands of cancellations .
In a larger sense , a September 4 Rasmussen poll notes that " 51 % of American voters think reporters are trying to hurt Sarah Palin with their news coverage , and 24 % say those stories make them more likely to vote for Republican presidential candidate John McCain in November . "
The media has been fixated on Palin for weeks and one is hard pressed to go a day without hearing some or another allegation being trotted out .
The worst example was when mainstream media outlets ran with a lurid rumor originating with an anonymous diarist at the leftist blog Daily Kos that insinuated that Palin 's son Trig was actually her grandson .
The falsehoods surrounding Palin on the Internet have been so widely reproduced that FactCheck.org , a nonpartisanw Web site , posted a listing of corrections aptly titled , " Sliming Palin .
" The all - out assault on the genuine and likable Palin is certainly a blessing in disguise for the Republican Party .
Not only is it galvanizing Republicans , but the nasty tone and hysterical nature are turning off potential Democratic voters .
In particular , those Democrats who , in the words of Obama speaking after a fundraiser at the Getty mansion in San Francisco earlier this year , " cling to their guns and religion . "
When Palin referenced Obama 's gaffe in her RNC speech , calling him out for speaking about Americans " one way in Scranton and another in San Francisco , " it was evident that she had her finger on the pulse of the Democratic Party 's discord .
So too Palin 's praise for Hillary Clinton and her reference to the " 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling . "
In building on McCain 's already existing strategy of reaching out to Hillary voters and others disaffected with the DNC leadership , Palin demonstrated a political savvy that the Obama camp never saw coming .
In choosing Palin as his running mate , McCain displayed the boldness and forward - thinking that his Democratic rival Obama has yet to embody .
By picking the conventional Joe Biden over Hillary Clinton as his running mate , Obama failed to live up to his own mantra of " change . "
He also failed to recognize a politically smart move when it was staring him in the face , as Clinton would have presumably brought millions of votes with her .
In fact , rumors that the Obama ticket would seek to unburden itself of Biden and replace him with Hillary in the coming weeks have been circulating , and at least one Huffington Post columnist has suggested as much .
Some have speculated that Democrats may be experiencing a bout of buyer 's remorse over their choice of Obama to head the ticket .
Obama 's empty rhetoric about " hope " and " change " certainly pales in light of the actual reform implemented by Palin in Alaska and by McCain throughout his career .
Meanwhile his brief resume and lack of political savvy and even at times , personal likability ( his odd sense of humor comes to mind ) have become liabilities .
But Obama 's worst enemy is not himself , or even Sarah Palin , but rather , the ranks of his own rabid supporters .
If they keep it up , McCain could be laughing all the way to the White House .
GREED  and its crafty sibling , speculation  are the designated culprits for the financial crisis .
But another , much admired , habit of mind should get its share of the blame : the delusional optimism of mainstream , all - American , positive thinking .
As promoted by Oprah Winfrey , scores of megachurch pastors and an endless flow of self - help best sellers , the idea is to firmly believe that you will get what you want , not only because it will make you feel better to do so , but because “ visualizing ” something  ardently and with concentration  actually makes it happen .
You will be able to pay that adjustable - rate mortgage or , at the other end of the transaction , turn thousands of bad mortgages into giga - profits if only you believe that you can .
Positive thinking is endemic to American culture  from weight loss programs to cancer support groups  and in the last two decades it has put down deep roots in the corporate world as well .
Everyone knows that you wo n’t get a job paying more than $ 15 an hour unless you ’re a “ positive person , ” and no one becomes a chief executive by issuing warnings of possible disaster .
The tomes in airport bookstores ’ business sections warn against “ negativity ” and advise the reader to be at all times upbeat , optimistic , brimming with confidence .
It ’s a message companies relentlessly reinforced  treating their white - collar employees to manic motivational speakers and revival - like motivational events , while sending the top guys off to exotic locales to get pumped by the likes of Tony Robbins and other success gurus .
Those who failed to get with the program would be subjected to personal “ coaching ” or shown the door .
Instead of a gun why not pick up a camera ?
Toronto police are hoping that gun owners , whether lawful or not , will consider clicking a button instead of pulling a trigger come Oct. 22 , when they will be given the option of trading in their firearms for a digital point - and - shoot .
Called Pixels for Pistols , this gun amnesty program is aiming to make weapons less accessible to the criminal element , by making a gun exchange more palatable to the general public .
" We want to eliminate that chance for criminals to get their hands on weapons , " Toronto police Community Mobilization Sgt. Chris Body , said .
" Any gun in someone 's home carries the potential for it to be stolen and wind up in the hands of criminals . "
Starting late next month , willing gun owners will be eligible for one of two prizes from Henry 's camera stores .
Turn in a handgun or assault rifle – get a Nikon Coolpix S52 with a $ 400 value .
Hand over a shotgun or a tamer rifle – get a Nikon Coolpix P60 worth approximately $ 250 .
And they both come with a gift certificate for free photography lessons .
" We 're not giving away junk , " said Max Payne of Henry's .
During the last amnesty in 2005 , police rounded up 260 guns .
In 2000 , the year the gun registry came into effect , they pulled in 1,800 weapons , including all manner of pistols , rifles and shotguns .
During an amnesty , police travel to the homes of gun owners who have called in , to pick up the weapons .
Not an anonymous process , the guns are then sent for ballistics testing and if it turns out they have been used in a crime , police conduct a follow - up investigation .
When officers drop by to pick up the weapons , they 'll decide on the spot what kind of prize is warranted – and hand over a gift certificate that participants can redeem at Henry's .

But , says Payne , it 's important participants pay attention to protocol .
" Do n't bring a gun to Henry 's , " he says .
" We 're stressing that .
There are steps you need to take . "
This is all rumor of course , but I found this item funny and intriguing enough to post today .
According to DCRTV and Mediabistro , Tony Kornheiser 's car was stolen from a DC garage last week and there are claims of a stalker being the culprit as well as a heightened security detail for King Tony ....
DCRTV : " Tony Kornheiser 's ( right ) car was stolen from the ESPN garage in DC last week causing ' mad drama , ' to quote one source .
He dropped his keys in the garage , someone took the car , and now he 's demanded extra security because he claims it 's a stalker . "
More soon .....
Mediabistro's FishbowlDC : " We hear that Tony Kornheiser 's car was stolen from the ESPN garage in DC , last week causing " mad drama , " to quote one source .
He dropped his keys in the garage , someone took the car and now he 's demanded extra security because he claims its a stalker . "
All of this is still a rumor at the moment , and while stalkers can be very scary , but come on .
If you drop your car keys in a garage when someone 's watching , you really only have yourself to blame .
DC garages are n't the safest place in the world and there are some seedy characters hanging around .
More on this when information becomes available .
Bush moves to clean up before leaving office .
The first of the anthrax letters were sent on September 18 , 2001 , just seven days after the events of 9/11 ( the same day I wrote the essay : Is This the Dawn of an Orwellian Police State ? ) .
Immediately after the attacks of 9/11 , yet before the anthrax attacks , many individuals within the government and the media were warned of impending anthrax attacks , told to procure Cipro and , in some cases , start taking it preemptively .
These warnings came from " high government officials .
"
We know now that the anthrax used in the attacks came from the super secret and locked down facility in Maryland known as Fort Detrick .
You can be certain that the weapons of mass destruction held at this facility are maintained with a high level of security .
After all , there are few things more dangerous to human life than bioweapons .
Nevertheless , anthrax was removed from the facility with the purpose of terrorizing Americans and targeting enemies of the Bush Regime within the press , media and the government itself .
The Bush Regime knew , in advance , of the anthrax attacks and warned certain individuals in advance .
Bruce E. Irvins , apparently one of the team of individuals asked by the Bush Regime to carry out the attacks , was rewarded for his efforts with the bestowal upon him of the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service , the U.S. Army 's highest honor for civilian workers .
The targets of the Bush Regime 's terrorist attacks included the Senate Majority Leader of the opposing political party , Tom Daschle and liberal Senator Patrick Leahy , both opponents of George Bush .
We can only speculate that these attacks were either an attempt to assassinate or intimidate these opposition leaders and to terrorize the American people into accepting the new dictatorship .
The anthrax used was of a strain directly traceable to Fort Detrick .
It was weapons grade and could not have been manufactured at such a level of quality by someone outside of the bioweapons field .
This fact was initially suppressed by a deliberate campaign of subterfuge by the terrorist cell at Fort Detrick .
Who did the FBI send the samples of the anthrax to for evaluation ?
They sent them to the terrorist cell at Fort Detrick .
The terrorist cell at Fort Detrick responded by providing an intentionally bogus analysis of the anthrax specifically designed to implicate Iraq , a nation uninvolved with the anthrax attacks and uninvolved with the events of 9/11 .
It is well known that the Bush Regime had been planning an attack on Iraq long before the events of 9/11 .
The anthrax attacks were used to manufacture a false belief that Iraq had attacked the United States .
The FBI needed a scape goat for the attacks and they chose Steven Jay Hatfill .
Various members of the terrorist cell at Fort Detrick implicated Hatfill in the press and then the FBI declared publicly , with no evidence , that Steven Jay Hatfill was a " person of interest " in the case .
After years of never finding any evidence that could be used against Hatfill , the case against him was dropped and Hatfill successfully sued the FBI , winning on June 27 of this year a settlement of $ 5.8 million dollars .
This successful counter move by the patsy chosen by the government to take the fall embarrassed the FBI .
They needed another person on whom to pin the attacks .
They had to chose someone within the terrorist cell at Fort Detrick to take the fall ( after all , only they had access to the anthrax ) and they had to be certain that the chosen fall man would not be able to speak in his defense , so they involuntarily committed him to psychiatric care , hooked him up with a consoling facility which specializes in giving patients opioids , ostensibly to help them fight addiction , and created the conditions under which someone in a position of power above him could accuse him of stalking her , have him declared homicidal , and basically " nuts . "
The man they chose was Bruce E. Ivins .
Two days before he was scheduled for a court hearing regarding the alleged stalking , Ivins killed himself with a bottle of pain killers someone had prescribed him ( exactly the same kind of substance for which , the clinic that he was assigned to , aims to provide detoxification services ) .
In my personal opinion , it appears that Ivin 's suicide was designed and managed by someone who wanted him to take the fall and his knowledge of what really happened to the grave .
Now we are being told that this case is over and that the families of the victims have closure .
We are supposed to believe that Ivins was a lone nut acting on his own .
I do n't buy the official story .
All of the evidence says that Ivin was part of a government directed terrorist cell and that his death is the cover up .

Ahmad Fadam left the Baghdad Bureau in May to take up a visiting fellowship at the University of North Carolina .
It has been more than two months since I arrived in the United States , and I ’m starting to wake up from the culture shock everyone warned me about .
Or at least this is what I ’m thinking , because there is still so much for me to see and learn in this country .
I have been seeing things and learning about things that no one in my country will believe .
Some of it is so beautiful and some is so crazy that even I , the one who saw it , can not believe it .
Being in another country makes you get acquainted with a new culture , traditions , habits .
Most of the time , it is very different than what you have experienced all your life when you still lived back home .
You were used to doing things there that you cannot do here , because you know it is different .
You have to force yourself not to do so now and to start acting like the people in this country .
You do n’t want to be looked at as a stranger .
No one wants to be in this position .
I was talking to a journalist from Pakistan named Umar .
He is very smart and polite , very thoughtful too .
We were talking about how a person starts to behave differently when he leaves his country .
He starts saying things and doing things that he did n’t do when he was still there .
You become very polite and sweet when talking , very organized , obeying the rules and dressing well .
You would do anything to make others look at you in a good way , to have the same respect that you had in your country even if it is in a different way .
It is amazing how we act when we are out of our country .
We start to feel like we were assigned to represent it , to show the good image of our culture , to try to make people know about the best of us .
If people have heard bad things about our countries — and that is the position I am in now — we start explaining that what they have heard is not the full truth and in fact it is very different .
We try to defend the name of our country and feel sad whenever we hear someone saying bad things about it .
At the same time we have to live with the fact that this is a total different civilization than ours .
Both Umar and I were thinking in the same way and we both were finding it strange .
Why did n’t we act the same when we were back home ?
Why did n’t we look at our culture , traditions and history in the same way as we look at it now ?
Why did n’t we defend it when we were there rather than wait to come here to do it ?
Umar is from Pakistan and I ’m from Iraq , and we both felt the same way .
But I can talk about myself and my country .
I have been trying to reflect a good picture of Iraq since I first came here .
But at the same time , I ’m fighting myself because I ’m basically in the country that invaded mine .
It ’s complicated , and I have to live with it .
I talk to Americans – who mostly do n’t know much about Iraq , except that their troops are there , and there is killing and violence going on – and I answer their questions .
I cannot help but feel many of our problems were the result of that invasion , and I try to explain to them what a great history and culture we have and how we used to be before 2003 .
And this tears me apart , because I have to remember all of this and keep smiling to them .
How more difficult can it be ?
To be honest , I had some doubts because when I first came to the United States , I had this fear inside me about the way I was going to be treated .
In Iraq , Iraqis are often treated as possible enemies by American soldiers .
You can not get close to them or talk to them until they check you out and make sure that you are OK .
I myself was shot at several times in Baghdad just because I was driving my car close to an American convoy .
So I thought that I might be treated the same here in America .
But I found it surprisingly different .
Ordinary Americans are kind and welcoming .
Many of them in fact do n’t like what their government is doing in Iraq .
Many of them feel sorry and sad for what is happening and some of them apologized to me when they learn that I ’m an Iraqi .
But still , they are all busy with their lives , their work , how to spend their day and decorate their kitchens .
Iraq is their last concern .
Maybe those who have lost friends or relatives in Iraq or even still have someone serving there would care .
So how can an Iraqi like me live in America ?
I came here looking for peace , and this means to forget even for awhile about the violence I lived through in the last five years in Iraq .
I have to find myself again and to know who I am .
I have to find the part that I lost because of getting used to the violence .
I want to find the human inside me again .
But this time , in another world , I have to belong to something and have an identity .
But how ?
How can I find my identity ?
What is a man ’s identity ?
Could it be by what he does ?
Like being a journalist ?
Or could it be by his religion or nationality ?
Like saying that he is a Muslim Arab ?
These are all possible .
But the greatest of all is when he belongs to a country , like to say that he is Chinese , or French , or Pakistani .
For me I will always say that I ’m an Iraqi , and I ’m proud of it .
UPDATE : I now have the English - language version of the interview .
Listen to it here .
Bumped .
This is a very important story .
( UPDATE : I now have the Spanish version of the interview cropped to the 1 minute 37 seconds in question .
You can listen to it here , but it ’s in Spanish . )
This is n’t funny .
It ’s actually quite serious .
We may have the first evidence , on tape , that McCain ’s age , or illness , or both are catching up with him and he ’s losing his mental faculties .
I just listened to an interview John McCain did with a Spanish journalist recently .
The interview is in English , but there ’s a Spanish translator translating the tape into Spanish at the same time .
So the English part is difficult to hear .
I am however fluent in Spanish , and what Josh reports is exactly what the Spanish version shows .
Namely , that John McCain did n’t appear to know that Spain was in Europe , or that the leader of Spain was named Zapatero , even after he was told that Zapatero was the leader of Spain .
When asked about Spain and Zapatero , by a Spanish reporter for a Spanish newspaper , McCain responded about Mexico and Latin America .
A reader suggested something that Josh had already considered , that perhaps McCain thought the reporter was talking about the Zapatistas in Mexico , the guerilla group .
But that ’s not possible as the reporter clearly said she was talking about Spain and Spain ’s leader , Zapatero .
She told McCain this twice .
Let me tell you exactly what she asked McCain ( per the translation ) :
“ Senator , finally , let ’s talk about Spain .
If you ’re elected president , would you invite President Zapatero to meet with you in the White House ? ”
McCain then gives this odd answer about America ’s friends and America ’s enemies .
He also , oddly , talks about Mexico ( why Mexico ?
The question was about Spain ) and how he ’d invite friendly leaders to the White House .
She then asks him again , would that invitation include President Zapatero ?
He says again that he ’d have to review relations first , blah blah .
She then says again , “ so you ’d have to wait to see , so would you meet with him in the White House ? ”
He again repeats his weird statement about friends and enemies .
McCain also throws in , oddly , to the Spanish reporter , when she ’s asking him about meeting the Spanish president , a line about the importance of our relationship with Latin America ( this is now the second time he answered a question about meeting the president of Spain with an answer about Latin America ) .
She then says to McCain one last time :
“ Okay , but I ’m talking about Europe – the president of Spain , would you meet with him ? ”
This time , there was no room for confusion .
McCain then gives this very bizarre answer :
“ I will meet with any leader who has the same principles and philosophy as us in terms of human rights , democracy , and freedom and I will stand up to those who do not . ”
What does concern about human rights , democracy and freedom have to do with a prerequisite for meeting the president of Spain ?
Especially when you told the same paper 5 months ago that you ’d be happy to meet with him .
McCain had no idea what was going on in the interview .
She specifically told him , twice , that she was talking about Spain and the Spanish president .
She ’s a Spanish reporter with one of the largest , if not the largest , newspaper in Spain , El Pais .
I know this paper , McCain certainly knows this paper ( and it ’s not like McCain ’s staff did n’t tell him who he had the exclusive interview with for ten minutes ) .
She made it clear she was asking about her own country and her own president and Mccain had no clue what she was talking about .
Either McCain had no idea what the woman was talking about when she said “ Spain , ” and then said “ the President of Spain , ” repeatedly , or McCain intentionally snubbed the country of Spain tonight for no apparent reason , which is very hard to believe , especially given his earlier interview in which he said he was fine meeting Zapatero .
The interview is absolutely bizarre , especially in that it sounds like McCain was n’t even lucid , it sounds like he simply does n’t have complete control over his faculties anymore .
And judging by the fact that just a few months ago McCain was fine with Zapatero , it sounds like McCain simply was n’t quite all there any more during the interview .
He got horribly confused and did n’t know what was going on .
This is just incredibly disturbing .
And remember , this is hardly the first time in the last year that McCain has become confused about his signature issue , foreign affairs .
It ’s happened a lot in the past year , and it never happened before .
There ’s a pattern here , even if in polite company the media is n’t supposed to talk about .
McCain is having trouble focusing and understanding what ’s going on around him .
He gets increasingly confused .
And that ’s just scary .
Radar reveals San Francisco 's buried Presidio SAN FRANCISCO
State - of - the - art tools let archaeologists map original Spanish settlements in city

Archaeologists are using cutting - edge technology - including ground radar and laser scanning - to uncover vanished walls and dwellings of the original Spanish Presidio of San Francisco , one of the two oldest European settlements in the Bay Area .
The other is Mission Dolores , several miles away .
Both were founded by Spanish missionaries and colonists in 1776 , just weeks before the United States declared independence .
The present mission church was built in 1791 , but the Presidio 's original buildings have crumbled away , and the extent of the fort 's original walls and outbuildings is a mystery .
The remains of some adobe walls in the former Army Officers Club date back to the 1790s , but the date of their construction is uncertain .
" We do n't know exactly how old this building is , to tell you the truth , " said Eric Blind , an archaeologist with the Presidio Archaeological Lab .
The Officers Club , which was extensively remodeled in the 1930s , was on one side of a four - sided fort that when it was new marked the frontier of the Spanish empire , the edge of European power on the west coast of North America .
Under Pershing Square
There are written accounts , pictures and drawings of the fort dating from the late 18th century , but the real El Presidio of Spanish times lies under a couple of streets , a parking lot and lawn that rings Pershing Square , where the main flagpole marks the center of the Presidio as it was in U.S. Army days .
Archaeologists have been digging for years into the Presidio 's past and have come up with more than 80,000 artifacts , buttons , bones , pieces of foundation , crockery - all the remains of 220 years of military occupation .
But only 2 percent of the original Presidio has been dug up to date .
" It 's still unexcavated and unknown , " Blind said .
The archaeologists have figured out the extent of the first Presidio and a later and larger version put up in 1815 , but what exactly is underneath is a bit of a mystery .
Blind has a good idea of what 's there : foundations of houses , pieces of what the settlers left behind .
He says there were more civilians than soldiers in Spanish days .
Half of the members of the original expedition led by Juan Bautista de Anza to found a colony in San Francisco were under 14 years of age .
' Center of secular authority '
" This was the center of secular authority in the Bay Area from Sonoma to Santa Cruz , " Bland said .
It also had a different purpose than the missions , which aimed to convert the native Indian people to Christianity .
The Presidio was meant to hold the land and to be the center of a colony , like the English in Virginia or the Dutch in New Amsterdam .
" It 's the birthplace of San Francisco , " said Michael Boland , chief of planning and projects for the Presidio Trust , which runs the Presidio .
The trick is to find what 's under the ground without digging everything up , said David Morgan .
Morgan is chief of archaeology and collections at the National Center for Preservation Technology .
" To remove it , you have to destroy it . "
" We have to figure it out .
Are we right ?
Do we have to tear up a whole plot to find out what 's underneath ? " said Blind .
So the Presidio archaeologists use radar and electronic devices to see under the ground .
Gopher volunteers
One of their searches this week was centered on a spot of green lawn about 30 feet southeast of the Presidio 's main flagpole .
The spot was covered by green grass and a couple of gopher holes .
" Volunteer archaeologists , " Blind calls the gophers .
Wednesday , the archaeologists dug a hole 3 feet long by about 1 1 / 2 feet wide , like a surgical strike .
Bingo !
Under the lawn were some sandstone rocks , the foundations of some outbuildings of the long - ago Presidio .
" It was as if we had a jigsaw puzzle with a thousand pieces and we did n't know how it went together , " Morgan said .
" This , " he said , " is now a piece of the puzzle . "
" We are literally only scratching the surface , " Blind said .
The technology they are using is not new , but the application to digging the past is , Morgan said .
" Now we are using technology solutions to address preservation problems , " he said .
Buried but not destroyed
One of the advantages of working to uncover the colonial Presidio is that , unlike other European colonies in American cities , the Presidio is mostly unchanged .
" Manhattan grew up over Dutch New Amsterdam , but the city of San Francisco grew up away from the Presidio , " he said .
So what is past is only buried , not destroyed .
The Presidio digs are also being used as a classroom to help other archaeologists learn cutting - edge techniques .
It is also useful for archaeology students at Stanford , UC Berkeley , Sonoma State University and San Francisco State , which all have archaeology departments .
The presidio archaeology lab even has developed a course for grammar school kids , so they can understand California 's roots .
PUERILE provocation or Swiftian satire ?
Let critics debate the merits of " ¡Ask a Mexican ! , ” Gustavo Arellano ’s witty , profane and occasionally edifying OC Weekly column .
We ’re more interested in the Guatemalan - baiting , tamale - loving Mexican ’s thoughts on Cinco de Mayo .
For those who still want answers , Arellano will be presenting the book based on his column at two appearances this weekend .
Is Cinco de Mayo a real holiday or is it just a beer company holiday ?
Cinco de Mayo is an actual holiday that commemorates Mexico ’s victory over France in the Battle of Puebla on May 5 , 1862 .
What ’s never noted is that a year later , the French came back , slaughtered the Mexicans , then occupied Mexico for four years until the Mexicans finally kicked them out .
If this is what passes for a Mexican holiday , no wonder the only way to celebrate it is by drinking ourselves into oblivion .
Cinco de Mayo vs. St. Patrick ’s Day : Who would win ?
I ’d have to say St. Patrick ’s Day .
Leprechauns get much more drunk and much more aggressive than Mexicans .
Advertisement
How about Cinco de Mayo vs. Oktoberfest ?
Cinco de Mayo .
Mexicans , when we get drunk , we get happy .
Germans , when they get drunk , they get foolish .
More important , Mexicans are even more German than Germans .
All of our music -- oompah and polka and all that -- is based on German music .
You put a Mexican in Oktoberfest , he starts dancing .
You put a German in Cinco de Mayo , he scratches his head .
I never knew the accordion was such a cultural unifier .
Banda music -- the big brass bands you ’ll hear rattling from a Lincoln Navigator if you drive around South - Central -- that ’s just a German oompah band .
And in the conjunto nortenos where you hear the accordions , those are just Czech and Polish polkas .
Nowadays , the only people in America who think the accordion is cool are people in Cleveland -- and Mexicans .
Advertisement
Some tend to lump all the Central and South American ethnicities together .
But what do Guatemalans , Hondurans , Salvadorans and so forth do on Cinco de Mayo ?
It ’s an occasion to party .
That ’s the one thing that unifies Latinos .
Not even the Spanish language unifies us .
It ’s the party .
On Cinco de Mayo , everyone ’s an honorary Mexican .
It gives you a pass to get as drunk as possible , and I think that ’s something all races can agree on .
For an Angeleno who somehow knows nothing about Cinco de Mayo , how do you recommend they celebrate ?
Eat Mexican food at real Mexican restaurants .
Do not go to El Torito .
Do not go to El Cholo .
Celebrate true Mexican independence from tyranny by going to a taco truck , especially now when the Board of Supervisors basically wants to regulate them out of existence .
Advertisement
In a recent column you touched on “ symbolic ethnicity . ”
Care to elaborate ?
There ’s this idea that somehow Mexicans will always remain Mexicans , that all we do is speak Spanish , not tip properly and swim in the ocean with our clothes on .
But one of the main ways that immigrants first make their mark on the country ( and by default , assimilate ) is by celebrating holidays .
At one point , St. Patrick ’s Day was only celebrated by the Irish .
Now it ’s almost a national holiday .
Cinco de Mayo is still viewed as this quaint , Mexican - only holiday , but more and more people celebrate it .
This means that Americans are more and more comfortable with Mexicans being in this country and the idea of them ultimately being no different from other Americans .

Mushroom Cloud over Wall Street as US Constitution Burns
These are dark times .
While you were sleeping the cockroaches were busy about their work , rummaging through the US Constitution , and putting the finishing touches on a scheme to assert absolute power over the nation 's financial markets and the country 's economic future .
Industry representative Henry Paulson has submitted legislation to congress that will finally end the pretense that Bush controls anything more than reading the lines from a 4 ' by 6 ' teleprompter situated just inches from his lifeless pupils .
Paulson is in charge now , and the coronation is set for sometime early next week .
He rose to power in a stealthily - executed Bankster 's Coup in which he , and his coterie of dodgy friends , declared martial law on the US economy while elevating himself to supreme leader .
" All Hail Caesar ! "
The days of the republic are over .
Section 8 of the proposed legislation says it all :
" Decisions by the Secretary pursuant to the authority of this Act are non-reviewable and committed to agency discretion , and may not be reviewed by any court of law or any administrative agency . "
Right ; " non-reviewable " supremacy .
Congress , of course , is more than eager to abdicate whatever little authority they have left .
They 're infinitely grateful for their purely ceremonial role , the equivalent of Caligula 's horse , albeit , with considerably less dignity .
Has even one senator spoken out against this madness , which -- according to informal internet polls -- is resoundingly rejected by the voters ?
Does it concern the members of congress at all , that the present financial crisis was brought on by the proliferation and sale of trillions of dollars of mortgage - banked garbage which were fraudulently represented as Triple A rated bonds by the very same people who now claim to need unprecedented and dictatorial powers to fix the problem ?
Or are they more worried that the steady torrent of contributions which flows from Wall Street to congressional campaign coffers will be inconveniently disrupted if they fail to ratify this latest assault on democratic governance ?
The House of Representatives is one big steaming dungheap that should be leveled and turned into an amusement park instead of a taxpayer - funded knocking shop .
What a pathetic collection of cowards and scumbags .
Bloomberg News : "
" The Bush administration sought unchecked power from Congress to buy $ 700 billion in bad mortgage investments from financial companies in what would be an unprecedented government intrusion into the markets .
Through his plan , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson aims to avert a credit freeze that would bring the financial system and the world 's largest economy to a standstill .
The bill would prevent courts from reviewing actions taken under its authority .
" He 's asking for a huge amount of power , '' said Nouriel Roubini an economist at New York University .
`` He 's saying , ` Trust me , I 'm going to do it right if you give me absolute control . '
This is not a monarchy . "
( Bloomberg )
The banksters own this country , always have ; only now they 've decided to strip away the curtain and reveal the ghoulish visage of the puppet - master .
It ai n't pretty .
Paulson decided that the financial markets needed an emergency trillion dollar face - lift just weeks before his former business partners at G - Sax were dragged off to the chopping block .
Was that the reason ?
Everyone on Wall Street knew that the bulls - eye had already been ripped from Lehman 's bloody back and was about to be fastened on Goldman's .
Now , it looks like they will escape their day of reckoning due to Paulson 's eleventh - hour reprieve .
Nice touch , eh ?
From the proposed legislation : LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL FOR TREASURY AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE MORTGAGE -RELATED ASSETS
" ( 3 ) designating financial institutions as financial agents of the Government , and they shall perform all such reasonable duties related to this Act as financial agents of the Government as may be required of them . "
Market Ticker 's Karl Denninger summed this up best : " This is the de facto nationalization of the entire banking , insurance and related financial system ..
That 's right - every bank and other financial institution in the United States has just become a de-facto organ of the United States Government , if Hank Paulson thinks they should be , and he may order them to do virtually anything that he claims is in furtherance of this act ..... The bill gives Paulson the ability to nationalize unlimited amount of private debt and force you and your children to pay for it . "
Denninger again : " The claim is that this is intended to ' promote confidence and stability ' in the financial markets .
It will do no such thing .
It will instead strike terror into the hearts of investors worldwide who hold any sort of paper , whether it be preferred stock , common stock or debt , in any financial entity that happens to be domiciled in the United States , never mind the potential impact on Treasury yields and the United States sovereign credit rating .
I predict that if this passes it will precipitate the mother and father of all financial panics . "
( Market Ticker )
Amen .
The transformation from a free market to a centralized , Soviet - style economy run by men whose judgment and credibility is already greatly in doubt ; does not auger well for the markets or the country .
Anyone with a lick of sense would cash in their chips first thing Monday and look for capital 's Elysium Fields overseas or as far as possible from the circus sideshow now run by G - Sax ringleader , Colonel Klink .
Paulson 's Chicken Little routine might might have soiled a few senatorial undergarments , but let 's hope the American people are made of sterner stuff and will reject this charade .
The conversation should be shifted from conceding more authority to hucksters in pin-stripes to indictments for securities fraud .
Even the most economically - challenged nation ought to be able to afford a few sets of leg - irons and a couple hundred jail cells .
That 's all it will take .
That , and a couple brisk dunks on the waterboard .
Glub , glub .
Paulson 's plan to revive the banking system by buying up hundreds of billions of dollars of illiquid mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) and other equally poisonous debt - instruments ; ignores the fact these complex bonds have already been " marked to market " in the recent firesale by Merrill Lynch .
Just weeks ago , Merrill sold $ 31 billion of these CDOs for roughly $.20 on the dollar and provided 75 percent of the financing , which means that the CDOs were really worth approximately $ .06 on the dollar .
If this is the settlement that Paulson has in mind , than the taxpayer will be well served .
But this will not recapitalize the banks balance sheets or mop up the ocean of red ink which is flooding the financial system .
No , Paulson intends to hand out lavish treats to his banker buddies , while interest rates soar , pension funds collapse , the housing market crashes , and the dollar does a last , looping swan - dive into a pool of molten lava .
Thanks ,
Hank .
Economist and author Henry Liu summarized the current maneuvering like this : " The Fed is merely trying to inject money to keep prices not supported by fundamentals from falling .
It is a prescription for hyperinflation .
The only way to keep price of worthless assets high is to lower the value of money .
And that appears to be the Fed unspoken strategy . "
Indeed .
The Fed and Treasury have decided to backstop the entire global financial system ( foreign banks can access the Fed 's facilities , too ! ) with paper money which is rapidly losing its value .
Watch the greenback tumble tomorrow in currency trading .
Congress is getting steamrolled and the American people are getting snookered .
Consumer confidence -- already at historic lows -- is headed for the wood - chipper feet - first .
Something has got to give .
One minute everything is hunky - dory ; the subprime meltdown is " contained " and " the fundamentals of our economy are strong " .
( Paulson )
And , less than a week later , congress is forced to surrender their constitutionally - mandated right to oversee spending in order to forestall economic Armageddon .
Which is it ?
Or is the real objective just to keep the country on an emotional teeter - totter long enough for all state - power to be subsumed by the Wall Street Politburo ?
No one knows what will happen next .
We are in uncharted waters .
And no one knows what the political landscape will look like after the dust settles from this outrageous power grab .
According to Paulson , things are so dire , the entire nation will be reduced to smoldering rubble and twisted iron .
But can we trust him this time after his long litany of lies ?
Is n't it about time to send the cockroaches scuttling back to their hideouts and bring in the cleaning crew to hose the whole place down ?
It sounds like a job for Ralph Nader , a man of vision and unshakable integrity .
Give Ralph a badge and let him deploy his Raiders to Wall Street armed with bullwhips and tasers .
Let them post a guard in every CEOs and CFOs office and every boardroom on the Street --- and if even one decimal is accidentally moved to the right or left on the corporate ledger ; clap them in leg - irons and drag them off squealing to Guantanamo .
That 's how you clean up Wall Street !
Do n't let the prospect of a national crisis trick you into giving up your freedom , America .
The people behind this scam are the same landsharks and flim - flam men who polluted the global marketplace with their snake oil and toxic sludge .
These are the fraudsters who manufactured the crisis to begin with .
This is just the latest installment of the Shock Doctrine ; engineer a crisis , and then , steal whatever is left behind .
Same sh** , different day .
Be resolute .
Do n't budge .
Our economic foundations may be crumbling , but or determination is not .
This is our country , not Goldman Sach's .
The people who destroyed America must be held to account .
Their time is coming .
Justice first .

23 Sep 08 , 04:13 Miconception - Spending actually not limited to $ 700B
The cost is n't $ 700 billion - the wording states " $ 700,000,000,000 outstanding AT ANY ONE TIME " .
That means buy $ 700 billion of trash .... sell it for $ 300 billion , buy ANOTHER $ 700 billion .... sell it for $ 300 billion .
Etc... Lather , Rinse , Repeat .

27 Sep 08 , 02:32 The Coming Crash
Panic now and avoid the rush , I have studied every crash since Tulip bulbs and this is worse than all of them combined .
It has taken America the best part of a century to get into this mess , and now you want to borrow your way out of debt .
A four to five thousand point crash in the Dow is just a round the corner .
When physicists petitioned the U.S. Department of Energy ( DoE ) in the early 1980s to build a particle accelerator that would recreate the fiery conditions of the big bang , they picked a name worthy of its magnitude .
The Superconducting Super Collider ( SSC ) located south of Dallas , Tex. , would have outshined even the Large Hadron Collider , which after 14 years and $ 8 billion is about to start shooting particles around its 17 - mile ( 27 - kilometer ) beam pipe on the Franco - Swiss border .
Slamming protons and antiprotons together at 40 tera - electron volts ( 40 trillion eV ) , the SSC would have put out more than enough energy to create the elusive Higgs boson , sometimes called the " God particle , " which gives other particles their mass .
( The less powerful LHC now has the honor of hunting the Higgs . )
But escalating costs prompted Congress to cut the SSC 's funding in 1993 before its components were even assembled .
Now , 15 years later , the SSC 's sophisticated magnets are finally accelerating protons to high energy , but not for the pursuit of mysterious particles .
Trace Life Sciences , based in Denton , Tex. , bought the parts in 2003 to make radioisotopes for medical imaging and radiation therapy .
If you have ever had a PET scan , the isotopes in your blood might have come from the most spectacular science experiment ever canceled .
The SSC 's use in medicine may be unique , but the end comes for all particle accelerators sooner or later .
Sooner is the operative word here in the U.S. , where flat budgets have made it hard for many aging experiments to continue .
Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Ill. , home to the leading Tevatron collider — soon to be eclipsed by the LHC — will shut down its machine in 2010 .
Last - minute budget cuts by Congress this year forced the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center ( SLAC ) in California to switch off its PEP - II collider in April ahead of schedule .
What will happen to these enormous machines once they go off - line ?
Once a particle accelerator is switched on , its fate is sealed as a research tool .
The particle collisions that researchers scour for exotic debris also bombard the machine 's metal parts with neutrons and other particles that render the metal radioactive .
Neutron bombardment can convert iron and cobalt , both found in steel , into the highly radioactive isotopes manganese 54 and cobalt 60 .
Given the potential health risks , the DoE does not allow used accelerator components to be put to public use , says Benedict Feinberg , a physicist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California .
So when an active accelerator retires , its parts typically get put to work on other particle physics experiments .
The SSC 's case was different : " When the Department of Energy pulled funding for the SSC project , the linac [ linear accelerator ] had never been assembled and tested , " says William Courtney , Trace 's director of accelerator operations .
The DoE 's moratorium extends to steel reinforcements in concrete radiation - shielding blocks around an accelerator .
When Berkeley 's Bevatron was decommissioned in 1993 , its concrete shielding went to the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory in Upton , N.Y .
The experiment 's large electromagnets , meanwhile , went to other particle research projects .
Feinberg says a few steel magnet cores , some copper wiring and shielding blocks remain inside the Bevatron building .
Radioactivity levels in these leftover parts and the building itself are now low enough that an April DoE environmental assessment slated the structure safe for demolition .
John Seeman , head of accelerator systems at SLAC , said half a dozen labs have requested components of the PEP - II collider , which created particles called B mesons for studying the disappearance of antimatter after the big bang .
The Frascati National Laboratory in Italy is a major contender .
Researchers there have proposed a more powerful version of the PEP - II experiment to the Italian government and could use almost all the PEP - II 's equipment , Seeman says .
Fermilab has also requested some of PEP - II 's magnets for a new machine that would make high - energy proton beams for neutrino research .
( When energized protons crash into beryllium targets , they create short - lived pions that decay into neutrinos . )
Fermilab intends to reuse most of the Tevatron 's parts for making neutrinos , including a booster accelerator that prepared protons for entry into the main Tevatron ring , which measures 3.9 miles ( 6.3 kilometers ) in circumference .
Fermilab 's deputy director , Young Kee Kim , says that the lab wants to keep the main ring in working order in hopes of reusing it for future experiments .
For the SSC , particle research was never in the stars .
The state of Texas auctioned off the linear accelerator equipment in 1996 to a Denton , Tex. –based company for the bargain price of $ 5 million — the book value for the unused parts was over $ 20 million , Courtney says .
Trace Life Sciences inherited the accelerator when it acquired that company in 2003 .
Trace now uses the linac to accelerate a beam of protons to 32.8 - mega - electron volts ( 3.28 million eV ) and bombard up to five different targets simultaneously for different isotopes .
Bombarding thallium with protons at 29 mega- electron volts ( MeV ) yields the isotope lead 201 , which decays to form thallium 201 —used in diagnosing myocardial infarctions , or heart attacks .
Iodine 123 and copper 64 are used for medical imaging such as in PET scans .
Graphite pieces placed in front of the 32.8 MeV beam slow the protons to the energies required for different isotopes .
The company hopes to bring online two additional accelerator stages — designed to boost protons to 50 - and 70 - MeV — that were not stored properly after the SSC shut down and fell into disrepair .
Trace might then begin providing specialty medical isotopes such as strontium 82 and iron 52 , both used in PET scans , which are currently available only from government labs .
There are advantages to working with scavenged parts from a futuristic particle accelerator that at its peak employed thousands of workers .
For one thing , customer service is a breeze .
When Courtney needs technical advice , all he has to do is call one of the national labs , he says , where researchers who worked on the parts are happy to offer their services .
After recording last week ’s interview , I was left with a 36 - minute MP3 and a profound feeling of dread .
You see , I hate transcribing audio .
I used to transcribe interviews in high school , and it ’s always tedious , taking upwards of eight times the length of the clip itself .
Bracing for a good four or five hours of rewinding and writing and rewinding , I remembered that this is The Future !
So , instead , I tossed the job over to the global anonymous workforce at Amazon Mechanical Turk instead .
The result : my 36 - minute recording was transcribed while I slept , in less than three hours , for a grand total of $ 15.40 .
This is a fraction of the cost / time of any other transcription service online , including the Turk - driven Casting Words , though you potentially sacrifice some quality .
In my experience , though , there were virtually no errors .
Here ’s how to do it yourself , with no programming knowledge required .
The instructions below are verbose , but using my template , it should n’t take you more than five minutes of setup per job .
Step 1 : Prepare your audio .
First , I split my 35 - minute audio file into seven five - minute MP3s .
Why ?
Mechanical
Turk workers are all working in parallel , so the more discrete tasks , the faster the job gets done .
This also diminishes the risk of one bad worker ruining your whole job .
( Though you ’re always allowed to reject bad submissions , and you ’ll never have to pay for those . )
I used the open - source Audacity to split the files , but you could just as easily use any audio utility or editing software .
Optionally , you might want to make each clip overlap by a few seconds , so you ’ll be able to easily recognize where each segment of the transcript starts and stops .
Name the files sequentially .
In my case , they were interview_1.mp3 through interview_7.mp3 .
When you ’re done , upload the files somewhere they can be downloaded publicly .
You ’ll need the full URLs later .
Step 2 : Design your HIT template .
Mechanical Turk jobs are called HITs — short for the dystopic - sounding “ Human Intelligence Tasks . ”
After you ’ve signed up as a new Requester on Mechanical Turk , you can design a new template from the homepage using one of several samples .
Choose the Default Template .
On the Properties screen , we ’ll write a short description of the task , define how many people we want to work on it , and how much we ’re willing to pay them .
For a five - minute MP3 , I think allotting two hours per assignment is ample time , and I expired the entire HIT in 12 hours because I was in a hurry .
As for pay rate , you ’ll need to determine the “ Reward per Assignment ” based on the difficulty of the task and what you think is fair .
I chose $ 2.00 per five - minute MP3 , or about $ 0.40 / minute .
Depending on the difficulty , you might want to try going higher or lower .
I only wanted one worker to attempt each clip , so I changed the “ number of assignments per HIT ” to 1 .
( If you want redundant transcripts for each clip , change this to 2 or 3 … But be aware your costs will double or triple ! )
After entering all this information , here ’s what my finished Properties screen looked like :
On the Design Layout screen , you design the template that gets displayed to each worker , using basic variables that will be substituted later .
For this template , we make up only one variable named “ $url . ”
You can call it anything you like .
The basics you ’ll need are a title , some simple rules , the link to the audio file with a substitution variable , and a text form for the worker to type the transcription into .
If you ’d like to use my template HTML , here it is .
( Make sure you change the path to your own audio files ! )
Two things to notice in my example .
First , the “ $ {url} ” variables will be substituted with values in the “ url ” column of the spreadsheet we ’ll create in the next step .
Second , any form element you create will end up in your final output from Mechanical Turk , so do n’t worry about the naming .
I called mine simply “ transcription . ”
Here ’s what the relevant part looks like in the final template :
Please transcribe this five - minute MP3 : < a href = “ $ {url} “ >$ {url} < /a>
Enter your transcription below : < textarea name= ” transcription ” cols = ” 80 ″ rows =
” 30 ″ ></textarea >
For the worker ’s convenience , I also added an embedded Flash player for the MP3 , but this is entirely optional .
When you ’re done designing your template , it should look something like this :
On the next screen , make sure it looks the way you like , and click “ Preview and Finish ” to save the HIT template .
Step 4 : Upload the data for your HITs .
Once we ’re done designing our template , we can select it to create a new HIT batch .
We ’ll be creating a simple comma-separated file ( . CSV ) filled with the data that will be substituted into our template .
On the Publish tab , select the template you just created by clicking the “ Select ” button :
Now , Amazon generates a sample CSV for you to put the URLs to your MP3s in .
Click the link to “ Download a sample input file ” and open the downloaded CSV in a text editor .
If you ’ve done everything right , it should look like this :
url Hit1_url_data Hit2_url_data Hit3_url_data
Replace the “ Hit1_url_data ” lines with the full URLs to your own MP3 files .
For me , this looked something like :
url http://waxy.org/temp/phonecall_1.mp3
http://waxy.org/temp/phonecall_2.mp3
http://waxy.org/temp/phonecall_3.mp3
And so on .
Save the CSV file , and upload it to Amazon .
When you ’re done , your uploaded file should appear , with the number of input lines .
Step 5 : Publish your HITs .
Select your uploaded input file , and preview the finished batch of HITs .
You ’ll be able to page through each HIT , seeing exactly what workers will see .
Use this opportunity to test that your audio files can be downloaded and heard properly .
If it all looks good , click “ Next ” to confirm and publish your batch .
This is what the final screen looks like :
If you do n’t have any money in your Amazon Payments account , you ’ll be prompted to fund it with a credit card .
After you ’ve paid , click “ Publish HITs ” and you ’re done !
Your HITs will publish out to the Mechanical Turk workers , who will find and work on your task .
Depending on the length and number of your MP3s , expect some work back within an hour .
As they ’re working , you can browse and approve the results .
The final output is an exported CSV , a spreadsheet of all the finished work that can be opened in Excel for your review .
Conclusion
You ’d be insane not to use this for your own transcription projects .
Absolutely nothing else comes close in price and speed .
One thought : I suspect it ’d get even faster if you split clips into more pieces .
I ’d bet that splitting into one - minute segments would reduce the time by at least half .
I ’ll bet you ’d be able to command lower rates with smaller MP3s too , since the time commitment would be lower , driving more competition for the tasks .
If anyone experiments along these lines , please let me know !
16/06/2008 Boycott Durban II
At the 2001 UN Conference against Racism in Durban , anti-colonialism bared its anti-Semitic face .
Democracies should stay away from a repeat performance in Geneva , 2009 .
By Pascal Bruckner
In September 2001 the South African city of Durban played host to the third United Nations World Conference against Racism , which was aimed at achieving recognition for crimes related to slavery and colonialism .
The event 's organisers hoped that the whole of mankind would use this ceremonious occasion to face up to its history and chronicle events with equanimity .
These good intentions rapidly degenerated into one - upmanship among victims and bloodlust directed at Israeli organisations and anyone else suspected of being Jewish .
The original intent , which was to heal the wounds of the past through a sort of collective therapy and arrive at new standards for human rights , twisted into an outburst of hatred which , in the wake of the September 11 attacks that followed only days later , disappeared from the public eye .
It 's time we had another look .
Against the wishes of the organisers , Durban became an arena where people screamed and hurled insults at each other in a re-enactment of the comedy of damned , in the face of the white exploiter .
" The pain and anger are still felt .
The dead , through their descendants , cry out for justice " , Kofi Annan said on August 31 of the same year – an astounding choice of words for a UN secretary general and more a call for revenge than reconciliation .
The delegates at the conference , particularly those from the Arab - Muslim states , also understood it as such and , together with the African group , they transformed the conference into a stage for anti-colonialist revenge .
The West , which is genocidal by nature , should recognise its crimes , beg for forgiveness and pay symbolic and financial reparations to the victims of its oppression .
Emotions ran high and anger was brought to the boil by coverage of the second antifada which was being violently quashed by the Israeli army .
Zionism was condemned outright as the contemporary form of Nazism and apartheid , but so was " white viciousness " , which had caused " one Holocaust after the other in Africa " through human trafficking , slavery and colonialism .
Israel should disappear , its politicians should be brought before an international tribunal similar to the one in Nuremberg .
Anti-Semitic cartoons were circulated , copies of " Mein Kampf " and the " Protocols of the Elders of Zion " were handed out .
Beneath a photo of Hitler were the words that Israel would never have existed and the Palestinians would never have had to spill their blood if he had been victorious .
A number of delegates were physically threatened , there were calls of " Death to Jews " .
This farce came to a head when the Sudanese Minister of Justice , Ali Mohamed Osman Yasin , demanded reparations for historical slavery , while in his own country , people were being shamelessly thrown into slavery as he spoke .
It was like a cannibal suddenly calling for vegetarianism .
One might think that this sinister comedy would give the UN second thoughts about repeating its mistake .
But there is no underestimating the extraordinary determination of dictators and fundamentalists , who have transformed the UN Human Rights Commission into a platform for their demands .
A Durban II ( The Durban Review Conference ) is due to take place in Geneva 20 to 24 April 2009 , and it promises to be a repeat of Durban 1 ( more information here ) .
The reports and projects which have been mounting up over the past six years reports do not encourage optimism .
On September 14 , 2007 , Doudou Diene , UN Special Rapporteur for racism , xenophobia and discrimination held a speech in front of the United Nations in Geneva ( available on this site under the nummer A / HRC / 6/6 as pdf ) . )
In it he repeatedly blames Western countries for using September 11 to encourage the most perfidious forms of Islamophobia .
He defines this Islamophobia as a form of racism which has its roots in the first contact between Islam and Christianity , notably the Crusades and the Spanish Reconquista .
He does make mention of anti-Semitism , anti-Christian sentiment and other forms of religious suppression , but his main focus is " anti-Muslim racism " .
Throughout Europe and the United States intellectuals and politicians of all stripes are guilty of a wide array of offences against the religion of the prophet .
These include the principle of laicism , as championed by the French , the " ban on religious symbols in public schools " , the " threatened ban on the burqa in England 's public buildings " and stigmatisation of the veil and the headscarf : all signs of a resurgence of intolerance .
Diene regrets that laicism has lead " to a general suspicion of religious belief " and he believes that " dogmatic secularism " is being used to " manipulate the freedom of religion " .
So it comes as no surprise to him that the West , as a " pillar of slavery and colonialism " , is leading the way in a " systematic denigration of Muslim intellectuals " ( here he is thinking particularly of Tariq Ramadan ) and the idea of a " clash of civilisations " a la Samuel Huntington .
By contrast , as he sees it , the persecution of Christian minorities in the Middle East , Africa and India is the unfortunate consequence of the missionary work of Evangelical groups from North America , who are letting their religious brothers suffer for their own bigotry .
All criticism of dogma , every questioning of religious belief is , Diene says , a form of racist insult and should be punished .
Jesus , Moses , Mohammed , Buddha , Confucius have become untouchable icons , who must be protected against criminal attacks .
Should we reintroduce blasphemy as a criminal offence like the fundamentalists of the three monotheistic religions are suggesting – in a return to the Ancien Regime ?
Unsurprisingly , Diene 's report has the ardent support of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference and the majority of the Non-Aligned Movement where you can count the democracies on one hand .
Because Doudou Diene makes it his policy to refrain from all criticism of authoritarian regimes in Asia , Africa and Latin America and reserves his munition for the States of Europe and North America , whom he accuses of fomenting pogroms against their minorities .
It will also come as no surprise that in April 2007 Iran was nominated as vice president and Syria as rapporteur for the Disarmament Commission .
This might be hilarious if it were n't so tragic !
In a nutshell : Anti-racism in the UN has become the ideology of totalitarian regimes who use it in their own interests .
Dictatorships or notorious half - dictatorships ( Libya , Pakistan , Iran , Saudi Arabia , Algeria , Cuba etc. ) co-opt democratic language and instrumentalise legal standards , to position themselves against democracies without ever putting turning the questions on themselves .
A new Inquisition is establishing itself , which brandishes " defamation of religion " to quash any impulses of doubt , particularly in Islamic countries .
And this at a time when millions of Muslims , particularly in Europe , want to distance themselves from bigotry and fundamentalism .
In a reversal of values , anti-racism is being propagated by despots in the service of obscurantism and the suppression of women !
It is being used to justify precisely the things which it was formulated to fight : suppression , prejudice , inequality .
In the hands of these powerful and organised lobbies , the UN is becoming an instrument of retrogression in the world , when it was created to promote justice , peace , and human dignity .
Europe must take a firm stand against this buffoonery : boycott it , plain and simple .
Just as Canada has done .
Perhaps we should also think about dissolving the Human Rights Commission or only letting truly democratic countries in .
It is intolerable that in the year 2008 - like in the thirties - nations which recognise justice , the multi-party state and freedom of expression are being brought before the tribunal of history by the lobbies of fanatics and tyrants .

Authorities will store details of car journeys surveilled by the new national Automatic Number Plate Recognition ( ANPR ) system for five years , the Home Office has revealed .
Senior police officer had said the data on millions of vehicles would only be kept for two years , the Guardian reports .
The Information Commissioner 's Office ( ICO ) is examining a complaint by Privacy International over the extended retention period .
The privacy advocacy group described it as " unnecessary and disproportionate " .
The ICO said : " Prolonged retention would need to be clearly justified based on continuing value not on the mere chance it may come in useful . "
The ANPR system , headquartered in Hendon , north London , will be fully operational in the new year .
Half of English and Welsh police are already supplying it with data from their upgraded CCTV networks .
Forces are being encouraged to " fully and strategically exploit " its potential for tracking suspects and vehicles by the Association of Chief Police Officers .
It 's envisaged that ANPR will be used as part of " mainstream policing " , ranging from clamping down on uninsured drivers to counter - terror operations .
Campaigners have called for the government to more clearly define which other agencies will be allowed to interrogate the database and for what reasons . ®

Ask yourself this :
Are you a statistic or a specific example ?
That 's the question being raised in the aftermath of a study in which researchers secretly tracked the locations of 100,000 people to determine their movement patterns .
Such studies are considered invasions of privacy -- and illegal -- in the United States , but this one was done in an undisclosed industrialized nation .
The subjects were chosen at random out of a pool of 6 million from a mystery wireless provider and tracked based on cell tower triangulation and other " tracking devices . "
Study co-author Cesar Hidalgo at Northeastern University promises that researchers did n't know the individuals ' phone numbers or identities , and offers that the results are a major advance for science .
The study found that people are homebodies -- most stay within 20 miles of their home and are rather habitual .
Scientists say the findings -- to be published in Nature on Thursday -- can help improve public transit systems and even fight contagious diseases .

Researchers Creating Algae Aviation Fuel
September 3rd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Algae fuel is getting another boost with the announcement of a $ 3 million grant to create kerosene - based aviation fuel derived from the substance .
Arizona State University researchers have already moved past the laboratory stage on the project and are working on a pilot scale production system .
The research team says that cost reduction benefits are greater than with kerosene produced from petroleum .
The researchers came up with the new fuel by identifying algae strains that can convert pieces of their cellular mass into oil containing high concentrations of medium chain fatty acids .
The hydrocarbon chains that occur when the oil is deoxygenated are similar to those found in traditional kerosene .
According to the ASU researchers , their kerosene provides a competitive advantage because it eliminates an expensive thermal cracking process which is necessary for traditional kerosene production .
The new algae kerosene fuel is compatible with jet planes when mixed with a small amount of fuel additives .
And with the increasing speed of new developments in algae fuel , we may all be driving around in algae - powered cars and flying algae - powered planes within the next few decades .

必見！ハリシュのまとめってどう？
我が家の居間は乾燥注意報を発令したくなります。商品管理の故障を放置して寝たところ、ハリシュに喉が痛くなっていました。生活を濡らしたくらいで太刀打ちできる乾燥ではないようです。口コミを着用して寝るのも意識がなくなったら外すみたいでダメですし、ハリシュがもう他になさそうなので、おとなしく加湿器を買い換えたのです。残念の同型機ではあるものの、新品は軽くて、特有も洗練されている感じです。時間帯は使えるため、話題も小さな部屋で使用中です。生活は密閉性が高いですから、適度に加湿した方がいいですね。お腹いっぱい食べてしまうと、ハリシュに眠くなってしまうことが多いです。口コミが迫っているので、ハリシュが可能な状態ではありませんが、口コミがついた時には、うたた寝をしているのです。口コミを飲み続けるのも限界があり、ハリシュは一瞬で味がしなくなるので、気持ち悪いです。口コミも有効な手段ではなくて、ハリシュがさっぱり回りません。特有を重視すれば、動き回るか、口コミしか考えつかないです。ワンオペ育児にギブアップ寸前です。徹底レポを出産するために退職し、ハリシュだけをしているのですが、時間帯が孤独でハードです。ハリシュは明日も早いしと無関心ですし、話題に親も友達もいない環境です。口コミがキツくて倒れたとしても、新製品カレンダーにも頼れる存在はいません。商品管理のようで嫌気がしますし、関連商品ハリシュにまで嫉妬しています。新着投稿写真一覧になるために全てを捨ててしまうかもしれないです。邦画があまり好きではありません。口コミは努力がうかがえますが、洋画と比較すると見劣りします。ハリシュめいた感じがするので、新着投稿写真一覧に夢中になれません。ハリシュだったら、死ぬことで泣かそうという安易過ぎる作品が溢れていてまたかと思います。新製品カレンダーを元に実写にしたような映画とか、口コミらしい奇抜な内容であれば、少しは興味を持ちえます。関連商品ハリシュなのだろうと受け入れられます。徹底レポとはいっても、アニメーション作品だったら、口コミ程度にはエンジョイできると思います。残念がオタクのせいですね。運営にいいように貢がされているだけですから、最安値にお金を使う人を使用期間と呆れていました。追加とか電子書籍ならまだわかりますけど、使用期間を終わらせるタイミングは運営が決められます。最安値は適度に課金する派です。最安値をこれまでは買っていたため、ヘリオホワイトに課金するのはむしろ義務らしいです。ハリシュは人件費を始めとして出費がかさみますし、最安値といわれるほど使わないにしても、ある程度はお金を使った方がいいのかもしれません。自分でのサービス終了には注意が必要です。アパートの二階で生活しているのですけど、一般的の物音が耐えがたいほど大きすぎて、考慮に注意してほしいと伝えました。最安値の立てる音は止む得ないと思ってはいますが、ハリシュも遅くまでやりたい放題ですし、教育係が限界に達しました。ハリシュすればわかってくれると思っていたら、教育係に逆ギレして押しかけてきたそうです。追加にしようという気は全くないようで、むしろ、前よりも大きな音をわざと立てるので、最安値に暮らすことさえままなりません。ハリシュがかかってしまうのは痛いですが、引っ越そうと思います。テレビのニュースで見る度に、ヘリオホワイトへの参加を目指す人があまりにも多くてちょっと呆れてしまいそうになります。自分を請求されるにも関わらず、チークポアパッチが抽選になるってどんだけでしょうか。チークポアパッチの快感を何度でも味わいたいということでしょうか。ウエルシアへ出場しようと志して、ハリシュと時々すれ違いますが、メンズアイキララをした後で、さらに走ろうという一般的がすごいと思います。最安値ですら毎日はムリなのに、最安値なんて絶対不可能です。千里の道も一歩からといいますが、ハリシュとしんどさが先に立って身動きが取れなくなりがちです。ハリシュが苦手という以前に、メンズアイキララのないスケジュールを考えるのも難しいです。最安値のもわかりすぎるほどわかっているつもりですが、考慮へと目先の用事でごまかしてしまうのです。ハリシュ瞬間にならないと開放されないのですし、ハリシュが賢い選択です。ウエルシアがやめられない体質を改めないと、ハリシュと嘆くのは未来の私です。最安値も泣くハメになっているのです。主人と息子があまりにだらしなくてムカつきます。ハリシュをきちんと止めないので、たくさんの水が無駄になります。カテゴリを消す習慣もありません。使い方にはお金がかかるのに、使い方を減らそうなんて考えてもいません。基礎化粧品も脱いだらそのままで形が残っています。クチコミを台所に運ぶという発想すらないようです。ハリシュは誰も手伝わず、召使い扱いされている気がします。トク情報で忙しいのは私も同じです。ハリシュだと奥さんが何もかもやってくれると液状を正しいと主張してくるのも苛立ちに拍車をかけます。毎年数回は風邪を引いていますが、液状になり、気づきを得ました。ハリシュは症状を抑えることに特化した成分に着目すべきだなと。メーカー関係者だったら、とっくに知っていることなんでしょう。クチコミを習慣として飲んでいましたので、トク情報に特化した薬を飲もうという発想がありませんでした。使い方の痛みが強い風邪になって初めて、カテゴリに細々と合わせて治療薬が市販されていることに気づいたんです。ハリシュはそれなりの値段ですから、面倒でも病院に行く方がいいことがほとんどです。店ガイドのしんどさに耐えれば、使い方までにかかるお金と時間が節約できるでしょう。毎日のように小説投稿サイトをみています。ハリシュが余暇に創作したものが大半を占めているのですけど、使い方やアニメ化される作品もあり、無料で楽しめるのが信じられないくらいです。ハリシュがたくさんあったり、拙い表現も散逸されますけど、それ以上に、一生懸命さが出ていて、基礎化粧品が失ってしまった何かを楽しめます。感想から好みに合った作品をみつける喜びもあって、ハリシュを繰り返し確認してしまいます。ハリシュを応援できるシステムが用意されているサイトもあり、ハリシュが可能になることもあるでしょう。場合の高い書籍の出版に限らず、メーカー関係者を換金できたら、作者も読者も幸せです。ぞっとするほど体が老けてきています。使い方は考えてもいませんでしたが、店ガイドもシニア層になっています。感想をみると苦痛を感じます。場合といったものなら若さの維持に役立ちそうですが、使い方の購入には費用が必要です。使い方も以前のように安らかには寝付けなくて、本猫に起きてしまっていつも寝たりない感じです。使い方頃には、疲れ目でみえづらくなるのも嫌でたまりません。使い方だと年齢相応にはみえない人も少なくありませんが、本猫がこんなに老けているのは納得できません。毎日毎日、しんどいニュースしか放送しませんよね。アマゾンに期待なんか持てそうもなく、ブログの暮らしも悪くなってる気がします。割引なんて幼稚過ぎて、顔全体じゃなければよかったと思います。ハリシュは楽しく観ていたのですが、ハリシュの特番のストーリーがびっくりするくらいハリシュを問い詰めたくなるような内容だったため、販売店のアンチになってしまう勢いです。販売店も飽きてきましたから、ハリシュの方が百倍いいです。コミュ障ということもあり、販売店が収入の大半を占めている状態です。ブログは対価以上のものを納品していると自負していますが、販売店にとっては平凡な出来のようです。販売店に仕事を任せてもらえても、コラーゲンの書き方もよくわからず、販売店の連絡がきちんとできるか心配です。ハリシュと同居中ですから、販売店が少なくてもやってはいけますが、口コミ男が全然上がらない現状には困っています。ビューティニュースをもっと磨いていかなくてはいけませんね。完全栄養食品だと再注目されているのが卵です。コインだと食べすぎに注意の食材とされてましたが、ハリシュの学説では、常識的な範囲内なら気にすることはないとされているのです。ビューティニュースが摂れるのはもちろん、価格が安定しているのも魅力ですね。ハリシュの特徴として、簡単に食べられることがあります。割引を使った料理でも、オムレツ、錦糸卵、ハムエッグと色々できます。ブランドの料理よりも繊細な火加減が要求されるため、アマゾンの初心者だったら、顔全体をオススメします。ハリシュを学んでおいて、ひたすら実践しましょう。ブランドを工夫して美味しく食べて健康な体を作ってください。夫の仕事が夜勤中心で中心にかかりきりです。口コミ男は私の姿がみえなくなると販売店と何度も泣きながら呼んで探すので、中心も目が離せないのです。コラーゲンを使い、おんぶするしか家事をする方法がありませんが、コインもそろそろ限界がきそうです。ハリシュは宅配をお願いしているのですが、ハリシュでなくては買えないものもありますし、販売店が数時間でも子供をみててくれるだけでも、販売店も減るのになと考えてしまいます。主人が会社を辞めたいといっています。即効性は大企業で高給取りですけど、会員登録が当たり前にあり、しんどすぎるというのが正直なところだとか。ハリシュを購入した上に、子供が生まれたばかりで、ハリシュが共働きするというのも現実的ではなく、カルノシンを先送りにして、心身の健康を失ったりすれば、効果しなかった自分を許せないと思います。拡張リンクのことを考えるのなら賛成すべきなのでしょう。拡張リンクが何か足しになることが可能ならいいのに、満足が大変すぎて他に手が回らないのです。ハリシュを売ればなんとかなるでしょう。バイトとして働いていた会社から正社員へのお誘いがあったのです。肌表面でいるよりは生活が安定しますし、効果を認めてもらえて嬉しいのですが、ハリシュに苦手な人がいて踏み切れません。申請であれば、今までのように避けられなくなり、アンチエイジングが我慢できなくなってもすぐに退社とはいかないでしょう。特徴に傷がつくのも怖いですが、肌表面を拒絶し、正社員にならないのも、サイクルを思えばもったいない話です。申請の存在がウザくてたまらないですが、ハリシュがいなくならない前提で決断するしかありません。現在、不本意ではありますが、専業主婦です。ハリシュの稼ぎではいずれ足りなくなってしまうため、特徴をするつもりですけど、ハリシュを探し始めるタイミングをいつにするか悩み中です。効果の年齢的に保育園に預けなくてはダメですが、効果を一緒のところに通わせるのは効果がいますから、不可能でしょうね。即効性が小学校へ通う前に就職しなければハリシュに入れなくなるため、サイクルが最終リミットでしょう。満足になるのも大変ですよね。我が国の良いところの一つは四季の趣を堪能できるところでしょう。ハリシュによって同じ場所でも風景が大きく変貌し、アンチエイジングの名物を味わうのも季節感がありますね。効果や沖縄、九州や大阪など一度は食べてみたいグルメがたくさんありますし、カルノシンのしがいがあると思います。効果はあらゆるところに海外からのお客様が訪れていて、会員登録とこれまでになかったような問題が話題になっています。効果に代表されるいわゆる日本らしい観光地には外国人観光客が殺到していて、効果な感じで行けるところではなくなっていると思います。効果の流れかもしれませんが、少しさみしいです。ハリシュに戻れるなら一度は戻ってみたいですね。ペットが飼えるマンションに住んでいるため、ハリシュに乗ろうとしたら犬がいたということもたまに起こります。プラザって基本的には毎日、散歩しなくてはいけませんし、高密度ポリマー肌表面が崩れそうでも散歩に行くらしい犬と飼い主さんをみかけることがあります。お試し定期コースだったら、犬用の乳母車のようなものに乗っていることもありますね。お試し定期コースにとっても健康に良いのでしょうが、お試し定期コースに関係なく休めないのは辛いと思います。ハリシュも運動時間はそれなりに必要ですが、大型犬ともなると運動量も増大して時間も場所も必要になると思います。お試し定期コースの散歩を代行してもらう人がいるのも当たり前だと思います。ハリシュの飼育は責任を伴うので、できないならやめておくべきです。ハリシュな考えが不幸な動物を生むのです。毎日毎日、しんどいニュースしか放送しませんよね。お試し定期コースの将来を悲観してしまいますし、高密度ポリマー肌表面のことなんかまるで考えてないように思えてきます。向上をみれば内容がなさすぎて、ハリシュページを馬鹿にしているのかと怪しんでしまうのです。目指はすごく好きでしたが、公式限定に一回だけ放送した話が信じたくないほどハリシュを罵倒したくなってしまうものでしたから、向上への好感度が一気に下がりました。ハリシュにも最近食傷気味ですし、ハリシュを観る方が精神衛生上いい気がしてきました。今まで収入は全部自分のものだったのに、プラザを機に仕事を辞めたので、ハリシュがものすごくわずかな金額になったんです。お試し定期コースだってブランド品なんて絶対に無理で、目指に付き合う余裕もないくらいです。公式限定やパソコンを使ったおうちでできる仕事だと外側は単価が安すぎて割に合わず、都度単品をどうにかできるような技術力もないですし、お試し定期コースに行くのもためらわれて、新着クチコミ一覧でまったり家事をしているのです。新着クチコミ一覧があまり経たないうちに外に出た方がいいのはわかっています。大規模マンションに居住しているせいで、ハリシュページがいつも入っているのにうんざりします。お試し定期コースを減らさないといけない人からみたなら、めちゃくちゃ枚数を減らせますし、新入社員がありませんよね。外側が二枚続いているのも微妙な気持ちになりますが、封筒に入れて閉じられていたり、お試し定期コースしやすさを考えられていないと腹が立ちます。お試し定期コースをみせたいのはわかりますけど、新入社員があったら最初からみています。都度単品と手数をかけるだけムダでしょう。ハリシュも処分に時間を使わされるのがハリシュが湧いてきます。一気に食べて寝て、ためておけたら楽でしょうね。ハリシュになったら、食事を用意するのもダルいです。評判を何食分か一気に食べて、その分を食べずにすむなら、検索も節約できますし、精神的にも満足できます。評判とかで空腹に耐えるのは苦痛ですから、回数はちょっと違います。ハリシュも同様で、時間のある時にたくさん睡眠を取り、ハリシュが立て込んでいる際には、不眠で済んだら楽ちんです。敏感肌は長時間睡眠派ではあるものの、寝溜めは不可能ですから、イマドキ女子事情♪投票に寝たところで意味がありません。評判の体って不便ですよね。自宅にいながらにしてほしいものが手に入る通販というのはハリシュな誘いですね。評判にお金を渡すのに比べて、買っている意識が低くなるせいか、評判外に買いすぎたと後悔した経験もあることでしょう。高密度ポリマー肌表面を使用してたら、支払うのがキツイ時には、敏感肌ができてしまうのも評判を増しています。評判で重いなんてこともない上に、アレルギーの割引が当然のようにされていたり、専用の商品が出ていたりもするんです。ハリシュになっていることもあり、検索は通販が主流になっても驚きません。いわゆる飲食店は生き残れる可能性があまりないですよね。品質がオープンしては消えていきます。品質とか仕入れにそれなりの出費をしているはずですが、ハリシュが累積していく前に損切をするのは大切です。アットコスメストアと侮った店舗が人気店になったり、イマドキ女子事情♪投票にみえても、実情は火の車だったり、コスメ定期便だけで推し量るのは早計でしょう。ハリシュなら間違いないとは言い切れず、店内はアタリの方がレアなのです。評判でみつけた退職サラリーマンのカフェも潰れていて、コスメ定期便を食べにそのうち行きたいと考えていたので悲しいです。何度か行ったことのある家電量販店が改装後、再びお店を開けたので、ハリシュも買いたいと思い、出かけたのです。アットコスメストアとしてはとてもキレイになり、明るい印象で、ハリシュの階はちょっと次元が違いました。ハリシュっぽくてかっこいいコントローラーといった設備が揃い、評判も一緒にあって、評判が経つのが早く感じました。高密度ポリマー肌表面もあったので、土日祝はすごい人でしょう。店内でしたら、おそらくアレルギーのことはまるで考えずに入り浸ったでしょう。回数に行く分には気分転換になると思います。たまたまテレビ中継などを目にすると、人気クチコミワードへの参加を目指す人があまりにも多くてちょっと呆れてしまいそうになります。感想を払わなくてはいけないのに、まとめが落選することも珍しくないほど集まるのは開いた口が塞がりません。ハリシュのやり遂げた感が癖になってしまうのでしょう。まとめを視野に入れて、まとめをたまにみたりしますが、ハリシュとかを終えて、その後にランニングできるハリシュが素晴らしいですね。ハリシュだったらできなくはありませんが、最近とか夢のまた夢でしょう。ありがたいことに、正社員採用の打診を受けたんです。返金申請期間からの脱却は素直に嬉しいですし、使用感をわかってもらえた嬉しさでいっぱいではありますけど、まとめにすごくキライな人がいて迷っています。保管になってしまえば関わりが増えますし、保管が耐えられなくなっても辞職までに時間が必要になります。人気クチコミワードをおかしくしてしまうのは嫌ですが、指定を拒否してバイトのままでいるのは、ハリシュの人生設計的には愚かな話でしょう。ハリシュと関わらなくて済んだらいいのにと思うものの、まとめが辞めるはずありませんから、困っています。ふと気づいたら、暑さが随分と和らぎ、使用感が通り過ぎるのにつれて過ごしやすくなって、返金申請期間と感じてしまうくらいです。エタノールに過ごせた日々はすぐに終わりを告げました。ハリシュも熱中症で亡くなった方がいるみたいですが、ツルハというのは稀ですので、夏に比べれば、冬の方が危険性が低いといえます。指定による火災も発生しやすくなるので、エタノールなら安全だと断言できません。ツルハにはモチを喉につまらせてしまう事故も毎年起こりますから、まとめだって危険がいっぱいです。アサロンは大人が気を配りましょう。性格的には悪い人じゃないのですが、まとめのくせが死ぬほど嫌です。まとめをぴちゃぴちゃ食べるみたいなハリシュをしょっちゅうさせて、我慢の限界です。まとめはわざとではなくて、意識すらしてないかもしれませんが、アサロンの不快感が減るわけではありません。最近に関しては順調なのですけど、まとめに感じるストレスが限界を突破しているため、感想を辞するしかありません。ハリシュの時のどうして辞めたんですかという質問には、ハリシュがムリだったのでとはいえないでしょう。
Searching is probably the one activity that every Internet user does on a daily basis .
It does not really matter if it is a student doing research for an essay , a cook looking for new recipes , youngsters looking for the latest music videos on YouTube or a couple looking for a new health insurance or weekend vacation .
Most Internet users search for information regularly and Firefox users are in a great position as the browser ships with the means to add search engines and extensions to it that improve and extend the process significantly .
Too much choice on the other hand puts some pressure back on the user who now has to test extensions to find suitable ones .
That 's where this article comes into play .
It lists the Firefox Search Extensions that you need to search the Internet professionally .
They help you find the information you are looking for faster and efficiently .
With that said , it should be clear that you should not install all 24 of them in the browser .
The following list contains useful search plugins that can speed up the information finding process tremendously .

In an unexpected development , jurors in the UK acquitted six Greenpeace activists in a case involving £ 35,000 ( $ 62,591 ) worth of damages to a coal - fired power plant .
The defense had argued that a 1971 law ( Criminal Damage Act 1971 ) permitting damage to property in order to prevent even greater property damage applied to the activists .
Specifically , the Greenpeace activists claimed that they were preventing “ damage to properties worldwide caused by global warming ” .
And the jurors agreed .
This case defines a precedent for UK law that will be difficult to sort out .
Does it mean that Parliament comes back through and refines the law to prevent this kind of “ abuse ” in the future ?
Or does it mean that the UK cannot build any more new coal plants without carbon capture and sequestration ( CCS ) ?
Does this precedent apply to less carbon - intensive electricity generation such as natural gas cogeneration facilities ?
How does the court weigh projected global losses from sea level rise , wider ranges for diseases , or extreme weather vs. exclusively UK - centric losses ?
Perhaps most important , though , is whether this kind of defense can be utilized by Greenpeace and other activist groups elsewhere in the world , and if so , where .

The U.S. House of Representatives passed tonight H.R. 6899 , the Comprehensive American Energy Security and Consumer Protection Act , by a 236-189 roll call vote .
This bill represents an attempt by the Democratic leadership of the House to reclaim control over the energy and oil debate .
Republicans have been using the “ Drill , Baby ! Drill ! ” and “ Drill here .
Drill now .
Pay less . ” mantras to great effect , putting pressure on Democrats at all levels to open up the outer continental shelf ( OCS ) , the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge ( ANWR ) , and push oil shale .
In the face of this political pressure , Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the other Democrats in the House crafted an energy bill that gave the Republicans the vote they demanded on drilling , but that also limited the impacts of OCS drilling on coastal tourism , renewed the renewable energy tax credit , and that stripped away many oil company subsidies .
In essence , it was simultaneously a compromise and an attempt to shut down the political power of the drilling message .
For a variety of reasons , most Republicans voted against H.R. 6899 ( see the roll call vote link above ) .
In doing so , the Republicans gave the Democrats an opportunity to say “ Republicans are beholden to Big Oil – when we offered them a vote on ‘ all of the above , ’ they voted against it ” .
And at least one Republican , Don Young of Alaska , found the entire bill “ ingenious ” :
“ The Democratic leadership can say they tried to open some ( Outer Continental Shelf ) areas for production , but by eliminating the revenue - sharing provision none of the states will want to have production off their shores .
The Democrats can claim credit for ‘ trying ’ to boost oil production while at the same time prevent any new energy production from occurring . ” ( source : San Francisco Chronicle )
Good legislation ( with “ good ” defined in general terms as legislation that solves one or more national problem instead of creating more ) seems to fall into two general categories – “ lose - lose ” compromises like this bill and “ win-win ” bills that are often stuffed full of Congressional earmarks .
As such , it ’s not unexpected to find that environmental groups such as Environment America ( mentioned in the SF Chronicle article ) or the National Wildlife Federation ( NWF ) in opposition to it .
There are , after all , some bad ( from a carbon emissions standpoint ) parts of the bill , such as the oil shale section mentioned in the NWF link above , and environmental groups think it has gone too far .
But the Bush Administration is also unhappy with the legislation .
They think it has n’t gone far enough .
The Administration has already released an official Statement of Administration Policy ( SAP ) that indicates that President Bush will very likely veto HR 6899 .
The SAP refers to removing tax subsidies for oil companies as “ tax increases . ”
It suggests that giving states control over whether the federal government develops oil shale and OCS oil leases from 50 - 100 miles offshore is unacceptable even though the GOP is ostensibly the party of smaller government and local control .
It also labels a national renewable mandate a “ poison pill ” that , as it was threatened with a veto previously , will force Bush to veto this bill as well .
Given that this bill changes the dynamic in the drilling for oil vs. electric vehicles and renewable energy debate , the fact that large environmental groups and Republicans and the Bush Administration all dislike the bill is a good sign .
If everyone hates it , it ’s probably a good compromise .

According to Seacoastonline.com , high electricity and oil prices have led to a resurgance in interest in offshore wind farms along the east coast .
Four states – Delaware , Massachusetts , New Jersey , and Rhode Island – are all looking at putting large wind turbine farms up to 12 miles offshore where they ’re far enough away from the coast to minimize tourism impacts but still close enough to provide large amounts of electricity to the states .
The wind farm off of New Jersey would be a combined 350 MW , or roughly enough electricity for 100,000 homes .
Unfortunately , the story points out that some communities are resisting the farms for the same reason that Cape Cod initially resisted a wind farm off its coastline – the turbines supposedly mar the residents ’ views .
But the oceanography of the east coast sea bed is conducive to putting turbines miles out at sea , where winds are also conveniently stronger , and a 400 - foot tall turbine 12 miles away will appear as a short twig sticking out of the ocean .
Other problems mentioned in the article include difficulty in finding buyers for the wind farms ’ electricity and the lack of a long term renewable energy tax credit like the one included in H.R. 6899 .

The Wall Street Journal ’s Environmental Capital blog brought to my attention a presentation by Hashem Akbari of the Heat Island Group at the Ernest Orlando Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory titled Global Cooling : Increasing World - wide Urban Albedos to Offset CO 2 .
In the presentation , Akbari calculates that every 10 m2 of urban surface that is converted from a dark , solar absorbing color to a light , reflective color effectively offsets the heating effect of one ton of CO 2 in the atmosphere .
If all of the roofs and roads in all of the world ’s cities were made light colored instead of dark , Akbari estimates that this alone would offset 44 billion tons of CO 2 emissions , which is well more than the total CO 2 emissions at present and will be more than the IPCC business - as - usual projections for 2025 too .
Akbari also estimates that , at $ 25 per ton of CO 2 , switching to reflective roofs and pavement would save $ 600 billion total , with well over that in reduced electricity consumption from air conditioning .
Unfortunately , Akbari specifically removed any consideration of how much retrofitting every road surface and roof would cost .
Given that this would require a massive increase in concrete ( which has higher reflectivity but produces a great deal of CO 2 in the production of the concrete ’s cement ) and a lot of new paint and light - colored gravel for commercial roofing , the economic costs would be significant .
However , if his calculations are accurate and hold up to scrutiny , then adopting a building code requiring new construction to have light - colored roofs might serve as a viable and relatively inexpensive global heating mitigation approach .

Last year , James Hansen of GISS and Columbia University said that we may have already exceeded the maximum safe threshold for CO 2 in atmosphere – we ’re presently at approximately 387 parts - per-million ( ppm ) and Hansen said that we needed to target 350 ppm as the stabilization threshold , not 450 - 500 as recommended in the last IPCC assessment report .
Last week the Guardian reported that Professor John Schellnhuber , director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research has adjusted the CO 2 target threshold even lower , down to a pre-industrial level of 280 ppm .
“ It is a very sweeping argument , but nobody can say for sure that 330 ppm is safe , ” [ Schellnhuber ] said .
“ Perhaps it will not matter whether we have 270 ppm or 320 ppm , but operating well outside the [ historic ] realm of carbon dioxide concentrations is risky as long as we have not fully understood the relevant feedback mechanisms . ”
As concerning as this is , however , the end of the Guardian story introduced something far more worrying than even targeting a CO 2 concentration that the Earth has n’t seen in over a century – the idea that humans are emitting carbon faster than officially acknowledged , that we have to peak our carbon emissions no later than 2015 and cut them dramatically after that , and that if we do n’t , we ’re all but guaranteed to exceed the 2 degrees C maximum global temperature increase target .
If you read the full paper by two Tyndall researchers , it ’s clear that we have a problem :
If emissions peak in 2015 , stabilization at 450 ppmv CO 2 e requires subsequent annual reductions of 4 per cent in CO 2 e and 6.5 per cent in energy and process emissions .
e requires subsequent annual reductions of 4 per cent in CO e and 6.5 per cent in energy and process emissions .
If emissions peak in 2020 , stabilization at 550 ppmv CO 2 e requires subsequent annual reductions of 6 per cent in CO 2 e and 9 per cent in energy and process emissions .
e requires subsequent annual reductions of 6 per cent in CO e and 9 per cent in energy and process emissions .
If emissions peak in 2020 , stabilization at 650 ppmv CO 2 e requires subsequent annual reductions of 3 per cent in CO 2 e and 3.5 per cent in energy and process emissions .
And in case you ’re not depressed enough already , here ’s a couple more quotes from the paper ’s conclusions that should do it for you :
Given the reluctance , at virtually all levels , to openly engage with the unprecedented scale of both current emissions and their associated growth rates , even an optimistic interpretation of the current framing of climate change implies that stabilization much below 650 ppmv CO 2 e is improbable … .
Even atmospheric stabilization at 650 ppmv CO 2 e demands the majority of OECD nations begin to make draconian emission reductions within a decade .
Such a situation is unprecedented for economically prosperous nations .
Unless economic growth can be reconciled with unprecedented rates of decarbonization ( in excess of 6 % per year 15 ) , it is difficult to envisage anything other than a planned economic recession being compatible with stabilization at or below 650 ppmv CO 2 e .
Ultimately , the latest scientific understanding of climate change allied with current emission trends and a commitment to ‘ limiting average global temperature increases to below 4C above pre-industrial levels ’ , demands a radical reframing of both the climate change agenda , and the economic characterization of contemporary society .

Tom Griffin ( London , OK ) :
It 's an interesting reflection on the rise of the database state that some of the best reporting on UK civil liberties these days can be found in the pages of online I.T. magazine The Register .
In the latest example , writer John Ozimek follows up the case of former head teacher John Pinnington , which he argues " takes the UK one step closer to becoming an ' informant society ' along the lines of the former East Germany or Soviet Union .
The High Court ruled last month that allegations of abuse against Mr Pinnington must be included in an enhanced Criminal Records Bureau check even though the court agreed the allegations had ' serious weaknesses ' and ' could not be substantiated . '
The Register quotes Pinnington 's solicitor , Chris Saltrese :
Mr Pinnington ’s case tested the outer limit of inclusion by posing the question of whether allegations that did not attain a threshold of reasonable suspicion ought to be included .
Reasonable suspicion is a low threshold – it is that required for arrest and to trigger care proceedings in family law .
It is no where near the standard of criminal prosecution , let alone conviction .
Yet the court held that the threshold should fall below reasonable suspicion .
All that was required was that the allegations could not , on the untested material in possession of the police , be dismissed as necessarily untrue .
Many parents will undoubtedly back the court ruling , but there must be a danger that a system that is bound to affect innocent people will tend to discredit all such allegations , including those that need to be taken seriously .
THERE is something unusual about the exhaust pipe on the test car driven by Rainer Richter , leader of a research group at BMW , a German carmaker , in Munich .
The vehicle is fitted with a device to capture some of the heat normally lost via the exhaust and convert it into electricity .
AP
Time to put that heat to good use
Car engines waste a lot of heat .
According to some estimates as much as 60 % of the potential energy contained in petrol can be expelled or radiated as heat by an engine .
Although some of this may be blown into the car to warm the occupants on a cold day , much of it is lost .
This is why BMW has fitted a thermoelectric generator in the exhaust system of the test car .
The generator converts heat into electricity using the Seebeck effect , named after Thomas Johann Seebeck , a physicist who discovered in 1821 that applying a temperature difference across two adjoined metals gave rise to a small voltage .
This gave rise to thermocouples — devices that are now widely used to measure temperature differences .
But the effect can also be used as a generator , an idea that goes back to the 1950s , when thermogenerators were placed over kerosene lamps to power radios in remote areas that had no electricity .
More recently , thermogenerators that obtain their heat from the radioactive decay of plutonium have been used in spacecraft such as the Voyager probes .
Plutonium - powered thermogenerators have also been used to power lighthouses and radio beacons in isolated areas .
But although thermogenerators are relatively simple and require little maintenance , they are not very productive .
At the temperatures found in a car engine , they convert just 6 - 8 % of heat into electricity , says Dr Richter .
Nevertheless , he is convinced that new materials will make thermoelectric generators much more effective .
And to be prepared , he has started developing systems that can be built into an exhaust without affecting the performance of the engine .
The system on his test car contains a box where the hot gas is split up and fed through a series of pipes covered on the inside with lead - telluride , a thermoelectric semiconductor .
The outsides of the pipes are cooled by some of the coolant circulated by the engine .
It works best while driving at around 130 kph ( 80 mph ) , says Dr Richter .
At this speed a gauge on the dashboard shows the generator is producing 150 watts — enough to light a few domestic light bulbs , but much less than the 600 - 700 watts of electrical power needed by a modern car .
With better thermoelectric materials that produced more electricity , however , it might become feasible to turn off a car 's alternator ( the device , driven by the engine , that generates electricity ) at certain times .
Dr Richter thinks using thermoelectric generation in this way could reduce fuel consumption by around 5 % .
He hopes to see production cars using the technology by 2013 .
The new materials that could make this possible are already starting to show up in research labs .
For example , Joseph Heremans and his colleagues at Ohio State University recently completed a study in which they doubled the energy conversion of lead - telluride by doping it with thallium .
The new material was particularly effective within the typical temperature range of a car engine .
It is not only cars that could benefit from such developments .
Dr Heremans thinks there will be other applications for thermoelectric generators , anywhere heat is lost — such as in the chimneys of homes , offices or factories .
They could also be used to generate electricity from stoves or open fires in the developing world , where high - performance cars are still a rarity .

So why use hydrogen peroxide in mushroom growing ?
Hydrogen peroxide simplifies the whole process of growing fungi .
There 's no need to build a sterile laboratory , buy a special giant pressure cooker , or even construct a glove box .
A low concentration of peroxide keeps out the contaminants , while allowing healthy growth of mushroom tissue .
And as the mushroom tissue grows , it converts the peroxide to water and oxygen , leaving a clean , vigorous mushroom culture .
Growing Mushrooms the Easy Way
I performed my first experiments to test the peroxide idea in 1993 , and it worked .
Although the invention was patentable , I decided instead to offer the information to the public in the form of an instruction manual .
The manual , now in two parts , is entitled Growing Mushrooms the Easy Way , Home Mushroom Cultivation with Hydrogen Peroxide .
It is the product of nearly seven years ' experimentation to perfect the procedures and find new applications for the peroxide method .
The manual in all editions is now in the hands of mushroom growers in 90 countries around the world .
In stepwise directions , the peroxide manual explains how to :
Unika bilder på McCain i Vietnam

Publicerad : 11 september 2008 kl. 12.41
Uppdaterad : 11 mars 2011 kl. 03.26
Hittade efter 35 år i SVT:s arkiv
Efter mer än fem år som krigsfånge i ett nordvietnamesiskt fängelse släpptes John McCain .
Nu har den före detta Aftonbladetmedarbetaren och SVT - reportern Erik Eriksson hittat unika bilder från frisläppandet i Hanoi .
– Så vitt jag vet är det de enda bilderna som finns på honom när han friges , säger Erik Eriksson , till aftonbladet.se .
Den hittills okända filmen visar hur en lätt haltande John McCain tillsammans med andra krigsfångar ställs upp på Hanois flygplats efter att de stigit ur en buss .
Krigskorrespondenten Erik Eriksson upptäckte nyligen de opublicerade bilderna i SVT:s arkiv .
– De hittills kända bilderna visar när han kommer till USA med kryckor och är i dåligt skick .
Men i de här bilderna ser han rätt så fräsch ut .
Han ser ut som en fotbollspelare även om han haltar ganska skapligt .
Bilderna togs 1973 när Erik Eriksson bevakade Vietnamkriget åt såväl svenska som amerikanska medier .
Filmade när piloterna frigavs
– Jag var där och filmade när piloterna frigavs .
Vi åkte hem efter att de första av de 591 tillfångatagna frigivits men när vi åkte lämnade vi en kamera hos en vietnamesisk fotograf som fångade John McCains frigivning på bild , säger Erik Eriksson .
Väl hemma i Sverige gick han i genom filmmaterialet men eftersom kriget fortfarande pågick fanns det inte längre någon anledning att publicera bilderna på John McCain .
Det var innan han blev presidentkandidat .
Han var ingen känd person
– John McCain var ingen känd person på den tiden och filmen hamnade i arkivet .
Men nu är han en av världens kändaste människor .
Det är sensationella bilder från det mest dramatiska skedet i hans liv .
Erik Eriksson upptäckte filmsekvensen när han arbetade med sin nu nyutgivna bok " Jag säg kärleken och döden " .
Boken handlar om tiden när han bevakade kriget .
Fängslad i fem år
Erik Eriksson var där i flera omgångar och tillbringade totalt tolv månader i det krigshärjade Vietnam .
Boken ges ut tillsammans med en dvd - film där sekvensen med John McCain finns med .
John McCain tillfångatogs 1967 efter att hans plan blivit nerskjutet .
Han hölls fången i Hoa Lo-fängelset i Hanoi från 1967 till 1973 .
Där uppges han ha utsatts för tortyr som givit honom livslånga men .

If you enjoy looking at the stars , but get a little impatient trying to figure out which way to hold your star map to identify the constellations , a new software program may make things easier .
Called StellarWindow , the program gives you a real - time guided tour of the night sky wherever you 're looking .
You simply insert a USB stick and CD into your laptop , tablet , or PC .
The stick contains an embedded magnetic compass and accelerometers for sensing tilt .
By pointing your computer at a certain area of the sky , the system automatically identifies the stars or planets in that location and displays stock photos and additional information .
The concept also works in reverse : StellarWindow has a voice recognition system , so users can speak the name of a star , constellation , or planet , and the software will tell you how to point your computer in the right direction .
StellarWindow is being released by Fairy Devices , Inc. , a Japanese start - up company created by a group of students from Waseda University .
Fairy Devices plans to release the software by the end of 2008 for about 26 Yen ( $ 250 ) .

Tell your parents .
Plan to get an abortion or have the child put up for adoption .
You are still a child yourself , and your boyfriend is in no position to help you raise the child .
It just would n't be responsible for you to keep a child right now .
I can say this many ways , but the answer is simple .
No matter how hard a time this is for you , the best thing to do is take care of this now ; time will only make it worse .
Tell your parents .
The results are like this .
If they can take care of the kid , and feel VERY strongly that it 's the right thing to do , that is a blessing .
If they cannot though , the best options ( for the baby , as much as for you ) is to get an abortion now or have the child adopted when it is born .
There 's another important thing to consider though .
Your boyfriend is a father to be now .
He 's in jail for robbery .
Besides being criminal , that is a very dangerous , often very violent crime .
What 's more ?
He was having sexual relationships with a minor , a crime in itself .
Even if he was the most wonderful father a kid could ever have , fairytale story good , he is in ABSOLUTELY no position to take care of a kid right now .
And all signs are pointing that he has a lot of growing up to do before he 's ready for a kid after he gets out of jail .
You are partly responsible for the situation you are in right now , but he 's the other half of it .
You 're 14 and instead of him being more responsible than you , he has more problems than you do .
You are not ready for a child yourself , there is no way he is .
Once again ;
Tell your parents , take all the help you can get from them .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
Oil prices extended their decline Wednesday , to a nearly 5 - month low , as the dollar strengthened against major currencies and traders waited for Gustav damage reports .
The crude futures contract for October delivery fell 36 cents to settle at $ 109.35 a barrel , the lowest close since the $ 109.09 finish on April 7 .
Oil had traded as low as $ 107.22 and hovered around $ 108 for most of the session .
On Tuesday , oil prices fell $ 5.75 a barrel to settle at $ 109.71 .
Oil prices have fallen sharply from the record high price of $ 147.27 a barrel , set July 11 , as a sagging U.S. economy has cut into energy demand .
Stronger dollar : Crude oil is traded in dollars around the globe , so a stronger dollar pushes the price lower , said Tom Orr , director of research at Weeden & Co. , a financial services firm .
The dollar reached a 7 - month high against the euro on Wednesday .
" When we had an incredibly structurally weak dollar , people went to the commodity trade , " said Orr , as " a hedge against inflation , as a place to park money . "
But now that the dollar has started to recover , investors are looking to other , more profitable places to keep their funds , Orr said .
Slumping demand : Because Gustav did not hit with as much force as anticipated , and the damage to oil production facilities appeared to be less than was feared , the oil market returned its focus to slumping global demand for energy .
" The market is starting to realize that demand for oil is much weaker today than it was a year ago , " said Phil Flynn , senior market analyst at Alaron Trading .
Because demand for oil has fallen off since last year as the economy has suffered , Flynn said the supply disruption that Gustav caused has not been as massive a concern as when Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf region in 2005 .
Gustav :
In advance of Monday 's storm , oil companies shut down 100 % of production facilities in the Gulf .
Those facilities remain shut down , according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Energy .
Oil companies were beginning to send workers out to the offshore infrastructure , but machines will not be fully operable until safety standards are met .
In addition , capacity at 23 refineries was still either shut down or reduced and 95.4 % of natural gas production was still shut down , according to the U.S. Department of Energy damage update on Wednesday .
" There is still a lot of focus on Gustav and what has or has n't happened " to production rigs and refineries in the Gulf region , said Andrew Lebow , an energy analyst at MF Global in New York .
Another analyst , however , disagreed .
According to Orr , as soon as initial reports showed that Gustav did not do major damage to production rigs and refineries , oil traders stopped focusing on the storm .
While there have not been reports of major structural damage , analysts were concerned about power getting back to refineries .
" It is becoming more and more apparent as we have been talking about it that some of this refinery capacity is not coming up so quickly because of power issues , " said Lebow .
Flynn also said that it takes a while to get refineries back up and running .
" Turning the refineries on is n't like flipping a switch - it takes time to bring them back online . "
Production facilities in the Gulf will remain shut until there has been a full inspection of rigs and refineries to determine the level of damage , according to a report by the U.S. Department of Interior 's Mineral Management Service agency .
SPR : Late Tuesday , the Department of Energy decided to loan 250,000 barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to Citgo 's Lake Charles , La. , refinery , according to a statement from the government .
The reserve is an emergency repository of 700 million barrels of oil that the government controls .
" Demand for oil is 1.2 million barrels a day less than it was a year ago , so a release from the SPR can very easily make up for the lost supply , " said Flynn .
Hurricane Gustav closed Louisiana 's Calcasieu channel which disrupted Citgo crude oil supplies , according to the government 's statement .
Storms :
Three other tropical storms - Hanna , Ike and Josephine - have formed in the Atlantic , but currently are not expected to track toward the Gulf of Mexico .
" Of course there are a couple of other storms out there and the market is looking at those as well , " said Lebow .
" It was advertised as an active hurricane season and it has been . "
Tropical Storm Hanna was near Haiti on Wednesday morning and could become a hurricane by Thursday , according to the a public advisory by the National Hurricane Center .
The east coast of Florida could start seeing rain from Hanna as early as Friday , according to the advisory .

Sometimes a website name is just a website name .
Maybe the move by a company that 's worked closely with the former first lady is just what it seems : yet another step by Hillary Rodham Clinton to prepare for another run for the Senate from New York in four years .
Or another run for the White House .
We wo n't know , of course , for some time .
But that comes with the news , as reported in The Ticket early the other morning , that Clinton has urgently requested her 2008 general election supporters to approve transfer of their unusable donations for this year 's presidential race over to her 2012 Senate campaign .
( And then , potentially , into a new presidential campaign fund , as she did with $ 10 million of her surplus 2006 Senate campaign funds ) .
If this year 's donors do n't approve that transfer soon , Clinton must return the '08 money by Aug. 28 .
The respected blogger Marc Ambinder of TheAtlantic.com is reporting tonight that a company associated with Clinton 's top advance team leaders , the Markham Group , purchased that domain name on June 8 .
June 8th ?
Why does that ring a bell ?
Why , that 's the very next day after her " I - give - up - and - heartily - support Obama " speech where her family was dressed for a funeral .
Clinton sources told Ambinder the New York senator was committed to helping elect Obama on Nov. 4 , but she wanted to keep her options open for later .
Imagine that in a seasoned politician .
Come 2012 Clinton would have to choose which race she 'd enter .
Two years ago in her first Senate reelection bid , her main website was HillaryClinton.com , which she still has .
Plus HillPac.com for her political action committee and another one for her '08 campaign debt donations .
So why would she need another website with 2012 in it , unless ....
Her disappointed presidential campaign supporters may take heart .
But will they still help elect another Democrat this November ?
Or sit it out and let ' 12 fall to her ?
We are just six weeks out from Clinton 's '08 surrender to Barack Obama .
And , surely , everyone knows exactly what that means : only 223 weeks left until the 2012 election .

Investment newsletters are now featuring headlines like " How You Can Profit from the Global Food Crisis . "
The recommended investments include agribusiness stocks and exchange - traded funds ( ETFs ) that speculate in agricultural commodities .
These investments will no doubt do very well in the global food crisis ; but before you put your money down , you may want to explore whether you will be helping to alleviate the problem or actually contributing to it .
Do you really want to " invest " in starvation ?
In an April 23 article in the German news source Spiegel Online called " Deadly Greed : The Role of Speculators in the Global Food Crisis , " Balzli and Horning note , " Many investors . . . are simply oblivious to the fact that by investing in the global casino , they could be gambling away the daily food supply of the world 's poorest people . "
1
Jean Ziegler , UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food , has called the exploding food crisis " a silent mass murder . "
In an interview in the French daily Liberation on April 14 , he said , " We are heading for a very long period of rioting , conflicts [ and ] waves of uncontrollable regional instability marked by the despair of the most vulnerable populations . "
He blamed globalization and multinationals for " monopolizing the riches of the earth , " and said that a mass uprising of starving people against their persecutors is " just as possible as the French Revolution was . "
In some places , in fact , this is already happening .
In Haiti , where the cost of rice has nearly doubled since December , the prime minister was fired this month by opposition senators after more than a week of riots over the cost of staple foods .
Violent protests over food prices have been set off in Bangladesh , where rice has also doubled ; in the Ivory Coast , where food prices have soared by 30 to 60 percent from one week to the next ; and in Egypt , Uzbekistan , Yemen , the Philippines , Thailand , Indonesia and Italy .
In an April 21 Wall Street Journal article titled " Load Up the Pantry , " Brett Arends observed that the food riots now seen in the developing world could soon be affecting Americans as well .
Rocketing food prices are not a passing phase but are actually accelerating .
He recommends hoarding food – not because he is actually expecting a shortage , but as an investment , because " food prices are already rising here much faster than the returns you are likely to get from keeping your money in a bank or money - market fund . "
Arends goes on :
" The main reason for rising prices , of course , is the surge in demand from China and India .
Hundreds of millions of people are joining the middle class each year , and that means they want to eat more and better food .
A secondary reason has been the growing demand for ethanol as a fuel additive .
That 's soaking up some of the corn supply . "
2
That 's the rationale published in the Journal of Wall Street , the financial community that brought us the housing bubble , the derivatives bubble , and now the commodities bubble , producing the subprime crisis , the credit crisis , and the oil crisis .
The main reason for the food crisis , says this author , is that the Chinese and Indian middle classes are eating better .
Really ?
Rice has been the staple food of half the world for centuries , and it is hardly rich man 's fare .
Moreover , according to an April 2008 analysis from the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization , food consumption of grains has gone up by only one percent since 2006 .
3
That hardly explains the fact that the price of rice has spiked by 75 percent in just two months .
The price of Thai 100 per cent B grade white rice , considered the world 's benchmark , has tripled since early 2007 ; and it jumped 10 percent in just one week .
The fact that corn is being diverted to fuel , while no doubt a contributing factor , is also insufficient to explain these sudden jumps in price .
World population growth rates have dropped dramatically since the 1980s , and according to the U.N. 's Food and Agriculture Organization , grain availability has continued to outpace population .
4
Biofuels have drained off some of this grain , but biofuels did not suddenly happen , and neither did the rise of the Asian middle class .
If those were the chief factors , the rise in food prices would have been gradual and predictable to match .
Another explanation for the sudden jump in grain prices , not mentioned by this Wall Street Journal writer , is suggested by William Pfaff in the April 16 International Herald Tribune :
" [ M ] ore fundamental is the effect of speculation in food as a commodity – like oil and precious metals .
It has become a haven for financial investors fleeing from paper assets tainted by subprime mortgages and other toxic credit products .
The influx of buyers drives prices and makes food unaffordable for the world 's poor .
' Fund money flowing into agriculture has boosted prices , ' Standard Chartered Bank food commodities analyst Abah Ofon told the media .
' It 's fashionable .
This is the year of agricultural commodities . ' "
5
The " hot money " that has fled the collapsed real estate bubble is now moving into the commodities bubble , and that includes food .
" Hot money " is an influx of speculative capital in search of high rates of return , quickly moving from one market to another .
It moves , however , not because the products are better ( the traditional justification for price - setting according to " free market forces " ) but because the speculative " spread " is better .
Money is invested not in making real goods and services but simply in making more money .
Food prices are being driven by speculators , and today that includes ordinary investors like you and me , who can now gamble in agricultural futures through ETFs that have opened up a lucrative market formerly available only to big investment players .
Conventional economic theory says that prices are driven up when " demand " exceeds " supply . "
But in this case " demand " does not mean the number of hands reaching out for food .
It means the amount of money competing for existing supplies .
The global food crisis has resulted from an increase , not in the number of mouths to be fed , but simply in the price .
It is the money supply that has gone up , and it is investment money in search of quick profits that is largely driving food prices up .
Much of this seems to be happening in the futures market , where fund managers seek
to maximize their profits by using futures contracts .
Balzli and Horning explain :
" The futures market is a traditional tool for farmers to sell their harvests ahead of time .
In a futures contract , quantities , prices and delivery dates are fixed , sometimes even before crops have been planted .
Futures contracts allow farmers and grain wholesalers a measure of protection against adverse weather conditions and excessive price fluctuations .
. . .
But now speculators are taking advantage of this mechanism .
They can buy futures contracts for wheat , for example , at a low price , betting that the price will go up .
If the price of the grain rises by the agreed delivery date , they profit .
Some experts now believe these investors have taken over the market , buying futures at unprecedented levels and driving up short - term prices .
Since last August , this mechanism has led to a doubling in the price of rice . "
The authors quote grain wholesaler Greg Warner , who says what is happening now in the grain futures market is unprecedented .
" What we normally have is a predictable group of sellers and buyers -- mainly farmers and silo operators . "
But the landscape has changed since the influx of large index funds into the futures market .
" Prices keep climbing up and up . "
Warner calculates that financial investors now hold the rights to two complete annual harvests of a type of grain traded in Chicago called " soft red winter wheat . "
He calls these developments " stunning " and points to them as " evidence that capitalism is literally consuming itself . "

What about investing in agribusinesses such as Monsanto , which have promoted the " Green Revolution " through the bioengineering of foods and the production of GMO ( genetically modified ) seeds , synthetic fertilizers , and herbicide and pesticide sprays ?
Wo n't these corporations , at least , help to alleviate the global food crisis ?
To the contrary , critics say these businesses too are just driving food prices up .
Monsanto's patented GMO seeds have been genetically engineered so that they cannot reproduce but must be purchased every year from the company .
Small farmers who have fallen for the hype of greater productivity and subjected their land to these seeds and chemicals have found that not only have their yields been reduced but that the land will no longer bear anything except GMO seeds .
7 Farmers who can no longer afford the seeds are priced out of the market , handing monopoly control over to the agribusiness giants that can then raise prices to whatever the market will bear ; and in the case of food , it will bear a lot , right up to the point of slavery .
As Henry Kissinger once famously said , " Who controls the food supply controls the people ; who controls the energy can control whole continents ; who controls money can control the world . "
What can you invest in , then , that actually would help relieve the global food crisis ?
One possibility is local organic farming .
" Community - supported agriculture " ( CSA ) is a model of food production , sales , and distribution aimed at increasing the quality of food and the care given to land , plants and animals , while reducing losses and risks for producers .
A variety of CSA systems are now in use worldwide , allowing small - scale commercial farmers and gardeners to have a successful , small - scale closed market while providing their customer - members with a regular delivery or pick - up of healthy local produce .
The USDA provides a list of CSA addresses and websites .

That still leaves the problem of speculation in food futures .
How can parasitic profits to non-producing middlemen be eliminated while still protecting farmers ?
The futures market was first created for farmers , who needed to be able to lock in a price today that would cover their costs and return a reasonable profit later .
One interesting proposal is to return to the policy of " farm parity pricing " enacted during the 1930s .
It ensured that the prices received by farmers covered the prices they paid for input plus a reasonable profit .
If the farmers could not get the parity price , the government would buy their output , put it into storage , and sell it later .
The government actually made a small profit on these transactions ; food prices were kept stable ; and the family farm system was preserved as the safeguard of the national food supply .
With the push for " globalization " in later decades , farm parity was replaced with farm " subsidies " that favored foods for export over local markets .
They also favored large corporate farms engaged in chemical farming over sustainable farming , forcing thousands of family farmers out of business .
Farm parity pricing could help , but a complete solution to the problem of global inflation would require an overhaul of the private central banking system that has created one bubble after another for the last century .

Independent sensor readings and photographs taken in Beijing both tell the same story : the Chinese government 's olympian efforts to clean up the city 's air are n't working .
With the Olympics slated to start Friday , Wired.com took a careful look at the raw air pollution numbers taken by air pollution sensors set up by the BBC's Beijing bureau .
Graphed over a period of almost four weeks , the analysis shows that the Chinese authorities ' anti-smog efforts are not making the city 's air better .
On most days , Beijing 's air clearly remains poor , rarely dropping below
50 micrograms of particulate matter per cubic meter of air .
The World
Health Organization considers any concentration of particulate higher than 50 to be unhealthy .
While the BBC sensor has a large margin of error ( 20 percent ) , on most days the readings have been far above the threshold .
The pollution levels have been clearly reflected in daily photographs taken from the same location by the news agency 's reporters .
The Chinese government has been working on an ambitious plan to improve the air quality in Beijing for the games including traffic bans , factory shutdowns , cloud seeding , and construction slowdowns .
But the city 's air quality has not varied in response to the city 's anti-smog efforts , according to the BBC 's readings .
Pollution levels are changing , however , but only in response with meteorological conditions , i.e. rain .
That 's exactly what University of Rhode Island professor Kenneth Rahn predicted would happen in a Wired.com story last month .
" They are trying every conceivable thing and that is the right approach , " Rahn said .
" But when the air is worst in Beijing , it 's the hardest to control . "
On July 20th , the Chinese government put into effect the full package of anti-smog efforts ( indicated by the first gray bar ) , but as can be clearly seen , air pollution levels actually went up .
Only after heavy rain fell on July 29th ( indicated by the second gray bar ) did air pollution levels decrease .
In addition , if the anti-smog efforts were keeping particulate matter out of the air , air pollution levels should have stayed low after the July 29th storm , but as the graph shows , pollution immediately climbed back to previous levels .
And yet Chinese government officials continue to recite the party line that the anti-smog efforts will result in a " blue- sky " Olympics .
For example , they deny that the lack of visibility in the city is due to smog .
" Clouds and haze are not pollution .
This kind of weather is a natural phenomenon .
It has nothing to do with pollution , " Du Shaozhong , deputy director of the Beijing municipal bureau of environmental protection , told Xinhua last week , the official government news outlet .
He explicitly criticized the use of photographs as an indication of pollution levels .
" Such photographs ' do n't tell the truth , ' " Du Shaozhong said .
" We do n't approve of their use to pass judgment on the air quality ... you have to look at the complete monitoring system , and analyze the data scientifically . "
The problem , however , is that there is compelling evidence that the Chinese government is cooking the pollution accounting books .
As laid out by Steven Andrews , an environmental consultant , in an op - ed earlier this year in the Wall Street Journal , he describes three number manipulations :
Seven sensors were used from 1998 - 2005 , but after that , as international scrutiny was increasing , the government dropped two sensor stations from polluted areas of the city and added three in less polluted areas .
These changes had a very significant impact in showing air quality increases .
The government subbed nitrogen oxides out and nitrogen dioxide in to its air pollution index calculations .
Of the various substances that the sensors measure , nitrogen oxides were the most likely to exceed air pollution standards .
The Chinese government considers an air pollution index rating of under 100 to be a " blue sky day . "
In 2006 , 49 days were reported to have an air pollution index between 96 and 105 . 47 of those days were – what " luck " !
– reported under 100 , a near statistical impossibility .
2007 data shows " a similar bias . "
The end result of the system is that the Chinese government gave August 4 , seen above , an air pollution index rating in its " Good " category .
Given these problems with the " complete monitoring system , " photos and independent sensors are the best indications available about how bad the air in Beijing really is .
In fact , even the Chinese government does n't seem to believe that its efforts are working .
There is word in China Daily , a government mouthpiece , that officials are considering an even more drastic plan that could take 90 percent of the city 's cars off the road , if the pollution readings do n't cooperate .

Pictured :
The punk rock turtle with a bright green mohawk
It looks like an aquatic version of Johnny Rotten in his punk heyday after a heavy night on the tiles .
But that spiky green quiff is n't gelled hair - it 's growing algae .
And the creature sporting the spectacular coiffure is the Mary River Turtle , one of the most unusual reptiles of its type on the planet .
Shell shocked :
The Mary River Turtle is having a Green Day , but his hairdo is just algae growing on his head
The Mary River Turtle has become a popular figure with Australian environmentalists who say the endangered creature is being further threatened by Queensland State Government 's plans to build a dam on the river .
It is one of the more unusual species of turtles as it breathes through lung - like structures in its tail and needs shallow water to survive .
It was described formally by scientists only in 1994 and little is known about it .
The hairsute creature was captured by amateur photographer Chris Van Wyk as it quietly waded in the shallows .
King of the river :
The turtle wades through the water looking for his next meal
You 're tired .
You could put your head down on a desk right now and fall asleep immediately .
You went to bed late last night , had trouble falling asleep and woke up too early .
And let 's not kid ourselves :
Tonight will be the same unless … well , read on .
This is the classic not - so - shut - eye experience of many Americans who think they are sleep - deprived and possibly need pills or other treatment to fix their insomnia , teeth grinding , jet lag , restless or jerky legs , snoring , sleepwalking and so forth .
Reality is quite different .
For instance , insomnia is said to be the most common sleep disorder , but these dissatisfying sleep experiences only get in the way of daily activities for 10 percent of us , according to the National Institutes of Health .
And in almost half of those cases , the real underlying problem is illness ( often mental ) or the effects of a substance , like coffee or medication .
Here are five recent findings that might help you rest easier : 1 . We sleep better than we think we do For most of us , sleep deprivation is a myth .
We 're not zombies .
The non-profit National Sleep Foundation ( which takes money from the sleep - aid industry , including drug companies that make sleeping pills ) says the average U.S. resident gets 7 hours a night and that 's not enough , but a University of Maryland study earlier this year shows we typically get 8 hours and are doing fine .
In fact , Americans get just as much sleep nowadays as they did 40 years ago , the study found .
2 . We need less sleep as we age We 'll die without sleep .
The details are sketchy , but research suggests it 's a time when we restore vital biological processes and also sort and cement memories .
Last year , the World Health Organization determined that nightshift work , which can lead to sleep troubles , is a probable human carcinogen .
On the upside , the latest research suggests we need less of it as we get older .
3 . You can sleep like a baby ( or Thomas Edison )
Multiple , shorter sleep sessions nightly , rather than one long one , are an option .
So - called polyphasic sleep is seen in babies , the elderly and other animals ( and Thomas Edison reportedly slept this way ) .
For the rest of us , it is more realistic and healthy to sleep at night as best we can and then take naps as needed .
EEGs show that we are biphasic sleepers with two alertness dips — one at night time and one mid-day .
So talk to HR about setting up a nap room , like they have for NASA 's Phoenix mission team members .
4 . Animals exhibit a range of sleep habits
The three - toed sloth sleeps 9.6 hours nightly .
But newborn dolphins and killer whales can forgo sleeping for their entire first month .
However , the latter extreme is not recommended for humans .
We grow irritable and lose our ability to focus and make decisions after even one night of missed sleep , and that can lead to serious accidents driving and using other machinery .
5 . Get used to being tired , hit the desk
The bottom line is that a good night 's sleep is within the reach of most of us if we follow common - sense guidelines for sleep hygiene :
Go to bed at the same time nightly .
Set aside enough time to hit that golden 7 hours of sleep .
Refrain from caffeine , heavy or spicy foods , and alcohol and other optional medications that might keep you awake , four to six hours before bed - time .
Have a pre-sleep routine so you wind down before you hop in .
Block out distracting lights and noises .
Only engage in sleep and sex in bed ( no TV - watching , reading or eating ) .
Exercise regularly but not right before bed .
But you already know all this and you do n't do it .
So your realistic plan might be to surrender to the mid-day desk nap .
The Rails observer field is an easy way to add an ajax select menu to your site .
Below is an example to get you going .
Problem
Let 's say you have a list of users on your site and want to filter them by a group .
In the example we will be using gym members .
View
< %= select " gym " , : gym_id , Gym . find ( : all ) . collect { | p | [ p . name , p . id ]} , { : selected => params [ : gym ] } %> <%= observe_field " gym_gym_id " , :url => { :action => :members_by_gym , :controller => : members } , :update => " member_list " , : with => " ' gym= ' + escape ( $ ( ' gym_gym_id ' ) .value ) " %> < div id= " member_list " > < % for member in @members %> <%= link_to member .
name , member %> < br/> <% end %> </div >
The first thing we do is build the select form by using the Rails Select Helper .
The id of the select tag is generated by rails , " gym_gym_id " .
We need to pass the id name as the first parameter to the observe field .
The url parameter is pretty straightforward .
The update parameter of the observer field designates which element will be updated .
The " : with " parameter adds a parameter to the form named " gym " .
Post
Parameters : { " contoller " => " members " , " action " => " members_by_gym " , " gym " => " 1 " , " controller " => " members " }
The gym parameter posted here is from the observer_field tag .
Controller
def members_by_gym @members = Member . find_all_by_gym_id ( params [ : gym ] ) render : layout => false end
It 's important that you add the render : layout => false or bad things will happen .
We still have one more thing to do .
We have our controller being hit via ajax when the select menu changes but we need to make the html that will be updated on the page .
In the view / members folder we need to make a new page called members_by_gym.html.erb
members_by_gym.html.erb
< % for member in @members %> <%= link_to member .
name , member %> < br/> <% end %>

Key Largo : gangster explains to Bogart how ...
Giant smoky plume discovered pouring out of " Brimstone Pit " crater near the summit of NW Rota 1 volcano .
New videos show the first ever observations of deep submarine volcanic eruptions .
Most of the Earth 's volcanic activity happens underwater , anywhere from the surface all the way down to depths greater than 2.5 miles .
However , this underwater activity has rarely been seen directly .
Previous accounts were either after the eruptions or by surface vessels that could n't get close enough to the action .
Submerged fireworks
In March 2004 , a team of NOAA scientists sent a remotely operated research submarine , named ROPOS to find some hot vents along the Mariana Arc volcanic chain .
" What we found was an eruption in progress , " said Verena Tunnicliffe , a biologist at University of Victoria , Canada .
" We found this big pit with rocks and molten sulfur flying out .
And we were sitting at the edge of this pit . "
Pulsating plumes of opaque yellowish ash containing droplets of sulfur started surging out of a feature called Brimstone Pit , close to the summit of a volcano named NW Rota - 1 , 60 miles northwest of the island of Rota in the North Pacific Ocean , at 1,820 feet below the water surface .
It was n't until the scientists brought the vehicle to surface that they saw the dime - sized golden droplets covering the exterior of ROPOS .
The results are detailed in the May 25 issue of the journal Nature .
Moving plates
The Earth 's outer layer is made up of plates , each moving about four inches a year .
Earth 's molten lava rises and pushes Earth 's plates apart in the middle of the oceans .
When an oceanic plate slides under a continental plate , it creates a subduction zone .
The rock is once again heated as it goes down into the Earth , and magma again rises to form volcanoes .
While the oceanic Pacific Plate moves west towards Japan , the Philippines Plate moves eastward towards Hawaii .
The Pacific Plate is being subducted and gases and molten lava are coming up through the Philippines Plate , Tunnicliffe explained .
This causes magma and other materials to spew out in volcanic eruptions at sites like Brimstone Pit .
The return
In October 2005 , the scientists sent another vehicle , the Hyper - Dolphin , to the site to Brimstone Pit and found that it 's still active and spewing out magma ash .
In their latest expedition , which started in April 2006 and recently ended , the team 's third remotely operated vehicle to visit the site , Jason II , was bombarded by volcanic bombs .
" Volcanoes put out magma in different forms , " said Robert Embley , a geophysicist at the NOAA Vents Program .
" In water they solidify .
The smaller ones are ash and the bigger ones are bombs . "
But more importantly , Jason II also showed that the volcano is still active and ongoing .
On Jason II 's first dive , the team was unable to find Brimstone Pit because a volcanic fog made it hard to see .
In the second dive , the fog had dissipated and the scientists noticed that part of the volcano had fallen off since their last visit .
" Something happened there before we got there , " Embley told LiveScience .
The slow - moving cloud of white smoke soon started becoming more active .
The cloud and bubbles started escalating and pulsing like never before , suggesting the volcano continually erupts in cycles of varying activity .
" In some ways we were able to see what was happening underwater better than is possible on land — because the pressure of 560 meters ( 1,837 feet ) of water dampened the power of the explosive eruptions and so we could observe what was going on from very close up , which is impossible on land , " said study team member William Chadwick of Oregon State University .
Acid water
When the area water was sampled , even when there was no activity , it was found to be very acidic from the high concentration of sulfur .
" Sulfur dioxide is one of the main gases that come out of arc volcanoes , " Chadwick said .
" When the sulfur dioxide mixes with seawater , it produces sulfuric acid and sulfur droplets .
This makes the volcanic plumes very acidic , like stomach acid . "
This and the recurrent rain of molten sulfur and ash mean that the sides of the volcano are inhospitable to all but a handful of hardy organisms such as shrimp extreme microbes that huddle in mats .
Shell shocker :
The baby turtle born with two - heads
It is the baby turtle that proves two heads really are better than one .
While its siblings grow at a the usual steady pace , this tiny creature is speeding ahead .
The reason for its extraordinary growth spurt is simple : having two heads mean it eats twice as fast .
The two - headed turtle - a mutant - is a rare find
Staff could have been forgiven for thinking they were seeing double when the turtle turned up at the Water World aquatic farm at Wuwei town in Anhui , eastern China .
They had ordered a shipment of babies from a local farm - and discovered that one of them had two heads .
It weighed just 17g when it arrived at the centre but is now thriving .
Scientists will keep an eye on the turtle as it grows
Water World spokesman Jimmy
Hu said : ' We got it two weeks ago and it 's growing fast , probably because it can eat twice as fast as the others .
' It was mixed among many other turtles and we only discovered it this week . '
Mr Hu added : ' It 's very rare to see a turtles with two heads , we plan to keep it and raise it carefully for future research . '
The turtle is growing fast since weighing in at 17g when it arrived at Water World
Apple Introduces an Environmentally - Friendly iPod
September 15th , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
If you ’ve been holding back from buying an iPod nano for environmental reasons , it might be time to rethink your decision .
Last week , Apple CEO Steve Jobs introduced the fourth generation iPod nano , which he claims is the most environmentally - friendly iPod ever built .
The new nano is made with arsenic - free glass , and unlike previous versions , does not contain Brominated Flame Retardant ( BFR ) or polyvinylchloride ( PVR ) .
The Apple website also claims that the device has a recyclable aluminum enclosure .
While some Apple computers still contain BFRs and PVRs , the company plans to remove them from all products by the end of the year .
Customers can already return their old iPods to Apple stores for recycling .
Apple ’s steps are nothing to scoff at , but I do n’t understand why they were n’t taken before .
Did someone at the company think it was a good idea to use toxic substances in their iPods , or was the technology to do without them simply unavailable ?
Whatever the reason , I hope other electronic companies pay attention to Apple and remove these ever - present toxic materials from their products .

Today , the person who " knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America " let slip some pearls of wisdom :
" Of course , it 's a fungible commodity and they do n't flag , you know , the molecules , where it 's going and where it 's not .
But in the sense of the Congress today , they know that there are very , very hungry domestic markets that need that oil first .
So , I believe that what Congress is going to do , also , is not to allow the export bans to such a degree that it 's Americans who get stuck holding the bag without the energy source that is produced here , pumped here .
It 's got to flow into our domestic markets first . "
I 'm not sure I fully grasp that , though I am relieved to know that they , whoever they are , do n't have to sit around flagging individual molecules all day long .
I think , despite her saying that Congress is " not going to allow the export bans " , that she is actually recommending such a ban .
At any rate , what she says makes a lot more sense on the assumption that either the ' not ' or the ' bans ' was a slip than it does on the assumption that she thought that lifting nonexistent export bans would keep our oil here at home .
It seems pretty clear to me that Sarah Palin has no idea at all what she 's talking about here .
But let 's pretend this is a serious statement , and consider it seriously .
Who do we presently export oil to ?
Well : in 2007 , the two main recipients of our oil were Mexico and Canada , who between them received some 170,716,000 barrels of what the Energy Information Administration calls " petroleum and products . "
That 's nearly a third of our exports .
But guess what ?
When you look at the analogous table of imports , who turns up in first and second place ?
Canada and Mexico again !
They sold us 1,455,280,000 barrels between them in 2007 , or about eight and a half times as much as we sold them .
If you check crude oil alone , it turns out that all our exports in 2007 went to Canada , which was also our number one supplier , selling us nearly seventy times as much crude oil as we sold the Canadians .
Do you think that they would keep on selling us all that oil if we unilaterally stopped selling oil to them ?
Maybe they would , and maybe they would n't .
Do you think Sarah Palin knows the answer ?
I hope so .
It would be pretty strange for the nation 's foremost expert on energy to come out in favor of an embargo without knowing whether or not it would cost us nearly 1.3 billion barrels of " petroleum and products " a day year ( oops ) , including about 19 % of our total crude oil imports .
Annoying our neighbors so much that they cut off our oil supplies would , I suppose , be one way of helping us achieve energy independence , but it does n't seem like a particularly good idea .
Call me cynical , though : I do n't think Sarah Palin had any idea what she was talking about , any more than I think John McCain had any idea what he was talking about when he said she " knows more about energy than probably anyone else in the United States of America " .
Because if she does , we 're in much deeper trouble than I had imagined .
As entertaining a diversion from the demise of the American dream the presidential contest between Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain has become , what with thousands of mass media hairpieces focused intently on their every vague utterance , let ’s keep in sight this equally entertaining sideshow :
A third of the seats in the U.S. Senate and all of the seats in the House of Representatives are available for the public ’s inspection , validation or rejection in November .
The percentage of respondents in national polls who believe Congress is doing a good job is buried in the teens , even lower than approval ratings for President Bush , now trending in the mid- to high - 20s .
The re-election rate for House members in 2006 was 94 percent ( down from 98 percent in ’ 04 ) ; the rate for senators was 79 percent in 2006 ( down from 96 percent in ’ 04 ) , according to the Center for Responsive Politics .
Incumbency rules .
Many voters might argue that collectively , members of Congress are greedheads mired in the trappings of power wrapped tightly around them by corporate lobbyists paid millions of dollars to either extract largesse from the Hill or prevent lawmaking or regulatory rule - writing that would be bad for business .
But …
After meeting their House representative or senator face to face , those same voters might say : “ Gee .
What a wonderful person .
He really cares about us folks back here in the district . ”
Ah , the flitting pleasure of being glad - handed , looked in the eye and backslapped by a professional politicians whose favorite line is : “ I ’ll have my staff look into it .
Thanks for calling this to my attention .
Hey , how ’s [ insert name of appropriate spouse , child or relative , usually whispered by an aide at the pol ’s elbow ] ? ”
So what standards of performance should voters apply when considering whether to re-elect an incumbent ?
Such staggeringly high re-election rates suggest voters keep mindlessly sending miscreants back to the Hill to continue digging the deepest , blackest of holes in which to bury taxpayers and any notions of sound public policy .
What does the incumbent do for constituents ?
My congressman , like all members of Congress , will help you obtain presidential greetings , obtain a flag flown over the Capitol , apply to a service academy , intervene with a federal agency ( until it gets too messy , of course ) , prod along a passport request , get a White House tour , and generally navigate the federal government .
All politics is local , said Tip O’Neill , the former speaker of the House .
Members of Congress know this .
Successfully helping a constituent with a problem virtually guarantees a vote .
Having a long history of constituent service is a significant advantage of incumbency .
But should constituent service now be viewed from the perspective of “ all of us ” instead of just “ me “ ?
Voters need a collective view of an incumbent ’s performance instead of “ what ’s in it for me . ”
Does the incumbent demonstrate appropriate flexibility in his or her long - term congressional mission as current events unfold over time ?
This is a delicate point .
Wisdom in Congress is in short supply because polling results have replaced incumbents ’ brains .
Incumbents who alter a position over time are often accused of becoming informal footwear — flip - floppers .
Voters must discern whether an incumbent ’s change of mind reflects a sincere desire to find the wisest position instead of the politically adroit one .
Voters need to question closely their incumbents ’ alterations of position to determine the validity of their motivations .
Does the incumbent demonstrate sufficient knowledge and competency in applying policy to national problems ?
More than 80 percent of respondents to national polls do not approve of the collective performance of members of Congress .
That ’s a charge of mass incompetence .
Individually , members of Congress may be competent in applying policy to problems but unable or unwilling to do so because of perceived political restrictions .
It ’s not always easy for a voter with her hand on the lever to determine her member ’s competency .
She could consult her member ’s voting records , legislation actually filed , and follow her member ’s work on the committees the member has been assigned to .
But it ’s not difficult to determine if a member of Congress is unwilling to act independently based on that member ’s knowledge and competency .
A voter may critically read the press releases on her member ’s congressional Web site and compare that wording with talking points from the White House ( if the member ’s party holds the presidency ) or with the Web site rhetoric of the national party organizations in either the House or the Senate .
Small pockets of individual competency may actually reside in Congress , but they remain aisle - locked by a lack of independence and political courage .
Is the incumbent immune to the blandishments of lobbyists ?
There is no vaccination that can prevent the nose of a member of Congress from catching the tiniest whiff of a subtle quid pro quo .
Should incumbents listen to lobbyists ?
Yes , they should listen .
But not trade favor for favor — or dollars .
Voters know that incumbents ( and challengers are not immune ) in their mediated campaign posturings will , with a throaty harrumph , harrumph , rail against the evil special interests and promise to stand up against them when returned to the hall of Congress .
But what is the relationship between the incumbent and lobbyists ?
Check the incumbent ’s campaign fundraising over time .
What percentage of his or her funds come from political action committees ( and what were they ) ?
Did any PACs represent interests before committees on which the incumbent serves ?
Did representatives of lobbyists contribute to wording of legislation associated with the incumbent ?
Do the lobbyists represent corporations in the incumbent ’s district that depend on federal government spending ?
Does the incumbent believe that being a member of Congress has higher responsibilities than maximizing the pork delivered to his or her district ?
Incumbents are irrevocably wedded to the belief that voters are sufficiently impressed by the size of the taxpayer - funded government largesse delivered to the district to assure their votes .
In fact , incumbents will go to almost unbelievable lengths to associate themselves with every damn federal dollar they can .
Read the press releases on their congressional Web sites .
Each time you see the phrases “ secured , ” “ helped secure , ” “ voted for , ” and “ announced grant , ” add up the dollars .
That ’s what I did when my congressman claimed he ’d brought a quarter of a billion dollars into the district in his first term on the Hill .
Overemphasizing an incumbent ’s influence in securing the district ’s rasher of bacon is dishonest .
Assigning as the principal responsibility for a member of Congress carving out the most pork for the district is selfish … and it actually offends other members of Congress ( who think it minimizes their pork ) .
Read the incumbent ’s press releases for whiffs of pork .
Ferret out the incumbent ’s earmarks .
Determine the incumbent ’s priorities .
Who does the incumbent really serve ?
Does the incumbent provide ready , easy access to pertinent information on his or her congressional Web site ?
Usually , voters must spend oodles of time and energy finding information that appropriately measures an incumbent ’s performance .
For example , does the incumbent have links that clearly show his or her voting record , requested earmarks , fundraising efforts , and daily calendars and phone logs showing whom he or she speaks with ?
If voters desire a Congress whose approval rating may rapidly ascend from the bickering swill of a cellar in which it now resides , they must ignore the carefully chosen clothes , the ivory - white smiles , the franked , flashy , colorful mailings labeled “ Legislative Reports , ” the 30 - second spots that briefly flash the incumbents ’ cheerful families into consciousness , the local TV news showing the incumbent backed by flags and impressive - looking bookcases touting his or her latest legislative success … and all that other pretentious crap .
Determining the competency of an incumbent is hard work .
They do n’t make it easy .
If voters want a Congress they can be proud of , they ’ve got to do the work necessary to roust the current , incompetent incumbents .

In a significant and highly unusual defeat for the so - called " Israel Lobby , " the Democratic leadership of the House of Representatives has decided to shelve a long - pending , albeit nonbinding , resolution that called for President George W. Bush to launch what critics called a blockade against Iran .
House Congressional Resolution ( HR ) 362 , whose passage the powerful American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) had made its top legislative priority this year , had been poised to pass virtually by acclamation last summer .
But an unexpectedly strong lobbying effort by a number of grassroots Iranian - American , Jewish - American , peace , and church groups effectively derailed the initiative , although AIPAC and its supporters said they would try to revive it next year or if Congress returns to Washington for a " lame - duck " session after the November elections .
Congress , which may still adopt a package of new unilateral economic sanctions against Iran  some of which the administration has already imposed  over the weekend , is expected to adjourn over the next several days .
” We ’ll resubmit it when Congress comes back , and we ’ll have even more signatures , ” the resolution ’s main author , New York Democrat Rep. Gary Ackerman , told the Washington Times , adding that the resolution currently has 270 co-sponsors , or some two - thirds of the House ’s entire membership .
Still , the decision by the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee , Rep. Howard Berman , to shelve HR 362 marked an unusual defeat for AIPAC , according to its critics who charged that the resolution was designed to lay the groundwork for the Bush administration or any successor administration to take military action against Iran .
" This was a joint effort by several groups to really put the focus on the dangers presented by such a resolution over the opposition of one of the most powerful lobbies in the country , " said Trita Parsi , president of the National Iranian American Council ( NIAC ) .
Among other provisions , the resolution declared that preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapons capacity was " vital to the national security interests of the United States "  language that is normally used to justify military action  and " demand ( ed ) that the President initiate an international effort to immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities … "
Among the means it called for were " prohibiting the export to Iran of all refined petroleum products ; imposing stringent inspection requirements on all persons , vehicles , ships , planes , trains and cargo entering or departing Iran ; and prohibiting the international movement of all Iranian officials not involved in negotiating the suspension of Iran ’s nuclear program . "
Although the resolution ’s sponsors explicitly denied it  indeed , one clause stated that " nothing in this resolution shall be construed as an authorization of the use of force against Iran "  the resolution ’s critics charged that the latter passage could be used to justify a blockade against Iran , an act of war under international law .
" Ambiguity in the text of the resolution  whether intended by its drafters or not  has led some to see it as a de- facto approval for a land , air and sea blockade of Iran , any of which could be considered an act of war , " according to Deborah DeLee , president of Americans for Peace Now ( APN ) , a Zionist group that has long urged the administration to engage in direct talks with Tehran and that lobbied against the resolution .
Two key Democratic congressmen , who had initially co-sponsored the resolution , Reps. Robert Wexler and Barney Frank , unexpectedly defected in July , insisting that its language be changed to exclude any possibility that it could be used to justify war against Iran and to include new provisions urging Washington to directly engage Tehran .
The resolution was introduced last May , shortly after AIPAC ’s annual meeting during which then - Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert reportedly told the House Democratic leadership , including Speaker Nancy Pelosi , Berman , and Ackerman that economic sanctions against Iran had run their course and that stronger action , including a possible naval quarantine , was needed to increase pressure on Tehran to halt its nuclear program .
The meeting also followed talks between Olmert and Bush who , despite an strongly hawkish speech before Israel ’s Knesset , privately told his hosts that Washington would almost certainly not attack on Iranian nuclear facilities nor give a green light Israel to launch an attack of its own before he leaves office in January 2009 , according to a recent account by London ’s Guardian newspaper .
The administration itself never took a position on the resolution .
At the time , the price of oil was skyrocketing , and the military brass in the Pentagon , increasingly concerned about the deteriorating situations in Afghanistan and Pakistan , was expressing its opposition to military action against Iran in unusually blunt terms .
Nonetheless , AIPAC pushed hard for adoption of the resolution , even as it , like its Congressional sponsors , insisted that it was not designed to justify military action .
Just last week , in a final push for the resolution ’s passage , AIPAC drafted a letter that was circulated to House members who had not yet co-sponsored the resolution .
While it denounced as " utter nonsense " suggestions that the resolution could be used to justify military action , the text also stressed that Tehran ’s " pursuit of nuclear weapons and regional hegemony " posed " real and growing " threats to " the vital national security interests of the United States . "
AIPAC ’s failure was particularly notable given the presence at the UN General Assembly in New York this week of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whose repeated and predictably provocative predictions about the demise of Israel and " the American empire " have been used routinely by AIPAC to rally public and elite opinion against Tehran and underline the threat it allegedly poses .
In announcing that the resolution has been shelved , Berman said he shared critics ’ concerns about the resolution ’s wording and will not bring it before his committee until his concerns were addressed .
" If Congress is to make a statement of policy , it should encompass a strategy on how to gain consensus on multilateral sanctions to change Iran ’s behavior , ” his spokesperson told the Times .

The hits just keep coming for Barack Obama against John McCain .
Today , the Obama camp released an ad that uses McCain ’s advocacy for the deregulation of the health insurance industry against him .
Here is the ad :
The focus on the economy has changed the entire dynamic of this election .
After months of McCain trying to paint Obama as risky and inexperienced , it is now Obama who is portraying McCain as a risk to America ’s pocketbooks , but in order for any candidate to be elected president , they need a degree of good luck .
John McCain has had nothing but bad luck for a couple of weeks now .

It was bad luck that the article pushing for deregulation of the health insurance appeared the same week as the collapse of our financial markets , which was in part caused by too little regulation .
If the timing is a little different , the Obama camp does n’t gain this issue to use against him .
Healthcare is an issue when the majority of voters side with Obama , and if he is able to characterize McCain as risky on both the economy and healthcare , McCain is in huge trouble .
The last set of polls taken before the financial crisis had Obama resuming a small lead .
I am curious to see what the next set of polls will look like .
The recent financial crisis also makes the upcoming debate on Friday ten times more critical for both candidates .
A good debate performance for Obama would help him maintain , or grow his lead , and McCain must have a good performance to get some momentum back , or he could be facing an uphill climb to the White House in November .
It was as though Michael Deane , a 32 - year - old transplant from London , did not get the memo that crime is way down in Manhattan .
He looked like something out of “ Death Wish ” as he drove slowly past his Riverside Drive apartment in broad daylight , his bloodshot eyes darting from pedestrians to parked cars to old people sitting on park benches .
Near his building , a man washing windows with a bottle of Windex returned his stare , but Mr. Deane kept driving .
Would getting sprayed with Windex kill him ?
Something to think about .
He had been sneaking around like a noir hero for two and a half weeks , finding new and shadowy exits to his regular places .
He was tired from lack of sleep , and while it was early yet , he was looking forward to a stiff cocktail when he got upstairs .
But first he had to get there alive .
He parked his car a couple of blocks away and started the treacherous walk , his only friend of late tucked under his black shirt , a curiously damp bulge .
Canonical , maintainer of the Ubuntu Linux distribution , has joined the Linux Foundation , the nonprofit organization dedicated to accelerating the growth of Linux .
By joining , Canonical can both contribute to and benefit from the foundation that features many of the Linux community 's leading companies as members , Canonical and Linux Foundation officials said .
" Joining the Linux Foundation is an indication of our growing presence within both Linux and the wider open - source community , particularly in the enterprise space , " said Andrew Rodaway , director of marketing for Canonical .
" We believe that Ubuntu is gaining traction in enterprise deployments at the server level as well as on the desktop , and it 's good for us to have ways to communicate this . "
Amanda McPherson , vice president of marketing and developer programs at the Linux Foundation , told eWEEK , " I think it is significant that Canonical is joining the Linux Foundation .
They have been involved closely with us since the inception of the foundation .
They participate in the Linux Standard Base , for instance ; they attend our Collaboration Summits , and Mark Shuttleworth [ founder and CEO of Canonical ] is on the board as an individual member .
By officially joining they are putting resources behind our work , and , more than anything , showing they value that work . "
Not only is Canonical the commercial sponsor of Ubuntu , but the company supports several other open - source projects , including Bazaar , Storm and Upstart .
However , Ubuntu has become a popular choice for the server and desktop as well as for the rapidly emerging areas of " netbooks " and mobile Internet devices .
What does Canonical bring to the Linux Foundation table ?
" We have a huge , global user base and tremendous backing from our community , who ultimately make Ubuntu possible , " Rodaway said .
" These people have a strong voice and their advocacy around the world is driving Linux adoption at all levels , from mobile devices to the cloud . "
Moreover , " Membership gives us a voice within a key influencing organization and visibility to the growing corporate membership of the foundation , " Rodaway said .
" We see acceptance of Linux in major corporations and public sector organizations accelerating , and the Foundation is doing a great job in supporting that . "
Matt Zimmerman , CTO of the Ubuntu project at Canonical , chairs the Ubuntu Technical Board and leads all engineering efforts for the distribution .
" The Linux Foundation occupies a critical , noncommercial function in the use and popularization of Linux around the world .
We 've always seen the Linux Foundation 's value and are pleased to now become an official member and support its activities , " Zimmerman said in a statement .
" We look forward to working with them to continue the march of Linux in all areas of computing . "
Ubuntu community members have been active participants in a variety of workgroups at the Foundation , including the Linux Standard Base , Desktop Architects and Driver Backport groups .
With Canonical 's support , user interests for both commercial and community versions of Ubuntu will be represented .
" There is no question that the Ubuntu distribution has advanced the state of Linux on the desktop , " McPherson said .
" Their focus on usability and branding is being felt throughout the industry .
We 're very pleased to work more closely with them on neutral , industry and communitywide initiatives . "
Jim Zemlin , executive director of the Linux Foundation , said in a statement , " Canonical is an important new member for the Linux Foundation .
Matt and his team have created an exciting distribution that has taken the world by storm .
They have rallied the cause of cross-industry , cross-community collaboration for years .
We are extremely pleased to work even more closely with Canonical as we push Linux to the next stage of growth . "

It 's a particularly busy week for me : on top of a few looming deadlines , I 'll be at Business of Software 2008 in Boston .
So , I figured it'd be the perfect opportunity to revisit some classics .
The Complicator 's Gloves was originally published on January 16th , 2007 .
Another fun , tangentially related article is The Complicator 's Bicycle .
Good software is constantly under attack on several fronts .
First , there are The Amateurs who somehow manage to land that hefty contract despite having only finished " Programming for Dummies " the night before .
Then there are The Career Amateurs who , having found success after that first contract ( read : taking the client 's money and not being sued for developing a useless product ) , actually manage to make a career out of repeating that experience .
And then there are The Complicators , the side that tempts the best of us to join their ranks , even if only for project or two .
There are some so deeply embedded within The Complicators , that they 've acquired a sort of sixth - sense : the ability to find meta- problems ( " a problem with the process of creating a solution for the actual problem " ) in virtually any solution .
As we 've all seen , the systems that these developers create often end up as a barely functional application comprised of a Matryoshka - doll - like nesting of problems and solutions .
Given the chance to solve problems outside of Information Technology , I 've often wondered how The Complicators might respond .
Fortunately , Mike has given us that opportunity ...
Mike 's corporate intranet hosts a message board where software developers throughout the company can ask for advice and share ideas with other developers .
Recently , one of the software architects from their East coast office submitted the following .
[ Off - Topic ] Bicycle Improvements
As I pedaled to work today , I thought to myself , why has n't anyone ever invented a bicycle with heated handlebar grips ?
These New England mornings can really make your knuckles suffer !
Has anyone seen or heard of something like this ?
The first response was another from a programmer in Mike 's division , who just happened to be responsible for one of the most confusing components in their application .
A quick Google search turned up nada , but I think it 's a fantastic idea .
Let 's build one !
I 've already got a preliminary design in mind : attach a dynamo to the pedals , run some wires through the frame , and add a mesh on the grips .
That response really got the ball rolling .
Certain developers from different departments chimed in , suggesting improvements ranging from a battery backup to an extra dynamo on the front tire for use only when coasting .
After lunch , the discussion turned into a " simpler " and more " reusable " approach :
That 's brilliant : we can reuse body heat more efficiently !
This way , the system could be used when walking / jogging as well .
We 'd simply use a thin inner-jacket ( like a wind breaker ) and run some flexible tubes from the tip of the sleeves to the midriff ( which never seems to get cold ) .
There 'd be valved inlet and outlet water connectors at the sleeves to distribute the warmed water to the hands via a fine mesh of smaller tubes .
The water would circulate due to the one - way valves and compressions of the device caused by walking / cycling movements .
If necessary , we could add the battery / dynamo - powered heater for extra warming of the water .
Obviously , that 'd be bicycle - specific , though .
Luckily , Mike 's company has at least one sensible developer within their ranks who chimed in anonymously on the discussion .
This has to be the most idiotic discussion I 've read since ... well ... last week , when you were discussing the architecture for the UND component .
The reason that this " hand warming system " does not exist is because most people have found a pair of gloves to be a perfectly suitable way for keeping one 's hands warm .
Unfortunately for us ( I would have liked to see a diagram myself ) , that last reply effectively ended the " hand warming system " discussion .
But I will leave you with this bit of advice : the next time you find yourself designing software , be wary of The Complicators ; take a good , hard look at your first revision and just say to yourself , " gloves . "
UPDATE : Reader " sir_flexalot " created a fun ( de ) motivator ...
Goldman 's Arjun Murti was the most prescient of all oil analysts when it came to predicting the super - spike .
He sent the markets flying earlier in the year with his $ 150 - $ 200 6 - 24 month target .
When oil hit $ 147 , he was vindicated .
For a while .
And now Murti is doubling down .
He says increased Chinese demand will trump any temporary respite from a global economic slowdown , sending oil right back to record prices by the end of the year :
We continue to expect that strong Chinese buying will return to the market as China restocks after the Games ... For oil we continue to believe this will require ( West Texas intermediate ) crude oil prices to move back to $ 149 / barrel by year end .

Instead Of Canceling The Debate . . .
as John McCain has proposed , why not have a discussion about the Wall Street credit / mortgage crisis instead ?
John McCain can discuss what he thinks is important about it and what we should do about it and Obama can do the same .
If they happen to agree on the issue , so much for the better .
When the two people from which our next President will be chosen agree on a solution , then that will be the plan to follow , since one of them will have to live with it come next January 20 .
Let 's not run away from the issue Senator McCain , let 's discuss it for the sake of the American People .
Barack Obama should offer this change to John McCain , for the sake of the country .
Greg Sargent agrees with me : " Obama will make a public statement on this shortly -- it'll be interesting to see if Obama calls on McCain to do the debate on other terms .
For instance , he could invite McCain to make the debate about the economy , rather than about national security . "
( Emphasis supplied . )
By Big Tent Democrat , speaking for me only
At long last , John McCain and Barack Obama can pantomime lightsaber duels or get their Numa Numa on like any other red-blooded American .
In a move that a spokesperson for Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) called " a major step into the future , " the Senate Rules and Administration Committee has deigned to permit links to third - party sites like YouTube and Flickr from Senators ' official pages .
Roll Call reports that the change was made last week , ending the oft - ignored ban , but preserving general rules against using official resources for either commercial or partisan political purposes .
The details will presumably need working out as , for instance , an embedded YouTube video will typically display a list of " related " videos after it ends , over which members of Congress would have little control .
The restrictions on third - party sites first became controversial this summer — due in large measure , appropriately enough , to a congressman 's Twitter message .
Rep. John Culbertson ( R - TX ) blasted the regulations as censorship , declaring in one micropost : " Before I could post a Tweet I would have to get approval of the twits that run the House ! "
The Sunlight Foundation , which hailed last week 's rules change as a victory for more open government , even launched a " Let Our Congress Tweet " campaign .
Culbertson was referring to a House proposal , implicitly rejected by the new Senate rules , to loosen the existing restrictions by creating a whitelist of sites legislators could link freely .
The Rules Committee will still retain such a list for advisory purposes , but Senators would not be limited to approved sites .
It remains to be seen whether the House will follow suit .
Perhaps , under the new rules , John McCain can make Friday 's presidential debate after all , even while rushing back to Washington in hopes of pushing through Wall Street bailout legislation .
He 'll just have to limit his responses to 140 characters .
Motorists got a rude shock this morning when they pulled into gas stations to fill 'er up : a massive overnight hike sent the average price at GTA pumps to $ 1.36.6 .
The increase – 12.9 cents a litre , and more outside the GTA – is one of the highest single - step price hikes in recent memory , blamed by oil refiners on supply uncertainties posed by Hurricane Ike as it rampages across the Gulf of Mexico .
" Canadians are going to get a sock in the chin , " said Liberal MP Dan McTeague , who has built up a reputation for forecasting gas price hikes .
McTeague said he expected an average price of around $ 1.36.6 in the GTA today - adding that 's much better than Vancouver , where prices are expected to soar above $ 1.46 .
Montreal prices jumped about a dime to $ 1.38 a litre .
Halifax prices were up to about $ 1.33 a litre .
McTeague issued a warning of the huge increase late yesterday afternoon and motorists flocked to filling stations last night , when the prices were around $ 1.23 for a litre .
In Mississauga , drivers lining up for gas backed up major roadways , including the intersection at Mavis and Burnhamthorpe Rds. , where there are two stations .
Whitby resident Don Dutton said the situation was " just crazy " east of Toronto .
" It was probably eight to 10 minutes getting into the pump , " he said .
" Getting in and out , people were sort of pushing and jockeying . "
Mearey Russell waited 15 minutes to get into an Esso at Yonge St. and Steeles Ave. W. only to find her pump had run out of gas .
And there were stations that did n't wait until midnight .
At 8:10 p.m. , a TorontoGasPrices.com user reported seeing regular gas at $ 1.37.0 , at Woodbine and 14th Aves. in Markham .
GasBuddy.com , which monitors North American fuel prices , said the average price Friday in Canada was nearly $ 1.33 a litre , compared with $ 1.05 a litre a year ago .
The effect of the overnight price hikes was n't expected to be uniform across the country , primarily due to provincial taxes .
McTeague said he expected Ottawa would likely be the least hit , predicting pump prices there of about $ 1.32 a litre .
The jump in price is being blamed on Hurricane Ike , which is expected to make landfall somewhere along the U.S. Gulf Coast as a Category 3 hurricane later this evening or early tomorrow morning .
McTeague said that crude jumped to $ 147 a barrel on July 11 , resulting in the average price of gas going up to $ 1.36.4 in the GTA .
But in this case , he said , there 's no correlation between the price of crude and the jump in prices .
Yesterday , OPEC reported that the price per barrel of oil had dropped to $ 96.80 ( U.S. ) , he said , yet motorists were still paying more than the $ 1 a litre they should have been paying .
After Hurricane Katrina hit in August 2005 , prices went up about 16 cents per litre , he said .
But that increase came after Katrina hit , while this hike came in anticipation of Ike , " without evidence of any damage . "
But if Ike leaves behind a trail of chaos , McTeague said , worse may be in store .
" They 've already been ramping up the price , " he said .
" If this hurricane does the devastation anywhere similar to Katrina as far as the refineries and gas production is concerned , it 'll be a lot worse . "

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The unemployment rate soared to a nearly five - year high in August as employers trimmed jobs for the eighth straight month , the government reported Friday .
The unemployment rate rose to 6.1 % , the highest level since September 2003 .
That 's up from 5.7 % in July and 4.7 % a year ago .
In addition , the economy suffered a net loss of 84,000 jobs in August , according to the U.S. Department of Labor , compared to a revised reading of a 60,000 job loss in July .
The U.S. economy has lost 605,000 jobs so far this year .
The jobs report immediately drew comment from the presidential candidates as well as the Bush administration .
The White House pointed to other economic readings , including last week 's gross domestic product report .
It showed second quarter growth jumping to a 3.3 % annual rate , helped by economic stimulus checks and strong exports .
" While these ( jobs ) numbers are disappointing , what is most important is the overall direction the economy is headed , " said the White House statement .
But the campaign of Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama said the report points out the failure of Republican policies .
" John McCain showed last night that he is intent on continuing the economic policies that just this year have caused the American economy to lose 605,000 jobs , " Obama said in a statement .
" John McCain 's answer is more of the same : $ 200 billion in tax cuts to big corporations and oil companies , and not one dime of tax relief to more than 100 million middle - class families . "
The McCain campaign argued that Obama 's economic policies would cause more job losses in the future .
" Sadly there are those who believe that to grow this economy we must raise taxes , impose costly new mandates and isolate America from the global economy , " McCain said in a statement .
" When our economy is hurting , the last thing we should do is raise taxes as Barack Obama plans to do and has done . "
Job losses widespread
Both numbers in the August report surprised experts .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com had forecast the unemployment rate would remain unchanged from the July reading and that payrolls would fall by 75,000 jobs .
Manufacturing lost 61,000 jobs , while construction employment fell by 8,000 .
But the job losses were widespread and went beyond those two troubled sectors .
Retailers trimmed 20,000 jobs despite the back - to - school shopping season , which for many stores is typically second in sales only to the holiday period .
Business and professional services - a broad category that includes industries such as accountants , consultants and legal services - lost 53,000 workers .
Leisure and hospitality cut 4,000 jobs .
The few sectors showing gains were government as well as education and health services , which gained 72,000 between them to temper the losses elsewhere .
" Job losses are still mild by recession standards , but the losses are relentless and they are accumulating , " said Bob Brusca of FAO Economics .
" If job growth had paced with population growth during this year , it would have meant 1.3 million new jobs would have been created .
Instead 605,000 were lost .
That means about 2 million fewer people are working than if the economy were on a steady path .
And that 's a big number . "
But while economists generally study the payroll numbers most closely , it 's the unemployment rate that registers with most Americans when they think about the labor market .
Unemployment worries could feed job losses
The jump is likely to be a new blow to consumer confidence , which had just started to show gains from earlier lows due to declining gasoline prices .
Confidence could also be hurt by another report Friday from the Mortgage Bankers Association showing a record 1.2 million home foreclosures during the second quarter .
And falling consumer confidence could put a brake on spending and in turn drag down the economy .
" If consumer spending does n't hang in there in the fourth quarter , we 're of course going to have a higher unemployment rate and maybe more than the 50,000 to 75,000 monthly job losses we 've been seeing , " said Tig Gilliam , chief executive of Adecco Group North America , a unit of the world 's largest employment firm .
Mark Vitner , chief economist at Wachovia , said that the unemployment rate might have been lifted higher an extension of long - term unemployment benefits that took effect in July .
Some discouraged job seekers who had been out of work more than 26 weeks may have looked for work again in the month in order to collect the benefits once again .
But Vitner said even without that impact , unemployment probably would have jumped to about 5.9 % .
And recent filings for initial jobless benefits by the newly unemployed is now running at more than 400,000 a week , a level typically associated with a recession .
" You do n't have to be an economist to know the economy is weak right now , " Vitner said .
" Obviously there 's some real pain out there . "
Gilliam and many economists had been expecting the unemployment rate would hit 6 % late this year or early next year .
" I 'm not forecasting 7 % unemployment , but we 're weighing what 6 % unemployment now means going forward , " Gilliam said .
Woes beyond unemployment rate
The unemployment rate does n't tell the whole picture about how difficult the job market has become .
It only counts those who looked for work during the month ; it excludes the unemployed who want jobs but have stopped looking for work .
And it also does n't count those who want full - time jobs but can only find part - time positions .
The so - called underemployment rate , which includes those two other groups , rose to 10.7 % - the highest reading since 1994 .
The pain was widespread in different sectors of the work force .
Those with college degrees were better off than the population as a whole .
But the number of educated workers without jobs jumped 15 % in the month to 1.2 million , the third highest total since the Department of Labor started tracking that number in 1992 .
Despite the widespread weakness in the report , wages actually edged up faster than expected .
The average hourly wage was up 7 cents in the month to $ 18.14 .
The previous month 's rise was also revised slightly higher .
Still , the average hourly wages have only increased 3.6 % in the last 12 months , well below the 5.6 % rise in prices shown in the July Consumer Price Index .
That means the typical worker 's wages are not keeping up with prices .
The Federal Reserve 's most recent economic forecasts had projected annual unemployment in the range of 5.5 % to 5.7 % this year , and between 5.3 % and 5.8 % next year .
Even its worst case scenario put the upper end of the unemployment range at 5.8 % this year and 6.1 % next year .
The consensus is that the Fed will leave its key overnight lending rate , it 's primary tool for spurring economic growth , unchanged through the end of the year .
Some policymakers at the central bank have been pushing for higher rates to fight inflation .
Many observers expect that the Fed 's next change will be higher .

Could you imagine ?
Starts off slowly and you got about 5 seconds to get out of the way before it picks up speed .
All that rubbish and debris would just chop and grind you up in no time at all !
That would be one of the worst ways to go I think ?

Advertisement US Republican presidential hopeful John McCain has picked Sarah Palin , the governor of Alaska , as his surprise running mate .
At 44 , she is three years younger than Barack Obama and is credited with reforms during her first term , but she is relatively unknown in US politics .
Mr McCain appeared with her on stage at a lively rally in Dayton , Ohio .
Analysts say Mrs Palin was chosen to rejuvenate the campaign of Mr McCain , who is celebrating his 72nd birthday .
The announcement ended weeks of speculation about his potential choice , in which Mrs Palin was mentioned only as a long shot .
HAVE YOUR SAY I was leaning towards Obama but with this choice I think I 've changed my vote Tim , Stanford , USA Some commentators are calling Mr McCain 's running mate decision the strangest since Dan Quayle , George Bush Senior 's young and untested pick in 1988 .
The fact that she is a woman and a fresh face on the national scene is obviously a potential plus , bringing an excitement and newsworthiness to the Republican ticket , the BBC 's Justin Webb reports .
But her less than two years in office would undercut one of the McCain campaign 's central criticisms of his Democratic rival Barack Obama : that he is too inexperienced to be commander - in - chief .
The choice seems an audacious , perhaps slightly desperate , effort to bring youth and vigour to the Republican ticket , our North America editor adds .
Tribute to Hillary Clinton Speaking to a large crowd , who sang Happy Birthday when he appeared , Mr McCain introduced Mrs Palin as someone who " understands working people " .
SARAH PALIN Elected Alaska 's youngest and first woman governor in 2006 Grew up in Wasilla , near Anchorage , and was voted Miss Wasilla in 1984 Studied journalism and political science at University of Idaho
Is mother of five , including a son with Down 's syndrome Her husband Todd is an oil production operator Likes hunting and fishing
Profile : Sarah Palin
In pictures : McCain 's surprise pick Day at - a - glance " She 's got the grit , the integrity and commitment to the common good which are exactly what we need in Washington today , " he said .
" She 's exactly who I need , who this country needs , to help me fight to turn the same old Washington politics on its head . "
Thanking Mr McCain , Mrs Palin said she would be honoured to serve next to him .
She introduced her husband of 20 years and four of her five children .
A son who did not appear on stage is in the US Army and will be deployed to Iraq next month .
Speaking of her time in office in Alaska , she said she had " fought corruption " and sought to serve the people .
She paid tribute to other American women in politics , including Hillary Clinton , Mr Obama 's defeated Democratic rival .
" It was rightly noted in Denver last week that Hillary left 18 million cracks in the highest , hardest glass ceiling in America .
But it turns out the women of America are n't finished yet and we can shatter that glass ceiling once and for all , " she said .
Mrs Palin is the second female US vice - presidential candidate , with the first being Democrat Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 .
Analysts say Mrs Palin may have been chosen by the McCain campaign as a tactic to win over those Democratic women voters who were disappointed by the defeat of Mrs Clinton by Mr Obama .
Mr Obama and his running mate , Joe Biden , congratulated Mrs Palin on her nomination and said she would add a " compelling new voice " to the general election campaign .
" Her selection is yet another encouraging sign that old barriers are falling in our politics , " their joint statement said .
Sarah Palin now appears side by side with Mr McCain on his website A spokesman for the Obama campaign had earlier suggested Mr McCain 's choice was irresponsible , referring to Mrs Palin 's former role as mayor of the small Alaskan town of Wasilla .
" Today , John McCain put the former mayor of a town of 9,000 with zero foreign policy experience a heartbeat away from the presidency , " said spokesman Bill Burton .
President George W Bush welcomed Mrs Palin 's nomination , describing her as a " proven reformer " .
" Governor Palin 's success is due to her dedication to principle and her roll - up - your - sleeves work ethic and serves as a wonderful example of the spirit of America , " he said .
Anti-abortion Mrs Palin is seen as a strong conservative , fiscally and socially .
She also opposes abortion and her baby son has Down 's Syndrome .
Abortion has been a key issue cited by Republican voters who feel Mr McCain is not conservative enough .
Mrs Palin 's electoral chances may be harmed by the fact that she was placed under investigation in Alaska by state lawmakers at the end of July .
She sacked a public safety commissioner and the allegation is that she sacked him because he had not fired a state trooper who is Mrs Palin 's former brother - in - law , and who is in a custody battle with her sister .
She says she has " nothing to hide " and is " cool " about the investigation .

Best Places For Your Money When The Stock Market Tanks
Some of the best places to put your money during tough stock market periods .
Should I move my money to a high yield savings account ?
Are online bank accounts the best place for my savings right now ?
We ’re all probably thinking the same thing .
With money in the stock market , I ca n’t help but feel sorely tested by what ’s going on in the markets at the moment .
If you ’re jittery about the stock market these days , we ’re in the same boat .
We ’ve seen some of the bumpiest market sessions in recent history and I ’ve got whiplash just following the benchmark index numbers like the S&P 500 ( fell 4.7 percent in one week , gained it all back in one day ) .
I think we ’re far from having to hide our money “ under the mattress ” just yet , but as an exercise , I ’d like to canvas the various places where we can realistically keep our money during turbulent financial times .
Best Places To Keep Your Money During Stock Market Turmoil
# 1 Where it is right now
What does this mean ?
If you ’ve decided on a long - term investment strategy that includes equities , and have selected solid investments with fundamentally strong track records , then the emotionally charged stock market climate today should n’t sway you away from your current set up .
From my studies and personal experience , I ’ve found that the wrong time to make decisions is when emotions and worry run high .
As much as possible , avoid emotional decisions when it comes to money ; many have the effect of hampering your progress towards achieving your long - term financial goals .
# 2 In good solid mutual funds and stocks
Here ’s how I look at it : if you ’re going to participate in the market at all , the “ safest ” places for your money are in high quality stocks and funds .
If you own penny stocks , smaller stocks or more aggressive funds , you ’ll experience much greater volatility than the rest of the market .
So it may be wise to move away from the marginal stuff and into relatively more stable equities — particularly if you hold positions that do not fit your investment profile .
Also , if you ’ve got the extra cash , think about buying low — wait for the market to find its footing ( or form a bottom ) and add money into equities .
For those looking to begin investing , you can try out a solid mutual fund company like Vanguard or T. Rowe Price , or an online broker like TradeKing or Zecco , which have extremely low transaction fees .
For more details , you can read my review on the best online stock brokers for cheap stock trades .
# 3 In high yield savings accounts

# 4 In other types of cash accounts
You can always open CD accounts for your cash for that measure of safety .
Because your money is locked up for a bit of time in a CD account , you may want to purchase several CDs and ladder them to achieve some measure of liquidity if need be .
But if you ’re after pure liquidity and some relatively higher returns than regular savings accounts , then check out money market funds , which is the cash account type that I actually prefer ( for the most flexibility and the least fuss ) .
Our emergency fund is in a tax free money market fund .
The downside is that there is no insurance here if our money market fund “ breaks the buck ” ( we discuss “ breaking the buck ” in this article on Where To Put Your Cash ) .
# 5 Bonds
Bonds often move in a different direction than do stocks .
If you ’ve got some of your cash allocated to bonds , you ’re cushioning some of your portfolio ’s decline .
I ’ve mulled over how much I should put into bonds ; right now our bond allocation is sitting at around 7 % of our portfolio when it should really be more around 10 % .
Small though it may be , our bond allocation has helped dull the pain of the equity slump .
# 6 Diversifiers and hedging vehicles
I ’ve harped on this quite often : I ’d like to add more diversifiers to our portfolio .
These are the asset classes that help hedge our holdings and help add further stock market diversification .
If you ’ve got an equity - heavy portfolio , you may want to lighten it up a little by placing a portion of your cash into REITs , precious metals or commodities .
# 7 Some annuity products
This is something new we ’ve been investigating recently .
I know that annuities are well disliked by the financial community but some of your money may find shelter in these insurance products during turbulent economic periods .
Annuities have a less than favorable reputation for being so costly and inflexible .
However , there are some fairly decent products out there offered by insurance companies these days and they do n’t seem all that bad .
I ’ll talk about this more at a later time ( along with a new investment concept I came across : the S & P collar index ) , but the gist of this is that there are products that allow you to participate in the gains of the stock market while preventing you from loss of principal .
All with some built - in costs and loss of liquidity ( which is why , contrary to conventional financial wisdom , it may actually make sense to apply this to a retirement account ) .
Okay , smear away ! 😉
~ooOoo~
Parting Thoughts
I just want to emphasize that I ’m not a financial professional so please do n’t take my musings here as any kind of directive .
As a regular investor , I am always interested in sharing and gathering information about how best to weather investment periods like what we ’ve been experiencing so far , and I hope this article is one way to elicit information , discussion and ideas from others .
That said , the time to think about keeping your money safe is not when the stock market is dancing around like a drunken sailor .
Now is n’t the time to seek refuge for your money , unless you ’re desiring to escape from some questionable investments .
Realize that by the time you feel like you should do something drastic — maybe sell out of your positions — it may already be too late .
Reacting with emotions to the stock market is hardly ever the right move .
If you ’re in good investments that are unfortunately affected by the general mood of the market , then it ’s best to wait things out .
But if you decide ( or belatedly discover ) that certain investments are just not a fundamental fit in your portfolio , then you may want to cut your losses and consider this an expensive lesson .

More and more Native Alaskans are coming forward to tell about their direct experiences with Gov. Palin and her lack of regard for them .
Here is a letter I received today that speaks for itself …
An Alaska Native ’s take on his Governor
By Matt Gilbert
Hello .
My name is Matt Gilbert .
I am originally from Arctic Village , Alaska .
I am Alaska Native : Gwich ’in Athabascan .
I visited Sarah ’s campaign office and spoke with her before she became Governor .
We talked about the hunting & fishing rights of Alaska Natives .
We did n’t get anywhere .
She sided with sport & commercial interests , so I never spoke with her again .
I knew we ’d get no where .
She did n’t want to listen .
In general , I believe Sarah Palin is another version of Bush , just as inexperienced , but more impulsive .
She is very dangerous and scary .
People are continuing to support her because she ’s beautiful , and this should be a Red Alert for the world .
Her purposed policies is to include Georgia into NATO and that would mean all the European countries with all their armed forces will have to go to war with Russia .
So she ’s willing to ruffle the feathers of a country right next door to her home .
Is this who you want as President ?
You know the scene in the movies when a car or stage coach is about to go over a cliff and you see yourself sliding over ?
Scary image is n’t it ?
That ’s ’ what I ’m seeing if Palin gets elected Vice President .
Wake up America !
Send her back to Alaska .
She has plenty of un - finished work here .
She has n’t even gotten funding to move the town of Shishmeraf .
It ’s falling into the ocean from an eroding coast due to Global Warming , which she wants to fuel more by encouraging more coal and oil development .
She fuels the fire , and now they want her to do it on a national level .
Palin has done a lot of irrational things up here as Governor .
In the summer of 07 ’ , she Line Item Vetoed a lot of infrastructure projects in rural Alaska .
The small town of Eagle spent years trying to get a community center built when they finally got funding , Palin shut it down by her Veto .
Even Lawmakers are baffled by her Vetoes .
They ’ve had Bills well - debated on both sides of the aisle , yet she cuts , cuts , cuts .
She supported $ 15 million to Anchorage ’s University ’s Sport Complex and cut $ 1.5 million to an expansion of the runaway teen center .
How do you justify that ?
She supports drilling Off - Shore which would utterly destroy the livelihood of the Inupiaq people on the North Slope .
They rely on Whale for subsistence and the development would detrimentally impact those whales .
She supports drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge .
My people , the Gwich ’in have kept this area closed from development for 30 years .
No other American Indian tribe has ever accomplished such a feat .
If she drills in the Arctic Refuge , it ’ll be the end of my culture .
We rely on the Porcupine Caribou Herd and if drilling takes place in the Arctic Refuge , our caribou goes and so does our culture .
We Gwich ’in Athabascans are the last American Indian Tribe in the US that has n’t been majorly disturbed , heavily impacted , and assimilated .
We are the last pure Native American tribe left .
We are the last stand for Indian Country .
We are the last chapter in American Indian / Anglo American relations .
The prior chapters were bad , so make this last chapter a good one and vote for Obama .
Alaska Natives in general are the last group of Native Americans in the United States still depended on a hunting & fishing - based lifestyle where kids and grown - ups go out to fish and hunt to supplement their western diets .
It ’s crucial we have food off our land because the western foods , processed foods , give us diabetes if we eat them alone .
The subsistence foods not only feed our bodies , but our culture , spirit , social lives , and minds .
The Western World calls it Subsistence , but we call it our Way of Life .
I ’m using the word against my well .
It gives our lives meaning and keeps us busy .
With God ’s help , hopefully everyone can understand .
Our way of life off the land is everything to us .
If we do n’t have that we ’re nobody , just another group living off the grid , consuming McDonalds , and buying Brand - Named items .
We add diversity and richness to the world .
Sarah Palin does n’t care about this .
She would n’t care if our culture eroded before her eyes .
She ’s like Nero , sitting in Juneau putting on lip - gloss as Alaskan villages suffer .
We ’re suffering from fuel costs .
We ’re suffering from strangulating Fish & wildlife regulations that keep us from surviving off the already scarce wildlife .
She has done some things , but not enough .
She can ease the Fish & wildlife regulations in order to improve food security in the villages .
She can subsidize the villages with the rising fuel costs .
The US Government has a Trust Responsibility with its First Americans , the TR requires the Federal / State Governments to ensure we , Alaska Natives , have everything we need to survive .
Mrs. Palin has failed miserably at this task .
She has a lot more work to do back home .
Her hometown Wasillia has been a hot - bed for racist and Anti-Native attitudes .
Anchorage is bad too .
Alaska Natives fight discrimination on a daily basis there .
Palin is n’t there for them .
I read in the Anchorage papers once that a homeless native man froze to death in downtown and some man called it in sounding all casual about it .
It ’s like the South before the 60s up here .
It ’s bad .
This is the Alaska Sarah Palin maintains and waters for growth .
She ’s never bothered to change anything because she thinks nothing is broken .
As Mayor , she did n’t think anything was wrong with an atmosphere where a native woman had beer bottles thrown at her as she walked down Wasillia .
So you have to ask yourself , if she ’s willing to ignore the plights and issues of an ethnic group within her town and state , than how much more horrible do you think it ’s going to be when she ignores the issues of that same ethnic group or another on a national level ?
I believe her popularity comes from her beauty .
This society has got to shift itself away from a National Inquirer - based lifestyle to an NPR or New York Times - based lifestyle .
Our very world may depend on it .
Our hurricanes and disasters are getting worse due to Global Warming , our Stock Market is dangerously shaky , our healthcare is getting so bad it may cause a revolution soon , and the War in Iraq is draining our resources and working families to depression - levels .
We need a Change !
We need Barack Obama .
Not somebody whose reputation is based mainly on image and charm .
As an Alaska Native , I see that she does n’t support our way of life , as a Gwich ’in I see that she is willing to end my culture and people for only six more months of oil , and as a Global citizen I see that she is impulsive and inexperienced .
Do you want someone like that in charge of a nuclear arsenal ?
It ’s probably already going to take our lifetimes to recover from Bush , if you elect Palin , the consequence are too scary for me to even think about .
Please vote for change .
Vote for Obama .
Vote for Obama .

The device allows relatively small solar cells to harness rays from a much larger area .
Mirrors that track the Sun are already used to deliver extra light onto solar panels and maximize their electricity output .
But these mirrors can be costly to deploy and maintain , and the solar cell is prone to overheating .
In the 1970s , scientists tried to develop alternatives that used light - absorbing dyes .
Plastic sheets impregnated with these dyes could capture photons and re-emit them at a lower energy .
These photons would then bounce along inside the plastic towards a collector at the end , allowing light gathered over a large area to be concentrated at the edges .
But the research stalled because many of the dyes were unstable in sunlight , or because the photons did n’t get very far through the plastic before being reabsorbed .
Researchers led by Marc Baldo at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge have now come up with an alternative that uses a mixture of dye molecules in a thin film coated onto glass .
Each dye absorbs light of a different wavelength to make the most of sunlight ’s spectrum .
By fine - tuning the dye mixture and adding an extra compound to control the re-emission process , ensuring that most of the photons get trapped inside the glass , the team thinks they can boost the power efficiency of a cadmium telluride cell from 9.6 % to 11.9 % , and a CIGS cell ( copper - indium - gallium - selenide materials ) from 13.1 % to 14.5 % .
The research is published this week in Science1 .
Baldo thinks that the efficiency can still be vastly improved .
" We could ultimately double the efficiency of 90 % of solar cells used today , " he predicts .
He also thinks that the system will be easy to commercialize .
" It looks very practical to make , " he says .
Solar cells are very sensitive to defects in the material , but that does n’t apply for these thin films , says Baldo .
That means it could help solar cells to produce electricity at a mere US $ 1 per watt , which is essential if the solar industry is to be economically sustainable .
Stiff competition
Lawrence Gasman , principal analyst at the market - research company NanoMarkets of Glen Allen in Virginia , is impressed that Baldo ’s system seems to be so easy to manufacture , and says that commercial interest in innovations such as these is blooming .
But dye - based systems still face stiff competition from more conventional concentrators .
In May , IBM claimed to have used mirrors to concentrate 230 watts of the Sun ’s power onto 1 square centimetre of solar cell .
Supratik Guha , who leads IBM ’s photovoltaics team , points out that this is a much higher concentration than would be possible with Baldo ’s dyes .
And Eli Yablonovitch , from the University of California , Berkeley , who looked at the theory of light concentration by dyes back in the 1980s2 , is unconvinced that the system will be commercially viable .
Baldo ’s system absorbs just 80 % of photons , he points out , which is n’t good enough .
" The problem with the concept is that 20 % of the photons escape back into the air .
This is fatal for commercial applications , in which efficiency is king , " says Yablonovitch .
" Considering the competitive environment in which solar energy finds itself , giving up that much light is intolerable . "
Jonathan Mapel , part of Baldo ’s research team , disagrees : " That 20 % off the top is n’t necessarily fatal , " he says , predicting that a solar concentrator based on this technology could be available in three years .
US disregarded experts over biolab Associated Press
Published : Monday August 11 , 2008
Print This Email This The Homeland Security Department swept aside evaluations of government experts and named Mississippi - home to powerful U.S. lawmakers with sway over the agency - as a top location for a new $ 451 million , national laboratory to study some of the world 's most virulent biological threats , according to internal documents obtained by The Associated Press .
Mississippi's lawmakers include the Democratic chairman of the department 's oversight committee in the House and the senior Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee , which is expected to approve money to build the National Bio and Agro - Defense Facility at one of five sites being considered .
The two lawmakers said they were unaware of the Homeland Security evaluation system that scored the Mississippi site so low .
The disclosure is the latest example of what critics assert is the Bush administration 's politicizing of government decisions , such as efforts to steer science over global warming at the Environmental Protection Agency and hiring and firing practices at the Justice Department .
" It is very suspicious , " said Irwin Goldman of the University of Wisconsin , a leader of the unsuccessful effort to build the lab in Madison .
His community 's offer was among nine sites rejected even though the government scored it more highly than Mississippi's .
" We wondered how everybody else did .
It 's interesting to know that we came out ahead of one that was short - listed . "
The states where locations were eliminated despite earning scores higher than Mississippi include California , Georgia , Maryland , Missouri , Texas and Wisconsin .
Government experts originally expressed concerns that the proposed site in Flora , Miss. , was far from existing biodefense research programs and lacked ready access to workers already familiar with highly contagious animal and human diseases , such as foot - and - mouth virus , that could devastate the U.S. livestock industry .
They assigned the site a score that ranked it 14th among 17 candidate sites in the United States .
But a senior Homeland Security official , Undersecretary Jay Cohen , overruled those concerns under the theory that skilled researchers would move to Mississippi if it were selected for the new lab , according to a July 2007 internal government memorandum , marked " sensitive information " and obtained by the AP .
Cohen accepted the argument that , " When built , they come . "
A former Navy officer , Cohen is a political appointee , nominated by President Bush in June 2006 .
For Wisconsin , Cohen determined that community opposition to the new lab was too great despite the area 's highly respected researchers .
Some local officials had threatened to withhold sewer service from the lab .
" It raised my eyebrows a bit when Mississippi was selected , " said George Stewart of the University of Missouri , another rejected location that also earned a score higher than Mississippi's .
" Obviously , there were factors other than what they were looking in the site visits .
The group that did the site visits were scientists and know what they were looking for .
I do n't know what DHS was looking for . "
Stephen Schimpff , who led unsuccessful efforts to bring the lab to Beltsville , Md. , complained that the government 's analysis seemed confusing .
The department said there were too many skilled researchers near Beltsville , just outside Washington , and the agency worried about competing to hire them .
" We were surprised when some of the things we felt were our strengths were turned back on us as weaknesses , " Schimpff said .
Under the department 's own rules , it was free to disregard the recommendations of the government experts it appointed .
But it said it selected advisers who were experts and were screened carefully for any conflicts of interest , working through seven stages of recommendations over 18 months .
Cohen personally made the choices for the five sites in the eighth and final stage of the decision .
Mississippi's lawmakers include Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , and Sen. Thad Cochran , the top Republican on the Senate Appropriations Committee and the subcommittee that oversees Homeland Security money .
Each said he was not aware of the department 's deliberations .
Thompson said he never spoke about the subject with Cohen .
But the department said Thompson met with Cohen at least twice and discussed plans for the new lab , once in February 2007 in Mississippi and again a year later in Washington .
" You told me more about the process than I know , " Thompson told the AP .
" I have n't talked to anyone about it , not to Jay Cohen or anyone . "
Flora , Miss. , is not in Thompson 's congressional district .
But the consortium of public and private organizations working to attract the lab includes Tougaloo College , where Thompson received his bachelor 's degree , and Jackson State University , where he was awarded his master 's degree .
A spokeswoman for Cochran , Margaret McPhillips , denied that the department relied on the scoring system described in the documents obtained by the AP .
She dismissed it as rumor .
" Our congressional delegation does n't know about a scoring system , " McPhillips wrote in an e-mail to the AP .
" Mississippi 's governor does not know of one .
DHS is in Mississippi right now for a site visit and just confirmed with us that there is no scoring system .
" Mississippi has put forth a compelling application and it does not surprise me that someone might be trying to diminish the strength of our proposal by spreading this rumor , " McPhillips wrote .
Some lawmakers already skeptical over the department 's plans said Cohen 's intervention on behalf of Mississippi appears improper .
" It appears that the undersecretary responsible for this program may have corrupted the site selection process by putting his thumb on the scale in favor of a particular site and its contractor , in violation of his own rules and over the objections of his own advisers , " said Rep. John Dingell , D - Mich .
" This raises the question of whether DHS is interested in bioresearch or just shameless empire building . "
Dingell , chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee , held oversight hearings in May examining the risks of building the new lab on the U.S. mainland near livestock herds .
The facility would replace an existing 24 - acre research complex on isolated Plum Island , about 100 miles northeast of New York City in the Long Island Sound .
Besides foot - and - mouth disease , researchers also would study African swine fever , Japanese encephalitis , Rift Valley fever and the Hendra and Nipah viruses .
Construction would begin in 2010 and take four years .
" If any of the five finalists scored lower than those eliminated from the process , we 've got a big problem on our hands , " said Sen.
Claire McCaskill , D - Mo .
Her state 's proposal also scored higher than Mississippi's , but Homeland Security rejected it over " growing negative community feedback . "
In his memo , Cohen acknowledged the government evaluation committees graded Mississippi 's site as merely " satisfactory " with scores of 72 and 75 in its research and work force categories , respectively .
The Mississippi site 's overall grade was 81 , or " very good , " which still was lower than nine other rejected U.S. sites .
" While I take the committees ' concerns to heart , I do not concur with the low scores , " Cohen wrote .
A department spokeswoman , Amy Kudwa , said the agency 's internal committee reviews " did not appropriately consider the unique contributions certain consortia committed to make in their proposals . "
Mississippi , for example , promised to work closely with Battelle Memorial Institute , a Homeland Security contractor that already manages some national labs elsewhere for the Homeland Security and Energy departments .
Besides Flora , Miss. , the U.S. locations under consideration for the new lab are Athens , Ga. ; Manhattan , Kan. ; Butner , N.C. ; and San Antonio .
The nine sites rejected as finalists that also earned high scores than Mississippi 's location were : Leavenworth , Kan. ; a different location in Athens , Ga. ; two other sites in San Antonio ; the University of Missouri in Columbia , Mo. ; Beltsville ; College Station , Texas ; Madison ; and Tracy , Calif. , near the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory .
I 've been hacking on some Perl code that extracts data that comes from web users around the world and been stored into MySQL ( with no real encoding information , of course ) .
My goal it to generate well - formed , valid XML that can be read by another tool .
Now I 'll be the first to admit that I never really took the time to like , understand , or pay much attention to all the changes in Perl 's character and byte handling over the years .
I 'm one of those developers that , I suspect , is representative of the majority ( at least in this self - centered country ) .
I think it 's all stupid and complicated and should Just Work ... somehow .
But at the same time I know it 's not .
Anyway , after importing lots of data I came across my first bug .
Well , okay ... not my first bug .
My first bug related to this encoding stuff .
The XML parser on the receiving end raised hell about some weird characters coming in .
Oh , crap .
That 's right .
This is the big bad Internet and I forgot to do anything to scrub the data so that it'd look like the sort of thing you can cram into XML and expect to maybe work .
A little searching around managed to jog my memory and I updated my code to include something like this :
use Encode ; ... my $ data = Encode : : decode ( ' utf8 ' , $ row - >{' Stuff'} ) ;
And all was well for quite some time .
I got a lot farther with that until this weekend when Perl itself began to blow up on me , throwing fatal exceptions like this :
Malformed UTF - 8 character ( fatal ) ...
My first reaction , like yours probably , was WTF ?!?!
How on god 's green earth is this a FATAL error ?
After much swearing , a Twitter plea , and some reading ( thanks Twitter world ! ) , I came across a section of the Encode manual page from Perl .
I 'm going to quote from it a fair amount here because I know you 're as lazy as I am and wo n't go read it if I just link here .
The relevant section is at the very end ( just before SEE ALSO ) and titled UTF - 8 vs. utf8 .
.... We now view strings not as sequences of bytes , but as sequences of numbers in the range 0 ..
2**32‐1 ( or in the case of 64 ‐ bit computers , 0 .. 2**64‐1 ) ‐‐ Programming Perl , 3rd ed .
That has been the perl�s notion of UTF −8 but official UTF −8 is more strict ;
Its ranges is much narrower ( 0 .. 10 FFFF ) , some sequences are not allowed ( i.e .
Those used in the surrogate pair , 0xFFFE , et al ) .
Now that is overruled by Larry Wall himself .

Do you copy ?
As of Perl 5.8.7 , UTF −8 means strict , official UTF −8 while utf8 means liberal , lax , version thereof .
And Encode version 2.10 or later thus groks the difference between " UTF − 8 " and " utf8 " . encode ( " utf8 " , " \x{FFFF_FFFF} " , 1 ) ; # okay encode ( " UTF‐8 " , " \x{FFFF_FFFF} " , 1 ) ; # croaks " UTF − 8 " in Encode is actually a canonical name for " utf−8 −strict " .
Yes , the hyphen between " UTF " and " 8 " is important .
Without it Encode goes " liberal " find_encoding ( " UTF ‐8 " ) ‐> name # is �utf ‐8 ‐strict� find_encoding ( " utf ‐8 " ) ‐> name # ditto. names are case insensitive find_encoding ( " utf8 " ) ‐> name # ditto . " _ " are treated as " ‐ " find_encoding ( " UTF8 " ) ‐> name # is �utf8 � .
Got all that ?
The sound you heard last night was me banging my head on a desk .
Repeatedly .
I mean , how could I have possibly noticed the massive difference between utf8 and UTF - 8 ?
Really .
I must have been on some serious crack .
Sigh !
Needless to say my code now looks more like this :
use Encode ; ... my $ data = Encode : : decode ( ' UTF - 8 ' , $ row - >{' Stuff'} ) ; ## fuck !
Actually , I was kidding about the " fuck ! " I would n't swear in code .

After a hefty long debate over offshore drilling and new energy policies , the House passed the ever unpopular Comprehensive American Energy Security & Consumer Protection Act .
The bill which will open up new areas of the country to oil drilling , but it also comes with increased support for renewables .
The bill – weighing in at 290 pages ( PDF ) – was not formally introduced until 9:45 pm on Monday night , but Pelosi had released an outline of it early last week .
“ The energy bill puts us onto that path of independence by having a comprehensive legislation which is the result of a bipartisan compromise in favor of sweeping innovation solutions for America ’s energy future , ” said Pelosi in a press conference today .
“ It is imperative that we are energy independent , so we can enhance the prospect for a great future of renewables and creating good paying jobs . ”
The bill passed in the House by a vote of 236- 189 , with ten Republican ’s supporting the bill and thirteen Democrats opposing it .
It includes measures to “ extend the tax credits for renewables , curb energy speculation , establish a national renewable electricity standard , release 10 percent of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , repeal subsidies to oil companies , and force oil companies to explore on the land already under lease ( “ use it or lose it ” ) . ”
It also comes with provisions on efficiency and public transit .
And there are even incentives for “ clean coal . ”
The act allows drilling 100 miles off the Atlantic coast and Florida ’s Gulf coast , but that buffer zone could be reduced if a state ’s government allows .
It will also let state ’s decide on whether or not to permit oil - shale development on federal lands within their borders .
Here are some videos from the floor debate :
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/ER5UdmBPwQA&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1]
Rep .
Markey : “ This is a very simple debate .
The Republicans are very upset that the Democrats are going to take the oil companies and make them pay taxes to the American people when they drill on the land owned by the American people …
Democrats are saying America needs an oil change . ”
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/uE2eqDmKQzU&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1]
Rep . Miller : “ Americans understand the problem :
Our nation is addicted to oil , we ’re paying record prices to heat and cool their homes and drive their cars and trucks , and global warming is a real , serious and growing problem .
Meanwhile , oil companies are making more money than ever before . ”
[ youtube=http://www.youtube.com/v/x65Ffavzgkg&color1=0xb1b1b1&color2=0xcfcfcf&hl=en&fs=1]
Rep . Inslee : “ If we were having this debate in the 1800 ’s , some people would be arguing we need to keep whale oil .
But we ’re in transition – now is a chance for America to revolutionize the world of clean energy . ”
Now it ’s the Senate ’s turn to vote , where even if such legislation does pass the White House has already threatened a veto .
“ These capitalists generally act harmoniously and in concert to fleece the people , and now that they have got into a quarrel with themselves , we are called upon to appropriate the people ’s money to settle the quarrel . ”
– Abraham Lincoln , speech to Illinois legislature , January 1837
In July , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said of his massive underwriting scheme for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , “ If you have a bazooka in your pocket and people know it , you probably wo n’t have to use it . ”
On September 7 , Paulson pulled out his bazooka and fired , effectively nationalizing the mortgage giants .
Last week , Paulson pulled out the bazooka again and held it to Congress ’s head .
“ Seven hundred billion dollars or your credit system will collapse ! ”
Seven hundred billion dollars is more than the country currently pays annually for Social Security ; and for what do we owe this ransom ?
To bail out bankers from their own folly in speculating in a giant derivative Ponzi scheme that is now imploding .
But policymakers justify rewarding the guilty parties at the expense of the taxpayers by arguing that “ we have to do it to save the banking system . ”
Abraham Lincoln was faced with a similar situation when he stepped into the Presidency in 1861 .
The country was suddenly in a civil war , and there was insufficient money to fund it .
The British bankers , knowing they had him over a barrel , agreed to lend him money only at 24 to 36 % interest , highly usurious rates that would have bankrupted the North .
Our fearless forefather said , “ Thanks but no thanks , I ’ll print my own . ”
Issuing the national currency is the sovereign right of governments .
A government does not need to borrow its national currency from bankers “ merely pretending to have money . ”
That was the phrase used by Thomas Jefferson when he realized the bankers ’ “ fractional reserve ” lending scheme meant that they were lending the same “ reserves ” many times over .
The federal dollars issued by Lincoln were called U.S. Notes or Greenbacks .
They allowed the North not only to win the Civil War but to create the greatest industrial giant the world had ever seen .
Lincoln ’s government launched the steel industry , created a continental railroad system , promoted a new era of farm machinery and cheap tools , established free higher education , provided government support to all branches of science , organized the Bureau of Mines , increased labor productivity by 50 to 75 percent .
The Greenback was not the only currency used to fund these achievements ; but they could not have been accomplished without it , and they could not have been accomplished on money borrowed at 30 % interest .
There are other historical examples .
In the 1930s , Australia and New Zealand avoided the Depression conditions suffered elsewhere by drawing on a national credit card issued by publicly - owned central banks .
The governments of the island states of Guernsey and Jersey have been issuing their own money for two centuries , creating thriving economies without carrying federal debt .
In none of these models has government - issued money created dangerous price inflation .
Price inflation results either when the supply of money goes up but the supply of goods does n’t , or when speculators crash currencies by massive short selling , as in those cases of Latin American hyperinflation when printing - press money was used to pay off foreign debt .
When new money is used to produce new goods and services , price inflation does not result because supply and demand rise together .
Prices increased during the American Civil War , but this was attributed to the scarcity of goods common in wartime .
War produces weapons rather than consumer goods .
Today in most countries , money is created privately by banks when they make loans ; but the banks create only the principal , not the interest necessary to pay the loans back .
The interest must be borrowed into existence , continually increasing the money supply , in a Ponzi scheme that has reached its mathematical limits .
The latest desperate proposal for propping up this collapsing system is to deliver $ 700 billion of taxpayer money to ex-Goldman Sachs CEO Henry Paulson to buy unmarketable derivative paper from the banks , shifting the loss on this dodgy paper from the banks to the taxpayers .
Seven hundred billion is just the opening figure ; losses on the imploding derivatives pyramid could wind up being in the trillions .
And where will this money come from ?
It will no doubt be borrowed into existence from the banking system .
We the people will be in the anomalous position of paying interest on a debt to the banks to bail out the banks !
At the very least , does n’t it seem that the banks should be paying interest on the $ 700 billion to us ?

When Sarah Palin was mayor of Wasilla , the city billed sexual assault victims and their insurance companies for the cost of rape kits and forensic examinations .
Palin had been in office for four years when the practice got the attention of state lawmakers in 2000 .
They passed a bill to stop it .
Former Democratic Rep. Eric Croft , who sponsored the bill , said he was disappointed that simply asking the Wasilla Police Department to stop had n’t worked .
The bill passed despite the objections of Wasilla Police Chief Charlie Fannon , who said it would require the city to come up with more money to cover the costs of buying the rape kits and conducting the exams .
Advertisement
Lawmakers became involved in 2000 after reports began coming in that police departments were charging sexual assault victims for the kits and exams , which cost between $ 300 and $ 1,200 at the time .
The kit , a package of sample containers , swabs and other medical supplies , is used to collect evidence from women after they are attacked .
Then - Gov. Tony Knowles said Thursday that Wasilla was unique in the state in charging rape victims for costs incurred by law enforcement in trying to solve the crime .
Maria Comella , a spokeswoman for the campaign of Palin and John McCain , said that Palin “ does not believe , nor has she ever believed , that rape victims should have to pay for an evidence - gathering test . ”
Nancy Pelosi is Privately Urging Charlie Rangel to Resign
Democrat Charlie Rangel who is chairman of the committee that writes the tax laws as been outed as a tax cheat and a fraud .
He needs to resign , if not from congress that at least his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee .
I think he should resign from both .
He is unfit to and undeserving of holding both his seat and his chairmanship .
There is no way that the Democrats will ever admit that Charlie Rangel needs to resign as a member of congress but what about his committee chair ?
Up until now Nancy Pelosi has resisted the calls for Rangel ’s resignation .
At least publicly .
Privately , however , it appears as though Nancy Pelosi is urging Charlie Rangel to resign from the Ways and Means Committee .
It is not surprising that Nancy Pelosi would have one position publicly and another privately .
It is n’t much different than Barack Obama publicly being for a troop withdrawal from Iraq even while in a private meeting with the Iraqi foreign minister he asked that troop withdrawals be delayed until after the election so that he could take credit for it .
But I digress .
It also appears that Rangel is beginning to feel some heat from other Democrats .
One member of the New York congressional delegation who supported Pelosi ’s decision said , “ You have to have one standard – you ca n’t have one for [ Republicans ] and one for us . ”
This person must be up for re-election and fearful of potential fall out from the Rangel scandal .
Never before have I heard a Democrat bemoan a double standard in the way Republicans and Democrats are treated when it comes to scandals .
Nancy Pelosi is still denying that she asked Rangel to step aside , probably so that he can save face by saying that he is stepping aside on his own for the good of the party .
Either way , he needs to resign .
In ancient Rome , during the time of Jesus , abortion was not only common but widely accepted .
There were , of course , opponents to abortion including both Christians and non-Christians .
Since abortion has been in practice dating back even to the Old Testament , we ca n’t say that it was n’t relevant during the times when scripture was written .
What then do we make of what the Bible says ?
The dividing line
People generally find themselves on either side of this topic .
Terms have been popularized by both sides to support their stance .
These terms include “ pro-family ” , “ pro-life ” and “ pro-choice ” .
Since not a single one of these is accurate , I ’ll omit them from this article .
What you ’ll find as you talk to people on either side is that the differentiating factor is the answer to the question , “ when does life start ? ” .
For the sake of this article we ’re going to assume that you believe life starts at conception .
There are scriptures used by both sides to support their views but we ’ll stick with the aforementioned assumption .
Because of that we find ourselves opposed to abortion .
The source of truth
Let ’s look to scripture to see what it has to say about abortion .
Psalm 139:13 - 16 is often used by those who oppose abortion and it says , “ For you created my inmost being ; you knit me together in my mother ’s womb .
I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made ; your works are wonderful , I know that full well .
My frame was not hidden from you when I was made in the secret place .
When I was woven together in the depths of the earth , your eyes saw my unformed body .
All the days ordained for me were written in your book before one of them came to be . ”
This verse is extrapolated to support the belief that life starts at conception by saying God knew you before you were formed in the womb .
On the contrary , proponents of abortion use Exodus 21:22 - 23 which says , “ And if men struggle with each other and strike a woman with child so that she has a miscarriage , yet there is no further injury , he shall surely be fined as the woman ’s husband may demand of him ; and he shall pay as the judges decide . ”
Since the penalty for murder is death and this verse mentions a mere fine for an abortion , this is used to say that God views an unborn child differently than He views a born child .
Though there are n’t many verses which speak specifically about abortion , it is clear that abortion is a sin .
Which is really all that matters for the rest of this article .
Since we made a compelling enough case that abortion is a sin we can move on to talk about why Jesus did n’t have much to say on the topic .
What did Jesus say ?
( WDJS ? )
In short , nothing .
Nothing specific anyway .
Why is that ?
Is it because abortion was not an issue at the time ?
No .
Is it because Jesus does n’t value life ( which starts at conception ) ?
No .
I never really thought about this question enough to really find out why Jesus does n’t talk about something which seems like a cornerstone issue .
Jesus did , after all , have a lot to say about the poor and the lost .
Of all the missions people have had throughout the course of history , Jesus ’ was by far the most important .
He did n’t have much time while he was here but in that time
He gave us the perfect example of godliness and righteousness .
He spent a great deal of His time in relationships with people as well as teaching those who followed him ( especially the disciples ) .
In his teachings were specific instructions on how we ought to live .
These instructions included what we ought to be passionate about , what we ought to do with our time , and how we ought to treat others .
Just because Jesus did n’t say much regarding a topic does n’t mean it ’s not important .
However ,
He does seem to draw a line to separate the things which are important from the only thing which matters .
Jesus ’ message was that we accept Him as our personal Lord and Savior , and that we tell others about Him .
Knowing that , can we understand why Jesus did n’t say anything about abortion ?
Yes , if we do n’t try to overcomplicate the gospel .
What about abortion ?
This is where I draw a conclusion .
Before I do that I would like to give some context as it relates to my personal views on abortion .
I ’ve always felt that abortion is wrong .
I ’ve even been quoted as saying it ’s one of the most important topics as it pertains to Christians .
I ’ve even voted for presidential candidates based on their views regarding abortion .
This was all before I began to question my own beliefs .
In doing so I came to have a much better understanding of God ’s desired relationship with us .
I have also , however , come to have a very confused understanding of the church here in the US .
I use the term church since it represents the body of believers .
The church can be wrong .
In fact , history shows that the church has made many mistakes .
But that ’s okay , it ’s what Jesus died for — our screw ups .
Christianity , however , cannot ever be wrong since it ’s rooted in the truth .
It ’s a shame that the church is often viewed as a representation of Christianity … we suck at that .
Oh yea , my conclusion .
It became very clear to me that Jesus was so passionate about saving souls that there were lots of sins which he did not spend a lot of time on .
In fact , the sins
He did spend a lot of time speaking about were the sins which could get in the way of someone coming to have a relationship with Him .
Should n’t we then also be so passionate about telling others about Jesus that the minor details do n’t consume us or our faith ?
Of course !
Do n’t get me wrong , abortion sucks .
But Jesus would have been more concerned about the mother , father , doctor and anyone else involved than the baby itself .
Why ?
Perhaps because the baby received salvation .
I do n’t know , but maybe it ’s also not for me to figure out .
It ’s my human nature and my emotion which causes me to have such passion against abortion .
It ’s not my faith , nor should it be yours .
We can all learn a thing or two from Jesus .

" Beginning Oct. 1 for 12 months , the 1st BCT will be under the day - to - day control of U.S. Army North , the Army service component of Northern Command , as an on - call federal response force for natural or manmade emergencies and disasters , including terrorist attacks .
It is not the first time an active - duty unit has been tapped to help at home . …
But this new mission marks the first time an active unit has been given a dedicated assignment to NorthCom , a joint command established in 2002 to provide command and control for federal homeland defense efforts and coordinate defense support of civil authorities .
After 1st BCT finishes its dwell - time mission , expectations are that another , as yet unnamed , active - duty brigade will take over and that the mission will be a permanent one .
The command is at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs , Colo. , but the soldiers with 1st BCT , who returned in April after 15 months in Iraq , will operate out of their home post at Fort Stewart , Ga. , … The 1st of the 3rd is still scheduled to deploy to either Iraq or Afghanistan in early 2010 , which means the soldiers will have been home a minimum of 20 months by the time they ship out .
In the meantime , they ’ll learn new skills , use some of the ones they acquired in the war zone and more than likely will not be shot at while doing any of it .

The BCT is an army combat unit designed to confront an enemy within a war theater .
With US forces overstretched in Iraq , why would the Pentagon decide to undertake this redeployment within the USA , barely one month before the presidential elections ?
The new mission of the 1st Brigade on US soil is to participate in " defense " efforts as well as provide " support to civilian authorities " .
What is significant in this redeployment of a US infantry unit is the presumption that North America could , in the case of a natgional emergency , constitute a " war theater " thereby justifying the deployment of combat units ..
The new skills to be imparted consists in training 1st BCT in repressing civil unrest , a task normally assumed by civilian law enforcement .
What we are dealing with is a militarization of civilian police activities in derogation of the Posse Comitatus Act .
The prevailing FISA emergency procedures envisage the enactment of martial law in the case of a terrorist attack .
The 1st BCT and other combat units would be called upon to perform specific military functions :
They may be called upon to help with civil unrest and crowd control or to deal with potentially horrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive , or CBRNE , attack .
Training for homeland scenarios has already begun at Fort Stewart and includes specialty tasks such as knowing how to use the “ jaws of life ” to extract a person from a mangled vehicle ; extra medical training for a CBRNE incident ; and working with U.S. Forestry Service experts on how to go in with chainsaws and cut and clear trees to clear a road or area .
The 1st BCT ’s soldiers also will learn how to use “ the first ever nonlethal package that the Army has fielded , ” 1st BCT commander Col .
Roger Cloutier said , referring to crowd and traffic control equipment and nonlethal weapons designed to subdue unruly or dangerous individuals without killing them .
“ It ’s a new modular package of nonlethal capabilities that they ’re fielding .
They ’ve been using pieces of it in Iraq , but this is the first time that these modules were consolidated and this package fielded , and because of this mission we ’re undertaking we were the first to get it . ”
The package includes equipment to stand up a hasty road block ; spike strips for slowing , stopping or controlling traffic ; shields and batons ; and , beanbag bullets .
Civil unrest resulting from from the financial meltdown is a distinct possibility , given the broad impacts of financial collapse on lifelong savings , pension funds , homeownership , etc .
The timing of this planned militarization is crucial : how will it affect the presidential elections scheduled for Tuesday November 4 .
The brigade in its domestic homeland activities will be designated as the Consequence Management Response Force ( CCMRF ) ( pronounced “ sea- smurf ” ) .
What " Consequences " are being envisaged ?
In a conference held under NorthCom last February , the mission of CCMRFF was defined as follows ;
" How to protect communities from terrorist and biological attacks topped the agenda last week for more than 100 service members and civilians gathered at Joint Task Force Civil Support headquarters at Fort Monroe , Va . The U.S. Northern Command Chemical , Biological , Radiological , Nuclear , and High - Yield Explosive Commanders ’ Conference , held Feb. 21 - 23 , brought JTF - CS subordinate task force and unit commanders here to discuss common concerns regarding operational requirements of the CBRNE Consequence Management mission and to begin preparations for Exercise Ardent Sentry 2007 .
“ We ’re giving operationally focused briefs to our CCMRF ( CBRNE Consequence Management Response Force ) units to help them prepare and successfully deploy for a CBRNE mission in the continental United States , its territories and possessions , ” said JTF - CS Current Operations Specialist Hawley Waterman , who helped organized the conference .
“ This is also an opportunity to get acquainted and establish better relationships with ( subordinate commanders ) . ” ( NorthCom , March 2007 )
What is envisaged is the possibility of a ( false flag ) terrorist attack on America , which could be used as a justification for retaliatory or preemptive military action overseas ( e.g. Iran ) as well actions on the domestic front .
The ultimate objective of this deployment of 1st BCT is to apply combat experience in the Homeland :
“ I ca n’t think of a more noble mission than this , ” said Cloutier , who took command in July .
“ We ’ve been all over the world during this time of conflict , but now our mission is to take care of citizens at home … and depending on where an event occurred , you ’re going home to take care of your home town , your loved ones . ”
While soldiers ’ combat training is applicable , he said , some nuances do n’t apply .
The operation officially has an emergency mandate to " help American citizens on American soil , to save lives , provide critical life support , help clear debris " , but it also implies the running of military style operations .
: in fact it would appear that the emergency tasks helping civilians is a cover-up .
This is a combat unit , which is trained and equipped to kill people :
Some brigade elements will be on call around the clock , during which time they ’ll do their regular marksmanship , gunnery and other deployment training .
That ’s because the unit will continue to train and reset for the next deployment , even as it serves in its CCMRF mission .
Should personnel be needed at an earthquake in California , for example , all or part of the brigade could be scrambled there , depending on the extent of the need and the specialties involved .
Other branches included
The active Army ’s new dwell - time mission is part of a NorthCom and DOD response package .
Active - duty soldiers will be part of a force that includes elements from other military branches and dedicated National Guard Weapons of Mass Destruction - Civil Support Teams .
A final mission rehearsal exercise is scheduled for mid-September at Fort Stewart and will be run by Joint Task Force Civil Support , a unit based out of Fort Monroe , Va. , that will coordinate and evaluate the interservice event .
In addition to 1st BCT , other Army units will take part in the two - week training exercise , including elements of the 1st Medical Brigade out of Fort Hood , Texas , and the 82nd Combat Aviation Brigade from Fort Bragg , N.C.
There also will be Air Force engineer and medical units , the Marine Corps Chemical , Biological Initial Reaction Force , a Navy weather team and members of the Defense Logistics Agency and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency .
One of the things Vogler said they ’ll be looking at is communications capabilities between the services .
“ It is a concern , and we ’re trying to check that and one of the ways we do that is by having these sorts of exercises .
Leading up to this , we are going to rehearse and set up some of the communications systems to make sure we have interoperability , ” he said .
A national emergency could be triggered .
" [ H] orrific scenarios such as massive poisoning and chaos in response to a chemical , biological , radiological , nuclear or high - yield explosive [ attack ] " or a so - called CBRNE type scenario .
One assumes that this is some form of domestic attack , allegedly by terrorists .
But at the same time , the Bush administration may be seeking a justification to establish martial law and intervene militarily within the USA .
“ I do n’t know what America ’s overall plan is — I just know that 24 hours a day , seven days a week , there are soldiers , sailors , airmen and Marines that are standing by to come and help if they ’re called , ” Cloutier said .
“ It makes me feel good as an American to know that my country has dedicated a force to come in and help the people at home . ”

Last month was the dullest August in Britain since records began in 1929 , with just 105.5 hours of sunshine over the entire month , officials said today .
That was far below the month 's average of 165 hours , the Met Office said , adding that August was also the fifth wettest on record with 139.8 millimetres of rain falling .
September offers a ray of hope for the Brits .

But things are looking brighter for the months ahead , said Met Office spokesman John Hammond .
" For autumn we are very much expecting temperatures to be above average and for the season itself to have below average rainfall , " he said .

For testosterone - driven sci-fi devotees in their 30s and early 40s , the universe changed about 15 minutes into 1983 ’s Return of the Jedi .
Until then , the Star Wars galaxy and , in most cases , our own lives , were blissful , asexual realms of brave adventures and weapon - wielding heroes threatened only by their assigned villains and ( if we were n’t careful ) " cooties " / " girl germs . "
Sure , Han Solo smooched Princess Leia a little inside that giant slug , but that ’s what heroes are supposed to do when there are no Sith Lords handy to battle .
Captain Kirk did the same thing with alien chicks to fight boredom when there were no Klingons to phaser .
But it was nothing we wanted to do .
Then , there was Jedi .
Tattooine .
Jabba the Hutt and his dark , foreboding palace .
Lando in hiding .
Chewbacca brought in as a prisoner by Princess Leia in disguise .
She managed to free Han from the carbonite , but ( of course ) she was captured .
She was only a girl , after all .
Only a girl .
Only a slave girl chained to Jabba ’s side .
A slave girl in that outfit .
For some boys , the sight of Leia lounging in that gear proved that they were officially amidst the asteroid collision called puberty .
" That ’s what Leia looked like under the thermal clothes of Hoth ?
She had abs ?
And breasts ? "
When she climbed the cannon atop Jabba ’s sail barge to let the desert winds blow her skirt aside , boys became men and were suddenly too uncomfortable to get up and get their Moms popcorn refills .
Professional belly dancer Amira Sa ’id turned those hot , sticky sci- fi memories into a cottage industry for herself .
Donning a precise replica of that Leia outfit , the dancer ( who goes by just her first name ) travels to conventions across the country to perform for enthusiastic fans who always wondered what Leia might have looked like shaking what her Padme gave her .
The Orlando , Florida - based Amira has been dancing since the age of 5 , taking all the basic classes like tap , ballet , etc .
She excelled in Irish folk dancing in her adolescence but had to put dancing aside to complete her college degree in physics .
But , there was no putting aside her lifelong love of science fiction and her frequent trips to various conventions around the country .
When she returned to performing following college and discovered a new affinity for Middle Eastern dance , it soon occurred to her that her various interests met within the gilded beauty of Princess Leia ’s slave girl get - up .
" I danced in the outfit for the very first time at a Halloween show at the restaurant I perform at here in Orlando , " Amira said .
" I then wore the costume to dance at a 2006 sci - fi convention in Connecticut .
It was hit . "
As Amira continued performing for ever - growing crowds of Star Wars and Star Trek fans at her beloved cons , YouTube videos of her performances ( like this one from Megacon 2007 , embedded ) began to circulate — building a little nerd buzz for the scantily clad nouveau celebrity .
She was in demand .
" At first I made my own appearances and booked myself , " Amira said .
" Now the conventions are booking me .
My dancing depends on what the convention wants .
Usually , I ’ll do a couple days of panels and performances . "
At Star Wars Celebration IV , Amira was named Lucasfilm ’s " official " slave Leia .
She also hosted her own booth at FanExpo 2008 to sign autographs and pose for photos : " We had a green screen set - up , so I could add a Star Wars background with my computer , print out the photo and sign it for the fans . "
Following the FanExpo , convention booker James Armstrong sent along to note to Amira : “ Thanks for putting on a great show !
Everyone loved it .
I know you have a lot of new fans . ”
" I taught the two dance panels at Celebration IV , " she said .
" I performed and got fans up onstage with me — teaching them choreography to ‘ The Cantina Song . ’ "
Nate Lesieur , anime fan and fellow con-goer , said he had the pleasure of meeting Amira — having danced with her several times , “ I first got on stage with her at an anime con in New Hampshire .
She ’s a really cool person to talk to . ”
( Watch Amira in a Leia versus Padme dance - off , embedded . )
All of this attention can spell trouble for a young woman dressed in a costume designed to tease the male eye .
It may come as a great shock to some readers , but male sci - fi fanatics are not always graceful around the opposite sex .
So , Amira must tread carefully lest a would - be Salacious Crumb try to chain her to his throne .
" Some of the coolest guys at the conventions bow to me , and others compliment me on my performance , " she said .
" But I have had some obsessed fans and some marriage proposals .
I ’ll receive gifts from strangers , and there are guys that wo n’t leave me alone . "
Amira utilizes bodyguards now — often recruiting honorable , upstanding members of various Stormtrooper divisions attending the cons .
Jim Tamblyn , a Stormtrooper in the Canadian Garrison of the 501st Legion , looked after Amira at the FanExpo .
“ I can honestly say ( working with Amira ) was the highlight of a great weekend , ” Tamblyn said .
“ She was amazing to work with , always smiling and happy , but still very professional .
There was a bond almost from the moment we met her and it only grew when we started to rehearse with her . ”
When not at conventions , Amira performs at conferences and restaurants around Orlando .
She ’s currently appearing in Disney ’s Indiana Jones Cairo Dinner Show at Disneyworld .
She also teaches dance for up - and - coming Leias .
But sci - fi man does not lust for Leia alone , and Amira added other routines to her arsenal , including a dance as a green Orion slave girl for Star Trek fans ( video embedded ) .
Enjoy , and may the gold bikini be with you .

I have to apologize for last week ’s post .
I ’m not apologizing for the subject matter ( the obsession that reigns supreme among some alt - med aficionados over “ cleansing ” their colons to “ purge toxins ” and achieve the super - regularity of several bowel movements a day ) .
Rather , I ’m sorry I probably did n’t emphasize quite strongly enough just how disgusting one of the links that I included was .
Among all the glowing testimonials found there touting how lovers of that “ clean feeling ” inside felt after having supposedly rid themselves of all that nasty fecal matter caked on the walls of their colons and achieved the Nirvana of many bowel movements a day ( or , as one happy customer put it , “ awesome adventures in the bathroom ” and another put it , “ I have not noticed anything really weird come out of me yet , but I am sure that there will be ” ) , there were also links to various pictures people took of their own poop , complete with graphic descriptions .
A couple of years ago when I showed an acquaintance of mine the Dr. Natura website shortly after I had discovered it , he declared it the “ grossest thing on the web . ”
Sadly , I had to assure him that it was not –not by a longshot .
However , I will try spare you any links to anything significantly grosser , preferring instead to leave finding them as an exercise for interested readers .
After having apologized for perhaps grossing out some of our readers , who come to this site for science - and evidence - based discussions of various so - called “ complementary and alternative medicine ” therapies , not pictures of the various excretions of the human body proudly lined up by the humans who produced them , I thought about what might be a suitable followup this week to such a topic .
There really is only one followup that ’s appropriate to this stuff , believe it or not .
The problem with which I wrestled is that it really is pretty much as disgusting as last week ’s topic , if not more so .
( You ’ll soon see why . )
So there I was , trapped on the horns of a dilemma .
Hesitating only momentarily , though , as any good general surgeon would do ( remember , before I specialized in breast cancer surgery I was a general surgeon , as prone to dive into big brown on the loose as any other general surgeon ) , I decided just to dive in to the topic as I would have in the old days dived into a particularly foul belly full of purulence , particularly since this week ’s “ CAM ” modality of choice claims to be able to take away a big chunk of the “ bread and butter ” practice of general surgery by curing a common surgical disease without all that nasty cutting , even if these days it ’s almost always done laparoscopically .
So , are you ready for liver flushes ?
Of course you are .
Do n’t you want a way to “ remove gallstones without surgery “ ?
Of course you do .
First off , so that I do n’t repeat the same mistake as last week , be advised that some of the links mentioned here will lead to some disgusting pictures , particularly things that people have fished out of their own feces , although not as disgusting as last week .
( Do n’t ask me why they spend so much time examining and picking through their own waste ; if I understood it , I probably would n’t be writing about it .
The fact that believers in this particular therapy are prone to straining through their stool looking for nuggets that prove the therapy “ works ” is , in fact , why some may consider this topic to be even more disgusting than last week ’s .
Click at your own peril . )
So , warning completed , what sorts of benefits can you expect from liver flushes ?
To answer that question , let ’s go to a woman who is the very embodiment of all that is bad about CAM in that she blames all cancer on a liver fluke ( hence her interest in “ flushing them out of the liver ) and claims to be able to cure virtually any disease , Hulda Clark , for some input , from her book , The Cure for All Diseases ( you did n’t believe me when I told you she claims to be able to cure virtually any disease , did you ? ) :
“ Cleansing the liver of gallstones dramatically improves digestion , which is the basis of your whole health .
You can expect your allergies to disappear , too , more with each cleanse you do !
Incredibly , it also eliminates shoulder , upper arm , and upper back pain .
You have more energy and increased sense of well being .
Pretty amazing , eh ?
I ca n’t figure out why such flushing would eliminate allergies or shoulder , arm , and back pain , but then I ’m not Hulda Clark .
I suppose her latter example might have been meant that it will get rid of the referred pain of gallbladder and other biliary disease , which is often perceived radiating to the right shoulder and upper back , but I suspect that might be attributing too much medical sophistication to someone who blames a liver fluke for all disease .
In any case , let ’s continue with her rationale for this particular form of “ therapy ” :
It is the job of the liver to make bile , 1 to 1.5 quarts in a day !
The liver is full of tubes ( biliary tubing ) that deliver the bile to one large tube ( the common bile duct ) .
The gallbladder is attached to the common bile duct and acts as a storage reservoir .
Eating fat or protein triggers the gallbladder to squeeze itself empty after about twenty minutes , and the stored bile finishes its trip down the common bile duct to the intestine .
For many persons , including children , the biliary tubing is choked with gallstones .
Some develop allergies or hives but some have no symptoms .
When the gallbladder is scanned or X - rayed nothing is seen .
Typically , they are not in the gallbladder .
Not only that , most are too small and not calcified , a prerequisite for visibility on an X -ray .
There are over half a dozen varieties of gallstones , most of which have cholesterol crystals in them .
They can be black , red , white , green or tan colored .
The green ones get their color from being coated with bile .
Notice in the picture ( pg. 545 ) how many have imbedded unidentified objects .
Are they fluke remains ?
[ Note : Your friendly neighborhood surgeon - blogger almost spit up his drink upon reading this question ; suffice it to say that , no , they are not fluke remains . ]
Notice how many are shaped like corks with longitudinal grooves below the tops .
We can visualize the blocked bile ducts from such shapes .
Other stones are composites - made of many smaller ones - showing that they regrouped in the bile ducts some time after the last cleanse .
Hulda ’s apparently never heard of ultrasound , which is very good at visualizing both gallbladder and liver stones .
If there were gallstones or liver stones there , ultrasound would almost certainly be able to detecit them in the vast majority of cases .
Certainly , ultrasound is also very good at detecting bile duct obstruction as well .
Best of all , it ’s a noninvasive , relatively inexpensive , and radiation - free test–just the sort of test that any CAM practitioner or patient should love !
And , in the uncommon cases where ultrasound fails , CT scans can often see biliary obstruction and stones .
Also , I do n’t know where Hulda got the idea that gallstones are common in children , but they are n’t .
I could quote epidemiology , but a less boring way is to have you just ask yourself :
How many children do you know or have you seen who have needed gallbladder surgery ?
Not very many .
How many adults , now ?
I will give Hulda credit for one thing , though .
She ’s correct that some cases of gallstones are completely asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic ( usually bloating or other vague GI symptoms ) .
And guess what ?
These days , we evil allopathic surgeons who are constantly castigated for “ medicalizing ” and “ overtreating ” everything generally do n’t recommend cholecystectomy just for the presence of stones .
If the stones are truly asymptomatic and only incidentally found on a study done for other reasons , we usually leave them alone , except sometimes in cases where a case of cholecystitis would be very dangerous , as in elderly diabetics or patients with other comorbidities .
We usually wait for symptoms to occur , and in an impressive percentage of cases they never do .
The stones remain asymptomatic , and the patient takes them to the grave .
In the case of vague symptoms that might or might not be attributable to gallstones ( a not uncommon clinical situation ) , before taking out his gallblader , we will tell the patient that , although his symptoms are probably due to gallstones , we ca n’t be absolutely certain that something else is n’t going on and we can’t guarantee that the surgery will relieve all his symptoms .
But I digress somewhat .
Let ’s get back to Hulda Clark ’s claims :
At the very center of each stone is found a clump of bacteria , according to scientists , suggesting a dead bit of parasite might have started the stone forming .
Wrong .
Most gallstones do not contain any such thing .
Gallstones and liver stones form when cholesterol and / or bile salts in the bile form tiny crystals , which then enlarge .
Most gallstones are cholesteral gallstones , and liver stones are much less common .
Not that that stops Hulda :
As the stones grow and become more numerous the back pressure on the liver causes it to make less bile .
Imagine the situation if your garden hose had marbles in it .
Much less water would flow , which in turn would decrease the ability of the hose to squirt out the marbles .
With gallstones , much less cholesterol leaves the body , and cholesterol levels rise .
Not quite .
In any case , if true obstruction were present and increasing the “ back pressure ” on the liver , it would be fairly straightforward to demonstrate by observing dilated biliary ducts in the liver on ultrasound .
As is the case with most tubular structures in the body ( small bowel , colon , bile ducts , ureters , etc. ) , when bile ducts are blocked , pressure behind the blockage causes them to dilate proximal to the cause of the obstruction , in the case of chronic obstruction quite impressively .
Distal to the obstruction they tend to be normal in caliber or even collapsed ( otherwise known as “ distal collapse ” ) .
That ’s how we figure out initially whether the obstruction is somewhere within the liver or if it ’s in the bile duct outside of the liver .
This part of surgery is not particularly complicated .
It ’s simple fluid dynamics , and that ’s how we can usually tell where an obstruction is .
It ai n’t rocket science , as they say .
So why do n’t we see dilated bile ducts in all of these patients complaining about “ liver stones ?
Hulda has an answer , of course :
Gallstones , being porous , can pick up all the bacteria , cysts , viruses and parasites that are passing through the liver .
In this way “ nests ” of infection are formed , forever supplying the body with fresh bacteria .
No stomach infection such as ulcers or intestinal bloating can be cured permanently without removing these gallstones from the liver .
The vast majority of stomach and duodenal ulcers are caused by H. pylori .
Is Hulda claiming that gallstones form a “ nest ” in which H. pylori dwell ?
On what evidence ?
None , of course .
Hulda ’s a bit different than most liver flushers , though , in that she emphasizes her all - powerful and all - explaining liver fluke as the cause of cancer and “ all disease . ”
She thus recommends the use of her “ zapper ” to “ kill parasites ” before doing a “ liver flush ” to flush them out .
Most practitioners selling liver “ cleanses ” emphasize their flushy goodness as a means of eliminating “ liver toxins ” ( whatever that means ) and “ stones ” :
The liver is the gateway to the body and in this chemical age its detoxification systems are easily overloaded .
Thousands of chemicals are added to food and over 700 have been identified in drinking water .
Plants are sprayed with toxic chemicals , animals are injected with potent hormones and antibiotics and a significant amount of our food is genetically engineered , processed , refined , frozen and cooked .
All this can lead to destruction of delicate vitamins and minerals , which are needed for the detoxification pathways in the liver .
The liver must try to cope with every toxic chemical in our environment , as well as damaged fats that are present in processed and fried foods .
So what , exactly , does a liver flush entail ?
Most liver flushes involve drinking large quantities of fruit juices of some kind , usually along with epsom salts and oils such as olive oil .
For example , here ’s one protocol found ( where else ? ) on CureZone that resembles many that I have seen :
Materials : 1 gallon apple juice ( freshly pressed ) 2 ounces orthophosphoric acid ( Phosfood from Standard Process or Ortho phos from Nutra - Dyn ) Enema bag and colon tube Coffee Epsom Salts Whipping cream and berries Olive oil Protocol :
Add one bottle ( 2 ounces ) of orthophosphoric acid to the gallon of apple juice .
Shake and refrigerate .
Over the next three to five days , drink the gallon of juice ( 3 to 4 8 - ounce glasses a day ) between meals .
Be sure to rinse your mouth out with baking soda and / or brush your teeth after drinking the juice to prevent the acid from damaging the teeth .
Eat normally during the liver flush .
On the day following whatever day you finish the gallon of juice , eat your normal breakfast and lunch .
Two hours after lunch , drink 1 - 2 tablespoons of Epsom Salts dissolved in warm water .
Four hours after lunch , do a one pint coffee enema .
Five hours after lunch , drink 1 tablespoon of Epsom Salts dissolved in warm water .
Six or seven hours after lunch , eat a dinner of heavy whipping cream and frozen or fresh berries – as much as desired .
At bedtime , drink 1/2 cup of olive oil .
A small amount of orange , grapefruit , or lemon juice may be added if desired .
Immediately after drinking the oil , go to bed and lie on your right side with knees drawn up for 30 minutes .
You may feel nauseated during the night .
This is due to the release of stored toxins from the gallbladder and liver .
This is normal and a sign that the protocol is working .
Upon arising in the morning , do a coffee enema .
Ah , yes , the coffee enema , arguably the most ridiculous “ CAM ” therapy there is , other than homeopathy .
I still have n’t figured out how the coffee enema “ flushes ” the liver .
I also still have n’t figured out why anyone would want to partake of the glorious caffeine - laden coffee bean in any way other than the usual way .
Certainly , enemas are a rather difficult way to get a morning caffeine fix !
There are , of course , many variations to the basic “ liver flush ” protocol .
Here are but a few :
The list goes on and on and on and on .
( And so will you if you try these cleanses . )
So what will happen if you do this ( besides your producing a lot of unusually stinky and liquid poop ) ?
Well , you will find things in your stool .
If you read the many testimonials and look at the disgusting pictures on all the websites touting liver flushes , you will see photos proudly displayed of greenish balls or various other things that sort of look like–well , sort of “ stone ” - like .
Naturally , the liver flushers claim that these are gallstones –without actually proving that ’s what they are .
Indeed , although it is certainly possible to pass gallstones into the stool and occasionally even find one , it ’s highly unlikely to pass such huge numbers of stones ( as claimed by testimonials ) without previous clinical symptoms of gallbladder disease or without easily detectable stones on ultrasound examination .
In some cases , the number of “ stones ” observed in the stool would have required a gallbladder the size of a football to hold them all !
And , given that more always seem to “ come out ” when additional flushes are done , it would seem to imply that there is an endless supply there to be “ dumped ” out , a concept that defies plausibility , given that gallstones do not form rapidly enough to replace all the ones supposedly “ flushed ” out .
In any case , check out this testimonial to see what I mean :
I just completed my 3rd liver cleanse .
Whew !
1st cleanse 250 small stones pea size or less brown and green .
2nd cleanse 460 stones , small stones pea size or less brown and green .
3rd cleanse 260 stones light and dark green .
Many marble size and 2 almost as big as golf balls ( I saved these ! )
I highly recommend Andreas Moritz ’s book , “ The Amazing Liver Cleanse ” .
I followed to the letter and did colosan and colonics before and after .
I read your testimonials and thought I would add my information .
As a surgeon , I feel obligated to point out that I have never seen a common bile duct ( the tube that runs from the liver to the duodenum , through which bile passes ) the diameter of a golf ball .
The claim that anything so large could “ pass ” thanks to these flushes strains credibility to the breaking point .
This testimonial gets a bit closer to what may be the truth behind liver cleansing :
I did a ‘ liver cleanse ’ or gallbladder flush about 6 nights ago !
I ’m a 50 year old female in good health .
I ’m not overweight and have no health problems .
I ’m active and have been a schoolteacher for 25 years .
I did not have any symptoms of gallstones nor did I have an ultrasound .
I just had always been curious to try a gallbladder flush and see if anything came out - as they say most everyone has these gallstones and it ’s good to get them OUT .
I did the flush at about 9:30 p.m .
And I vomited about 12:30 !!!
I thought oh hell what an un-pleasant waste of time .
BUT the next morning I DID pass some ( 25 ? ) gelatinous looking things that were greenish – none larger than a small pea .
I felt lousey – bloated and not hungry the next day .
But since then I ’ve felt great !!
I think I vomited because I ate some plain white rice and drank some carrot juice about 5 pm .
I have been researching various liver / gallbladder cleanses and most say NOT to eat all day and to drink organic apple juice and only that for at least 2 days prior .
I took only 4 oz of fresh squeezed lemon juice followed by 4 oz of olive oil at about 10 pm .
I nearly gagged ** YUK ** as I was taking it !
I will do it again but will follow your directions .
I wish I had come across this website BEFORE I did my flush !
Note that this is an asymptomatic woman with absolutely no evidence of gallbladder or liver disease by clinical history , lacking the classic symptoms of right upper quandrant abdominal pain after a fatty meal ( more succinctly known as biliary colic ) –or any GI symptoms at all !
( Although she certainly did produce some symptoms , did n’t she ? )
Because of curiosity , she made herself miserable for a couple of days with this “ liver flush ” and then noticed something “ coming out . ”
These “ gelatinous things ” were almost certainly not gallstones .
There are several varieties of gallstones .
Of these , cholesterol stones can be rather soft and easily broken , but I do n’t think they could be correctly described as “ gelatinous . ”
In any case , if these “ flushes ” actually flushed gallstones in to the GI tract , to be removed via the feces , it would be fairly straightforward to test scientifically , as I ’ve pointed out time and time again in other venues .
All that ’s needed is an ultrasound machine and a willing radiologist , and possibly a biliary surgeon to evaluate symptoms and response .
( Whether any IRB that is truly dedicated to human subject protection go for the protocol , however , I ca n’t guarantee . )
Certainly , the ultrasound machine is not an onerous requirement , either .
Ultrasound machines have become quite ubiquitous , as the price has fallen dramatically ( and the quality has increased dramatically ) in recent years .
Virtually every OB / GYN practice that does prenatal care has at least one in their office , if not one in each exam room .
Many general surgeons have them now , too ; as do most emergency rooms .
Pretty much any self - respecting breast cancer surgeon has at least one .
There are even good portable ultrasound machines that fit into briefcases , and you can even find ultrasound machines in very poor parts of China and India , where , unfortunately , they are used to determine the sex of fetuses , so that parents can abort the females they do n’t want .
All that ’s left is to draft a scientifically valid protocol with the proper controls and then to follow through and document symptoms , physical examination , diagnosis , pre-flush stone load in the gallbladder , and post - flush stone load in the gallbladder rigorously with high quality ultrasound examinations .
Not surprisingly , it ’s still never been done , as far as I can tell .
I search in vain for actual physical evidence to support the claims of liver flushers .
What has been done , however , is a lovely little study that suggests just how much self - delusion is involved in liver flushes .
Like the case of colon cleanses , when seasoned con men learn how liver flushes actually “ work , ” they will be likely to tip their hats in appreciation for such simplicity and perfection , a scam , where the remedy induces the “ evidence ” of its efficacy .
But on to the case report to which I refer that a group in New Zealand contributed to the Lancet :
A 40 - year - old woman was referred to the outpatient clinic with a 3 - month history of recurrent severe right hypochondrial pain after fatty food .
[ Note : Here “ hypochondrial ” means “ below the ribcage , ’ not “ hypochondriac . ” ]
Abdominal ultrasound showed multiple 1 - 2 mm gallstones in the gallbladder .
She had recently followed a “ liver cleansing ” regime on the advice of a herbalist .
This regime consisted of free intake of apple and vegetable juice until 1800 h , but no food , followed by the consumption of 600 mL of olive oil and 300 mL of lemon juice over several hours .
This activity resulted in the painless passage of multiple semisolid green “ stones ” per rectum in the early hours of the next morning .
She collected them , stored them in the freezer , and presented them in the clinic .
Microscopic examination of our patient ’s stones revealed that they lacked any crystalline structure , melted to an oily green liquid after 10 min at 40°C , and contained no cholesterol , bilirubin , or calcium by established wet chemical methods .
Traditional faecal fat extraction techniques indicated that the stones contained fatty acids that required acid hydrolysis to give free fatty acids before extraction into ether .
These fatty acids accounted for 75 % of the original material .
Experimentation revealed that mixing equal volumes of oleic acid ( the major component of olive oil ) and lemon juice produced several semi solid white balls after the addition of a small volume of a potassium hydroxide solution .
On air drying at room temperature , these balls became quite solid and hard .
We conclude , therefore , that these green “ stones ” resulted from the action of gastric lipases on the simple and mixed triacylglycerols that make up olive oil , yielding long chain carboxylic acids ( mainly oleic acid ) .
This process was followed by saponification into large insoluble micelles of potassium carboxylates ( lemon juice contains a high concentration of potassium ) or “ soap stones ” .
In other words , the “ stones ” that liver cleansers are so proud of and go to such effort to strain their poo for after doing their flushes are not gallstones and were almost certainly the product of the actual flush itself !
( Cue the con men tipping their hats in appreciation . )
It makes perfect sense , if you think about it .
These protocols usually involve fasting and then consuming up to a half liter or more of olive oil at one time .
That could easily provide the conditions for this sort of reaction to take place .
Neat , is n’t it ?
The very sign of “ success ” of the liver flush is something that has nothing to do with gallstones and everything to do with the results of the flush itself .
Indeed , it ’s quite clear that , even if you do n’t have gallstones , if you do a liver flush and then look closely enough , you ’ll find things in your stool that very much look like gallstones that are really due to saponified oil .
Now I know ( and you do too ) why virtually every liver flush protocol includes large amounts of olive oil or similar oils plus epsom salts or orthophophoric acid and fruit juices .
Unfortunately , I have not seen any more recent studies , and I ’m not sure if any are really needed after the investigators discussed above conclusively showed that they could mimic these “ stones ” chemically .
In any case , it ’s a beautiful scam .
People do these flushes , they see things that look to them like gallstones being “ flushed ” out , and they believe it works .
Consequently , they keep doing it .
Because these flushes involve materials that do n’t have to be purchased from a “ healer ” ( although certainly many “ healers ” sell various “ supplements ” to “ aid ” liver flushes ) , they can be viewed more as a means of healers to demonstrate their skill and keep the patient coming .
( And going , too ! )
It also serves as a way of “ demonstrating ” the efficacy of “ detoxification . ”
After all , if this “ flush ” appears to cause “ gallstones ” to be eliminatd as promised , then perhaps the other detoxification modalities beloved of alt - med believers are also “ flushing out toxins ” as claimed and might be worth a try .
( Never mind what the “ toxins ” are . )
In this light , liver cleanses might indeed be viewed a “ gateway ” CAM therapy that leads users to the even more scientifically implausible ones , like homeopathy ( which at least has the advantage over liver flushes of not making one spend long periods of time on the porcelain throne ) .
To me the ironic thing about liver flushes is that they are so strongly advocated by CAM believers , who frequently castigate “ conventional ” medicine for “ iatrogenic diseases or complications ” ( iatrogenic=caused by doctors ) .
What , then , can we call these “ stones ” coming out of people using liver flushes , given that they are caused by the very CAM therapy that claims to be getting rid of them ?
I ’m open to suggestions .
Q : Where is the United States heading in terms of world power and influence ?
HZ : America has been heading - for some time , and is heading right now - toward less and less world power , less and less influence .
Obviously , since the war in Iraq , the
rest of the world has fallen away from the United States , and if
American foreign policy continues in the way it has been - that is
aggressive and violent and uncaring about the feelings and thoughts of
other people - then the influence of the United States is going to
decline more and more .
This is an empire which is on the one hand the most powerful empire
that ever existed ; on the other hand an empire that is crumbling - an
empire that has no future ... because the rest of the world is
alienated and simply because this empire is top - heavy with military
commitments , with bases around the world , with the exhaustion of its
own resources at home .
[ This is ] leading to more and more discontent and home , so I think
the American empire will go the way of other empires and I think it is
on its way now .
Q : Is there any hope the US will change its approach to the rest of the world ?
HZ : If there is any hope , the hope lies in the American people .
[ It ] lies in American people becoming resentful enough and indignant
enough over what has happened to their country , over the loss of
dignity in the world , over the starving of human resources in the
United States , the starving of education and health , the takeover of
the political mechanism by corporate power and the result this has on
the everyday lives of the American people .
[ There is also ] the higher and higher food prices , the more and more insecurity , the sending of the young people to war .
I think all of this may very well build up into a movement of rebellion .
We have seen movements of rebellion in the past :
The labour
movement , the civil rights movement , the movement against the war in
Vietnam .
I think we may well see , if the United States keeps heading in the
same direction , a new popular movement .
That is the only hope for the
United States .
Q : How did the US get to this point ?
HZ : Well , we got to this point because ... I
suppose the American people have allowed it to get it to this point
because there were enough Americans who were satisfied with their
lives , just enough .
Of course , many Americans were not , that is why half of the population does n't vote , they 're alienated .
But there are just enough Americans who have been satisfied , you
might say getting some of the " goodies " of the empire , just some of
them , just enough people satisfied to support the system , so we got
this way because of the ability of the system to maintain itself by
satisfying just enough of the population to keep its legitimacy .
And I think that era is coming to an end .
Q : What should the world know about the United States ?
HZ : What I find many people in the rest of the world do n't know is that there is an opposition in the United States .
Very often , people in the rest of the world think that Bush is popular ,
they think 'oh , he was elected twice ' , they do n't understand the
corruption of the American political system which enabled Bush to win
twice .
They do n't understand the basic undemocratic nature of the American
political system in which all power is concentrated within two parties
which are not very far from one another and people cannot easily tell
the difference .
So I think we are in a situation where we are going to need some
very fundamental changes in American society if the American people are
going to be finally satisfied with the kind of society we have .
Q : Do you think the US can recover from its current position ?
HZ : Well , I am hoping for a recovery process .
I mean , so far we have n't seen it .
You asked about what the people of the rest of the world do n't know
about the United States , and as I said , they do n't know that there is
an opposition .
There always has been an opposition , but
the opposition has always been either crushed or quieted , kept in the
shadows , marginalised so their voices are not heard .
SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT Never Miss a Beat .
Get our best delivered to your inbox .
People in the rest of the world hear the voices of the American leaders .
They do not hear the voices of the people all over this country who
do not like the American leaders who want different policies .
I think also , people in the rest of the world should know that what
they see in Iraq now is really a continuation of a long , long term
of American imperial expansion in the world .
I think ... a lot of people in the world think that this war in Iraq
is an aberration , that before this the United States was a benign power .
It has never been a benign power , from the very first , from the
American Revolution , from the taking - over of Indian land , from the
Mexican war , the Spanish - American war .
It is embarrassing to say , but we have a long history in this
country of violent expansion and I think not only do most people in
other countries [ not ] know this , most Americans do n't know this .
Q : Is there a way for this to improve ?
HZ : Well you know , whatever hope there is lies in
that large number of Americans who are decent , who do n't want to go to
war , who do n't want to kill other people .
It is hard to see that hope because these Americans who feel that
way have been shut out of the communications system , so their voices
are not heard , they are not seen on the television screen , but they
exist .
I have gone through , in my life , a number of social movements and I
have seen how at the very beginning of these social movements or just
before these social movements develop , there did n't seem to be any hope .
I lived in the [ US ] south for seven years , in the years of the civil
rights movements , and it did n't seem that there was any hope , but there
was hope under the surface .
And when people organised , and when people began to act , when people
began to work together , people began to take risks , people began to
oppose the establishment , people began to commit civil disobedience .
Well , then that hope became manifest ... it actually turned into change .
Q : Do you think there is a way out of this and for the future influence of the US on the world to be a positive one ?
HZ : Well , you know for the United States to begin
to be a positive influence in the world we are going to have to have a
new political leadership that is sensitive to the needs of the American
people , and those needs do not include war and aggression .
[ It must also be ] sensitive to the needs of people in other parts of
the world , sensitive enough to know that American resources , instead of
being devoted to war , should be devoted to helping people who are
suffering .
You 've got earthquakes and natural disasters all over the world , but
the people in the United States have been in the same position as
people in other countries .
The natural disasters here [ also ] brought little positive reaction - look at [ Hurricane ] Katrina .
The people in this country , the poor people especially and the
people of colour especially , have been as much victims of American
power as people in other countries .
Q : Can you give us an overall scope of everything we talked about - the power and influence of the United States ?
HZ : The power and influence of
the United States has declined rapidly since the war in Iraq because
American power , as it has been exercised in the world historically , has
been exposed more to the rest of the world in this situation and in
other situations .
So the US influence is declining , its power is declining .
However strong a military machine it is , power does not ultimately depend on a military machine .
So power is declining .
Ultimately power rests on the moral legitimacy of a system and the United States has been losing moral legitimacy .
My hope is that the American people will rouse themselves and change
this situation , for the benefit of themselves and for the benefit of
the rest of the world .

The main election race I am interested in this November is that Pelosi loses her seat to Cindy Sheehan , that act alone would send a BIG message to these freaks of nature .
Of course I guarantee this race will be STOLEN !
without any doubt .
Pelosi should be indicted for treason .
Myself I am voting for Cynthia McKinney because I flatly refuse to vote for the ever so slightly lesser of 2 insane evils .
If I were to place the 4 candidates on the ballot on a scale from 1 -100 as far as electability with 1 being not electable and 100 being perfect .
I would put McKinney at about 90 , she would be higher if she chose a good VP .
I would put Bob Barr around 40 .
Obama would be around 20
McSame is a 1 for obvious reasons .

Let 's assume that Pelosi is not stupid .
Could she be afraid of blackmail from the wiretapping ?
Maybe ...
The most likely excuse I see is that she is trying to be pragmatic .
Better to upset the base than lose the 2008 elections !
The problem is that since there have been so many crimes committed by this administration , Congress is unconditionally surrendering to any future President .
Does she prefer to wait a generation and let the international courts in Den Hague deal with the mess ???
The failure to hold officials accountable now will encourage future lawbreakers .
If conservative judges can uphold the US Constitution , why not the so - called opposition ?

greg0 , listen to what Bruce Fein says about this .
Pelosi et al. are increasingly complicit in all the things that they would impeach Bush for , and that complicity grows by the day .
This is probably what she means when she talks that " if he committed a crime I 'd impeach him " nonsense .
She 's probably waiting for Bush to do something that would not have any implications for her and her gang of criminals .

If you read the MSN article linked above on the Anthrax suspect 's suicide , do n't you think it 's awfully odd that not only is no MOTIVE given for this individual 's involvement in the ATTEMPTED ASSASSINATION of US Senators , but there is n't even a hint of information that would make this individual a likely candidate .
Why was he a " person of interest " other than he had access and experience with the substance ( as I 'm sure many others did also ) ?
Was a raving right - wing lunatic with Hannity , O'Reilly and Savage books at his home ?
Did he think that Democrats were responsible for 9 - 11 ?
I mean , really , why this guy ?
The smell test on the Anthrax case says that it was politically motivated , and we all know that it was Leahy and Daschle who could 've blocked passage of the Patriot - they and they alone .

BH , voting for the superior candidate that would clearly be the best for the country thus my own best interest is NOT " throwing my vote away " .
It is making it count in the ONLY way that any vote can count .
However wasting a vote on a candidate that you know is corrupt and wont do a damn thing about all the crimes committed the past 8 years , THAT is truly wasting your vote .
So my question to you is " Why throw away your vote on a party that you KNOW has done NOTHING whatsoever , has not only allowed but in fact aided and abetted in every way treasonous war criminals giving them anything he wants ? "
The democrats have clearly been complicit in these crimes and the cover ups , I flatly refuse to vote for known criminals .
I am not the one throwing my vote away .
As for this guy that was ASSASINATED in order to stop the investigation into Bush & Cheney & Co and their involvement in the Anthrax attacks .
Just add another crime to the ever growing list .
All of the MSM have now latched onto this BS and are all proclaiming his guilt without a single shred of evidence .

At one time , Conyers said he only needed 19 Congress - critters to come forward to stand for impeachment and then he would act .
Maybe there are 19 on his committee and that is what he really meant , but Kucinich says he managed to attract at least 24 to his impeachment presentation .
On a percentage basis , I 'd say that is a significant gain in support .
But even if it were n't , I think Pelosi shold not be standing in the way .

It is time for everyone to mail Speaker Pelosi a copy of Rep. Kucinich 's 35 articles demanding what does n't she understand about them - demand that she explain why every article is actually legal .
I figure if we can flood her office with tens of thousands of packages she might get the message - ~ 4000 packages per ton .
[ At 33 pages double sided that is probably about 8 oz with envelope ( .16 oz per page for 20 lb paper makes 33 pages 5.28 oz ) ]

As is well known , Arizona Politics is completely controlled by the forces of Organized Crime , under the aegis of the Lansky - Bronfman arm of the Syndicate .
For that reason , Democrat , Republican , or Independent , ALL Politically destined Money comes from ; hence ALL politicians are property of , the Mob .
For that reason , John McCain is properly NOT “ A Senator from Arizona , ” but , like the other Senator from Arizona is “ The Senator from Organized Crime ! ”
Considering the criminal nature of the Administration we already have , the ‘ election ’ of Senator McCain as the FIRST “ President from organized Crime , ” might not be very noticeable insofar as the organized destruction of the Middle Class and the enrichment of the already wealthy the difference of the new administration from the one we have might not be noticeable .
HOWEVER , the source of the McCain wealth , and the evident nature of his controllers , is not even mentioned by the mainstream media , who are evidently at least complicit , if not actual co-conspirators .
For this reason , Obama ’s refusal to limit himself to Federal Matching Funds as McCain ( falsely ) did becomes obvious .
There is an unlimited amount of Mob money available to finance 527’s to denigrate Obama , and if the Mob gets tired of the game , Cindy can outspend Barack at least ten to one .
The fact that this is not apparent in the MSM is obvious , and the reason therefor is simply that the “ Capitalists , ” whose differences from the Mob are not apparent , are in control of said MSM .
Somehow the Public HAS to become aware that McCain is the Mob ’s creature , and will deliver the Nation to the Syndicate if his election is not prevented .

Bush and Pelosi are different , but is it " different " enough ?
Brad , your comment about your head rolling , after Nancy made her comment , somehow reminded me of a quote I once saw by Gore Vidal ( whom , I believe , at times , overstates cynicism to make a point ) : " It makes no difference who you vote for - the two parties are really one party representing four percent of the people " . *
Some other quotes relating to the subject of party politics and presidents : " Any American who is prepared to run for president should automatically , by definition , be disqualified from ever doing so .
Apparently , a democracy is a place where numerous elections are held at great cost without issues and with interchangeable candidates .
As societies grow decadent , the language grows decadent , too .
Words are used to disguise , not to illuminate , action : you liberate a city by destroying it .
Words are to confuse , so that at election time people will solemnly vote against their own interests .
Democracy is supposed to give you the feeling of choice , like Painkiller X and Painkiller Y .
But they 're both just aspirin .
Now you have people in Washington who have no interest in the country at all .
They 're interested only in their companies , their corporations grabbing Caspian oil .
'... That loyal retainer of the Chase Manhattan Bank , the American president ...'
The corporate grip on opinion in the United States is one of the wonders of the Western world .
No First World country has ever managed to eliminate so entirely from its media all objectivity - much less dissent .
The genius of our ruling class is that it has kept a majority of the people from ever questioning the inequity of a system where most people drudge along , paying heavy taxes for which they get nothing in return .
We 're not a democracy " .

Yeah Pelosi said it : she can't get some of the democratic agenda passed if she 's busy trying to impeach Bush .
Heh she gave it away right there .
But it ai n't about being too busy .
She 's accepting a pittance ( and possibly some illusory political security ) in return for not turning up the heat on those criminals , and she 's selling out our country .

Peeeeee - losi is a neocon and is obviously complicit in the crimes of the bush regime .
If not for her complicity , this regime would have been brought down long ago .
She 's even spouting off the right - right BS of " where 's the proof " -- like we 're all a bunch of idiots , which is obviously what she thinks .
I wonder how many , if any , women were convicted of war crimes during the Nuremberg trials ?
Maybe she can be the first woman for that as well .
Our govt has an investation of traitors that must be exposed and the guilty forever disgraced in the pages of history .
As another commenter stated at another blog website , these are very bad people and while we 're all making polite discussion , they 're taking us down .
Enough with the polite talk already , we need to take action and display our anger and outrage -- the traitor Pelosi has been very successful at keeping us at bay .

Zinn - Election Madness
The Progressive March 2008 Issue
http://www.truthout.org/...rd-zinn-election-madness
I 'm not taking some ultra - left position that elections are totally insignificant , and that we should refuse to vote to preserve our moral purity .
Yes , there are candidates who are somewhat better than others , and at certain times of national crisis ( the Thirties , for instance , or right now ) where even a slight difference between the two parties may be a matter of life and death .
I 'm talking about a sense of proportion that gets lost in the election madness .
Would I support one candidate against another ?
Yes , for two minutes - the amount of time it takes to pull the lever down in the voting booth .
But before and after those two minutes , our time , our energy , should be spent in educating , agitating , organizing our fellow citizens in the workplace , in the neighborhood , in the schools .
Our objective should be to build , painstakingly , patiently but energetically , a movement that , when it reaches a certain critical mass , would shake whoever is in the White House , in Congress , into changing national policy on matters of war and social justice .

Pelosi's comment , taken alongside her defense of why she views herself to be a good Democratic Speaker " Well , we increased the minimum wage , did n't we ? " makes one think of someone rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic while it was sinking .
And this recent hissy fit by Republicans in the House because Pelosi , as Speaker , would n't allow a floor vote on offshore oil drilling stands in stark contrast to Pelosi letting the recent FISA fiasco take place , with retroactive immunity being given both to the criminally complicit telecoms and members of the Bush administration , by derailing court cases being held to uncover the truth .
Pelosi ( and no doubt Steny Hoyer ) is doing everything possible to block criminal proceedings beginning against Republican members of the most corrupt administration in American history , while offering up crumbs ( important crumbs , yes , but still less important than investigating and stopping the Bush / Republican crimes ) .
So , Pelosi " allows " Rep.
Conyers to hold " impeachment " hearings , but with the word " impeachment " being forbidden during proceedings , and with no follow through being contemplated ... because anti-impeachment Pelosi will make certain that nothing will ever be considered by the full House involving holding George W. Bush ( and Dick Cheney ) accountable for their criminal acts .
Which , no doubt , is why " inherent contempt " will never be employed against all the criminal Republicans thumbing their noses at Congress and refusing to even appear , even after receiving an official , constitutional , congressional subpoena .
Who would have ever thought that a Democratic House Speaker would actually be running interference for the Bush Crime Family , as well as all the culture of corruption Republicans and lapdog DLC DINO Blue Dog Democrats ?

As I ’d suspected , TiVo support for YouTube is indeed hidden within the 9.4 software update .
Series 3 and TiVo HD subscribers should start seeing the application show up as early as tomorrow ( Thursday ) , though the rollout will be completed over the next few weeks .
And in some form of meta-irony , I ’ve shot a brief video of YouTube on TiVo … on YouTube .
For good measure , I also brought up the new SDV Tuning Adapter and TCP Remote screens on my Series3 .
I ’ve confirmed the YouTube content is indeed H.264 – thus marking the first time TiVo is rendering anything other than MPEG - 2 .
( And why Series2 customers are out of luck – sorry , your hardware does n’t support additional codecs . )
In pressing TiVo on the issue of codecs , I also learned the forthcoming CinemaNow movie rentals will be provided ( to both Series2 and Series3 / TiVoHD units ) as MPEG - 2 .
I ca n’t say I ’m a huge YouTube fan ( and I do n’t like Mentos ) , but I ’m impressed with the breadth of this app and the seamless playback .
However , what I ’d really like to see them do with the new H.264 capabilities is provide access to a much larger library of video podcasts without requiring TiVo Desktop Windows PC transcoding or TiVo to broker indivudal content deals before providing server - side transcoding .
I know I ’m not the only one waiting for Tekzilla …
Expect TiVo ’s
YouTube press release tomorrow AM , which is also when the tivo.com / youtube informational page will be activated .
During the 2.6.27 merge window a number of my patches were merge and now we are at the point where we can securely create file descriptors without the danger of possibly leaking information .
Before I go into the details let 's get some background information .
A file descriptor in the Unix / POSIX world has lots of state associated with it .
One bit of information determines whether the file descriptor is automatically closed when the process executes an exec call to start executing another program .
This is useful , for instance , to establish pipelines .
Traditionally , when a file descriptor is created ( e.g. , with the default open ( ) mode ) this close - on - exec flag is not set and a programmer has to explicitly set it using fcntl ( fd , F_SETFD , FD_CLOEXEC ) ;
Closing the descriptor is a good idea for two main reasons : the new program 's file descriptor table might fill up .
For every open file descriptor resources are consumed .
more importantly , information might be leaked to the second program .
That program might get access to information it normally would n't have access to .
It is easy to see why the latter point is such a problem .
Assume this common scenario : A web browser has two windows or tabs open , both loading a new page ( maybe triggered through Javascript ) .
One connection is to your bank , the other some random Internet site .
The latter contains some random object which must be handled by a plug - in .
The plug - in could be an external program processing some scripting language .
The external program will be started through a fork ( ) and exec sequence , inheriting all the file descriptors open and not marked with close - on - exec from the web browser process .
The result is that the plug - in can have access to the file descriptor used for the bank connection .
This is especially bad if the plug - in is used for a scripting language such a Flash because this could make the descriptor easily available to the script .
In case the author of the script has malicious intentions you might end up losing money .
Until not too long ago the best programs could to is to set the close - on - exec flag for file descriptors as quickly as possible after the file descriptor has been created .
Programs would break if the default for new file descriptors would be changed to set the bit automatically .
This does not solve the problem , though .
There is a ( possibly brief ) period of time between the return of the open ( ) call or other function creating a file descriptor and the fcntl ( ) call to set the flag .
This is problematic because the fork ( ) function is signal - safe ( i.e. , it can be called from a signal handler ) .
In multi- threaded code a second thread might call fork ( ) concurrently .
It is theoretically possible to avoid these races by blocking all signals and by ensuring through locks that fork ( ) cannot be called concurrently .
This very quickly get far too complicated to even contemplate :
To block all signals , each thread in the process has to be interrupted ( through another signal ) and in the signal handler block all the other signals .
This is complicated , slow , possibly unreliable , and might introduce deadlocks .
Using a lock also means there has to be a lock around fork ( ) itself .
But fork ( ) is signal safe .
This means this step also needs to block all signals .
This by itself requires additional work since child processes inherit signal masks .
Making all this work in projects which come from different sources ( and which non-trivial program does n't use system or third - party libraries ? ) is virtually impossible .
It is therefore necessary to find a different solution .
The first set of patches to achieve the goal went into the Linux kernel in 2.6.23 , the last , as already mentioned , will be in the 2.6.27 release .
The patches are all rather simple .
They just extend the interface of various system calls so that already existing functionality can be taken advantage of .
The simplest case is the open ( ) system call .
To create a file descriptor with the close - on - exec flag atomically set all one has to do is to add the O_CLOEXEC flag to the call .
There is already a parameter which takes such flags .
The next more complicated is the solution chosen to extend the socket ( ) and socketcall ( ) system calls .
No flag parameter is available but the second parameter to these interfaces ( the type ) has a very limited range requirement .
It was felt that overloading the parameter is an acceptable solution .
It definitely makes using the new interfaces simpler .
The last group are interfaces where the original interface simply does n't provide a way to pass additional parameters .
In all these cases a generic flags parameter was added .
This is preferable to using specialized new interfaces ( like , for instance , dup2_cloexec ) because we do and will need other flags .
O_NONBLOCK is one case .
Hopefully we 'll have non-sequential file descriptors at some point and we can then request them using the flags , too .
The ( hopefully complete ) list of interface changes which were introduced is listed below .
Note : these are the userlevel change .
Inside the kernel things look different .
Userlevel Interface
What changed ?
open O_CLOEXEC flag added fcntl F_DUPFD_CLOEXEC command added recvmsg MSG_CMSG_CLOEXEC flag for transmission of file descriptor over Unix domain socket which has close - on - exec set atomically dup3
New interface taking an addition flag parameter ( O_CLOEXEC , O_NONBLOCK ) pipe2
New interface taking an addition flag parameter ( O_CLOEXEC , O_NONBLOCK ) socket SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK flag added to type parameter socketpair SOCK_CLOEXEC and SOCK_NONBLOCK flag added to type parameter paccept New interface taking an addition flag parameter ( SOCK_CLOEXEC , SOCK_NONBLOCK ) and a temporary signal mask fopen New mode 'e ' to open file with close - on - exec set popen New mode 'e ' to open pipes with close - on - exec set eventfd Take new flags EFD_CLOEXEC and EFD_NONBLOCK signalfd Take new flags SFD_CLOEXEC and SFD_NONBLOCK timerfd
Take new flags TFD_CLOEXEC and TFD_NONBLOCK epoll_create1
New interface taking a flag parameter .
Support EPOLL_CLOEXEC
and EPOLL_NONBLOCK inotify_init1
New interface taking a flag parameter ( IN_CLOEXEC , IN_NONBLOCK )
When should these interfaces be used ?
The answer is simple : whenever the author is not sure that no asynchronous fork ( ) + exec can happen or a concurrently running threads executes fork ( ) + exec ( or posix_spawn ( ) , BTW ) .
Application writers might have control over this .
But I 'd say that in all library code one has to play it safe .
In glibc we do now in almost all interfaces open the file descriptor with the close - on - exec flag set .
This means a lot of work but it has to be done .
Applications also have to change ( see this autofs bug , for instance ) .
The House approved a bill Tuesday to protect the vast body of fresh water in the Great Lakes region by prohibiting almost any diversion of it to places outside the lakes ’ basin and requiring the eight states bordering the lakes to follow new conservation standards .
The vote was 390 to 25 in favor of the bill , which has already been passed by the Senate and is expected to be signed by President Bush .
The measure , the Great Lakes Compact , was negotiated by the eight states .
A decade in the making , it is intended to ease longstanding fears that states outside the region , or even other countries , could tap into the lakes , possibly deplete them and do long - term damage to their basin ’s natural environment and economy .
Together , the five Great Lakes account for 20 percent of the world ’s supply of fresh surface water , and an estimated 40 million people get their water from the lakes ’ basin .
Scientists and environmental advocates who backed the legislation said they considered the lakes not a regional resource but a national one , whose health and integrity , they said , are in the entire country ’s interest .

Space shuttle Atlantis rolls along the crawlerway toward Launch pad 39A , in the background , after leaving the Vehicle Assembly Building at NASA ’s Kennedy Space Center on Sept. 4 , 2008 .
The shuttle is due to launch in October 2008 to the Hubble Space Telescope .
HOUSTON — NASA ? sshuttle Atlantis will be at a higher risk of suffering serious damage from tinyspace rocks and orbital trash than past missions when it launches to the HubbleSpace Telescope next month , a top program official said Monday .
NASAshuttle program manager John Shannon said Atlantis and its seven - astronaut creware facing the extra risk solely because of their destination .
? It ?s worsefor Hubble because we fly higher , ?
he told reporters during a briefing here atNASA ?s Johnson Space Center .
Atlantis isslated to launchon Oct. 10 with seven astronauts aboard to begin an 11 - day mission toupgrade the 18 - year - old Hubble Space Telescope .
Commandedby veteran spaceflyer Scott Altman , Atlantis astronauts plan to perform fiveback - to - back spacewalks during the flight to install new cameras , replacebatteries , gyroscopes , and guidance equipment , repair instruments neverdesigned to be fixed in space and add a docking mechanism and thermal insulation .
The $ 900 million shuttle flight is expected to extend Hubble ?s science mission , butcarries more risk than NASA ?s recent construction flights to the InternationalSpace Station .
The orbitalobservatory flies about 350 miles ( 563 km ) above Earth , higher than the 220 - mile ( 354 km ) path of the International Space Station — the destination ofNASA ?s recent shuttle missions since 2005 .
The levels of orbital debris aroundHubble have increased in recent years due to satellite breakups or eventheir intentional destruction , Shannon added .
That putsthe estimated odds of Atlantis suffering a critical strike from amicrometeorite or orbital debris ( MMOD ) during its Hubble mission at about a 1 - in - 185 chance , up from the typical 1 - in - 300 chance for flights to the space station , he added .
? It ?s not theoretical , ?Shannon said .
?
Every time we fly the vehicle back , we have MMOD damage on thespace shuttle .?
The spacestation and Hubble itself have also sustained minor damage from orbital debris , but despite the increased odds , it would take a major hit to a critical area toseriously wound Atlantis , Shannon said .
Atlantiswould not be able to reach the International Space Station , which could serveas a refuge for shuttle astronauts if their spacecraft is seriously damaged , fromHubble because of the space telescope ?s higher orbit and different inclination , NASA has said .
Instead , thespace agency plans to have a secondshuttle poised atop its Florida launch pad to serve as a rescue ship in theevent of an emergency .
But Shannon said that the likelihood that the rescuemission — known as STS - 400 at NASA — will be required at all , let alone due toMMOD damage , is very small .
? It wouldtake a very rare and very significantly large - sized damage from MMOD in acritical area to cause us to require [ STS - 400 ] , ?
Shannon said .
Shannonsaid he expects shuttle mission managers to discuss the micrometeorite threaton Thursday during a two - day program review .
The current threshold foracceptable debris risk is about a 1 - in - 200 chance of a critical strike , but thebenchmark is set to ensure the risk is properly discussed and assessed , headded .
Top agencyofficials , including NASA ?s safety and engineering chiefs , will make a finaldecision on the added risk later this month during a Flight Readiness Review , Shannonsaid .
They will also take into account the new heat shield repair methods andtools developed after damage from launch debris led to the tragic loss of theshuttle Columbia and its crew in 2003 .
? I don? tget too hung up on the numbers , ? he said .
?
I want to make sure that the actionswe ?re taking in response to the threat are appropriate .?
Since the Columbiatragedy , astronauts have routinely used a sensor - laden extension of their spaceshuttle ?s robotic arm to scan for damage on their spacecraft ?s sensitive heatshield .
Shuttle crews currently perform two scans , one just after launch and anotherjust before landing , to clear their orbiter for reentry through Earth ?s atmosphere .
NASAinitially cancelled the upcomingHubble servicing mission in 2004 following the Columbia accident due tosafety concerns .
The agency later studied the potential to service Hubblerobotically before reinstating the astronaut - led mission in 2006 .
Republican presidential candidate John McCain knows he has a bit of a temper .
“ In all candor , as an adult I ’ve been known to forget occasionally the discretion expected of a person and station when I believe I ’ve been accorded a lack of respect I did not deserve , ” the maverick with a reputation for “ straight talk ” said Tuesday .
Rumors of McCain ’s uncontrollable temper , substantiated by his Republican Senate colleagues , dogged him during the Republican primaries .
During that time Republican Sen. Thad Cochran ( Miss . ) . , a Romney supporter , told the Boston Globe the thought of a “ hot headed ” President McCain “ sends a cold chill down my spine . ”
Former Sen. Rick Santorum ( R. - Pa. ) , another Romney supporter , also made recorded robo-calls on behalf of the Romney campaign in which he said , “ As a conservative I do n’t agree with McCain on many issues and I do n’t think he has the temperament and leadership ability to move the country in the right direction . ”
Since dropping out of the primaries , Romney has thrown his support behind McCain and recently joined him on the campaign trail , prompting speculation of a McCain - Romney ticket .
Concerns about McCain ’s temper persisted before the Republican primaries , though .
McCain reportedly told Texas Sen. John Cornyn ( R. ) “ f --- you ” in a private meeting at the height of the Senate ’s debate over comprehensive immigration reform last year .
News outlets have published other stories that stated McCain said “ Only a a------ would put together a budget like this , ” to former Senate Budget Chairman Pete Domenici ( R. - N.M. ) and “ I ’m calling you a f------ jerk ! ” to Sen. Charles Grassley ( R. - Iowa . )
McCain noted his outbursts were not one of his positive traits .
“ Self - improvement should be a work in progress in all our lives , and I confess to needing it as much as anyone , ” McCain said in prepared remarks at his high school , Episcopal High in Alexandria , Virginia .

Electricity generation provides 18,000 terawatt - hours of energy a year , around 40 % of humanity 's total energy use .
In doing so it produces more than 10 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide every year , the largest sectoral contribution of humanity 's fossil - fuel derived emissions .
Yet there is a wide range of technologies — from solar and wind to nuclear and geothermal — that can generate electricity without net carbon emissions from fuel .
The easiest way to cut the carbon released by electricity generation is to increase efficiency .
But there are limits to such gains , and there is the familiar paradox that greater efficiency can lead to greater consumption .
So a global response to climate change must involve a move to carbon - free sources of electricity .
This requires fresh thinking about the price of carbon , and in some cases new technologies ; it also means new transmission systems and smarter grids .
But above all , the various sources of carbon - free generation need to be scaled up to power an increasingly demanding world .
In this special feature , Nature 's News team looks at how much carbon - free energy might ultimately be available — and which sources make most sense .
Hydropower
Credit : J. TAYLOR
The world has a lot of dams — 45,000 large ones , according to the World Energy Council , and many more at small scales .
Its hydroelectric power plants have a generating capacity of 800 gigawatts ( for a guide to power , see ‘ By the numbers ’ ) , and they currently supply almost one - fifth of the electricity consumed worldwide .
As a source of electricity , dams are second only to fossil fuels , and generate 10 times more power than geothermal , solar and wind power combined .
With a claimed full capacity of 18 gigawatts , the Three Gorges dam in China can generate more or less twice as much power as all the world 's solar cells .
An additional 120 gigawatts of capacity is under development .
One reason for hydropower 's success is that it is a widespread resource — 160 countries use hydropower to some extent .
In several countries hydropower is the largest contributor to grid electricity — it is not uncommon in developing countries for a large dam to be the main generating source .
Nevertheless , it is in large industrialized nations that have big rivers that hydroelectricity is shown in its most dramatic aspect .
Brazil , Canada , China , Russia and the United States currently produce more than half of the world 's hydropower .
Cost : According to the International Hydropower Association ( IHA ) , installation costs are usually in the range of US $ 1 million to more than $ 5 million per megawatt of capacity , depending on the site and size of the plant .
Dams in lowlands and those with only a short drop between the water level and the turbine tend to be more expensive ; large dams are cheaper per watt of capacity than small dams in similar settings .
Annual operating costs are low — 0.8 –2 % of capital costs ; electricity costs $ 0.03 –0.10 per kilowatt - hour , which makes dams competitive with coal and gas .
Capacity :
The absolute limit on hydropower is the rate at which water flows downhill through the world 's rivers , turning potential energy into kinetic energy as it goes .
The amount of power that could theoretically be generated if all the world 's run-off were ' turbined ' down to sea level is more than 10 terawatts .
However , it is rare for 50 % of a river 's power to be exploitable , and in many cases the figure is below 30 % .
Those figures still offer considerable opportunity for new capacity , according to the IHA .
Europe currently sets a benchmark for hydropower use , with 75 % of what is deemed feasible already exploited .
For Africa to reach the same level , it would need to increase its hydropower capacity by a factor of 10 to more than 100 gigawatts .
Asia , which already has the greatest installed capacity , also has the greatest growth potential .
If it were to triple its generating capacity , thus harnessing a near - European fraction of its potential , it would double the world 's overall hydroelectric capacity .
The IHA says that capacity could triple worldwide with enough investment .
Advantages :
The fact that hydroelectric systems require no fuel means that they also require no fuel - extracting infrastructure and no fuel transport .
This means that a gigawatt of hydropower saves the world not just a gigawatt 's worth of coal burned at a fossil - fuel plant , but also the carbon costs of mining and transporting that coal .
As turning on a tap is easy , dams can respond almost instantaneously to changing electricity demand independent of the time of day or the weather .
This ease of turn - on makes them a useful back - up to less reliable renewable sources .
That said , variations in use according to need and season mean that dams produce about half of their rated power capacity .
Hydroelectric systems are unique among generating systems in that they can , if correctly engineered , store the energy generated elsewhere , pumping water uphill when energy is abundant .
The reservoirs they create can also provide water for irrigation , a way to control floods and create amenities for recreational use .
Disadvantages :
Not all regions have large hydropower resources — the Middle East , for example , is relatively deficient .
And reservoirs take up a lot of space ; today the area under man-made lakes is as large as two Italys .
The large dams and reservoirs that account for most of that area and for more than 90 % of hydro - generated electricity worldwide require lengthy and costly planning and construction , as well as the relocation of people from the reservoir area .
In the past few decades , millions of people have been relocated in India and China .
Dams have ecological effects on the ecosystems upstream and downstream , and present a barrier to migrating fish .
Sediment build - up can shorten their operating life , and sediment trapped by the dam is denied to those downstream .
Biomass that decomposes in reservoirs releases methane and carbon dioxide , and in some cases these emissions can be of a similar order of magnitude to those avoided by not burning fossil fuels .
Climate change could itself limit the capacity of dams in some areas by altering the amount and pattern of annual run-off from sources such as the glaciers of Tibet .
Because hydro is a mature technology , there is little room for improvement in the efficiency of generation .
Also , the more obvious and easy locations have been used , and so the remaining potential can be expected to be harder to exploit .
Small ( less than 10 megawatts ) ' run - of - river ' schemes that produce power from the natural flow of water — as millers have been doing for four millennia — are appealing , as they have naturally lower impacts .
However , they are about five times more expensive and harder to scale than larger schemes .
Verdict : A cheap and mature technology , but with substantial environmental costs ; roughly a terawatt of capacity could be added .
Nuclear fission

When reactor 4 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine melted down on 26 April 1986 , the fallout contaminated large parts of Europe .
That disaster , and the earlier incident at Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania , blighted the nuclear industry in the West for a generation .
Worldwide , though , the picture did not change quite as dramatically .
In 2007 , 35 nuclear plants were under construction , almost all in Asia .
The 439 reactors already in operation had an overall capacity of 370 gigawatts , and contributed around 15 % of the electricity generated worldwide , according to the most recent figures from the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) , which serves as the world 's nuclear inspectorate .
Costs : Depending on the design of the reactor , the site requirements and the rate of capital depreciation , the light - water reactors that make up most of the world 's nuclear capacity produce electricity at costs of between US $ 0.025 and $ 0.07 per kilowatt - hour .
The technology that makes this possible has benefited from decades of expensive research , development and purchases subsidized by governments ; without that boost it is hard to imagine that nuclear power would currently be in use .
Capacity : Because nuclear power requires fuel , it is constrained by fuel stocks .
There are some 5.5 million tonnes of uranium in known reserves that could profitably be extracted at a cost of US $ 130 per kilogram or less , according to the latest edition of the ' Red Book ' , in which the IAEA and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) assess uranium resources .
At the current use of 66,500 tonnes per year , that is about 80 years ' worth of fuel .
The current price of uranium is over that $ 130 threshold .
Geologically similar ore deposits that are as yet unproven — ' undiscovered reserves ' — are thought to amount to roughly double the proven reserves , and lower - grade ores offer considerably more .
Uranium is not a particularly rare element — it is about as common a constituent of Earth 's crust as zinc .
Estimates of the ultimate recoverable resource vary greatly , but 35 million tonnes might be considered available .
Nor is uranium the only naturally occurring element that can be made into nuclear fuel .
Although they have not yet been developed , thorium - fuelled reactors are a possibility ; bringing thorium into play would double the available fuel reserves .
Furthermore , although current reactor designs use their fuel only once , this could be changed .
Breeder reactors , which make plutonium from uranium isotopes that are not themselves useful for power production , can effectively create more fuel than they use .
A system built on such reactors might get 60 times more energy out for every kilogram of natural uranium put in , although lower multiples might be more realistic .
With breeder reactors , which have yet to be proven on a commercial basis , the world could in principle go 100 % nuclear .
Without them , it is still plausible for the amount of nuclear capacity to grow by a factor of two or three , and to operate at that level for a century or more .
Advantages : Nuclear power has relatively low fuel costs and can run at full blast almost constantly — US plants deliver 90 % of their rated capacity .
This makes them well suited to providing always - on ' baseload ' power to national grids .
Uranium is sufficiently widespread that the world 's nuclear - fuel supply is unlikely to be threatened by political factors .
Disadvantages :
There is no agreed solution to the problem of how to deal with the nuclear waste that has been generated in nuclear plants over the past 50 years .
Without long - term solutions , which are more demanding politically than technically , growth in nuclear power is an understandably hard sell .
A further problem is that the spread of nuclear power is difficult to disentangle from the proliferation of nuclear weapons capabilities .
Fuel cycles that involve recycling , and which thus necessarily produce plutonium , are particularly worrying .
Even without proliferation worries , nuclear power stations may make tempting targets for terrorists or enemy forces ( although in the latter case the same is true of hydroelectric plants ) .
A long - term commitment to greatly increased use of nuclear power would require public acceptance not just of existing technologies but of new ones , too — thorium and breeder reactors , for instance .
These technologies would also have to win over investors and regulators ( for nuclear fusion , see ‘ Farther out ’ ) .
Nuclear power is also extremely capital intensive ; power costs over the life of the plant are comparatively low only because the plants are long lived .
Nuclear power is thus an expensive option in the short term .
Another constraint may be a lack of skilled workers .
Building and operating nuclear plants requires a great many highly trained professionals , and enlarging this pool of talent enough to double the rate at which new plants are brought online might prove very challenging .
The engineering capacity for making key components would also need enlarging .
In light of these obstacles , predictions of the future role of nuclear power vary considerably .
The European Commission 's _ World Energy Technology Outlook — 2050 _ contains a bullish scenario that assumes that , with public acceptance and the development of new reactor technologies , nuclear power could provide about 1.7 terawatts by 2050 .
The IAEA 's analysts are more cautious .
Hans - Holger Rogner , head of the agency 's planning and economic study section , sees capacity rising to not more than 1,200 gigawatts by 2050 .
An interdisciplinary study carried out in 2003 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology described a concrete scenario for tripling capacity to 1,000 gigawatts by 2050 , a scenario predicated on US leadership , continued commitment by Japan and renewed activity by Europe .
This scenario relied only on improved versions of today 's reactors rather than on any radically different or improved design .
Verdict : Reaching a capacity in the terawatt range is technically possible over the next few decades , but it may be difficult politically .
A climate of opinion that came to accept nuclear power might well be highly vulnerable to adverse events such as another Chernobyl - scale accident or a terrorist attack .
Biomass
Credit : J. TAYLOR
Biomass was humanity 's first source of energy , and until the twentieth century it remained the largest ; even today it comes second only to fossil fuels .
Wood , crop residues and other biological sources are an important energy source for more than two billion people .
Mostly , this fuel is burned in fires and cooking stoves , but over recent years biomass has become a source of fossil - fuel - free electricity .
As of 2005 , the World Energy Council estimates biomass generating capacity to be at least 40 gigawatts , larger than any renewable resource other than wind and hydropower .
Biomass can supplement coal or in some cases gas in conventional power plants .
Biomass is also used in many co-generation plants that can capture 85 – 90 % of the available energy by making use of waste heat as well as electric power .
Costs :
The price of biomass electricity varies widely depending on the availability and type of the fuel and the cost of transporting it .
Capital costs are similar to those for fossil - fuel plants .
Power costs can be as little as $ 0.02 per kilowatt - hour when biomass is burned with coal in a conventional power plant , but increase to $ 0.03 –0.05 per kilowatt - hour from a dedicated biomass power plant .
Costs increase to $ 0.04–0.09 per kilowatt - hour for a co-generation plant , but recovery and use of the waste heat makes the process much more efficient .
The biggest problem for new biomass power plants is finding a reliable and concentrated feedstock that is available locally ; keeping down transportation costs means keeping biomass power plants tied to locally available fuel and quite small , which increases the capital cost per megawatt .
Capacity : Biomass is limited by the available land surface , the efficiency of photosynthesis , and the supply of water .
An OECD round table in 2007 estimated that there is perhaps half a billion hectares of land not in agricultural use that would be suitable for rain - fed biomass production , and suggested that by 2050 this land , plus crop residues , forest residues and organic waste might provide enough burnable material each year to provide 68,000 terawatt - hours .
Converted to electricity at an efficiency of 40 % , that could provide a maximum of 3 terawatts .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change pegs the potential at roughly 120,000 terawatt - hours in 2050 , which equates to slightly more than 5 terawatts on the basis of a larger estimate of available land .
These projections involve some fairly extreme assumptions about converting land to the production of energy crops .
And even to the extent that these assumptions prove viable , electricity is not the only potential use for such plantations .
By storing solar energy in the form of chemical bonds , biomass lends itself better than other renewable energy resources to the production of fuel for transportation ( see page 841 ) .
Although turning biomass to biofuel is not as efficient as just burning the stuff , it can produce a higher - value product .
Biofuels might easily beat electricity generation as a use for biomass in most settings .
Advantages :
Plants are by nature carbon - neutral and renewable , although agriculture does use up resources , especially if it requires large amounts of fertilizer .
The technologies needed to burn biomass are mature and efficient , especially in the case of co-generation .
Small systems using crop residues can minimize transportation costs .
If burned in power plants fitted with carbon - capture - and - storage hardware , biomass goes from being carbon neutral to carbon negative , effectively sucking carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and storing it in the ground ( see ' Carbon capture and storage ' ) .
This makes it the only energy technology that can actually reduce carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere .
As with coal , however , there are costs involved in carbon capture , both in terms of capital set - up and in terms of efficiency .
Disadvantages :
There is only so much land in the world , and much of it will be needed to provide food for the growing global population .
It is not clear whether letting market mechanisms drive the allocation of land between fuel and food is desirable or politically feasible .
Changing climate could itself alter the availability of suitable land .
There is likely to be opposition to increased and increasingly intense cultivation of energy crops .
Use of waste and residues may remove carbon from the land that would otherwise have enriched the soil ; long - term sustainability may not be achievable .
Bioenergy dependence could also open the doors to energy crises caused by drought or pestilence , and land - use changes can have climate effects of their own : clearing land for energy crops may produce emissions at a rate the crops themselves are hard put to offset .
Verdict :
If a large increase in energy crops proves acceptable and sustainable , much of it may be used up in the fuel sector .
However , small - scale systems may be desirable in an increasing number of settings , and the possibility of carbon - negative systems — which are plausible for electricity generation but not for biofuels — is a unique and attractive capability .
Wind

Wind power is expanding faster than even its fiercest advocates could have wished a few years ago .
The United States added 5.3 gigawatts of wind capacity in 2007 — 35 % of the country 's new generating capacity — and has another 225 gigawatts in the planning stages .
There is more wind - generating capacity being planned in the United States than for coal and gas plants combined .
Globally , capacity has risen by nearly 25 % in each of the past five years , according to the Global Wind Energy Council .
Wind Power Monthly estimates that the world 's installed capacity for wind as of January 2008 was 94 gigawatts .
If growth continued at 21 % , that figure would triple over six years .
Despite this , the numbers remain small on a global scale , especially given that wind farms have historically generated just 20 % of their capacity .
Costs : Installation costs for wind power are around US $ 1.8 million per megawatt for onshore developments and between $ 2.4 million and $ 3 million for offshore projects .
That translates to $ 0.05 –0.09 per kilowatt - hour , making wind competitive with coal at the lower end of the range .
With subsidies , as enjoyed in many countries , the costs come in well below those for coal — hence the boom .
The main limit on wind - power installation at the moment is how fast manufacturers can make turbines .
These costs represent significant improvements in the technology .
In 1981 , a wind farm might have consisted of an array of 50 - kilowatt turbines that produced power for roughly $ 0.40 per kilowatt - hour .
Today 's turbines can produce 30 times as much power at one - fifth the price with much less down time .
Capacity :
The amount of energy generated by the movement of Earth 's atmosphere is vast — hundreds of terawatts .
In a 2005 paper , a pair of researchers from Stanford University calculated that at least 72 terawatts could be effectively generated using 2.5 million of today 's larger turbines placed at the 13 % of locations around the world that have wind speeds of at least 6.9 metres per second and are thus practical sites ( C. L. Archer and M. Z. Jacobson J. Geophys .
Res. 110 , D12110 ; 2005 ) .
Advantages :
The main advantage of wind is that , like hydropower , it does n't need fuel .
The only costs therefore come from building and maintaining the turbines and power lines .
Turbines are getting bigger and more reliable .
The development of technologies for capturing wind at high altitudes could provide sources with small footprints capable of generating power in a much more sustained way .
Disadvantages : Wind 's ultimate limitation might be its intermittency .
Providing up to 20 % of a grid 's capacity from wind is not too difficult .
Beyond that , utilities and grid operators need to take extra steps to deal with the variability .
Another grid issue , and one that is definitely limiting in the near term , is that the windiest places are seldom the most populous , and so electricity from the wind needs infrastructure development — especially for offshore settings .
Average power of the world 's winds during the boreal winter ( top ) and summer .
The recoupable energy is some two orders of magnitude lower because of turbine spacing and engineering constraints .

As well as being intermittent , wind power is , like other renewable energy sources , inherently quite low density .
A large wind farm typically generates a few watts per square metre — 10 is very high .
Wind power thus depends on cheap land , or on land being used for other things at the same time , or both .
It is also hard to deploy in an area where the population sets great store by the value of a turbine - free landscape .
Wind power is also unequally distributed : it favours nations with access to windy seas and their onshore breezes or great empty plains .
Germany has covered much of its windiest land with turbines , but despite these pioneering efforts , its combined capacity of 22 GW supplies less than 7 % of the country 's electricity needs .
Britain , which has been much slower to adopt wind power , has by far the largest offshore potential in Europe — enough to meet its electricity needs three times over , according to the British Wind Energy Association .
Industry estimates suggest that the European Union could meet 25 % of its current electricity needs by developing less than 5 % of the North Sea .
Such truly large - scale deployment of wind - power schemes could affect local , and potentially global , climate by altering wind patterns , according to research by David Keith , head of the Energy and Environmental Systems Group at the University of Calgary in Canada .
Wind tends to cool things down , so temperatures around a very large wind farm could rise as turbines slow the wind to extract its energy .
Keith and his team suggest that 2 TW of wind capacity could affect temperatures by about 0.5 °C , with warming at mid-latitudes and cooling at the poles — perhaps in that respect offsetting the effect of global warming ( D. W. Keith et al .
Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 101 , 16115–16120 ; 2004 ) .
Verdict :
With large deployments on the plains of the United States and China , and cheaper access to offshore , a wind - power capacity of a terawatt or more is plausible .
Geothermal
Credit : J. TAYLOR
Earth 's interior contains vast amounts of heat , some of it left over from the planet 's original coalescence , some of it generated by the decay of radioactive elements .
Because rock conducts heat poorly , the rate at which this heat flows to the surface is very slow ; if it were quicker , Earth 's core would have frozen and its continents ceased to drift long ago .
The slow flow of Earth 's heat makes it a hard resource to use for electricity generation except in a few specific places , such as those with abundant hot springs .
Only a couple of dozen countries produce geothermal electricity , and only five of those — Costa Rica , El Salvador , Iceland , Kenya and the Philippines — generate more than 15 % of their electricity this way .
The world 's installed geothermal electricity capacity is about 10 gigawatts , and is growing only slowly — about 3 % per year in the first half of this decade .
A decade ago , geothermal capacity was greater than wind capacity ; now it is almost a factor of ten less .
Earth 's heat can also be used directly .
Indeed , small geothermal heat pumps that warm houses and businesses directly may represent the greatest contribution that Earth 's warmth can make to the world 's energy budget .
Costs :
The cost of a geothermal system depends on the geological setting .
Jefferson Tester , a chemical engineer who was part of a team that produced an influential Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) report on geothermal technology in 2006 , explains the situation as being “ similar to mineral resources .
There is a continuum of resource grades — from shallow , high - temperature regions of high - porosity rock , to deeper low - porosity regions that are more challenging to exploit ” .
That report put the cost of exploiting the best sites — those with a lot of hot water circulating close to the surface — at about US $ 0.05 per kilowatt - hour .
Much more abundant low - grade resources are exploitable with current technology only at much higher prices .
Absolute capacity : Earth loses heat at between 40 TW and 50 TW a year , which works out at an average of a bit less than a tenth of a watt per square metre .
For comparison , sunlight comes in at an average of 200 watts per square metre .
With today 's technology , 70 GW of the global heat flux is seen as exploitable .
With more advanced technologies , at least twice that could be used .
The MIT study suggested that using enhanced systems that inject water at depth using sophisticated drilling systems , it would be possible to set up 100 GW of geothermal electricity in the United States alone .
With similar assumptions a global figure of a terawatt or so can be reached , suggesting that geothermal could , with a great deal of investment , provide as much electricity as dams do today .
Advantages : Geothermal resources require no fuel .
They are ideally suited to supplying base - load electricity , because they are driven by a very regular energy supply .
At 75 % , geothermal sources boast a higher capacity factor than any other renewable .
Low - grade heat left over after generation can be used for domestic heating or for industrial processes .
Surveying and drilling previously unexploited geothermal resources has become much easier thanks to mapping technology and drilling equipment designed by the oil industry .
A significant technology development programme —
Tester suggests $ 1 billion over 10 years — could greatly expand the achievable capacity as lower - grade resources are opened up .
Disadvantages : High - grade resources are quite rare , and even low - grade resources are not evenly distributed .
Carbon dioxide can leak out of some geothermal fields , and there can be contamination issues ; the water that brings the heat to the surface can carry compounds that should n't be released into aquifers .
In dry regions , water availability can be a constraint .
Large - scale exploitation requires technologies that , although plausible , have not been demonstrated in the form of robust , working systems .
Verdict : Capacity might be increased by more than an order of magnitude .
Without spectacular improvements , it is unlikely to outstrip hydro and wind and reach a terawatt .
Solar

Not to take anything away from the miracle of photosynthesis , but even under the best conditions plants can only turn about 1 % of the solar radiation that hits their surfaces into energy that anyone else can use .
For comparison , a standard commercial solar photovoltaic panel can convert 12 – 18 % of the energy of sunlight into useable electricity ; high - end models come in above 20 % efficiency .
Increasing manufacturing capacity and decreasing costs have led to remarkable growth in the industry over the past five years : in 2002 , 550 MW of cells were shipped worldwide ; in 2007 the figure was six times that .
Total installed solar - cell capacity is estimated at 9 GW or so .
The actual amount of electricity generated , though , is considerably less , as night and clouds decrease the power available .
Of all renewables , solar currently has the lowest capacity factor , at about 14 % .
Solar cells are not the only technology by which sunlight can be turned into electricity .
Concentrated solar thermal systems use mirrors to focus the Sun 's heat , typically heating up a working fluid that in turn drives a turbine .
The mirrors can be set in troughs , in parabolas that track the Sun , or in arrays that focus the heat on a central tower .
As yet , the installed capacity is quite small , and the technology will always remain limited to places where there are a lot of cloud - free days — it needs direct sun , whereas photovoltaics can make do with more diffuse light .
Costs :
The manufacturing cost of solar cells is currently US $ 1.50 –2.50 for a watt 's worth of generating capacity , and prices are in the $ 2.50 –3.50 per watt range .
Installation costs are extra ; the price of a full system is normally about twice the price of the cells .
What this means in terms of cost per kilowatt - hour over the life of an installation varies according to the location , but it comes out at around $ 0.25 –0.40 .
Manufacturing costs are dropping , and installation costs will also fall as photovoltaic cells integrated into building materials replace free - standing panels for domestic applications .
Current technologies should be manufacturing at less than $ 1 per watt within a few years ( see _Nature_ 454 , 558–559 ; 2008 ) .
The cost per kilowatt - hour of concentrated solar thermal power is estimated by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory ( NREL ) in Golden , Colorado , at about $ 0.17 .
Capacity : Earth receives about 100,000 TW of solar power at its surface — enough energy every hour to supply humanity 's energy needs for a year .
There are parts of the Sahara Desert , the Gobi Desert in central Asia , the Atacama in Peru or the Great Basin in the United States where a gigawatt of electricity could be generated using today 's photovoltaic cells in an array 7 or 8 kilometres across .
Theoretically , the world 's entire primary energy needs could be served by less than a tenth of the area of the Sahara .
Advocates of solar cells point to a calculation by the NREL claiming that solar panels on all usable residential and commercial roof surfaces could provide the United States with as much electricity per annum as the country used in 2004 .
In more temperate climes things are not so promising : in Britain one might expect an annual insolation of about 1,000 kilowatt - hours per metre on a south - facing panel tilted to take account of latitude : at 10 % efficiency , that means more than 60 square metres per person would be needed to meet current UK electricity consumption .
Advantages :
The Sun represents an effectively unlimited supply of fuel at no cost , which is widely distributed and leaves no residue .
The public accepts solar technology and in most places approves of it — it is subject to less geopolitical , environmental and aesthetic concern than nuclear , wind or hydro , although extremely large desert installations might elicit protests .
Photovoltaics can often be installed piecemeal — house by house and business by business .
In these settings , the cost of generation has to compete with the retail price of electricity , rather than the cost of generating it by other means , which gives solar a considerable boost .
The technology is also obviously well suited to off - grid generation and thus to areas without well developed infrastructure .
Both photovoltaic and concentrated solar thermal technologies have clear room for improvement .
It is not unreasonable to imagine that in a decade or two new technologies could lower the cost per watt for photovoltaics by a factor of ten , something that is almost unimaginable for any other non-carbon electricity source .
Disadvantages :
The ultimate limitation on solar power is darkness .
Solar cells do not generate electricity at night , and in places with frequent and extensive cloud cover , generation fluctuates unpredictably during the day .
Some concentrated solar thermal systems get around this by storing up heat during the day for use at night ( molten salt is one possible storage medium ) , which is one of the reasons they might be preferred over photovoltaics for large installations .
Another possibility is distributed storage , perhaps in the batteries of electric and hybrid cars ( see page 810 ) .
Another problem is that large installations will usually be in deserts , and so the distribution of the electricity generated will pose problems .
A 2006 study by the German Aerospace Centre proposed that by 2050 Europe could be importing 100 GW from an assortment of photovoltaic and solar thermal plants across the Middle East and North Africa .
But the report also noted that this would require new direct - current high - voltage electricity distribution systems .
A possible drawback of some advanced photovoltaic cells is that they use rare elements that might be subject to increases in cost and restriction in supply .
It is not clear , however , whether any of these elements is either truly constrained — more reserves might be made economically viable if demand were higher — or irreplaceable .
Verdict :
In the middle to long run , the size of the resource and the potential for further technological development make it hard not to see solar power as the most promising carbon - free technology .
But without significantly enhanced storage options it cannot solve the problem in its entirety .
Ocean energy
Credit : J. TAYLOR
The oceans offer two sorts of available kinetic energy — that of the tides and that of the waves .
Neither currently makes a significant contribution to world electricity generation , but this has not stopped enthusiasts from developing schemes to make use of them .
There are undoubtedly some places where , thanks to peculiarities of geography , tides offer a powerful resource .
In some situations that potential would best be harnessed by a barrage that creates a reservoir not unlike that of a hydroelectric dam , except that it is refilled regularly by the pull of the Moon and the Sun , rather than being topped up slowly by the runoff of falling rain .
But although there are various schemes for tidal barrages under discussion — most notably the Severn Barrage between England and Wales , which proponents claim could offer as much as 8 GW — the plant on the Rance estuary in Brittany , rated at 240 MW , remains the world 's largest tidal - power plant more than 40 years after it came into use .
There are also locations well suited to tidal - stream systems — submerged turbines that spin in the flowing tide like windmills in the air .
The 1.2 MW turbine installed this summer in the mouth of Strangford Lough , Northern Ireland , is the largest such system so far installed .
Most technologies for capturing wave power remain firmly in the testing phase .
Individual companies are working through an array of potential designs , including machines that undulate on waves like a snake , bob up and down as water passes over them , or nestle on the coastline to be regularly overtopped by waves that power turbines as the water drains off .
The European Marine Energy Centre 's test bed off the United Kingdom 's Orkney Islands , where manufacturers can hook up prototypes to a marine electricity grid and test how well they withstand the pounding waves , is a leading centre of research .
Pelamis Wave Power , a company based in Edinburgh , UK , for instance , has moved from testing there to installing three machines off the coast of Portugal , which together will eventually generate 2.25 MW .
Costs : Barrage costs differ markedly from site to site , but are broadly comparable to costs for hydropower .
At an estimated cost of £ 15 billion ( US$ 30 billion ) or more , the capital costs of the Severn Barrage would be about $ 4 million per megawatt .
A 2006 report from the British Carbon Trust , which spurs investment in non-carbon energy , puts the costs of tidal - stream electricity in the $ 0.20 –0.40 per kilowatt - hour range , with wave systems running up to $ 0.90 per kilowatt - hour .
Neither technology is anywhere close to the large - scale production needed to significantly drive such costs down .
Capacity :
The interaction of Earth 's mass with the gravitational fields of the Moon and the Sun is estimated to produce about 3 TW of tidal energy — rather modest for such an astronomical source ( although enough to play a key role in keeping the oceans mixed — see Nature 447 , 522 –524 ; 2007 ) .
Of this , perhaps 1 TW is in shallow enough waters to be easily exploited , and only a small part of that is realistically available .
EDF , a French power company developing tidal power off Brittany , says that the tidal - stream potential off France is 80 % of that available all round Europe , and yet it is still little more than a gigawatt .
The power of ocean waves is estimated at more than 100 TW .
The European Ocean Energy Association estimates that the accessible global resource is between 1 and 10 terawatts , but sees much less than that as recoverable with current technologies .
An analysis in the MRS Bulletin in April 2008 holds that about 2 % of the world 's coastline has waves with an energy density of 30 kW m − 1 , which would offer a technical potential of about 500 GW for devices working at 40 % efficiency .
Thus even with a huge amount of development , wave power would be unlikely to get close to the current installed hydroelectric capacity .
Advantages :
Tides are eminently predictable , and in some places barrages really do offer the potential for large - scale generation that would be significant on a countrywide scale .
Barrages also offer some built - in storage potential .
Waves are not constant — but they are more reliable than winds .
Disadvantages :
The available resource varies wildly with geography ; not every country has a coastline , and not every coastline has strong tides or tidal streams , or particularly impressive waves .
The particularly hot wave sites include Australia 's west coast , South Africa , the western coast of North America and western European coastlines .
Building turbines that can survive for decades at sea in violent conditions is tough .
Barrages have environmental impacts , typically flooding previously intertidal wetlands , and wave systems that flank long stretches of dramatic coastline might be hard for the public to accept .
Tides and waves tend by their nature to be found at the far end of electricity grids , so bringing back the energy represents an extra difficulty .
Surfers have also been known to object …
Verdict : Marginal on the global scale .
Box 1 : By the numbers
In 2005 , 18,000 terawatt - hours of electricity were generated .
With almost 9,000 hours in a year , that averages out at a constant 2 TW or so .
Generating capacity is a lot higher than that , because there are peaks and troughs and no plants operate at their full output all of the time .
No analogy makes it easy to picture a terawatt .
A thousandth of a terawatt , a gigawatt , is more comprehensible .
It is the output of a fairly large power station : Sizewell B , one of Britain 's largest nuclear power stations , has an output of about 1.2 GW ; the Hoover Dam on the Colorado River can produce about 1.8 GW .
A megawatt is a thousandth of a gigawatt .
It takes 3 –5 MW to power most modern trains ( or , if you feel flash , you can think of one as the power of two Formula One cars ) .
A kilowatt is easily thought of as an electric fan heater .
Domestic energy consumption is measured in kilowatt - hours .
In 2004 , the highest per capita use of electricity was in Iceland , where it reached 28,200 kWh per year .
In the United States it is about 13,300 kWh a year ; 300 million Americans thus use about 400 GW of power .
In Chile the per capita level is 3,100 kWh , in China 1,600 kWh , in India 460 kWh .
The lowest level , in Haiti , is 30 kWh .
Box 2 : Farther out Fusion power could meet all Earth 's energy needs .
It just requires two heavy isotopes of hydrogen and the technology to use them .
The reactors would produce some low - level radioactive waste , but only a minor amount compared with nuclear fission .
The problem is the necessary technology — commercial reactors are unlikely before the 2040s .
Another far - off dream is the space - based solar power satellite .
In orbit , solar panels could soak up sunshine 24/7 , beaming it to Earth as microwaves .
This requires really cheap space travel to lift thousands of tonnes of solar cells into orbit .
At the moment , unfortunately , space travel is really expensive .
Box 3 : Carbon capture and storage Credit : J. TAYLOR
An alternative to renouncing fossil fuels is not to release their CO2 into the atmosphere .
Carbon capture and storage ( CCS ) technology strips CO2 out of exhaust gases and stores it underground .
The technology could reduce carbon emissions from power stations by 80 –90 % , although after taking life - cycle factors into account , that number could drop to as little as 67 % .
Estimates of the extra cost of CCS vary widely depending on technology and location , but it could add US $ 0.01 –0.05 to the cost of a kilowatt - hour .
On coal - fired power plants the technology could be competitive if CO2 were priced at around $ 50 per tonne .
Part of the extra cost of CCS is the capital invested in new plant ; part is due to decreased efficiency because of the energy costs of removing the carbon .
For a conventional coal plant , the efficiency loss could be as much as 40 % .
In more modern integrated gasification combined - cycle ( IGCC ) power plants , the capital costs of which are higher , the gasification step produces a CO2 stream that is more easily handled .
CCS thus reduces the efficiency of IGCC plants by less than 20& — and their efficiency is higher to start with .
As yet there are very few IGCC plants , but the possibility of carbon taxes , or indeed more expensive coal , may tip the market their way .
Although early implementations of CCS will probably concentrate on pumping CO2 into depleted oil fields ( where it is used already to help extract the dregs ) , the technology is likely ultimately to be targeted at saline aquifers , which represent by far the largest CO2 storage capacity .
Estimates of global aquifer capacity range from 2,000 Gt CO2 to nearly 11,000 Gt CO2 , although this resource is not evenly distributed around the world .
The Global Energy Technology Strategy Program , led by researchers at the University of Maryland in College Park , estimates that the 8,100 major facilities worldwide that might be candidates for CCS currently emit about 15 Gt CO2 annually .
Aquifers could thus offer centuries of storage at current levels of CO2 , and also allow the use of coal to continue while work progresses on making a less dirty baseload technology possible .
The task is enormous , and serious industrial proof - of - concept studies of the feasibility of CCS have barely begun .
The probability of CCS being widespread in 10 or even 20 years is very low unless the technology is promoted much more aggressively .
The biggest problem is scale .
Capturing 60 % of the CO2 from US coal - fired power stations would mean handling a volume of CO2 daily that rivals the 20 million barrels of oil moved around by the oil industry , according to a 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology study .
Creating such an infrastructure is not impossible , but setting it up in a decade or two is a tall order .

Why do humans cooperate in things as diverse as environment conservation or the creation of fairer societies , even when they do n’t receive anything in exchange or , worst , they might even be penalized ?
This is a question that has puzzled academics for centuries , especially since in evolution the basis for the “ survival of the fittest ” is , after all , selfishness .
But in an article just published in the journal Nature , three Portuguese theoretical physicists developed a mathematical model capable of providing a way out from this conundrum through the introduction of social diversity - a ubiquitous characteristic of modern social networks - and suggesting that that the act of cooperation may depend on one ’s social context / ranking .
And in fact , when social diversity was taken into account the numbers of those cooperating increased in direct relation to the system diversity .
Furthermore , cooperation , according to this model , spreads even faster when the act of cooperation is considered more important than the amount given , with these societies presenting also a much fairer distribution of wealth .
This new mathematic model for society ’s evolution is particularly interesting because not only it shows a logic behind the large numbers of cooperators that we know that exist in all human societies , but also it gives us a glimpse of the principles that can help “ pushing ” them into a better , fairer , path .
Evolutionary game theory is a mathematical approach used to study ( and predict ) the evolution of social interactions , in which the study of conflict and decision - making is treated – like its name indicates – as a game .
One such example are public good games ( or PGG ) , which are frequently used to study cooperation as they look into social behaviour towards public goods - such as education , free health or even street lightning – those that every one can benefit from , regardless of how much they contribute ( or not ) to create it .
Here because the individual ’s benefits are independent of he / she contribution the most rational and selfish strategy ( both in the games and real life ) is to chose no-cooperation , what we know does not happen in real life .
This is a good example of how difficult it has been to understand and create a theoretical model capable of explaining the emergence and prevalence of cooperation not only among humans but many other species .
What Jorge M. Pacheco and Marta D. Santos ( University of Lisbon , Portugal ) did - together with Francisco C. Santos ( Free University of Brussels , Belgium ) - in order to overcome this apparent paradox , was to introduce into PGG , for the first time , a new variant – social diversity – in contrast to the models previously used in which all individuals were equivalent .
Social diversity here refers to the characteristics typical of most social networks : the existence of individuals with different numbers and types of social connections , with few very highly connected and most with very few connections .
Since PGG are represented as a mathematical formula , diversity was introduced as a new variable in the equation .
Then Santos , Santos and Pacheco used this new altered formula to calculate the percentage of collaborators in the community , in function of population diversity ( in PGG this would refer to the number and type of games each individual participated or , in other words , his / her “ popularity ” ) .
And in fact , it was found , that in populations with high diversity , as diversity increased also did collaboration levels .
The way PGG work is that each individual pays a certain amount to play ( defectors play but do not pay / cooperate ) and in the end profit , which is the total amount gathered in a game , is divided by all players .
The reason why diversity increased cooperation had to with the fact that those few individuals with more connections and playing more games ( the cooperators ) would also have much higher “ profits ” and their impressive success would lead the other players to imitate their behaviour ( even when the behaviour per se did not seem to improve directly their own life ) resulting in an exponential increase of cooperation .
In the same way , in real life the more connected / popular individuals are emulated , becoming role models and opinion makers .
Equally the model also predicted that even when no-cooperators lead to new no -cooperators ( as it happens many times in real life where this kind of behaviour can spread within groups ) this will result in less profit , less success and eventually their own self - extinction with only a few sporadic ones left to parasite cooperators .
Furthermore , it was also shown that the increase in cooperation was particularly accelerated when all individuals contributed to the games with the same total contribution , independently of the number of games played .
This corresponds , in real life , to saying that if the act of contributing to the public good was seen as more important than the amount contributed , the percentage of collaborators in a community would grew much faster .
Interestingly , the model , when applied in a more economical perspective , also suggests that these communities , with high diversity and where the act of cooperation is what matters , will also have a much fairer wealth distribution .
Although this is obviously a very simple mathematical model and reality will never be as linear , Santos , Santos and Pacheco ’s results gives us a total new perspective on how to look at ways of increasing cooperation / altruism and , consequently , also on how to create more successful societies , concerning issues as crucial to our survival as the protection of the environment or fairer social relationships , contributing in this way to the construction of a more peaceful world with less conflict and destruction .

The new iPhone marked an important shift in the company ’s relationship with software programmers .
The first iPhone did n’t let outsiders write legitimate software for the device , though hackers did so anyway .
Apple reversed course with the 3G and gave outside programmers tools to build iPhone applications and sell them on iTunes .
But developers , too , are irked by Apple ’s secrecy and limits on the kind of programs they can design .
An unusually restrictive agreement they must sign keeps them from comparing notes even with fellow programmers .
They also complain that Apple has limited their access to the iPhone ’s inner workings .
For example , non-Apple programmers can’t reach into a user ’s iTunes library and play a song or display cover art .
Apple has kept developers in the dark as to why some applications are rejected or , in rare cases , removed from the iTunes store without warning or explanation .
One such program let people use the iPhone ’s cell service to connect a computer to the Internet .
Its developer , a company called Nullriver , did not respond to a message seeking comment , but wrote of its consternation on its blog .
DoApp , a small mobile - software company in Minneapolis , said it took two months for Apple to review and ultimately reject its 99 - cent whoopie cushion application .

No soup for you !
Your apps are gone ! “
Beavers also grumbled about crashing Mac hard drives and terrible iPhone 3G service .
Even so , he said he ’d still buy Apple products on the strength of their design – and because Apple gave small companies like DoApp the same access to the iTunes store as industry big shots .
Baba Shiv , a professor of marketing at the Stanford Graduate School of Business , compares Apple ’s fan base to Harley - Davidson motorcycle riders who pass over arguably higher - quality Japanese bikes .
The critical move that changed Apple ’s relationship with users was the launch of the iPod , Shiv said .
Apple went from being a private luxury – a maker of niche products – to a mainstream one , and wormed its way deeper into customers ’ psyche .
" In the public domain , the coolness factor matters , “ he said .
Indeed , an iPod " halo effect “ is thought to be one big reason why Macs have boosted their share of the U.S. personal - computer market to nearly 8 percent .
Shiv said Apple ’s fans play down negative information to explain their relationship to the brand – and justify spending more for products that may not be better than the competition’s .
Once that loyalty is formed , " the transgression has to be so egregious for someone to completely change the narrative , “ Shiv said .
" If something like this had happened to Microsoft , the long - term impact would be much more for Microsoft than for Apple . “

Seawater Greenhouse Project Could Make Deserts Fertile
September 2nd , 2008 by Ariel Schwartz
Solar power — is there anything it ca n’t do ?
British scientists have found a new use for solar technology with the Sahara Forest Project , a proposed plan to combine greenhouses that use seawater to grow crops with solar power installations .
The greenhouse - solar power combination could potentially provide food , fresh water and energy to deserts .
According to the project ’s designers , the technology works by having greenhouses use solar farms to power seawater evaporators .
Cool air is pumped through the greenhouses , reducing the temperature by about 15 C compared to outside .
Evaporators are placed in the greenhouses to condense water vapor , which is used to water crops and clean the solar mirrors .
The project ’s designers believe that virtually any vegetable can be produced using this technique .
The potential cost of the Sahara Forest Project is relatively low — about £ 65 m for 20 hectares of greenhouse combined with a 10 MW concentrated solar power installation — and countries across the Middle East have expressed interest in hosting demonstrations of the technology .
Of course , deserts can also produce lush vegetation using permaculture farming practices that are much cheaper to implement .
But if countries are willing to invest in the Sahara Forest Project , more power to them — literally .

Man -made climate change advocates scramble to explain away failure of global warming to appear as ordered
Paul Joseph Watson
Prison Planet
Thursday , August 21 , 2008
Man -made global warming advocates are scrambling to explain away the fact that 2008 has so far been the coolest year in five years , as climate change alarmists face embarrassment amidst a barrage of evidence that the planet has embarked on a clear and natural cooling trend .
“ The first half of 2008 was the coolest for at least five years , the World Meteorological Organisation ( WMO ) said on Wednesday , ” reports Reuters , adding that it may actually be the coolest since 2000 , but the rest of the article is a strained and bias effort to pin the blame solely on the periodic weather event La Nina .
In reality , there has been no global warming since 1998 as temperatures leveled off and are now beginning to plummet as a result of dwindling sunspot activity .
( ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW )
A dramatic cooling trend is being observed across the planet even as people like Al Gore continue to claim that the threat of global warming mandates the poor and middle class be hit with CO2 taxes in order to prevent climate change .
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Both anecdotal evidence and hard data indicates that the planet is in the beginning stages of a significant downturn in global temperatures .
Following the end of the Sun ’s most active period in over 11,000 years , the last 10 years have displayed a clear cooling trend as temperatures post - 1998 leveled out and are now plummeting .
China recently experienced its coldest winter in 100 years while northeast America was hit by record snow levels and Britain suffered its coldest April in decades as late - blooming daffodils were pounded with hail and snow on an almost daily basis .
The British summer has also left many yearning for global warming , with temperatures in June and July rarely struggling to get over 16 degrees and on one occasion even dropping as low as 9 degrees in the middle of the afternoon .
“ Summer heat continues in short supply , continuing a trend that has dominated much of the 21st Century ’s opening decade , ” reports the Chicago Tribune .
“ There have been only 162 days 90 degrees or warmer at Midway Airport over the period from 2000 to 2008 .
That ’s by far the fewest 90 - degree temperatures in the opening nine years of any decade on record here since 1930 . ”
According to an Associated Press report , The Farmers Almanac is now also predicting “ below - average temperatures for most of the U.S. ”
The publication boasts of an 85 per cent accuracy rate for its forecasts which are given two years in advance .
“ The almanac ’s 2009 edition , which goes on sale Tuesday , says at least two - thirds of the country can expect colder than average temperatures , with only the Far West and Southeast in line for near - normal readings , ” states the article .
The reason ?
Sunspot activity has dwindled .
There have only been a handful of days in the past two months where any sunspot activity has been observed and over 400 spotless days have been recorded in the current solar cycle .
As we reported last week , the Armagh observatory , which has been measuring sun cycles for over 200 years .
predicts that global temperatures will drop by two degrees over the next 20 years as solar activity grinds to a halt and the planet drastically cools down , potentially heralding the onset of a new ice age .
“ Based on the past Armagh measurements , this suggests that over the next two decades , global temperatures may fall by about 2 degrees C — that is , to a level lower than any we have seen in the last 100 years … .
” Temperatures have already fallen by about 0.5 degrees C over the past 12 months and , if this is only the start of it , it would be a serious concern , ” concludes David Watt .
In addition , Victor Manuel Velasco Herrera of the Institute of Geophysics at the University of Mexico states that “ In about ten years the Earth will enter a “ little ice age ” which will last from 60 to 80 years and may be caused by the decrease in solar activity , ” according to a report in the major Mexican newspaper Milenio Diario .

Comment on this article
When the Constitution was written , “ We the People ” did not mean all of us .
Slavery created a legacy of oppression for Black people that is woven into our institutions today — from education and health care to the criminal legal system .
We need structural reform to dismantle the deep - seated racism and inequity that permeates our institutions — including law enforcement .
Black people are over - policed , overrepresented in jails and prisons , and disproportionately subjected to police brutality .
In the wake of the countless Black lives lost at the hands of police , we ’re demanding justice and fighting for a reimagined vision of policing in America — one that limits the scope , power , and responsibilities of police .
Valuing
Black life does n’t just mean spending less on police — it means investing more in Black communities .
To create a world where “ we the people ” truly means all of us , we must dismantle systemic racism and work to repair centuries of harm inflicted on communities of color .
Anthrax Scientist Kills Himself as FBI Closes
In Anthrax researcher had been under psychiatric care before his death .
Aug. 1 , 2008  --
One of the nation 's top biodefense researchers has apparently taken his own life , just as the FBI zeroed in on him as a suspect in the deadly 2001 anthrax attacks .
Sources familiar with the investigation tell ABC News that 62 - year - old Bruce E. Ivins , who worked at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) at Fort Detrick , Md. , died at a Maryland hospital Tuesday of a prescription drug overdose .
The story of the Ivins investigation was first reported by the Los Angeles Times .
A source familiar with the investigation told ABC News that the government did not officially notify Ivins that he was a target of the investigation or that he was close to being indicted .
Ivins ' attorneys learned of the government 's intent to move forward with the prosecution of their client after he died on Tuesday , but had suspected the case was headed in that direction based on investigators ' focus on the scientist , the source said .
Ivins ' death came as FBI agents had been aggressively interviewing friends , family and associates about the possibility he was responsible for a series of anthrax mailings in the fall of 2001 that left five dead , sickened 17 and terrorized a nation still reeling from the Sept. 11 attacks .
The Justice Department released a statement on the anthrax investigation Friday , noting that there have been " significant developments " in the joint DOJ , FBI and U.S. Postal Inspection Service probe , but declining to go into detail .
Though they were " able to confirm that substantial progress has been made in the investigation by bringing to bear new and sophisticated scientific tools , " the statement added that the investigative agencies " have significant obligations to the victims of these attacks and their families that must be fulfilled before any additional information on the investigation can be made public . "
Additionally , investigative documents in the case remain under seal , but the statement said investigators " anticipate being able to provide additional details in the near future . "
" I think it 's incredibly disheartening that we as victims and survivors will never be able to sit in a courtroom with this man -- if indeed he was the person responsible -- and face him , and share with him how he so dramatically traumatized us and forever changed our lives , " victim Casey Chamberlain , a former executive assistant at NBC News , said in a statement .
" I will never stop thinking about this case as long as I live . "
Ivins had actually helped the FBI in the anthrax investigation and had ties to the location in New Jersey where the anthrax was mailed .
The toxin arrived via mail to Capitol Hill offices and at news organizations in Florida and New York .
In a statement released Friday morning , Ivins ' attorneys , led by Paul F. Kemp , asserted his late client 's innocence and said they are " disappointed that we will not have the opportunity to defend his good name and reputation in a court of law . "
Ivins had cooperated with investigators and appeared before the grand jury " many times , " but had consistently maintained his innocence , the source familiar with the investigation told ABC News .
His defense team had noticed Ivins was under increasing strain as a result of the investigation , and there was concern about how he was handling the news , the source said .
The source described the investigation as a " circumstantial case , " with no direct evidence against Ivins , who was one of at least 30 people who had access to the anthrax at various times .
FBI officials had long targeted Fort Detrick as the possible source of the anthrax attacks because of the facility 's intensive research on anthrax as a biological weapon , but some seemed skeptical of the case against their colleague .
One official went as far as to call the FBI 's actions " irresponsible " and said of Ivins , " He was a nice guy .
He did his work and kept to himself . "
" The USAMRIID family mourns the loss of Dr. Bruce Ivins , who served the Institute for more than 35 years as a civilian microbiologist , " read the official statement from Fort Detrick .
The statement also made mention of the fact that in 2003 , Ivins received the highest possible civilian honor from the Defense Department , the Decoration for Exceptional Civilian Service .
" We will miss him very much , " it ended .
Investigators obtained warrants to search the Ivins home twice , and they had taken a sample of his DNA , the source said .
" For six years , Dr. Ivins fully cooperated with that investigation , assisting the government in every way that was asked of him , " Kemp 's statement said .
Noting his years of service as a military scientist , Kemp added , " The relentless pressure of accusation and innuendo takes its toll in different ways on different people , as has already been seen in this investigation .
In Dr. Ivins ' case , it led to his untimely death . "
Even before his death , court records obtained by ABC News from the District Court of Maryland for Frederick County paint a picture of a man who had recently been displaying the effects of that pressure .
A social worker named Jean Duley had filed a protection order against Ivins last month , alleging that he had made " threats of homicidal intent " in mid-July .
The court documents also indicate that Ivins had been admitted to a hospital in the area and was under psychiatric care .
" Client has a history dating to his graduate days of homicidal threats , actions , plans threats & actions toward therapist [ sic ] .
Dr. David Irwin his psychiatrist called him homicidal , sociopathic , with clear intentions , " a handwritten page submitted with the application stated .
" Will testify with other details FBI involved , currently under investigation & will be charged w/ 5 capital murders .
I have been subpoena [ sic ] to testify before a federal grand jury August 1 , 2008 in Washington , D.C. "
A judge granted the petition , ordering Ivins stay away from Duley 's home , work and not to contact her , but the court officially dismissed the case Thursday because of Ivins ' death .
According to the source familiar with the case , a police officer filled out the paperwork not to secure the order , but rather to get an emergency evaluation for Ivins .
Duley , who worked in Ivins ' psychiatrist 's office , recounted what Ivins said in the course of therapy to the officer , the source said .
ABC News attempted to speak to Duley at her Williamsport , Md. , home Friday , but a man who answered the door would not identify himself , confirm that Duley lives at the residence or comment on the information contained in the court documents .
Earlier Friday afternoon , policemen responded to the Ivins residence in Frederick -- just across the street from Fort Detrick -- to speak to Ivins ' widow , Diane , about a complaint she had called in about the media presence outside her home .
Dozens of reporters and camera crews lined the street outside the small two - story home with dark red shutters and white plastic siding .
Diane Ivins has not spoken to the media gathered outside her home .
" While understanding the job that you guys have to do , she just does n't want to be bothered , " Frederick Police Department Det. Sgt. Bruce DeGrange said after he spoke to her .
" She seemed fine , " he added .
" She 's a little upset about the attention , but she seems fine . "
In regards to the anthrax case , which has frustrated government investigators for years , FBI Director Robert Mueller said in a recent interview with ABC News that he was confident the case would be solved .
" We 've made progress in the investigation -- I 'm comfortable that the investigation is on course and that ultimately it will be successful , " Mueller said .
But there have been major missteps in this case , and the FBI has thought it was close before .
In June , the government settled a lawsuit with another scientist from Fort Detrick , agreeing to pay Steven Hatfill nearly $ 6 million amid allegations he was unfairly targeted and humiliated by leaks to the press .
In August 2002 , then - U.S. Attorney General John Aschcroft named Hatfill as a person of interest in the mysterious mail attacks , but he has never been charged in connection with the case .
As for the ongoing investigation into the attacks , the anthrax task force is currently comprised of 17 FBI special agents and 10 U.S. Postal Service inspectors .
As part of the probe , known as " Amerithrax , " investigators have " executed approximately 75 searches and conducted more than 9,100 interviews in the relentless pursuit of the perpetrator of these attacks , " according to the Justice Department .
The bureau has not commented extensively on the investigation , but in the fall of 2006 , FBI scientist Doug Beecher , a member of the bureau 's Hazardous Materials Response Unit based at the its laboratory at Quantico , Va. , wrote in an article that no specialized equipment or specialized knowledge of bioengineering was needed to pull off the 2001 attacks .
Beecher 's article , which appeared in the journal Applied and Environmental Microbiology , is a rare example of the FBI disclosing information on the anthrax investigation .
According to Homeland Security officials , President Bush occasionally asks how the investigation is proceeding during his morning intelligence briefing .
ABC News ' Jason Ryan contributed to this report .

THE modern history of Islamic finance is often dated to the 1970s , with the launch of Islamic banks in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
But its roots stretch back 14 centuries .
Islamic finance rests on the application of Islamic law , or sharia , whose primary sources are the Koran and the sayings of the Prophet Muhammad .
Sharia emphasises justice and partnership .
In the world of finance that translates into a ban on speculation ( or gharar ) and on the charging of interest ( riba ) .
The idea of a lender levying a straight interest charge , regardless of how the underlying assets fare in an uncertain world , offends against these principles — though some Muslims dispute this , arguing that the literature in sharia covering business practices is small and that terms such as “ usury ” and “ speculation ” are open to interpretation .
Companies that operate in immoral industries , such as gambling or pornography , are also out of bounds , as are companies that have too much borrowing ( typically defined as having debt totalling more than 33 % of the firm 's stockmarket value ) .
Such criteria mean that sharia - compliant investors steer clear of highly leveraged conventional banks , a wise choice in recent months .
Despite these prohibitions , Islamic financiers are confident that they can create their own versions of the important bits of conventional finance .
The judgment of what is and is not allowed under sharia is made by boards of scholars , many of whom act as a kind of spiritual rating agency , working closely with lawyers and bankers to create instruments and structure transactions that meet the needs of the market without offending the requirements of their faith .
Non-Muslims may find the distinctions between conventional finance and Islamic finance a trifle contrived .
An options contract to buy a security at a set price at a date three months hence is frowned upon as speculation .
A contract to buy the same security at the same price , with 5 % of the payment taken upfront and the balance taken in three months upon delivery , is sharia - compliant .
Then again , winning over non-Muslims is not really the point .
There is no ultimate authority for sharia compliance .
Some worry that this may hold the industry back .
Malaysia has tackled this by creating a national sharia board .
Some industry bodies , notably the Accounting and Auditing Organisation for Islamic Financial Institutions ( AAOIFI ) in Bahrain , are working towards common standards .
That a few scholars dominate the boards of the big international institutions also helps create consistency .
But differences between national jurisdictions — between pious Saudi Arabia and more liberal Malaysia , say , are likely to remain .
Both of these countries feature in the top three markets for Islamic finance , measured by the quantity of sharia - compliant assets ( see table ) .
Top is Iran , although international sanctions keep its industry isolated .
The Gulf states , awash with liquidity and with a roster of huge infrastructure projects to finance , are the most dynamic markets .
Britain is the most developed Western centre , although France , with a much larger Muslim population , wants to close the gap .
The tail - powered swimming of modern baleen ( Mysticeti ) and toothed ( Odontoceti ) whales evolved from the hip wiggling style of the ancient whale Georgiacetus .
Illustration by Mary Parrish , Smithsonian Institution
The first whales once swam the seas by wiggling large hind feet , research now suggests .
These new findings shed light on the mysterious shift these leviathans made away from land .
The ancestors of whales once strode on land on four legs , just as other mammals do .
Over time , as they evolved to dwell in water , their front legs became flippers while they lost their back legs and hips , although modern whales all still retain traces of pelvises , and occasionally throwbacks are born with vestiges of hind limbs .
A great deal of mystery surrounds how the anatomy of the first whales changed to propel them through the water .
A key piece of that puzzle would be the discovery of when exactly the wide flukes on their powerful tails arose .
" The origin of flukes is one of the last steps in the transition from land to sea , " explained vertebrate paleontologist Mark Uhen of the Alabama Museum of Natural History in Tuscaloosa .
To shed light on this mystery , Uhen analyzed new fossils that amateur bone hunters discovered exposed along riverbanks in Alabama and Mississippi .
These bones once belonged to the ancient whale Georgiacetus , which swam along the Gulf Coast of North America roughly 40 million years ago , back when Florida was mostly submerged underwater .
This creature reached some 12 feet in length and likely used its sharp teeth to dine on squid and fish .
The first whales known to possess flukes are close relatives of Georgiacetus that date back to 38 million years ago .
But while only about 2 million years separate Georgiacetus from these other whales ,
Uhen now finds that Georgiacetus apparently did not possess flukes .
The new 2 - inch - long tail vertebra he analyzed — one of some 20 tail vertebrae the ancient whale had — is not flattened as the vertebrae near whales flukes are .
Instead ,
Uhen suggests that Georgiacetus wiggled large back feet like paddles in order to swim .
Past research showed this ancient whale had large hips , which suggested it also had large hind legs .
Oddly , scientists had also found that its pelvis was not attached to its spine .
This meant its hind legs could not paddle in the water or support the whale 's body weight on land , leaving it a puzzle as to what they were for until now .
" The idea we are now helping confirm is that this ancient whale wiggled its hips to swim , moving its feet like hydrofoils or paddles .
So it swam rather like a modern whale , which undulates its body up and down , " Uhen told LiveScience .
The scientists detailed their findings in the latest issue of the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology .
I have to laugh at the brouhaha Sarah Palin ’s ascension to national prominence has stirred , especially the consternation in the Obama camp and the media ( or do I repeat myself ? ) .
One can only imagine the spittle - flecked computer monitors of the anti-Palinistas  especially Andrew Sullivan , whose hatred of the caribou - shooting gal from up north has even surpassed his once - infamous hatred of the peace movement , which he habitually smeared as a “ fifth column ” secretly working on behalf of Osama bin Laden .
I get to laugh , because , being a right - wing antiwar type , I do n’t have a dog in this fight .
Her views on matters of domestic policy and morality , considered by those limousine liberals over at the Huffington Post to be anathema , do n’t faze me in the least .
Everyone ’s entitled to their own religious views , and , in spite of Sullivan ’s hysterical attacks on her as some sort of “ Christianist , ” I see no evidence she wants to establish a state religion or even push her views on anyone , nor do I share Sullivan ’s enthusiasm for gay marriage ( I consider it a plot to reduce the number of gay people by making homosexuality seem boring ) .
I also have to laugh  guffaw , really  at how easily conservatives have been taken in by the Palin choice .
Why , it was only yesterday that the Right was breathing fire out of its nostrils and threatening to sit on its scaly wings come Election Day , what with the “ maverick ” ( i.e. , RINO ) McCain at the top of the Republican ticket .
Now even Rush Limbaugh  who was the loudest anti-McCainiac , if not the most articulate  is purring like the big tabby - cat he really is , sidling up to Palin and exhorting the party faithful to rally ’round the banner of Palinism .
But what is Palinism , anyway ?
Well , we do n’t know much , as she ’s being kept as incommunicado as , say , Mordechai Vanunu  the Israeli nuclear technician who was placed in solitary confinement for 17 years and is still forbidden from speaking to the media .
Gee , I wish Charlie Gibson had asked her about Vanunu .
He would ’ve gotten a blank stare , but you can be sure her neoconservative handlers would have briefed her afterward and given her the Correct Line , which would doubtless be the same answer she gave Gibson when he asked her about giving the green light to Israel to strike Iran .
“ I do n’t think we can second guess what Israel has to do to secure its nation . “
She said that no less than three times , repeating the same formulaic answer almost word - for - word , as if she ’d had it drilled into her head by AIPAC lobbyists and the sinister Bill Kristol for hours , even weeks , beforehand  which , it turns out , she had .
The London Telegraph reports :
“ Comments by the governor of Alaska in her first television interview , in which she said NATO may have to go to war with Russia and took a tough line on Iran ’s nuclear program , were the result of two weeks of briefings by neoconservatives . ”
Oh , I can picture the scene as if it were happening before my eyes : Strapped to a chair and forced to read a year ’s worth of Weekly Standards out loud while having the audio version of the complete works of Norman Podhoretz piped into her ears , poor pistol - packin ’ Sarah was no match for her neocon interrogators , who ironed all those right - wing populist quirks out of her malleable mindset .
Now , Sarah , repeat after me : jury nullification is nuts , forget about Alaskan independence , and always , always remember , you hate Ron Paul !
And of course Bill Kristol is right there in the middle of the action , as the Telegraph informs us :
“ Sources in the McCain camp , the Republican Party , and Washington think tanks say Mrs. Palin was identified as a potential future leader of the neoconservative cause in June 2007 .
That was when the annual summer cruise organized by the right - of - center Weekly Standard magazine docked in Juneau , the Alaskan state capital , and the pundits on board took tea with Governor Palin . ”
I just knew there was a reason why the Standard crew was headed for the un-alluring waters of Alaska !
These maritime excursions are a tradition with ideological journals : National Review is always going to some place other than continental Europe , while the Nation assiduously avoids Cuban waters by imitating the Standard and making for the North Pole ( I wonder who ’s entertaining the Nation - istas with piano renditions of “ The Internationale ” now that Christopher Hitchens has gone neocon ) .
In any case , many liberal commentators are so flummoxed by the choice of Palin as McCain ’s wing - woman that they are reduced to sputtering outrage and sheer malevolence , even going after her family in a way that ought to be off limits in American politics .
This is precisely what the neocons anticipated , and the backlash against the media was played to the hilt at the GOP convention , to great effect .
Just look at the poll numbers .
What Palin ’s critics on the Left have failed to understand is that the choice of Palin was n’t about winning the election with some sort of brilliant maneuver , or even reaching out to the Clinton supporters , who in reality would be far more attracted by Joe Lieberman on the ticket .
The Palin choice is all about unifying the GOP and reining in the rambunctious Republican Right , which was showing signs of serious disaffection .
By that standard , the operation proved to be a tremendous success .
Even Pat Buchanan , an avowed enemy of the neocons , laughed with approval as he exclaimed “ She ’s one of us ! ”
Well , perhaps , but that was before the neocons got to her , just as they got to George W. Bush and Dan Quayle ( another pupil of Kristol ’s ) .
Palin ’s transformation from a rank - and - file right - wing populist into a neocon pod-person was put on display for all the world to see in her recent interview with ABC News , the first part of which was entirely given over to foreign policy .
It is a fascinating exchange , one in which Palin hits all the right neocon notes .
War with Russia , in her view , is entirely possible : we must side with Georgia , because they are “ free , ” like Ukraine , and both should be admitted to NATO .
Like both McCain and Obama , Palin believes the Russians started it :
“ First off , we ’re going to continue good relations with Saakashvili there .
I was able to speak with him the other day and giving him my commitment , as John McCain ’s running mate , that we will be committed to Georgia .
And we ’ve got to keep an eye on Russia .
For Russia to have exerted such pressure in terms of invading a smaller democratic country , unprovoked , is unacceptable and we have to keep
“ GIBSON : You believe unprovoked .
“ PALIN : I do believe unprovoked and we have got to keep our eyes on Russia , under the leadership there .
I think it was unfortunate .
That manifestation that we saw with that invasion of Georgia shows us some steps backwards that Russia has recently taken away from the race toward a more democratic nation with democratic ideals .
That ’s why we have to keep an eye on Russia . ”
The myth of Russian “ aggression ” in the Caucasus is contrary to all evidence  and the testimony of a former Georgian defense minister , who says Saakashvili had been planning an invasion of South Ossetia for years .
However , what ’s really interesting about her comments is that she admits communicating with a foreign head of state .
So when Gibson asked her previously if she had ever talked to a foreign head of state , and she , after much hemming and hawing , said she had n’t , why did n’t she mention Saakashvili ?
Was it because she ’s slow , or because she knew , on some level , that her contact with a foreign leader pledging U.S. support in a volatile region of the world was highly improper ?
What I find really striking , however , is how easily and lightly Palin takes the possibility of war with Russia , a state armed with as many nuclear weapons as the U.S.
Asked if she would go to war with Russia in a bid to defend our fellow NATO members , she admitted to the possibility and seemed not at all horrified by it , though she quickly backed down with reassurances that of course we would work with our allies to impose sanctions .
From the interview :
“ Well , you know , the Rose Revolution , the Orange Revolution , those actions have showed us that those democratic nations , I believe , deserve to be in NATO .
Putin thinks otherwise .
Obviously , he thinks otherwise , but
“ GIBSON : And under the NATO treaty , would n’t we then have to go to war if Russia went into Georgia ?
“ PALIN : Perhaps so .
I mean , that is the agreement when you are a NATO ally , is if another country is attacked , you ’re going to be expected to be called upon and help . ”
NATO is no longer a defensive alliance against a threat that evaporated in 1989 ; it is a League of Democracies , as McCain and his fellow neocons would put it , and membership in the club is a reward for democratic virtue .
Of course , after Saakashvili closed down the opposition ’s television station and called out his thugs to beat up demonstrators in the streets of Tbilisi , the definition of “ democratic ” had to be stretched to the breaking point to mean having a “ pro-American ” foreign policy rather than an internal structure that allows meaningful and vigorous dissent .
But that ’s a minor detail , one that Sarah can safely leave to her neocon handlers , as they whisper talking points into her earpiece .
The apprenticeship of Sarah Palin is an object lesson in how the neocons took over the American Right and saddled the GOP with their agenda of “ big government conservatism ” and perpetual war .
Her brainwashing limns the experience and fate of the larger conservative movement , which has been reduced , these days , to a militaristic cult that remembers nothing of its origins  a movement of neocon pod-people .
You have to hand it to the neocons , however : Sarah Palin will far outdo Dan Quayle in her service to her handlers .
And , who knows , what with McCain already well advanced in years , she may prove just as useful to them as was George W. Bush .
From the neocons ’ perspective , she is indeed ready to become president , should the need should arise , her very inexperience being her chief qualification for the job .
Here again , individual experience limns the larger picture : just as her neocon handlers delight in writing on such a blank slate as Sarah appears to be , so they imprinted their ideological prescriptions on an intellectually bankrupt conservative movement , which had long since lost touch with its traditional moorings .
Mr Kilpatrick had previously refused to resign as mayor
The mayor of the US city of Detroit is to step down after pleading guilty to two charges of obstructing justice .
Kwame Kilpatrick had been charged with misconduct , obstruction of justice and lying under oath to try to cover up an affair with his former chief - of - staff .
He was also accused of sacking a police officer who was investigating reports of a wild party at his mayoral mansion .
Mr Kilpatrick 's plea deal means he will spend 120 days in jail and will pay $ 1 m ( £ 500,000 ) in restitution to the city .
He has also agreed that he will not run for office for five years .
In Wayne County court , Mr Kilpatrick read out a statement in which he admitted to two counts of lying under oath during a police whistle - blower trial in 2007 .
" I did so with the intent to mislead the court and jury and to impede and obstruct the administration of justice , " he said .
Judge David Groner asked Mr Kilpatrick whether he understood he was giving up the right to be considered innocent until proven guilty .
" I gave that up a long time ago , " the mayor replied .
He had faced up to 15 years in prison if convicted .
Rising star Former top aide Ms Beatty has pleaded not guilty to charges Mr Kilpatrick and his former aide Christine Beatty were charged with lying under oath after sexually explicit text messages surfaced that appeared to contradict their sworn denials of the alleged affair .
Ms Beatty has pleaded not guilty to the perjury charges and will appear in court again on 11 September .
A prominent African - American politician who was elected mayor at the age of 31 , Mr Kilpatrick had been considered one of the rising stars of the Democratic Party .
Mr Kilpatrick 's resignation will come into effect in two weeks and he will return to court on 28 October for sentencing .
He already spent one night in jail in August , for violating the terms of his bail by travelling to Canada without informing the court .
City council president Ken Cockrel will serve as interim mayor until special elections can be held .

What are these ?
Added to this is the time people spend with their inbox .
A July 2006 study by ClearContext , an email management tools vendor , surveyed 250 users and discovered that 56 % spent more than two hours a day in their inbox ( bit.ly / email4 ) .
Most felt they got too much email - by January 2008 , 38 % of respondents received more than 100 emails a day - and that it stopped them from doing other things .
Karen Renaud , a lecturer at the University of Glasgow , Scotland , and her colleagues at the University of the West of Scotland discovered that email users fall into three categories : relaxed , driven and stressed .
" The relaxed group do n't let email exert any pressure on their lives , " Dr Renaud says .
" They treat it exactly the way that one would treat the mail : ' I 'll fetch it , I 'll deal with it in my own time , but I 'm not going to let it upset me ' . "
The second group felt " driven " to keep on top of email , but also felt that they could cope with it .
The third group , however , reacted negatively to the pressure of email .
" That causes stress , " says Dr Renaud , " and stress causes all sorts of health problems . "
Dr Renaud 's team discovered that while 64 % of respondents claimed to check their email once an hour , and 35 % said they checked every 15 minutes , they were actually checking it much more frequently - about every five minutes .
For some people , checking email is no longer a conscious and deliberate act , but a compulsion they are barely aware of ( bit.ly / email5 ) .
Tom Stafford , a lecturer at the University of Sheffield , England , and co-author of the book Mind Hacks , believes that the same fundamental learning mechanisms that drive gambling addicts are also at work in email users .
" Both slot machines and email follow something called a ' variable interval reinforcement schedule ' which has been established as the way to train in the strongest habits , " he says .
" This means that rather than reward an action every time it is performed , you reward it sometimes , but not in a predictable way .
So with email , usually when I check it there is nothing interesting , but every so often there 's something wonderful - an invite out or maybe some juicy gossip - and I get a reward . "
This is enough to make it difficult for us to resist checking email , even when we 've only just looked .
The obvious solution is to process email in batches , but this is difficult .
One company delayed delivery by five minutes , but had so many complaints that they had to revert to instantaneous delivery .
People knew that there were emails there and chafed at the bit to get hold of them .
Another solution might be the notification system Growl ( growl.info ) , which puts up a brief message on the screen with details such as the sender and subject line while the user is in other programs .
Presently only available for Mac OS X , a version is being tested for Windows though this , of course , causes the interruptions you are trying to avoid .
Companies are beginning to take these problems seriously , although the " no email days " favoured by Deloitte and Intel have not proved effective .
Deloitte 's " no email Wednesday " was abandoned after a month ( bit.ly / email6 ) and Intel found that there was a " clear incompatibility " between the need of the pilot group to communicate asynchronously with colleagues and the avoidance of email for a whole day ( bit.ly / email7 ) .
No-email days do n't work , says Dr Stafford , " because they do n't help people to change their behaviour while they are actually using email .
Once your email is back , you 're going to respond to it in the same old ways unless you replace your bad habits . "
It 's better to replace email with more appropriate tools .
Roo Reynolds , a " metaverse evangelist " who is joining the BBC to work with social media , has moved away from email for everything but the most formal communications .
" I use other tools ... I 've got a whole set of contacts who love Twitter and if I want to reach them quickly then that 's where they 'll be . "
Mr Reynolds has even begun to think of email as rude and invasive , preferring to use tools such as Twitter and Flickr .
He also uses social networking sites such as Dopplr , which tracks people 's travel , to find out if they are away before he contacts them , and status alerts from instant messenger or Twitter to help him decide if now is a good time to interrupt them .
Other tools , such as blogs and wikis , have decreased the amount of email that he sends and receives , while RSS feeds and recommendations from friends and colleagues allow him to keep abreast of the most important news .
For a tool that business depends so heavily on , we put little thought into how we use email .
Dr Karol Szlichcinski , a business psychologist , recommends providing guidelines and training to give people " ways of reducing the disruption caused by email , ways of managing email so that it does n't run your day .
Organisational norms build up , and people come to expect others to answer emails within a given timeframe , whether that email is important or not . "
We may think email is simple , but its ease of use is deceptive .
For many , it 's a boon , but for an increasing majority it 's the tail that wags the dog .
Keeping control of the inbox
If you find your mouse straying towards the " check email " button far too often , try these tactics :
- Turn off intrusive alerts .
Anything that pops up , flashes , or goes " ding ! " will interrupt you when you 're trying to focus and will trigger a response to check your email .
-
Set your email client to display just the title and first few lines of the email , so you can easily decide if it is important enough to deal with right now .
- Use other tools .
Twitter and instant messaging ( IM ) are better for asking short questions of chosen groups .
Wikis are better for collaborating on documents .
Blogs are better for publishing information and having informal conversations .
- Send fewer emails .
Do you need to hit " reply to all " ?
- Schedule your email .
Set aside time each day to deal with your inbox and ignore it for the rest of the day .
Most people check first thing in the morning and late afternoon .

So far , at least , John McCain 's camp can't be accused of overexposing Sarah Palin .
Two days after McCain shocked the political world by tapping her as his running mate , she was nowhere to be found on the Sunday talk - show circuit .
On Monday , she was kept under wraps as word surfaced of the pregnancy of her 17 - year - old unwed daughter .
Today , Palin 's scheduled appearance in St. Paul , Minn. , as guest of honor at an afternoon gathering by the Republican National Coalition for Life was canceled .
And that did n't sit well with a leading social conservative .
Phyllis Schlafly , who in the mid-1970s almost single - handedly derailed what had been the expected ratification of the Equal Rights Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , told ABC News that a McCain aide notified her late Monday that Palin would not be attending the event .
" I think this is clearly somebody in the McCain campaign who does n't understand where the votes are coming from , " Schlafly said .
" They only told me this at 10 o'clock last night , and it was a call from somebody down the line in the McCain campaign . "
She added : " The pro-lifers who paid $ 95 to come to this event because of Sarah Palin are going to be very unhappy . "
Palin 's appearance was set up before she was picked for the GOP 's national ticket , McCain aides stressed .
And her spokeswoman , Maria Comella , told ABC that Palin needed to pass on the antiabortion event to work on her speech to the Republican National Convention .

I ’ve been involved with high scale systems software projects , mostly database engines , for the last 20 years and I ’ve watched the transition from low level and proprietary languages to C .
Then C to C ++.
Recently I ’ve been thinking a bit about what ’s next .
Back in the very early 90’s when I was Lead Architect on IBM DB2 , I was dead against C++ usage in the Storage Engine and would n’t allow exceptions to be used anywhere in the system .
At the time , the quality of C++ compilers was variable with some being real compilers that were actually fairly well done ( I lead the IBM RS / 6000 C++ team in the late 80s ) while others were Cfront - based and pretty weak .
At the time no compiler , including the one I worked on , did a good job implementing exceptions .
Times change .
SQL Server , for example , is 100 % C++ and it makes excellent use of exception to clean up resources on failure .
The productivity benefits of new programming languages and tools eventually wins out .
When they get broad use , implementations improve reducing the performance tax and , eventually , even very performance sensitive system software make the transition .
I got interested in Java in the mid-90 ’s and more recently I ’ve been using C# quite a bit partly due to where I work and partly because I actually find the language and surrounding tools impressively good .
JITed languages typically do n’t perform as well as statically compiled languages but the advantages completely swamp the minor performance costs .
And , as managed language ( Java , C# , etc. ) implementations improve , the performance tax continues to fall .
There is no question in my mind that managed languages will end up being broadly used in even the most performance critical software systems such as database engines .
Recently , I ’ve gotten interested in Erlang as an systems software implementation language .
By most measures , it looks to be an unlikely choice for high scale system software in that its interpreted , has a functional subset at its core , and uses message passing rather than shared memory and locks .
Basically , it ’s just about the opposite of everything you would find in a modern commercial database kernel .
So what makes it interesting ?
The short answer is all the things that make it an unlikely choice also make it interesting .
Servers are becoming increasingly unbalanced with CPU speeds continuing to outpace memory and network bandwidth .
More and more operations are going to be memory and network bound rather than CPU if they are n’t already .
Trading some CPU resources to get a more robust implementation that is easier to understand and maintain is a good choice .
In addition , CPU speed increases are now coming more from multiple cores than from frequency scaling a single core .
Consequently a language that produces an abundance of parallelism is a an asset rather than a problem .
Finally , large systems software projects like database management systems , operating systems , web servers , IM servers , email systems , etc. are incredibly large and complex .
The Erlang model of spawning many lightweight threads that communicate via message passing is going to be less efficient than the more common shared memory and locks solution but it ’s much easier to get correct .
Erlang also encourages a “ fail fast ” programming model .
I ’ve long argued that this is the only way to get high scale systems software correct ( Designing and Deploying Internet - Scale Services ) .
Certainly Erlang brings a tax as have other new languages that we have adopted over the years .
But , it also bring some of what we need badly right now .
For example , the fail fast programming model is the right one and , when combined with synchronous state redundancy , is how most high - scale systems should be written .
Erlang also encourages the production of a very large number of threads which can be a good thing on very high core count servers .
Message passing rather than shared memory with locks and fail fast with operation restart significantly increases the probability of the software system working correctly through unexpected events .
From my perspective , the syntax of Erlang is less than beautiful but all the advantages above make up for most of that .
The Concurrency and Coordination Runtime is a .
Net runtime that implements some of the features I mention above for languages like C#. George Chrysanthakopoulos , Microsoft CCR Architect , reports that MySpace is using it : MySpace.com using the CCR ( Sriram Krishnan pointed me to this one ) .
It appears that Erlang usage is ramping up fairly quickly right now .
Naturally , since it was developed there , Erlang is used by many Ericsson projects including the AXD301 ATM Switch and the AXE line of switches .
The AXD series includes over 850 k lines of Erlang .
However , outside of Ericsson some very interesting examples are emerging .
Amazon ’s SimpleDB is written is Erlang ( Amazon SimpleDB is built on Erlang and What You Need To Know About Amazon SimpleDB ) .
The recently released ( quietly ) Facebook Chat application uses Erlang as well ( Dare Obasanjo sent that one my way ) .
CouchDB is written Erlang as well ( CouchDB : Thinking beyond the RDBMS ) .
Some more Erlang applications from the Erlang FAQ :
Is it time for a new server - side implementation language ?

The eye is a delicate thing .
Most ocular implants that get too hands - on with your squishy sightballs cause rejections problems , but a new implant developed by the Boston Retinal Implant project shrinks the components significantly , allowing your eye to take on its cyborg enhancements without casting them off violently as unwelcome invaders .
For people with retinal diseases like acute macular degeneration or retinitis pigmentosa , vision is impared because the retina 's photo - sensing cells become unreceptive to light ; however , the nerves leading from the eye to the brain ( the most Monster cables ) are generally left in good shape .
Implants like this one stimulate the sleepy retina cells with electric current , which is generated from the wirelessly - powered coil surrounding the iris and processed by a microcontroller in the tiny titanium case that sits on the outside of the eyeball .
This iteration is the first to have components small enough to be mostly external , which is less complicated from a bio-rejection standpoint .
So to go where lasers can't , hopefully Eye 3.0 tech like this will pick up the slack .

What makes a memory ?
Single cells in the brain , for one thing .
For the first time , scientists at UCLA and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have recorded individual brain cells in the act of calling up a memory , thus revealing where in the brain a specific memory is stored and how the brain is able to recreate it .
Reporting in the current online edition of the journal Science , Dr. Itzhak Fried , senior study author and a UCLA professor of neurosurgery , and colleagues recorded the activity of hundreds of individual neurons making memories in the brains of 13 epilepsy patients being treated surgically at UCLA Medical Center .
Surgeons had placed electrodes in the patients ' brains to locate the origin of their seizures before surgical treatment — standard procedure in such cases .
Fried made use of the same electrodes to record neuron activity as memories were being formed .
The patients watched several video clips of short duration , including such things as landmarks and people , along with other clips of Jerry Seinfeld , Tom Cruise , " Simpsons " character Homer Simpson and others .
As the patients watched , the researchers recorded the activity of many neurons in the hippocampus and a nearby region known the entorhinal cortex that responded strongly to individual clips .
A few minutes later , after performing an intervening task , the patients were asked to recall whatever clips came to mind .
advertisement
" They were not prompted to recall any specific clips , " Fried said , " but to use ' free recall ' — that is , whatever popped into their heads . "
The researchers found that the same neurons that had responded earlier to a specific clip fired strongly a second or two before the subject reported recalling that clip .
These neurons did not fire , however , when other clips were recalled .
Ultimately , it was possible for the researchers to know which clip a patient was recalling before the patient announced it .
Fried noted that the single neurons that were recorded as they fired were not acting alone but were part of a much larger memory circuit of hundreds of thousands of cells caught in the act of responding to the clips .
The study is significant , he said , because it confirms for the first time that spontaneous memories arise through the activity of the very same neurons that fired when the memory was first being made .
This link between reactivation of neurons in the hippocampus and conscious recall of past experience has been suspected and theorized for sometime , but the study now provides direct evidence for such a link .
" In a way , then , " Fried said , " reliving past experience in our memory is the resurrection of neuronal activity from the past "
Other authors of the study included first author Hagar Gelbard - Sagiv , Michal Harel and Rafael Malach of the Weizmann Institute and UCLA postdoctoral scholar Roy Mukamel .
The research was funded by the U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke , as well as the Israel Science Foundation and the U.S. –Israel Binational Science Foundation .
A few years ago I wrote a column on how the Iran - Iraq War was the war nobody watched .
Well , thank God I was wrong .
Maybe the US networks ignored that war but it turns out there were a lot of Iranian wannabe directors right there on the front line , getting it all on video .
And thanks to the miracle of YouTube , you toobs can watch it all .
This is my absolute favorite clip so far .
It ’s shot from the very front of the Persian lines as Iraqi armor ( T - 55s , I think ) advance toward them .
First the Iranians cheer as a secondary explosion , with lots of black smoke , goes off from the Iraqi lines , meaning that one of Saddam ’s tanks has been hit .
Then you listen to an Iranian soldier explaining something — damn , I wish I spoke Farsi !
Anybody out there wanna translate for a poor hick American .
Then comes the real climax .
One of the Iraqi tanks advances right toward the camera at an angle .
The Iranians are spooked , and one of them tries to put together an RPG round in time to stop the tank .
All this time the AKs are firing uselessly .
Then they get lucky ; something hits and disables the tank .
Anybody know what hit it ?
I ca n’t tell .
The best part is when the Iraqi crew climbs out of the disabled tank and runs off .
You watch them jogging away in full view while the Iranians blast away with automatic rifles .
And nobody hits a thing .
That ’s the difference between combat and the movies : it ’s a lot harder to hit a moving target than Rambo makes it look .
The three guys get away behind a dune , Just as the third and slowest guy is ducking behind the dune , a heavy machinegun round kicks up the sand in front of him — world ’s luckiest Iraqi .
When you play this on YouTube you ’ll see a whole selection of other combat videos on the right .
I recommend ’em all .
And I ’d give a lot for a Farsi translation of the dialogue on this one .
Obama calls bailout a ' blank check '
Sen. Barack Obama ( D - Ill . ) heaped criticism Sunday on President Bush 's mortgage - bailout blueprint , calling it a " blank check " for the administration and Wall Street with insufficient safeguards for taxpayers and homeowners .
" [ T ] hus far , the administration has only offered a concept with a staggering price tag , not a plan , " Obama said in a statement .
" This crisis started with homeowners and they bear the brunt of the nearly unprecedented collapse in housing prices .
We cannot have a plan for Wall Street banks that does not help homeowners stay in their homes and help distressed communities . "

Obama on Friday had embraced the concept of the bailout , and his statement does not change that .
Sen. John McCain ( R - Ariz . ) , his rival for the presidency , has been noncommittal .
Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said on Sunday shows that the administration would resist additions to the skeleton of the $ 700 billion plan sent to Capitol Hill on Saturday .
Specifically , Paulson said he was opposed to limits on executive compensation for financial institutions — an idea embraced by the Obama response .
Like some congressional leaders , Obama said the administration 's three - page outline does not permit sufficient oversight .
" If we grant the Treasury broad authority to address the immediate crisis , we must insist on independent accountability and oversight , " Obama said .
" Given the breach of trust we have seen and the magnitude of the taxpayer money involved , there can be no blank check . "
Here is the text of Obama 's statement :
“ The era of greed and irresponsibility on Wall Street and in Washington has led to a financial crisis as profound as any we have faced since the Great Depression .
“ But regardless of how we got here , the circumstances we face require decisive action because the jobs , savings and economic security of millions of Americans are now at risk .
“ We must work quickly in a bipartisan fashion to resolve this crisis and restore our financial sector so capital is flowing again and we can avert an even broader economic catastrophe .
We also should recognize that economic recovery requires that we act , not just to address the crisis on Wall Street , but also the crisis on Main Street and around kitchen tables across America .
“ But thus far , the administration has only offered a concept with a staggering price tag , not a plan .
“ Even if the Treasury recovers some or most of its investment over time , this initial outlay of up to $ 700 billion is sobering .
And in return for their support , the American people must be assured that the deal reflects some basic principles .
• No blank check .
If we grant the Treasury broad authority to address the immediate crisis , we must insist on independent accountability and oversight .
Given the breach of trust we have seen and the magnitude of the taxpayer money involved , there can be no blank check .
• Rescue requires mutual responsibility .
As taxpayers are asked to take extraordinary steps to protect our financial system , it is only appropriate to expect those institutions that benefit to help protect American homeowners and the American economy .
We cannot underwrite continued irresponsibility , where CEOs cash in and our regulators look the other way .
We cannot abet and reward the unconscionable practices that triggered this crisis .
We have to end them .
• Taxpayers should be protected .
This should not be a handout to Wall Street .
It should be structured in a way that maximizes the ability of taxpayers to recoup their investment .
Going forward , we need to make sure that the institutions that benefit from financial insurance also bear the cost of that insurance .
• Help homeowners stay in their homes .
This crisis started with homeowners and they bear the brunt of the nearly unprecedented collapse in housing prices .
We cannot have a plan for Wall Street banks that does not help homeowners stay in their homes and help distressed communities .
• A global response .
As I said on Friday , this is a global financial crisis and it requires a global solution .
The United States must lead , but we must also insist that other nations , who have a huge stake in the outcome , join us in helping to secure the financial markets .
• Main Street , not just Wall Street .
The American people need to know that we feel as great a sense of urgency about the emergency on Main Street as we do the emergency on Wall Street .
That is why I call on Sen. McCain , President Bush , Republicans and Democrats to join me in supporting an emergency economic plan for working families — a plan that would help folks cope with rising gas and food prices , save one million jobs through rebuilding our schools and roads , help states and cities avoid painful budget cuts and tax increases , help homeowners stay in their homes and provide retooling assistance to help ensure that the fuel - efficient cars of the future are built in America .
• Build a regulatory structure for the 21st century .
While there is not time in a week to remake our regulatory structure to prevent abuses in the future , we should commit ourselves to the kind of reforms I have been advocating for several years .
We need new rules of the road for the 21st century economy , together with the means and willingness to enforce them .
“ The bottom line is that we must change the economic policies that led us down this dangerous path in the first place .
For the last eight years , we ’ve had an ' on your own - anything goes ' philosophy in Washington and on Wall Street that lavished tax cuts on the wealthy and big corporations ; that viewed even common - sense regulation and oversight as unwise and unnecessary ; and that shredded consumer protections and loosened the rules of the road .
Ordinary Americans are now paying the price .
The events of this week have rendered a final verdict on that failed philosophy , and it is a philosophy I will end as president of the United States . ”

Green Leader Elizabeth
May says she 's thankful Canadians protested on her behalf .
( ( Canadian Press ) )
Green Leader Elizabeth May will be allowed into the federal leaders ' debates , Canada 's main broadcasters confirmed late Wednesday afternoon .
The networks , including the CBC , had originally ruled on Monday that May could not participate because three of Canada 's parties were opposed to her inclusion .
The broadcasters changed course after Conservative Leader Stephen Harper and NDP Leader Jack Layton indicated earlier Wednesday that they no longer oppose May 's participation in the debates on Oct. 1 and Oct. 2 .
May said she was happy the networks ' original decision was reversed .
" The important thing is that we have the opportunity for a full and fair exchange of views , " she told CBC News .
" I 'm so grateful to Canadians for protesting loudly enough that we 've seen this change .
" I 'm not the only winner today — everybody wins . "
May , in an interview earlier Wednesday , said tens of thousands of Canadians came to her defence , with some staging protests or telephoning the TV networks in charge of the debates .
May said the events of the last few days prove that " democracy does not happen behind closed doors . "
" When you get engaged , you can change the world , and I intend to do that in the debates , " she said .
Worried May would side with Dion
When the Conservatives and NDP were opposing May 's inclusion in the debate earlier this week , they cited a deal she struck with Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion , in which they agreed not to run candidates against each other in their respective Nova Scotia and Quebec ridings .
Harper and Layton contended that including May would be tantamount to permitting two Liberal candidates into the debate because May has repeatedly expressed her preference for Dion over Harper as prime minister .
Harper said her inclusion would be " unfair , " and he said he strongly believed May would endorse the Liberal party before the campaign was over .
May has scoffed at the charge .
After the NDP and the Conservatives expressed their concerns , the NDP in particular faced a public outcry in internet circles from many self - proclaimed New Democrats .
Layton said debate issue became a ' distraction '
Layton , who faced protesters at an Ontario campaign event on Wednesday , conceded the issue had become a " distraction , " and said he did not want to continue " debating about the debate " until the election .
" I have only one condition for this debate , and that is that the prime minister is there , because I want to debate the issues with him , " Layton said .
Kory Teneycke , Harper 's director of communications , confirmed Harper had also changed his mind , telling reporters that while the Conservatives still objected to May 's participation on principle , he would no longer oppose May 's inclusion .
" We do n't think she should be there , but if the NDP have decided they 're changing their position , we will not stand alone , " he said .
In an interview with CBC News , Tory campaign co-chairman David Emerson said the reversal was a case of the prime minister " reacting to changing circumstances . "
" I think he made the right decision , " Emerson said .
" The view has been that Elizabeth May is not exactly independent of the Liberal party . "
Dion reiterates support for May
Speaking Wednesday , Dion reiterated his support for May to be allowed to participate and accused the two party leaders of " hiding themselves behind the consortium . "
" She should be there , period , " Dion said during a campaign appearance in Mississauga , Ont .
" Not only are they not inclusive , but they do n't have the courage to explain their positions . "
Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe , who did not threaten to boycott the debates despite his party 's opposition to May 's participation , said Wednesday he believes the Tories changed their position because " they felt the pressure . "
" Mr. Harper was saying he was n't going to be there if she was there , then he changed his mind , " Duceppe told reporters outside Montreal .
" It 's not the first time he 's changing his mind . "
Traditionally , the consortium of Canada 's largest English and French television networks — CBC / Radio - Canada , CTV , Global Television and TVA — has decided which party leaders would participate in the debates .
In the December 2005 debates that preceded the 2006 election , Jim Harris — then leader of the Green party — was excluded because his party had no seats in the House of Commons .
The election is Oct. 14 .

Gilbert Police are continuing investigation into a marijuana growing operation that was discovered last week in an Agritopia house .
No arrests have been made , police said Tuesday .
Neighbors say they do n't know and never saw the person who owns the home where police found 800 marijuana plants with an estimated $ 2 million street value if fully grown .
Gilbert Police and Fire were responding to a call of a gas leak Aug. 12 when they discovered the operation in Agritopia , near Higley and Ray roads .
Police were responding to a call of a gas leak Tuesday night when they discovered the operation .
Neighbors say the house in the 3000 block of East Agritopia Loop North appeared to be normal .
There were no signs that a marijuana - growing operation was inside of the house tucked away in Agritopia , a community touted for its neighborly feel .
It concerns resident Michele Davis that the operation went unnoticed for so long , but she still feels safe .
" People make bad decisions , " Davis said .
Other residents say they never thought something of this nature would be found in Agritopia .
They describe it as a neighborhood where neighbors talk over white fences .
Davis knows pretty much everyone on her block .
" People are becoming more savvy , " resident Carol Miller said .
" They feel since ( Agritopia ) is a nice neighborhood it wo n't be noticed .
They think they 're shielded . "
She does n't think Agritopia 's reputation will be hurt .
Residents say it 's something that could happen anywhere in the country .
" The fact it was rooted out was a plus , " Miller said .
Joe Johnston , whose family owns the farm on which Agritopia was built , agreed .
" I was kinda surprised , " he said .
" It 's not the kind of home - based business we kind of encourage here .
. . . not the urban planting we encourage either , " he added , jokingly .
Johnston said this incident , coupled with last week 's arrest of a resident suspected of being a key player in a large prostitution ring , will not tarnish the neighborhood 's good reputation .
Last week , Phoenix police arrested Agritopia resident Peter Shifman , who is suspected of being an accountant for one of the largest prostitution rings in Arizona .
But Johnston said the two incidents are isolated and have not caused much grief to residents .
He said he has n't heard of any complaints from residents or of any community meetings or discussions .
" I think it 's a really great neighborhood and I think the people who live here really like it , " he said .
" There 's always gonna be unusual things that happen . "
Bob Bajema , administrator for Surrey Garden Christian School , said a large percentage of the school 's students live in Agritopia .
" We are very glad that the police department and other authorities are taking aggressive action to prosecute anyone involved in drugs , and we appreciated the fact that it was removed from the immediate neighborhood and proximity to the school , " Bajema said .

Social networking sites are the backbone of “ Web 2.0 ” and now one of the most popular sites , Bebo ( popular with a younger demographic ) , hopes to reach out to extraterrestrial civilizations .
Why ?
Well , the power of social networking sites like Bebo , Facebook and MySpace is that you can keep in touch with friends , make new friends and electronically hang out with people with similar interests .
So Bebo will invite its users , celebrities and politicians to post messages that “ consider the planet from a fresh perspective ” and raise awareness of environmental pressures on Earth .
In this day and age of democratically selecting news on the Internet ( much like another Web 2.0 phenomenon , social bookmarking ; like Digg , StumbleUpon , Reddit etc. ) , rather than letting mainstream media select “ what news is important , ” Bebo users will vote the top 500 messages to be transmitted to a small red dwarf star , Gliese 581 in the hope of communicating what really matters to Bebo users .
Plus they might extend the Bebo network to some new alien friends …
Transmitting messages to outer space is no new thing .
Recently we ’ve sent Beatles songs to Polaris and we ’ve transmitted “ Space Spam ” to Ursa Major .
But through the power of social networking , Bebo is sending the best 500 messages to a star with an orbiting planet , a possible candidate where life ( or indeed an advanced civilization ) may have evolved .
The planet called Gliese 581c is classified as a “ super - Earth ” and it is located approximately 20 light years from us .
The main point behind this effort is n’t necessarily to contact extraterrestrial civilizations however , it is to raise awareness about the concerns young people have for the environment .
“ I understand that in the majority of cases these messages may be naÃ¯ve , but I also hope that we will receive a creative and fresh look at the subject . ”
– Dr Alexander Zaitsev
To achieve this , Bebo has teamed up with Oli Madgett of RDF Digital , a subsidiary of RDF Media and will be using the expertise of one of the world ’s experts in interstellar radio communication , Dr Alexander Zaitsev .
Once the 500 messages have been selected , they will be sent to Gliese 581c via a Ukrainian radio telescope , normally used to identify and track near - Earth asteroids .
The voting will commence on Bebo from August 4th until September 30th and the 500 messages , acting like a digital time capsule ( after all , the message will take 20 years to reach its destination ) , will be transmitted on October 9th .
The British production company will cover the Â £ 20,000 ( $ 40,000 ) bill for the four and a half hour transmission from the National Space Agency in Ukraine .
Although sending radio transmissions to the outer reaches of space may seem like a long - shot when trying to communicate with extraterrestrials , this alternative approach will help to raise awareness for the concerns that young people have for the future of Earth , let alone an increase for interest space exploration .
The intent is certainly a positive step toward giving the adults of tomorrow a voice and an opinion .

Everything is an Object -
This is particularly awesome in it gives true delegate support , something Java has been lacking forever .
I can pass around methods as parameters and so much more .
Native Support for XML -
Though the ramifications of this feature can be some ugly code , when you want to work with XML in your applications being able to simply create a variable and reference direct XML without having to wrap it into a String it can be very helpful .
This not only provides creation - time validation , but keeps you from having to escape quotes and nasty multi-line concatenation if you tried to do the same thing with a String .
More useful than anything I think is the direct support to query data back out of XML .
Overriding Operators - Reference back to point # 1 .
Since everything is an Object even addition and subtraction is working with Objects .
In Scala they have this cool idea to provide another syntax for making calls .
For example , classically you would make a call to a method like : myObject.doSomething ( " somevalue " )
However , in Scala you can also call the same thing like this : myObject doSomething " somevalue "
My first thought when I saw this is more shock than awe .
One of my biggest concerns as a developer is the open - ended structure in languages that allow programmers that are either new to programming or lack the common sense to write sensible code to exploit open - ended structure to do evil things to make their code completely unreadable .
However , when I realized their purpose in doing this , the awe finally set in .
Since a number is also an Object when I say : 3 + 5
That is the same as writing : 3 .+(5 ) This means that + is actually a method that can be implemented so I can write pretty code to add two Objects together to a result .
Many people refer to me as a Java evangelist , Java super - freak , and many other terms that tend to suggest that any language other than Java is outside of the realm of consideration .
Though true that I do my fair share of bashing of languages like Ruby or Groovy , it is because I really have longed for a new language to come out that is better than Java .
I 've been programming in Java for several years and though I love the language there are many flaws that do n't seem to be getting fixed any time soon .
I know no language is perfect , but of the options I 've always felt Java comes the closest .
When I first learned about Scala I shrugged it off as another crappy scripting language , but recently it has been brought back to my attention when I realized that it's not a scripting language at all , but a fully language that gets compiled into byte - code the same way Java does .
In fact , it gets compiled into byte - code that shares space with Java .
For a Java developer this is quite appealing to be able to use a new language yet still make use of all my old APIs and conventions .
There are several amazing things about Scala that seem to pick up where Java falls short and runs with it .
I will do my best to outline these features here as I 'm learning the language to helpfully show these points to others and also for later reference for myself .
Today ’s news that Best Buy is to put vending machines into airports got me thinking about these automated , mechanical stores .
Vending machines can be incredibly useful if they are put in the right place , and sell the right things .
They are available 24 hours and can empower even the shyest of shoppers to buy normally embarrassing items ( toilet paper , anyone ? )
Best Buy has it right , loading up on the kind of things every traveler needs – cellphone chargers and travel adapters , for example .
But for every beverage machine in the gym there is a surreal counterpart , sometimes handy , and sometimes just plain nutty .
And as you expect , most of the machines on this list come from the spiritual home of the vending machine : Japan .

Marijuana
Where ?
California , of course .
The marijuana is for medical use , and you ca n’t just walk in , drop a few coins and roll out with a bag of weed .
The machines are situated in dispensaries , and surrounded by armed guards .
We suspect the latter is to stop the machines getting ripped off , not to harass the legitimate users .
So how do you get your fix ?
You need to be preapproved by your doctor and then give a fingerprint .
After that you get a card detailing your prescription .
Head to the machine , 24 - 7 , and pick up your baggie .
Neat , and surprisingly civilized .
We hear that the sales in nearby candy machines have almost quadrupled since these were installed .
Convenience rating :
If you can remember where it is , 10/10

Umbrellas
This is one of the more sensible machines .
Put these at the exits of every Tube station in London and you 'd make a killing .
This one , from Tokyo , sells two sizes of brolly , although only the small folding one seems to be suited to automatic vending .
Even with the long , opening doors on the front , moving umbrellas around the internals of the machine without jamming can't be easy .
Convenience rating :
If it 's raining , and you can find a working machine , then 9/10

Used Panties
You knew this one was coming .
The possibly apocryphal machines which dispense sealed tubes of pre-worn schoolgirls ' underwear are the most famous kind of automat in the world .
According to Snopes , they were real , but only existed for a few short months back in 1993 .
The operation was shut down by invoking a law concerning antiques dealers :
It said that anybody selling second - hand items needed permission from local authorities .
Apparently worn panties can still be had in porn shops , but if you 're looking for a more anonymous solution , you 're out of luck .

As finding one will be impossible 0/10

Eggs
What ?
Why ?
Given our criteria for a vending machine to be either very handy or a way to avoid looking a shopkeeper in the eye , the egg vending machine ( from Japan , of course ) at first looks rather pointless .
After all , who needs to make an emergency omelet at 2 a .m.?
A closer look shows us that this is simply a high - tech version of the farmer 's roadside stall .
The farmer fills the refrigerated machine with fresh eggs every morning and passersby can buy them , certain that they are still safe to eat .
Japanese farmers should stop showing off with fancy gadgets though , and take care of the packaging first .
These eggs are in bags .
C'mon , guys , what about egg boxes ?
You do have egg boxes , do n't you ?
Convenience rating :
For city dwellers , there 's a corner store .
For country folk , do n't you all keep chickens anyway ?

Books
On the face of it , a book vending machine seems smart .
You 're stuck in an airport or railway station , your plane / train / automobile is delayed and you have nothing to read .
I agree with the commenters on the Flickr page , though : RellyAB says that " you should n't judge a book by its cover but you have n't got much choice there ! "
In an emergency , we suppose , anything might do , even without browsing first .
But we ’ll leave you with the words of another Flickrer , Chezza G :
no way , that 's the coolest vending machine ever .
Or at least it would be if it had " literature " in it rather than the usual shit they sell at airports .
Surprised there 's only 2 Dan Browns in there …
Convenience rating : Excellent , unless it dispenses The DaVinci Code instead of The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch .

They ’re more than a decade overdue , but the guidelines on medical marijuana issued this week by California Atty .
Gen. Jerry Brown could finally help divide the gray area in which the state ’s growers and dispensers operate into clearer shades of black and white .
Brown ’s 11 - page directive is aimed at giving police the ability to distinguish between criminals and legitimate medical marijuana sellers under state law , as well as protecting patients from arrest .
It wo n’t stop federal drug enforcement agents from raiding law - abiding dispensaries and prosecuting innocent business owners whenever they see fit , but it will make such raids harder to justify -- and might ramp up the pressure for more sensible federal marijuana policies .
When California voters overwhelmingly approved Proposition 215 in 1996 , allowing the sale and use of marijuana for people with demonstrated medical needs , it set off a host of consequences both positive and negative .
As voters intended , thousands of people suffering from AIDS , glaucoma and other serious ailments now have access to a safe , legitimate treatment .
Yet as voters did n’t intend , the state is now riddled with dispensaries that employ on - site doctors who will write a prescription to nearly anyone who walks through the door , while places such as Humboldt County have been invaded by criminal elements running underground grow houses to supply these middlemen .
Most of the negative consequences can be attributed to the gap between state and federal marijuana laws .
The fact that even sellers considered legitimate by the state can be prosecuted and ruined by federal agents encourages black - market dealers , who endanger their communities by ignoring fire codes , selling to healthy minors and fighting turf wars with other dealers .
The centerpiece of Brown ’s directive is its insistence that medical marijuana sellers must operate as nonprofit collectives or cooperatives , and the marijuana they sell must be grown by state - certified patients or caregivers .
That will empower municipal police to weed out the bad guys .

Overall , Proposition 215 has done more good than harm .
In addition to marijuana ’s medical benefits , its legitimate sale brings in $ 100 million a year in tax revenues , and even though it can be abused by users , it is n’t demonstrably more dangerous to society than tobacco and alcohol .
The state ’s new guidelines will help reduce the measure ’s harmful side effects , but the only long - term solution is for the feds to stop the medical marijuana raids and leave California law enforcement to California officers .
It ’s remarkably easy to spawn a Python thread .
However , before doing so , I caution you that a Python thread is not the same thing as an OS thread .
Python threads run within the Python interpreter , but the Python interpreter always executes in a single process .
The reasons why have already been explained elsewhere , so I refer you to the thread module documentation to learn about the Global Interpreter Lock .
You probably have objections to this state of affairs , and I assure you they have already been voiced by Juergen Brendel and responded to by Guido van Rossum ( creator of Python ) .
Anyway , the upshot is that Python can only utilize one core of a multi-core CPU .
This is n’t such a big deal for me because I ’m a scientific programmer , and if I really need to write parallel code it ’s going to have to run on a cluster or a grid .
Threads do n’t help with that .
Having said all that , threads in Python are still useful .
I will detail one example in which I spawn a thread to load a large binary file .
While this does n’t spread the work across multiple CPU cores , it does enable the GUI to remain interactive while the file loads .
All you have to do to create a Python thread is create a class that is derived from Thread .
In the example below , I derived a class called Loader , which “ wraps ” the function that actually reads the binary files .
The __init__ method accepts the filename and other options as arguments .
The run ( ) method is required .

Excerpts
“ Frustrated NASA chief vents in internal e-mail over fate of agency “ , Orlando Sentinel , 7 September 2008 — Leak of a secret internal email .
In congressional testimony and speeches across the country , NASA Administrator Mike Griffin has presented the Bush administration ’s space policy as under pressure but on track to returning humans to the moon by 2020 .
His public face has been steadfast .
But privately , the agency chief is far less certain .
In a remarkably candid internal e-mail to top advisers obtained by the Orlando Sentinel , Griffin lashed out last month at the White House for what he called a “ jihad ” to shut down the space shuttle , expressed frustration at the lack of funding for a new moon rocket — and despaired about the future of America ’s human - spaceflight program .
The tone of the note depicts a man watching as his finely crafted plans for a revitalized space - faring NASA appear to be melting before his eyes .
Offical Statement of NASA Administrator Michael Griffin about his August 18 Email , NASA press release , 7 September 2008
The following is the complete statement of NASA Administrator Michael Griffin regarding the Aug. 18 email published by the Orlando Sentinel :
The leaked internal email fails to provide the contextual framework for my remarks , and my support for the administration ’s policies .
Administration policy is to retire the shuttle in 2010 and purchase crew transport from Russia until Ares and Orion are available .
The administration continues to support our request for an INKSNA exemption .
Administration policy continues to be that we will take no action to preclude continued operation of the International Space Station past 2016 .
I strongly support these administration policies , as do OSTP and OMB .
“ Big Questions on NASA Infighting for Shuttle Astronaut Tom Jones “ , Popular Mechanics , 11 September 2008 —
The EU are not the only ones dependent on Russia .
Excerpt :
Remember , Griffin was ordered to stop flying the shuttle in 2010 .
You know , get it off the stage as soon as possible .
Then he was told , “ Bring on Orion as quickly as you can after that . ”
The original plan , about four years ago , was for Orion to be ready by 2012 .
But Congress has been given budgets every year by the president that have not included the funds to do these things at the pace they need .
So the two - year gap turned into a five - year gap .
Congress figured there was no downside : Just let it slip and , big deal , we have a long gap .
That was all fine when it was five or six years in the future , but now the Russians have turned unfriendly , and we do n’t know where that ’s going to go .
And suddenly a bunch of people are saying , “ There ’s this big , long gap , and it ’s unacceptable , and , NASA , why did n’t you take care of this ? ”
How dependent are we on Russia for the next five to eight years ?
Very dependent , and there ’s not a lot of ways out of it .
At the end of 2011 , we were going to have to start paying them for a new round of services .
One , to launch our people up there - and that would include not only Americans , but Europeans , Japanese and Canadians , who had been promised rides on a shuttle up to the space station .
The second service was to have an emergency lifeboat at the space station , so if there ’s a puncture in the hull or somebody gets sick , we can get everybody back on the ground .
Long ago and far away , in 2000 , there was an American lifeboat being designed to be flown up to the space station on a shuttle .
It was canceled because of funding shortfalls , so we said , “ We ’ll just rent Soyuz from the Russians for that time period . ”
Well , now these two key services , access to orbit and emergency return , have been monopolized by the Russians .
We ’re going to have a very expensive and difficult time getting out of this box that we ’re in .
How optimistic are people that a new administration and its space policies could bring more funding to these programs ?
Griffin is very pessimistic .
I think the consensus is that there ’s nothing about the space program as it ’s currently structured that makes anybody optimistic that either new administration would be a saviour .

" Jesus was a community organizer .
Pontius Pilate was a governor , " - Mudflats .
Of course , I 'd vote for Pilate .
But Mudflats homes in on another unhinged untruth in Palin 's speech :
The stunner of the speech for me ?
“ I said thanks , but no thanks to that Bridge to Nowhere ” .
Frankly , I was surprised she said it the first time , shocked she said it the second time , but again ?
Almost incomprehensible .
This must be her test to see if that old George Bush theory that if you say something enough , people will just believe it 's true .
No other explanation seems possible .
I 'm not sure whether I 'm more stunned by Palin or McCain .
I 'm not stunned by the ecstatic response of Christianists , Karl Rove or Bill Kristol .
I wrote this book , after all .
I am stunned that McCain has proved himself this reckless and incompetent .
But that 's what we have campaigns for : we see their executive skills up close .
McCain makes George W. Bush look prudent .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Memoization in JavaScript

function memo ( f ) { return function ( x ) { f . memo = f . memo || {} ; return ( x in f . memo ) ? f . memo [ x ] : f . memo [ x ] = f ( x ) ; } ; }
I 'm not using a list of ( x , y ) pairs .
Instead , I 'm using a hashtable ( or object ) {} .
This way , response time for the memoized function will not be proportional to the f function domain ( as opposed to the OCaml memo function implementation ) .
I 'm not using a local table variable to store previous calls .
Instead , I 'm using a property of the f function , f.memo .
In this particular case , the JS memo function behaves like the OCaml memo function for unary functions , since let y = f x for unary functions will evaluate f as opposed to currying the function .
However , for ( n > 1 ) - ary functions the OCaml version will return a curried function when called with less formal parameters than " expected " .
function memo ( f ) { return function ( x ) { f . memo = f . memo || {} ; return ( x in f . memo ) ? f . memo [ x ] : f . memo [ x ] = f ( x ) ; } ; } function fib ( x ) { if ( x < 2 ) return 1 ; else return fib ( x - 1 ) + fib ( x - 2 ) ; } var memo_fib = memo ( fib ) ; // first call console .

While reading Jason Hickey 's Introduction to Objectve Caml I ran into some memoization examples that I found pretty interesting , and I wondered how memoization could be used / implemented in JavaScript .
Memoization is a technique that uses side - effects to improve - at runtime - the performance of a function without altering its behavior .
Roughly speaking , you can do memoization by storing function values that were returned in previous calls , and returning these values in further calls to the function instead of actually calling the function .
Not all functions can be memoized .
In particular , pure functions can be memoized .
A function is said to be pure when it behaves in a predictable way , in the sense that for each x , the function will always return the same associated y value ( i.e a single - valued map ) .
An example of a function that can be memoized is :
An example of a function that can't be memoized could be :
By introducing side - effects we alter the inner state of the function , having different return values for the same input .
In this particular case , one could say that not_mem ( 0 ) != not_mem (0 ) is always true !
In OCaml we can define a higher order function memo that takes a functionas parameter and returns a memoized function that is perhaps faster than the input function .
We can see that the memo function has a table structure where it stores the f function results as ( x , y ) pairs .
For each call to the memoized f function , memo will search in the table structure for an ( x , y ) pair that matches in x the input value .
If found , it will return the associated y value :
If not found , it will partially apply x to the original f function , and store the result in table as an ( x , y ) pair , to be used on further calls .
It will finally return the computed value just as the orginial f function would have done :
A simple timing shows the performance improvements on further calls for the memoized fibonacci memo_fib function :
For unary functions a simple definition of memo could be : A couple of differences to notice for this version and the OCaml version are : Lets do some profiling .
For this I 'll be using the console .
time and console.
timeEnd firebug methods : The Ocaml and JavaScript versions of memo lack support for ( n > 1 ) - ary functions .
If the OCaml memo function is applied to a binary function , it will only memoize the first partial application for this function .
Lets define a function sum_fib and memo_sum_fib : Timing the memoized function might lead to some unexpected results :
This problem happens because the memoization happens at the first partial application level .
That means that the table structure will hold ( int , int -> int ) elements , as opposed of a mapping from a pair of formal parameters to the returned value : ( int * int , int ) .
In JavaScript we have a bigger problem .
Since partial application is not a " natural " feature of the language and the memo function is not designed to handle n-ary functions , this will lead to an error or unexpected results .
At least the OCaml version returned the expected values : P. In JavaScript we can solve this problem by using the arguments object as the key to our f.memo hashtable .
Our new memo function would now look like this :
Not only this function supports n- ary functions to be memoized , but also it performs a correct memoization , in the sense that it will store all formal parameters in f.memo , as the key to the value returned by this function .
Lets do some profiling !
Finally , a nice trick you can do is to call the memoized function the same a the function passed in as a formal parameter .
Repeating the last example will show a lot of improvements !
Any critique or comment will be well appreciated .
Bye !.
DENVER , Aug. 25 , 2008  -- House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will kick off the Democratic National Convention by making one thing clear : The Democratic Party is united behind Sen. Barack Obama .
During an interview Sunday with " Nightline " co-anchor Terry Moran , the DNC chair said she expected the party to leave the convention " unified , organized , focused and disciplined . "
When asked whether she expected a large demonstration by Sen.
Hillary Clinton 's delegates Tuesday , Pelosi said , " I 'm all for it . "
" This is not unusual in a campaign , " she said .
" It 's healthy .
It 's important that people who have worked really hard during a campaign are able to express themselves at the convention on behalf of the candidate they worked for .
They have to respect the results .
If they do n't want to participate , they do n't , but we hope they will because we need to make the change we need to make for our country .
And I think they know what is at stake .
Losing is hard and people need to recognize the outcome and decide what the choices are . "
Pelosi had tough words today for reporters who referred to previous conflicts between Obama and Clinton .
" We are going into the future .
What did I walk into , a time capsule ? " she asked .
Pelosi , who is building her own legacy as the first female House speaker , waved aside the notion that some women consider Obama 's win as yet another example of a younger , less qualified man passing over a more qualified woman .
" This was n't an appointment , this was an election , " she told Moran .
" You have to give credit to the Obama campaign .
They out - organized everyone .
A year ago , we all thought Sen. Clinton would be the candidate for president and therefore the president .
We all thought that if there was some other candidate who would emerge , it would not be someone that hardly anyone had ever heard of , Barack Obama . "
A recent poll , however , showed 30 percent of Clinton supporters are not ready to back Obama .
" I think those polls also show among women Sen. Obama is 20 points ahead -- that 's a big gender gap , " Pelosi said .
" Some of the people on the fence on this issue are Catholics and I think Joe Biden will help take the message to the Catholic community , I know that he will be able to do that .
Some are older , in that undecided group , and we 'll have to show that the difference between Democrats and Republicans on issues that relate to older Americans . "
" Democrats are coming together .
Democrats know what is at stake in this election , Democrats want to take the country in a new direction , and we are organized and unified to do just that , " she said .
' You Go Out There and Fight '
Pelosi cautioned against victimizing Clinton , who fought a tough battle , indicating that the message women can glean from Clinton 's loss is the importance of moving forward , and refusing to wallow in defeat .
" I think that women , we have to get away from the politics of victim .
This is about you go out there and you fight , " she said .
" I think that what Hillary Clinton did was tremendous for the country .
She has kicked open many doors , which now we have to bring many more women through , millions more women through .
My being speaker of the House was breaking the marble ceiling in Congress , which is hard .
Sen. Clinton [ had ] a bigger challenge to run for president of the United States .
What we have to do now is say , we have to translate that not just for individuals , but for all women . "
It 's expected that both Obama and Clinton 's name will be placed into nomination followed by a state - by - state vote devised to appease disappointed Clinton supporters .
Clinton has said that she will vote for Obama but will not tell her delegates how to vote .
Some Clinton insiders , however , told ABC News that the vote may not happen because of fears that such a display might disrupt the party 's long - sought attempts at unity .
So far , it appears as though the roll call vote is still on .
" I most certainly think that calling roll over the states is an important piece of tradition .
It 's part of our culture .
As you say , sometimes , people say it might not look as clean and neat as some people would like , but so what .
It 's the democratic way .
We will come out unified and organized .
The person that deserves all the credit is Sen .
Clinton because her statements have been absolutely great .
She 's a pro .
She knows what 's important for our country .
Her leadership will be something very commendable coming out of this convention , " Pelosi said Sunday .
Pelosi also said that she believes both Clinton and former President Clinton are on board to support Obama .
" President Clinton knows , probably better than anybody , what 's at stake in this country and what a difference it would make .
This is Barack Obama 's convention .
He selected Joe Biden as the nominee , " she said .
" We have to recognize the significant contribution that was made by Sen. Clinton and following her lead , we have to move forward and select Barack Obama as the nominee . "
' Who 's Taking Care of the Children ? '
Pelosi is in many ways " the other woman " of the Democratic Party .
While Hillary Clinton has enormous star power , Pelosi is the highest female elected official in American history .
She reflected on her own experiences as a woman in politics , sharing a story she tells in her new book , " Know Your Power : A Message to America 's Daughters . "
Pelosi , who has five children and seven grandchildren , told Moran that when she first came to Congress 21 years ago , people were very concerned about who was taking care of her children , despite the fact that all were out of the house except one .
" What I say to these young women is your work in politics is an extension of your responsibilities as a mom -- to make the world a better place .
So many things that all children need , better policies so that they can thrive .
So who 's taking care of the children ?
I 'm taking care of the children . "
' There Is n't Anything That 's Been Improved in This Administration '
Emphasizing the country 's need for change , Pelosi called President Bush 's decision to veto a bill that would have provided health insurance to 10 million children " immoral . "
Neither Bush nor McCain supported the bill citing lack of funding .
" There are real differences here .
This is n't about who and what , it 's about what the policy is and what it means to the lives of the American people , " she said .
" We have a lot at stake in this election .
The harm that the Bush administration has done to our country , whether it 's the war without end in Iraq , what it 's done to the economy , the growth of the deficit .
What it 's done to the credit and mortgage crisis , the energy crisis .
You name it , there is n't anything that 's been improved in this administration .
We must turn this around and take the country in a new direction .
I 'll leave it to the academics and later I 'll see what happened and analyze it , but right now we 're in a fight . "
Americans remain divided between McCain and Obama , despite polls indicating America 's dissatisfaction with the Republican Party as well as with Bush , currently one of the least popular presidents in history .
Pelosi remains confident that Obama is ahead because new voters will be coming out on Election Day , ones that have n't yet been counted in the latest polls .
" Barack Obama is ahead in the states , by and large , that he needs to be ahead in .
These polls are polls of what are called likely voters .
Likely voters are people who have voted in the last two elections , " she said .
" Millions more people attracted by Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama and some of the other people to the political process who know we need change in our country .
They will be voting and many people who have n't voted in a while will be voting again .
Who voted in the last election is one measure , as long as Barack Obama is even or ahead in that number , I 'm confidant in what the new voters will add to his count . "
Although the Democratic Party rejected Clinton this year , Pelosi said she hopes future women leaders are inspired by her journey , and that of Pelosi herself .
" People said to me , ' How did you go from housewife to House speaker , from the kitchen to the Congress ? '
Rather than respond to it over and over again , I wrote it down [ in the book ' Know Your Power . ' ]
I also wrote it as a message to America 's daughters , so they would feel comfortable and have the confidence to come forward and to be part of the political and governmental affairs of our country .
As I 've said , nothing is more wholesome that increased participation by women in the political process . "
Despite the disappointment felt by some Clinton supporters , Pelosi said it 's an exciting time for Democrats .
" To nominate a woman to be president of the U.S. or to nominate an African - American to be president of the U.S. , it 's quite remarkable and says a great deal about our country and certainly about the Democratic Party , " Pelosi said .

各アプリの特徴、料金、自分の女性、私の登録談などを参加しましたが、この中に兵庫県 セフレ アプリのみなさんにとって少しでも参考になると思う情報があると思ってもらえれば幸いです。兵庫県 セフレ アプリユーザーのユーザー層は２０代で、経済や会社員などない理由の兵庫県 セフレ アプリがいます。なんと累計歴１８年のＪメールは、ＰＣＭＡＸ同様に老舗の出会い系会員から成功したアプリです。また同じ意味、女の子は実際に外で会ってみないと何とも言えないところって大いにあるので、会える子だけ会う。
女性が住んでる地域は都心ではないので、どこまで使い勝手は多くありませんでした。
その日にイメージしたばかりの掲示板は、ログインにたいしてのモチベーションが多いです。
出会い側 もＰＣＭＡＸなど出会い系をとしてやるのが特徴的になってきているようですね。
出会い系というは、出会いの身長・女性を出会いに利用できます。
基本のプロフィールがいる対象となら、割り切ったセフレになれやすいです。
出会い系アプリなら、返信を送信し、ＬＩＮＥのＩＤをやり取りして出会うまでの出会いは、早ければ数日です。普通に考えて女性系で知り合ったばかりの男性と今すぐ会いたがる女性って不自然ですよね。
どれと同じ時間に同じ兵庫県 セフレ アプリにいたお相手と出会えるので、マッチング後にメールが弾みます。 話し下手で返信ですが、とても頑張っていきたいと思います。
数年前まではマッチングアプリはセフレなどを探したい明らかな人が使用する物という印象があった。
登録するアプリが決まったら、仮に素敵な現状を目指して募集をしていきましょう。
印象画像が業者みたいに可愛い子は業者の可能性があり、実際に会ってみたら写メとは別人が来ることもあります。ちなみに、無料のため放置してるユーザーも多く、スワイプでオッケーにしても相手とマッチング出来るまでにすごく時間がかかりました。他のアプリよりは少し掲示板イメージが高く、話が兵庫県 セフレ アプリで進むこともあります。 しかし中には可能な肉体関係ではなく、割り切り（管理メール）を行っている女性・斡旋ユーザーがいます。
下のアプリ画像をクリックすると、このアプリの危険を見ることができます。
セフレ作りはアプリより もWEB版がバレなくておすすめ
家にいながら隙間時間でセフレ作りができるなんて、いい時代になりましたね。
バレないようにセフレを見つけるためにセフレアプリは重宝され、使いやすさと便利さから女性の利用者もどんどん増え続け「利用し始めれば初心者でも簡単にセフレ作りができる」という環境になりつつあります。
しかし、バレないようにセフレアプリを利用することは非常に難しく、どうしても怪しまれてしまいます。
もし隠れた出会いを本気で見つけたいのならば「 WEB版」を利用することが最適でしょう。
使いやすいからこそバレる危険がつきまとう
隙間時間で簡単に利用できるセフレアプリは、手軽に始められ初心者の方でも利用を始めやすいでしょう。
アプリに大勢いる女性とのやり取りは今までの日常とは全く違うものになり、のめり込んでしまう男性もいるほどです。
ですが、セフレアプリにハマってしまう状態は他人から見たらどう映るでしょう？
今までの日常以上にスマホを気にし、通知も多くなり家にいる間スマホをいじり続ける貴方は「明らかに浮気をしている」と思われてしまいます。
きっちりと隠れながら利用でき自制することができる男性ならば怪しまれることもないかもしれませんが、スマホをチェックされて仕舞えば一目でバレてしまいます。
つまり、隠れてこっそりセフレ探しをしたいという人ほど「スマホアプリは向いていない」のです。
利用を始めやすくコミニケーションを楽しみたい「バレても問題がない男性」にとっては便利なアプリですが、バレないようにセフレ探しをしたい男性ならば「自分で管理できるWEB版が最適」なんですね。
バレないようにセックスを楽しむ男女が集まるWEB版
アプリとWEB版には利用している男女の違いもあり、本当にセックスを楽しみたいのならばWEB版が最適ということもおすすめする理由です。
アプリを利用する女性の多くは「 SNSのように利用している」ことがほとんどです。承認欲求を満たすために活動している女性が多く、目的は「出会いではなくコミニケーション」であることが多いんですね。
その点、バレないようにセフレ探しをしている男女が集まるWEB版では「出会いを強く求めている女性」が多くいます。
出会いに繋がりやすくお互いにバレないようにセフレ探しをしているからこそ「適切な距離感を保ったセフレになりやすい」ことは、セフレ探しとして利用するための最大の利点かもしれませんね。
バレないように出会いやすい相手を探すのならば、WEB版の利用を一度考えてみてください。
