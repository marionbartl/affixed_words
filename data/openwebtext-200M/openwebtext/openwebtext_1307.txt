It ’s the only magic trick I can do .
The original art for this strip comes with its very own Boner Dolla .
America 's Health Insurance Plans ( AHIP ) was allegedly on board with health care reform from the start , until the White House decided to start vilifying insurance companies in August ; after that , as health reform began to coalesce amid that constant and exuberant vilification from Democrats of all stripes , AHIP criticized the cost - containment functions of Democratic reforms ( remember the PricewaterhouseCoopers study it commissioned , claiming that certain provisions in the Senate Finance bill -- but not the whole bill - - would raise costs ? ) .
AHIP stuck to that message today , claiming that parts of the newly passed Senate health reform bill would raise costs , instead of lowering them .
See the full statement from AHIP President and CEO Karen Ignagni below :
" Providing all Americans with health care coverage is crucial for the country .
Health plans support legislative changes that would provide guaranteed access to all Americans , with no pre-existing condition limitations and no health - status - based premiums .
These reforms are essential to giving all Americans greater peace of mind and health security .
" At the same time , specific provisions in this legislation will increase , rather than decrease , health care costs ; reduce coverage options ; and disrupt existing coverage for families , seniors and small businesses - particularly between now and when the legislation is fully implemented in 2014 .
" These issues can and should be addressed if health care reform is going to fulfill the promise of providing all Americans with guaranteed access to affordable , portable health care coverage . "

Jeff Daniels : Working In And Around The System
While I know Jeff Daniels best from such movies as Something Wild and Arachnophobia , the veteran actor has amassed an impressive body of theater and film work throughout his 30 - year career .
The man has also given back to his chosen craft by founding the Purple Rose Theatre in his hometown of Chelsea , Michigan , and it has become a haven for budding young actors in the Midwest who do n’t necessarily want to go to New York or Los Angeles right away to learn about performing .
Ultimately he has created a successful career for himself and done many projects on his own terms .
Daniels just finished up a run on Broadway in the acclaimed drama God Of Carnage ( with James Gandolfini , Hope Davis and Marcia Gay Harden ) , for which was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Play .
During that engagement I spoke with him for a cover story in Stage Directions magazine .
There was some extra material that did n’t make the feature , so I have included it here .
Jeff Daniels on taking his craft seriously and not being a Hollywood stereotype :
As you get older , and you have a family and have two of three kids who are still in college , how do you deal with the stress year in and year out about where the money ’s coming from ?
Is that a constant worry , or at this point do you have a system for dealing with all of this and a good rhythm to your career ?
Worry is a good word .
I would n’t say that I ’m a neurotic when it comes to where ’s my next job .
I ’m not that cliché , but I do have to make a certain amount of money every year and try to do it with as much artistic integrity as possible .
[ chuckles ]
But at the end of the day it ’s family first , and it ’s an obligation I take very seriously .
If that means the career suffers a little bit because I ’m doing something that maybe others who are more important would n’t , so be it .
But I can look my kids in the eye and not say , “ Come on and follow me and my artistic integrity to the poorhouse . ”
There ’s a responsibility to making sure that they ’re okay , and leading as artistic a life as possible .
I do the best I can in a business that really does n’t care .
You ’re also not a cliché of the business .
You have n’t been married multiple times and are not getting into the headlines for getting into trouble .
You seem stable and grounded .
Producers tend to like that , yeah .
They tend to like to hire that person , I ’ve found .
I remember when Colin Farrell was getting into trouble regularly and generating headlines .
That might ’ve done wonders for his bad boy reputation , but I ’m not sure it necessarily helped his films at the box office .
I ’ve always looked at the kind of behavior as short - term .
It may make you a lot of money now , but eventually …
I ’ve been on enough movie sets to know that we need it done now .
You need to be brilliant right now , and everybody is looking at their watch because this is the only day that they have this location .
I like being a hired gun that can come in and nail it , and the producers say , “ You just saved us half a day . ”
“ Yeah , I know . ”
Yup .

The defence secretary has said the Afghanistan mission is vital to the UK 's national security , following the 100th military death of this year .
Bob Ainsworth joined calls for the public not to judge the campaign by casualties alone as he arrived to visit troops in Helmand .
Head of the Army Gen Sir David Richards said such a judgement " undervalues the tremendous efforts " of the UK troops .
It comes as the body of the 99th UK serviceman to be killed was flown back .
Meanwhile , hundreds of people gathered in Wimborne , Dorset , for the funeral of 20 - year - old Rifleman Philip Allen - of 2nd Battalion The Rifles - who was killed in an explosion in Afghanistan on the eve of Remembrance Day .
We are told we must n't think too much about casualties - we must think about the propaganda , the lies , the posturing that we have been subjected to for the last eight years
Labour MP Paul Flynn
Afghan death soldier repatriated Toll on UK troops in Afghanistan
His best friend Karl Howard told the service he had been proud to be a soldier and had lived life " swift and bold " .
Mr Ainsworth said there was a " sense of very real progress " in Afghanistan .
He added : " The mission is of vital importance to our national security back in the UK and people have to understand that 's the reason we are here . "
' Challenging year '
The milestone 100th death comes only a week after the 99th UK serviceman was killed in Afghanistan this year - 30 - year - old Acting Sgt John Amer .
The body of A / Sgt Amer , who was fatally wounded as he went to help a colleague who had been wounded in another explosion moments earlier , was flown back to RAF Lyneham in Wiltshire .
Hundreds of people later lined the streets of the nearby town of Wootton Bassett as his funeral cortege passed through .
The latest death in Helmand was announced hours before Mr Ainsworth arrived for a trip the Ministry of Defence said was due to last several days .
He will also meet commanders and Afghan officials .
US Defence Secretary Robert Gates has also flown to Afghanistan on a separate visit .
Most recent UK fatalities Total deaths 2011 : 32
The British soldier , of 1st Battalion The Royal Anglian Regiment , was shot in the Nad-e Ali area of Helmand on Monday afternoon .
He has not yet been named but next of kin have been informed .
Gen Richards said the latest " loss hardens our determination to succeed " .
He added : " The temptation to judge this essential campaign by casualties alone undervalues the tremendous efforts of our forces and our allies , and the progress they are making . "
The chief of the defence staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , admitted 2009 had been a " particularly challenging year " but said the sacrifices " have brought security " to more of Helmand .
He warned there was " still much to do , and there will be difficult days ahead " .
But Sir Jock said : " Our armed forces are making a real difference , and are building the basis for enduring success in Afghanistan . "
AFGHAN WAR DEATH TOLLS 2009 US : 302 UK : 100 Canada : 27 France : 11 Italy : 9 Others : 49 Afghan forces :
More than 680 believed killed or missing Source : iCasualties.org ; various Former Chief of the General Staff , Gen Sir Richard Dannatt , told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Prime Minister Gordon Brown was now , " late in the day ... beginning to get " the significance and importance of winning in Afghanistan .
Mr Brown announced last month that 500 more UK troops would be going to Afghanistan , taking the total UK deployment to more than 10,000 , while the US plans to boost its deployment by 30,000 .
But BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera says there is a recognition that increases in British and American troop numbers are unlikely to reduce the casualty rate in the short term .
The total number of UK troops killed since the start of operations in Afghanistan in October 2001 has now reached 237 .
One Labour backbencher has accused ministers and military leaders of producing " carefully manicured soundbites " in response to the 100th death .
Newport West MP
Paul Flynn said they were seeking to suppress debate on whether forces should be in the country by presenting a " fiction " of potential success .
In a Commons debate he said : " We are told we must n't think too much about casualties , that we must think about other things - we must think about the propaganda , the lies , the posturing that we have been subjected to for the last eight years . "
The Stop the War coalition said it would be intensifying its campaign to have troops withdrawn .
The body of A / Sgt John Amer was driven through Wootton Bassett The group will deliver a petition to Downing Street on 21 December .
In a speech in London , shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said the UK was carrying a " disproportionate " burden in Afghanistan .
He said Nato countries which failed to contribute troops or financial support to the military mission in Afghanistan should ask themselves whether they were serious about their membership of the alliance .
Earlier , Afghan President Hamid Karzai warned that it would take 15 years before Afghanistan was able to pay for the costs of maintaining its own security forces .

Investigation finds more cases of duplication in publications co-authored by ministers and senior officials .
EXCLUSIVE
Nature has uncovered further instances of apparent plagiarism in papers co-authored by government ministers and senior officials in Iran .
The spate of new examples raises questions about whether such incidents are symptomatic of conditions also common in other developing countries — such as difficulties with English or pressure to acquire academic credentials as a prerequisite for promotion — or whether they are also linked specifically to the Iranian regime , where growth of a merit - based university culture has been undermined by political appointments and purges of reform - minded scientists ( see page 699 ) .
Research papers co-authored by Hamid Behbahani contain text from other works .
A. KENARE / AFP / GETTY
An earlier probe1 , 2 revealed extensive plagiarism in a paper co-authored by transport minster Hamid Behbahani and four papers co-authored by science minister Kamran Daneshjou .
The revelations received wide coverage in the Iranian media and blogosphere .
Scientists inside and outside the country have called for investigations , as well as for stronger ethical oversight in Iran 's research institutions .
Daneshjou , a mechanical engineer at the Iran University of Science & Technology ( IUST ) in Tehran , was head of the interior - ministry office that oversaw this year 's disputed election that kept President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in power .
In October , the Iranian parliament 's commission for science and education held an informal inquiry into the four Daneshjou papers .
Although it made no official conclusion , it effectively cleared Daneshjou after his co-author , IUST colleague Majid Shahravi , took responsibility for the papers ' contents in the Iranian media — although both Shahravi and some members of the commission also maintain that the papers contained originality .
Three of the four papers have now been retracted by the journals in question — the fourth was in an Iranian journal .
The paper3 by Behbahani , an IUST researcher who supervised Ahmadinejad 's PhD , has not been investigated , although it seems to be almost entirely put together from three earlier articles by different authors2 .
It was retracted by the journal Transport in October .
Behbahani has publicly said that the paper did not constitute plagiarism because only parts of the article were identical to earlier work .
He challenged the allegations of plagiarism , calling them a " media attack , far from fairness and integrity " and " an illegitimate accusation " .
Nature has now uncovered yet more instances of apparent plagiarism in papers from Behbahani and some of his co-authors .
One paper4 on asphalt - road resistance — by Behbahani's Transport co-authors Hassan Ziari , a deputy minister of roads and transportation whom Daneshjou recently appointed as head of Payame Noor University in Tehran , and Mohammed Khabiri , then a PhD student at the IUST — contains many sections that are identical to a 2005 paper5 by scientists in Pakistan .
And two 2008 papers6 , 7 on strengthening asphalt roads , co-authored by Behbahani and Ziari with PhD student Shams Noubakhat , also contain duplicated material .
The first6 includes multiple passages from three earlier papers8 , 9 , 10 and the second7 is also largely taken from three other papers10 , 11 , 12 .
One scientist familiar with the field , who asked to remain anonymous , says that he has difficulty making sense of the first paper 's results , and that some data in it6 are identical to those in one of the earlier papers by different researchers8 .
" That the two sets of results could be identical is improbable , " he says .
Behbahani and Ziari did not respond to requests for comment .
Muhammad Atif Ramay , managing editor of the Journal of Applied Sciences Research in which both papers were published , says that the journal has withdrawn the articles from its website pending further investigation .
Also in question is a 2008 paper on modelling pollution in Iran13 , which is co-authored by one of the 37 members of the Iranian Supreme Council of Cultural Revolution , Mohammad Ali Kaynejad , an environmental engineer at Sahand University of Technology in Tabriz , Iran .
The paper almost entirely duplicates a 2001 conference paper14 on modelling pollution in Hungary .
The Iranian paper acknowledges the original source of the model , although the authors wrote that it was " tested via the simulation of a photochemical oxidant episode that took place in Tabriz , Iran in 2007 " .
But Alison Tomlin , an environmental modeller at the University of Leeds , UK , and a co-author on the Hungary model , says that the Iranian paper contains " no new results " and " is definitely a copy " .
It includes computer simulations purportedly of Iranian data , but they match the Hungary figures — and the background map outlines Hungary , not Iran .
The first author of the Iranian paper , Esmaeil Fatehifar , an environmental engineer at Sahand University of Technology , places the responsibility on another member of the team .
" He said these are measured data about Tabriz Petrochemical Complex , " he says .
" I thought he was right and accepted it . "
Fatehifar says he intends to cancel the team member 's PhD plans .
He adds that Kaynejad had " not seen that paper " even though his name is on it .
Kaynejad did not respond to Nature 's interview requests .
Questions have also been raised over work co-authored by Ali Reza Ali-Ahmadi , education minister in the previous government of Ahmadinejad .
A 2006 paper15 on supply networks co-authored by him includes many sentences and paragraphs that are identical to those in three earlier papers16 , 17 , 18 .
Mika Ojala at Tampere University of Technology in Finland , a co-author on one of the earlier studies , says that in his opinion this is not coincidence .
Ali -Ahmadi could not be reached for comment .
Babak Amiri , an IUST researcher and a co-author on the paper , says that a draft version of the paper was accidentally submitted before it was checked by himself or Ali-Ahmadi .
" I apologize for this big mistake , " he says .

Nature has also learned that the US National Academy of Sciences earlier this year removed a chapter from a 2003 book19 on a US–Iranian workshop .
Ironically , the chapter , authored by Hassan Zohoor , secretary of the Academy of Sciences of the Islamic Republic of Iran , was called ' The impact of moral values on the promotion of science ' .
It was withdrawn because it substantially duplicated a 1999 paper20 by Douglas Allchin , a historian and philosopher now at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis .
Zohoor says that he never saw Allchin 's paper , and that he only prepared a draft of the paper , leaving others in his office to " develop it and add the literature review " .
Zohoor says that the explanation of the staff member involved — that the copying happened " quite accidentally and as a mere negligence " — is inadequate , and that he intends to write to Allchin to apologize .
" In my entire life I 've never copied anyone else 's work , " says Zohoor .

No one is too old for a receiving some help and tips when it comes to dating .
Even those who have a lot of experience in dating can make mistakes .
When it comes to dating , each time it is different because you date different people who have entirely different sets of tastes preferences and approach to life so no one can be over confident about their dating skills .
Here are few useful tips for senior dating .
When you are going on senior dating you are probably dating after a long time .
You may have to brush up your dating skills .
Some people even think that they can never date again and get discouraged easily even with the slightest failure .
Many of us think that finding a suitable date at that age is quite an impossible task .
If you too are thinking the same then you should know that you are wrong .
You can find suitable dates at any age .
So do not bar yourself from dating showing your age as the reason .
Start using online dating sites to look for your dates .
It may not be possible for all of us to visit bars and discos or to other places of socialization to find our dates but all of us can go online to search for our dates .
You can find a number of senior dating sites that you can use to find your partner .
Age is never a barrier for dating .
You must choose your dating site carefully after checking senior dating site reviews .
When you read reviews of dating sites , you will be able to know whether it is worth spending time in a particular dating website or not .
After finding the right dating website , signup for your account and start reviewing the profiles of singles available in your dating site .
Before contacting them , try to post a detailed profile about yourself so that when you contact others they will have something to read about who you are and what kind of person you are .
When you find the right person for dating , make sure that you plan dating evening well .
It is not a must that you should go steady with someone with whom you go on a first date .
The first date is actually to decide whether you two will be compatible for a long term relationship .
Never jump into conclusions regarding your relationship with a person .
It is best to go for a second date because on your first date both of you will be tensed and both of you would be trying hard to impress the other .
So you will not be natural on your first date .
You will therefore need a second date to get the feel of the other person .
In case you feel that things could workout between you two , make sure to convey it clearly to them so that they do not get the wrong message .
Clear communication is very important to be successful with senior dating .
" I have always said that I like everything from Marduk to Mozart , and this pretty much proves it , " Megadeth drummer Shawn Drover tells Noisecreep in reference to his ' Your iPod Is Showing ' submission .
He 's not kidding .
Drover 's iPod list starts with Vivaldi's ' The Four Seasons , ' ends with Pat Travers ' ' Gettin ' Betta ' and features a broad variety of classic rock , classic metal , neo-classical metal , jazz , thrash , prog and death metal in between .
" Growing up in Montreal back in the '70s , rock radio would play a Black Sabbath song , then a Supertramp tune and a Max Webster song to finish it off -- which , nowadays would never happen , as music has about four billion sub - genres just with heavy metal alone , " Drover says , explaining where his eclectic taste in music began .
" Back then , nobody would even bat an eyelash after hearing a wide variety of rock music and I really miss that , " Drover remembers .
" I always make sure I have a great variety of different music on my iPod and iTunes , because music evokes such emotion for me .
If I 'm in a violent head space and I feel like ripping somebody 's head off I will put on some Cryptic Slaughter or Marduk .
If I really want to relax and chill for a bit , I will throw on Vivaldi or Mozart . "
Setting his iPod in Random Shuffle mode -- as we require for ' Your iPod Is Showing ' -- is a familiar practice for Drover , who enjoys not knowing what song he 'll be listening to next .
What 's more , his diverse iPod list is just the tip of the iceberg of his listening habits .
" Although heavy metal is the music I play and love the most of all , I have always enjoyed listening to lots of other musical forms , " he says .
" A lot of avant - garde music really pumps me up .
Frank Zappa , Naked City , Blotted Science and Dillinger Escape Plan are a just a few of my favorites .
I really admire bands that create music with no boundaries . "
Shawn Drover , your iPod is showing :
Vivaldi -- ' The Four Seasons '
Dio -- ' Egypt ( The Chains Are On ) '
Suffocation -- ' Abomination Reborn '
Accept -- ' Restless and Wild '
Tony MacAlpine -- ' Dreamstate '
Saga -- ' Social Orphan '
Cradle of Filth -- ' Beneath the Howling Stars '

Egypt has found new evidence to support its demand for the return of Queen Nefertiti ’s bust , right , from Berlin , Bloomberg News reported .
According to the Supreme Council of Antiquities in Cairo the diary of the archaeologist who discovered the 3,500 - year - old bust shows that he misled authorities when it was transferred abroad .
In an e-mail statement the council said the diary of Ludwig Borchardt , who found the bust in 1912 , showed he knew the head was of Queen Nefertiti but instead reported it as a “ painted plaster bust of a princess . ”
The statement said , “ These materials confirm Egypt ’s contention that Borchardt did act unethically with the intent to deceive . ”
The diary was presented to Egypt by Friederike Seyfried , director of the Ägyptisches Museum und Papyrussammlung in Berlin , where the bust is on display at the Neues Museum .
Egypt will formally ask for the return of the bust this week .
Bernd Neumann , the German culture minister , has said that his country obtained the bust lawfully , and that Egypt had no grounds to seek its return .
Fears Mount Over Dangers
Of Hoisting Heavy Weights
By KEVIN HELLIKER
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
March 13 , 2003
As a fitness trainer and health fanatic , Michael Logan knew that weight lifting could strengthen his bones and protect his heart .
What he did n't know was that it could be lethal .
Mr. Logan had a bulge in his primary artery , the aorta .
Knowledge of that bulge , or aneurysm , would have prompted doctors to allow only light - weight lifting .
But like the vast majority of people with aneurysms , Mr. Logan did n't know he had one .
So he continued heavy - weight lifting -- until an aortic aneurysm killed him last June at age 46 .
" It 's very surprising that something he did for his health might have hurt him , " says Mike Logan , the late Chicago trainer 's son .
In a nation obsessed with looks and fitness , weight lifting is the latest workout craze .
Recent studies have shown that lifting can lower blood pressure , combat diabetes and strengthen bones .
Bookstore shelves are teeming with new fitness tomes touting weight lifting .
Over the three years ended in 2001 , participation in weight lifting in the U.S. has risen 12 % -- while aerobic exercise declined 2 % , according to American Sports Data Inc .
Now , however , a small but growing number of researchers are raising concerns about the safety of lifting heavy weights .
Such lifting can trigger strokes and aneurysms , and perhaps even cause a highly fatal arterial disease called dissection , believe doctors at prominent health centers such as Yale University School of Medicine and the Stanford University Medical Center .
Aneurysms alone kill 32,000 Americans a year , making them as big a killer as prostate cancer , and a more common killer than brain cancer or AIDS .
Especially vulnerable to aneurysm and other arterial conditions are senior citizens -- a group that has been urged to take advantage of the bone - strengthening effects of weight lifting .
Aneurysm experts express little concern about moderate to light - weight lifting .
Some define light as an amount that can be lifted 60 times , in four sets of 15 .
A leading aneurysm research and surgeon , John Elefteriades of the Yale University School of Medicine , recommends that people over 40 years old bench - press no more than half their body weight .
Equally important is breathing regularly during exercise to minimize spikes in blood pressure .
Aneurysms are n't the only concern for heavy - weight lifters .
Vascular experts say it can induce stroke , as well as dissection , in which the inner lining of the aortic artery separates from the outer walls .
Heavy - weight lifting can spike blood pressure to dangerous heights .
In maximum - effort lifting , which pits a participant against the most weight he can hoist one time , studies have shown that blood pressure rises to as high as 370/360 from a resting rate of 130/80 .
Conventional blood - pressure monitors can't even measure levels above 300 .
" At that level , nobody would be surprised if you had a stroke , " says Franz Messerli , a hypertension specialist at the Ochsner Clinic Foundation in New Orleans .
John Robertson witnessed just such an event one day when he was lifting weights as a medical student .
Lifting beside Dr. Robertson was a fellow medical student who suddenly keeled over backward .
A vessel in his brain had ruptured .
He was rushed to the hospital , and survived .
" During the time that you 're lifting , the pressure on the artery wall is intense , " says Dr. Robertson , chief of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at St. John 's Health Center in Santa Monica , Calif .
Doctors have long suspected that the steep blood - pressure spikes arising from heavy - weight lifting could trigger ruptures of already weakened vessels .
Now , suspicion is growing that such lifting can damage healthy vessels .
Yale 's Dr. Elefteriades has shown in a lab experiment that intense pressure can induce dissection , often requiring emergency open - heart surgery .
Dissection typically occurs in older adults , or those who have a family history or who suffer from a syndrome called Marfan 's disease .
Yet Dr. Elefteriades has treated two young dissection victims who had none of the traditional risk factors , but who were heavy - weight lifters .
Similarly , a study conducted at Los Angeles County Harbor - UCLA Medical Center profiled four young men who entered the emergency room suffering dissection -- all heavy - weight lifters .
Steriod use may increase the risk .
One option for anyone over 60 or with a family history of aneurysms or dissection is to get scanned before starting a lifting program .
Most aneurysms and dissections can be detected by CT scans .
Also , an inexpensive ultrasound test can detect the abdominal aortic aneurysm , which ranks as the nation 's 13th - leading cause of death .
The latest trend in resistance training is called slow lifting , in which the participant takes 10 seconds to raise a light to moderate amount of weight and 10 seconds to lower it .
Proponents tout it as a safer and more effective alternative to both regular lifting and aerobic exercise .
But the authors of two books on slow lifting concede they have n't measured its blood - pressure spikes , which is arguably the most crucial safety issue .
The two authors , Adam Zickerman and Michael Eades , say that slow lifting produces smaller spikes than regular lifting .
Other doctors and fitness experts disagree .
They say that one cause of blood - pressure spikes during weight lifting is the contraction of the effected muscle .
During slow lifting , a muscle may be contracted for more than 60 seconds compared with two or three seconds in regular speed lifting .
For anyone concerned about stroke , aneurysm or dissection , or for the vast number of Americans with uncontrolled hypertension , " I would not recommend slow lifting , " says Wayne Westcott , a slow - lifting proponent who is director of research at the South Shore YMCA in Quincy , Mass .

Last Friday , Ms. Renn arrived for an interview wearing a cosmic glitter Maison Martin Margiela cat suit , a sleeveless cardigan from Preen , Rick Owen ’s floppy boots and what looked like a bicycle lock around her neck .
For all the appearance of success , she has had darker days , as chronicled in her book , in which she describes starving herself to be a “ straight size ” model , the industry term for girls who meet the prevailing standard of beauty , which is to say extremely thin .
It was not until Ms. Renn acknowledged an eating disorder six years ago and began to eat normally that her career took off as a plus - size model .
While she embraces that label , she also sees it as a means of changing expectations among designers and magazines  and even the public  that models have to look a certain way .
Ms. Renn was born in Miami .
Her mother , who was still a teenager , left her to be raised by her grandmother , Kathy Renn , a successful saleswoman of Mary Kay cosmetics with a pink Cadillac in the driveway .
Ms. Renn came to know her grandmother as Mom , while her mother , named Lana in the book , remained largely out of the picture until her teens .
When she was 12 , Ms. Renn and her grandmother briefly moved in with Lana in Clinton , Miss. , but their relationship ended with a violent confrontation .

She never knew her father .
“ I do n’t have a picture , ” she said .
“ I do n’t even have a name . ”
When a modeling scout told her she had potential provided she lose weight and shrink her hip size from 43 inches to 34 , Ms. Renn saw a means of escape from small - town life in Clinton .
On a regimen of Diet Coke and sugar - free Jell - O , she began by losing 28 pounds in three months .
By 2002 , when she moved to New York at age 15 , she weighed 95 pounds and had lost more than 42 percent of her body weight .
On her first day in the city , she landed a shoot for Seventeen .
Kathy Renn , now living in Riverside , Calif. , where she is the executive director of a nonprofit group , Fuel Relief Fund , said she always thought her granddaughter was in control of her diet and weight .
“ One thing about Crystal , ” she said , “ is she is very goal - oriented .
When she set her mind to going into modeling , that ’s what she did . ”
Although she followed her granddaughter to New York for several months , Mrs. Renn was not fully aware of Crystal ’s weight struggles until she read the book .
Restoring China 's disappearing wetlands
By Yu Tianyu ( China Daily )
Updated : 2009-11-09 07:50
China has been making great efforts to re-draw the disappearing Sanjiang Plain Wetlands on its maps .
The country 's largest freshwater wetlands have changed dramatically in the face of the country 's rapid agricultural development in recent decades .
Located in the eastern region of Heilongjiang province , huge sections of the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands were converted by local farmers , soldiers and Zhiqing , or urban educated youth , between the early 1950s and the 1970s , responding to the central government 's call to develop the Great Northern Wilderness or " Beidahuang " .
The Sanjiang Plain area , a low plain that borders the Heilongjiang , Ussuri and Songhuajiang rivers , has gone through extensive agricultural development .
Today , a broad sweep of rice paddies and farmlands stretch toward the horizon .
Large wilderness areas became rich black farmlands .
The Chinese people gave a new name to the region : " Beidacang " - the Great Northern Grain Barn .
According to statistics , annual grain production reached 42.3 billion kg in 2008 of the country 's total 528.5 billion kg in grain production last year .
Beidahuang , which has 5.5 million hectares of fertile land , has become China 's largest grain production base , growing more than 138 billion kg of grain for the country over the past six decades .
After half a century , the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands tell a very different story .
Extensive agricultural development and population growth have resulted in a considerable loss of wetlands .
The Sanjiang Plain contains the largest area of wetlands in China .
It contains six national wetland reserves and 10 provincial wetland reserves .
But they are disappearing at a frightening speed .
After more than 50 years of economic development , the area of the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands decreased by 4.32 million hectares , or nearly 80 percent .
As a result , only 1 million hectares of wetlands can now be seen on the map of the Sanjiang Plain .
The wetlands , often referred to as the earth 's " kidneys " , have played a significant role in water purification and conservation , as well as the prevention of erosion and flooding .
Worsening droughts
Since the 1990s , the Sanjiang Plain area , with a total arable land area of 3.5 million hectares , has suffered worsening droughts .
The worst drought struck as much as 40 percent of its farmlands , and there are now more than 808,000 hectares of farmland that are vulnerable to droughts .
Scientists said an increase in droughts , floods and sandstorms afflicting northern China in recent years are closely linked to the shrinking wetlands .
Related ecological damage has caused economic losses equal to 4 percent to 8 percent of the country 's GNP , according to statistics .
" As the country 's largest ecological province , environmental protection in Heilongjiang province has huge effects on northeastern and northern China , " said Sun Yao , vice governor of Heilongjiang province .
Many rivers and water systems in Heilongjiang reach neighboring Russia , so the ecological effect stretches beyond China 's borders , he said .
Sun said Heilongjiang , especially the Sanjiang Plain , also is important to China 's food and energy security future .
Experts said the wetlands in Sanjiang Plain are considered globally important and represent one of the more important breeding sites and migratory routes for waterfowl in northeastern Asia .
The wetlands are also significant for the numbers and species of globally threatened waterfowl .
The Chinese government has realized that it must speed up its efforts to save its dwindling wetlands .
A pioneer of wetlands protection in China , the Heilongjiang provincial government has banned any cultivation and excavation of wetlands since 1999 .
The 2003 Heilongjiang Wetlands Regulations gave official authority for wetlands management to the Heilongjiang Provincial Forest Department ( HPFD ) .
Farmland - to - wetlands
With funding from the National Development and Reform Committee , HPFD is managing a project that will restore 150,000 hectares of farmland to wetlands and replant 68,500 hectares yearly by 2010 .
To better protect the wetlands , the Sanjiang Plain Wetlands Protection Project has been under way since March 2007 , co-financed by the Heilongjiang provincial government , Asian Development Bank and Global Environment Fund .
The project is expected to cost about $ 55 million , including $ 12.14 million in Global Environment Fund grants and $ 15 million in loans from the Asian Development Bank .
" The project is to promote sustainable use of natural resources through integrated conservation planning and to improve the well - being of local communities , " said Robert Wihtol , China director of the Asian Development Bank .
The project is targeting 13 counties , including six nature reserves within five contiguous watersheds .
Yoshiaki Kobayashi , a water resources management specialist for the Asian Development Bank , said the project will involve 11,900 hectares of new forest plantations .
Already , 8,457 hectares of new forests have been planted , he said .
The project also involves maintenance of about 43,700 hectares of existing forest lands .
" Forests increase the water retention capacity of the lands and mitigate soil erosion , which is the first step of wetlands protection , " Kobayashi said .
Kobayashi said the prospect of a net annual income of $ 210 to $ 256 per hectare from dry - land grain production ( wheat - soy - corn ) has served as a strong motivator for farmers to expand the farmlands in any way possible , including draining the wetlands .
Meanwhile , pesticide and fertilizer pollution , burning , grazing and other agricultural practices within or near the natural reserves have adversely affected the area 's ecology , according to a recent Asian Development Bank report .
" Alternative livelihoods for these farmers who are affected by the farmland - to - wetlands plan must be provided to discourage such harmful natural resource exploitation in the wetlands , " Kobayashi said .
As millions of students labor over college applications this month , they and their parents are pondering just how big a tuition bill they want to pay .
Students are increasingly skeptical about the value of a college degree ; the proportion who are willing to borrow money for college if necessary has fallen to 53 % from 67 % in the past year , based on a survey of 800 college students by Sallie Mae , Reston , Va .
Jason Wotman , who co-founded a tailgate - party service , says his degree in human and organizational development from Vanderbilt University helped prepare him for entrepreneurship .

Parents are thinking harder , too , about why they sign big tuition checks , based on a steady stream of email I have received since writing about the college cost - to - value equation a few months ago .
Here is a look at a few perspectives on the issue :
• A path to a better - paying job : College graduates in general earn at least 60 % more than high - school grads on average , both annually and over their lifetimes , and the income gap has been growing over time , says a 2007 report by the College Board , New York .
Beyond that , students who major in science - or math - related fields tend to earn more right out of college , compared with other majors , research shows .
Phillip Hamilton , a St. Louis stockbroker , values the earning potential of a degree from a top professional school for his son , a high - school junior , over any prestige or network a degree from an elite liberal arts college might confer .
" Is a degree in sociology , English or communications from a ' door - opening ' school really going to help with that landscaping job that awaits you ? " he asks rhetorically .
He hopes his son , 17 , chooses a college based on the quality of its engineering , food science or accounting program , and majors in one of those subjects .
" Then if you decide to work at a surf shop after graduation , you can still snap out of it at 27 and get a real job , " he says .

For parents who want to refine the cost - to - income analysis , a new tool is available that predicts how much money a student is likely to make after graduating .
The online calculator , HumanCapitalScore.com , will generate a 10 - year range of students ' likely postgraduation income based on their test scores , high school and college attended , grades and major .
Developed by People Capital , New York , a peer - lending concern , as a tool to predict students ' creditworthiness , the calculator can also be used to compare the likely outcome of various possible choices of colleges and majors .
It makes projections based on data sets from more than a half - dozen government and private - sector sources , encompassing hundreds of thousands of actual grads .
Prices start at $ 19.95 to compare two scenarios .
I tested the calculator by entering information on six actual college graduates who voluntarily shared their data , and comparing the HumanCapitalScore.com projections to the grads ' actual earnings .
The grads ' pay fell within the range projected by the calculator in five of six cases .
The exception was a young entrepreneur who chalked up a mediocre record at a little - known college but blossomed later , when working for himself .
The projections are based on what " an individual with certain attributes can reasonably expect to earn , " says Alan Samuels , People Capital 's chief product officer .
" Clearly , some will do better than expected , while others will do worse ; " the projections are likely to be accurate about 80 % of the time , he says .
HumanCapitalScore.com 's projections can also help a student figure out how much money to borrow for college .
Many experts say total student loans should n't exceed a grad 's first - year income after graduation .
More information on postgraduation pay can be found at Payscale.com / best - colleges , which offers general information on median salaries of actual grads by college , type of college , major and job .
• Preparing for a rich , well - rounded life : To Megan DeLamar Schroeder , Texarkana , Texas , planning the college experience based entirely on future income demeans its true value .
" The intangible benefits ... cannot be reduced to some kind of short - term cost benefit - analysis , as though one is purchasing a piece of property or an expensive sports car , " she says .
A college education and associated degree may be a " door opener " to career opportunities that may not be available otherwise .

She borrowed $ 40,000 to earn an economics degree from Stanford University in the 1980s , which landed her only an entry - level job at a bank upon graduation .
She spent 10 years paying off her student loans .
But the experience was worth every penny , she says .
The opportunity " to ' marinate ' for four years in an amazing environment " served as a " springboard to lifelong learning and inquisitiveness , " she says .
She will encourage her 10 - year - old twin daughters to hew to similar values when they start their college search , she says .
Research supports Ms. Schroeder 's viewpoint .
College grads generally show higher rates of civic participation , engaging in volunteer work and donating blood at more than twice the rate of high - school graduates , says the College Board study .
They are less likely to smoke and more likely to exercise daily .
College grads also have a much higher likelihood of being happy , says a 2005 survey of 3,014 adults by the Pew Research Center ; 42 % of college grads reported being very happy , compared with 30 % of those who only finished high school or less .
• Finding work you love : James Landon , Apache Junction , Ariz. , says this is a good reason to attend college , and he sees big public universities as the best and most cost - effective place to conduct such a search .
Four of his five children attended big public universities .
Two of them had no idea as freshmen what they wanted to do , Mr. Landon says , and the universities ' broad offerings of programs , majors and facilities helped them figure it out .
One wound up in finance and is a successful real - estate broker ; the other majored in psychology and political science and is now pursuing a foreign - service career in graduate school .
College degrees can guide students ' career choices in subtler ways .
Jason Wotman , 24 , loves his work as a co-founder of Tailwaiters , a Great Neck , N.Y. , startup that runs tailgate parties for clients at sporting events and concerts .
" It 's mine , it 's my baby .
Every step , every ounce of progress , feels good , " he says .
His degree in human and organizational development from Vanderbilt University helped launch him as an entrepreneur , he says .
His courses in marketing , human - resource management and leadership equipped him well to size up opportunities and run a startup .
" Taking it from an idea to an actual business , I felt like I had the tools , " he says .
• Gaining an influential network :
Many graduates of elite colleges swear by the value of their network of campus buddies in opening doors after graduation , and say striving to gain admission to such schools is worth the effort .
However , a long - term study of 6,335 college grads published in 1999 by the National Bureau of Economic Research found graduating from a college where entering students have higher SAT scores — a sign of exclusivity — did n't pay off in higher post - graduation income .
What matters more , it seems , is graduates ' personal drive .
In a surprising twist , a stronger predictor of income is the caliber of the schools that reject you .
Researchers found students who applied to several elite schools but did n't attend them — presumably because many were rejected — are more likely to earn high incomes later than students who actually attended elite schools .
In a summary of the findings , the Bureau says that " evidently , students ' motivation , ambition and desire to learn have a much stronger effect on their subsequent success than average academic ability of their classmates . "

Staff at mobile phone company T - Mobile passed on millions of records from thousands of customers to third party brokers , the firm has confirmed .
Details emerged after the firm alerted the information commissioner , who said his office was preparing a prosecution .
Christopher Graham said brokers had sold the data to other phone firms , who then cold - called the customers as their contracts were due to expire .
A T - Mobile spokesman said the data had been sold " without our knowledge " .
Mr Graham , who was appointed earlier this year as the watchdog responsible for safeguarding personal information , said the data breach was the biggest of its kind .
He added that the case illustrated why there needed to be a prison sentence to prevent people from selling private data to third parties .
Mr Graham confirmed his office was preparing a prosecution against those responsible for selling on T - Mobile data .
Justice Minister Michael Wills told the BBC that there was a " strong case " for introducing custodial sentences to prevent the trade in illegal data .
Search warrants Initially Mr Graham had said he would not name the operator involved as it could prejudice a prosecution .
But after phone firms 02 , Vodafone , Orange , 3 and Virgin said they were not the subject of his investigation , T - Mobile confirmed it had been .
ANALYSIS Danny Shaw , BBC home affairs correspondent
The increasing use of computers and memory sticks to store and transfer data has fuelled what the information commissioner described in 2006 as a pernicious and widespread trade .
Addresses , phone bills , bank statements and health records - they can all be obtained for a price .
The Information Commissioner 's report estimated that you could trace the name and address of a telephone caller from their phone number for £ 75 and check someone 's criminal record for £ 500 .
Suppliers obtain information through two routes - by paying insiders to pass it on or by pretending to be someone who has a lawful need for it - known as blagging .
In August a civilian worker at Essex Police was fined for accessing police intelligence databases 800 times and passing on mobile phone records .
Mr Graham said investigators had been working with the company after it reported suspicions of an unlawful trade in customers ' data .
The team from the Information Commissioner 's office obtained search warrants to enter premises and have also interviewed employees .
Mr Graham said : " Many people will have wondered why and how they are being contacted by someone they do not know just before their existing phone contract is about to expire .
" We are considering the evidence with a view to prosecuting those responsible and I am keen to go much further and close down the entire unlawful industry in personal data .
" But , we will only be able to do this if blaggers and others who trade in personal data face the threat of a prison sentence .
" The existing paltry fines are simply not enough to deter people from engaging in this lucrative criminal activity .
The threat of jail , not fines , will prove a stronger deterrent . "
' Exploiting data '
The Ministry of Justice has been consulting on tougher penalties for illegal trade in personal information .
The Data Protection
Act bans the selling on of data without prior permission from the customer and a fine of £ 5,000 can be imposed following a successful prosecution .
T- MOBILE FACTS
The UK 's fourth largest mobile phone company Has an estimated 16.6 million UK customers - a 15 % share of the market UK workforce of 6,500 Subsidiary of German firm Deutsche Telekom Plans to merge its UK business with that of Orange
This would create a mobile phone giant with 28.4 million customers But Mr Graham said that the mobile phone case suggested that people were " driving a coach and horses " through the legislation .
He added : " This is not just about mobile phone companies .
It 's about private investigators , it 's about blagging information from databases for use to put the frighteners on witnesses , attempt to knobble juries , pursue ' nasty neighbour ' disputes , interfere in the family courts , difficult divorce settlements .
" Personal data has value and there are people out there exploiting it . "
Justice Minister Michael Wills said the government was looking at bringing in tougher penalties to deter the illegal trade in personal information .
He added : " Given the scale of public concern about privacy of their data , I think we have to look at going further and custodial sentences clearly have to be a part of that . "
But Conservative justice spokeswoman Eleanor Laing said : " The government 's refusal to establish a strong privacy watchdog is nothing short of scandalous .

" We need a beefed - up information commissioner with a full set of punitive strings to his bow , including the power to fine organisations . "
Lib Dem Home Affairs spokesman Chris Huhne said the " shameful incident " proved that stiffer penalties " cannot be introduced soon enough " .
He added : " This sorry episode questions the government 's wisdom in getting communications providers to hoard increasing amounts of information about us . "
' Proactively supported ' A spokesman for T - Mobile said the sale of the data had been " deeply regrettable " and that it had been asked to keep it secret to avoid any criminal prosecutions being prejudiced .
He said : " T - Mobile takes the protection of customer information seriously .
" When it became apparent that contract renewal information was being passed on to third parties without our knowledge , we alerted the Information Commissioner 's Office .
The spokesman added that the company and the ICO " working together " had identified the source of the breach and that T - Mobile had " proactively supported the ICO to help stamp out what is a problem for the whole industry " .
He added : " We were therefore surprised at the way in which these statements were made to the BBC today . "

PRETTY in pink ?
Not Deborah Watson .
“ If I see a floral print or pastel dress in my closet , I think : ‘ Ugh , gross !
I do n’t want to wear that , ’ ” she said .
Ms. Watson , a fashion stylist in New York , has turned her back on those hallowed totems of femininity in favor of the raffish look of a big T - shirt , well - worn jeans and a graying black cotton overcoat .
“ Anything more girly , I just see as weak , ” she said .
“ It ’s not cool to be demure . ”
A disdain for such sweetly conventional trappings of sex appeal has trickled down of late from tastemakers like Ms. Watson to scores of followers who are swapping their baby - doll dresses , spindly heels and lace for the flinty attractions of studs and leather , mannish jackets and rock - star jeans .
Their embrace of a pointedly aggressive , street - smart style suggests that the more adventurous are rethinking the tenets of female allure .
If the old ideal of sexiness was the shoulder - baring voluptuousness of Scarlett Johansson , the new sexy is the European fashion editor Carine Roitfeld in a black blazer and tall vixenish boots .
The look , often slightly disheveled , is shared by off - duty models and style - world insiders .
“ We may like Lady Gaga , but in this day and age , women are n’t rushing out to look like her , ” said Sam Shahid , the art director behind the provocative advertising campaigns of Abercrombie & Fitch .
This narrative suits Arab governments .
It allows them to deflect onto America all of their people ’s grievances over why their countries are falling behind .
And it suits Al Qaeda , which does n’t need much organization anymore  just push out The Narrative over the Web and satellite TV , let it heat up humiliated , frustrated or socially alienated Muslim males , and one or two will open fire on their own .
See : Major Hasan .
“ Liberal Arabs like me are as angry as a terrorist and as determined to change the status quo , ” said my Jordanian friend .
The only difference “ is that while we choose education , knowledge and success to bring about change , a terrorist , having bought into the narrative , has a sense of powerlessness and helplessness , which are inculcated in us from childhood , that lead him to believe that there is only one way , and that is violence . ”
What to do ?
Many Arab Muslims know that what ails their societies is more than the West , and that The Narrative is just an escape from looking honestly at themselves .
But none of their leaders dare or care to open that discussion .
In his Cairo speech last June , President Obama effectively built a connection with the Muslim mainstream .
Maybe he could spark the debate by asking that same audience this question :
“ Whenever something like Fort Hood happens you say , ‘ This is not Islam . ’
I believe that .
But you keep telling us what Islam is n’t .
You need to tell us what it is and show us how its positive interpretations are being promoted in your schools and mosques .
If this is not Islam , then why is it that a million Muslims will pour into the streets to protest Danish cartoons of the Prophet Muhammad , but not one will take to the streets to protest Muslim suicide bombers who blow up other Muslims , real people , created in the image of God ?
You need to explain that to us  and to yourselves . ”
( CNN ) -- Former Hewlett - Packard CEO
Carly Fiorina finally made it official Wednesday : She 's running for Senate in California .
The first woman to lead a Fortune 500 company made the announcement at an event in conservative Orange County , pledging that her focus will be on " economic recovery and fiscal accountability "
" The decisions made in Washington impact every family and every business , of any size , in America .
Throughout my career , I 've brought people together and solved problems , and that is what I plan to do in government :
Set aside ego and partisanship and work to develop solutions to our problems , " she told supporters .
" I will not settle for a jobless recovery , and we must start the important work of getting our financial house back in order , " Fiorina added .
" Washington must show discipline to cut spending and create policies that encourage and empower businesses and put people back to work . "
Fiorina , considered to be a moderate Republican with little history on social issues , will face off against conservative California Assemblyman Chuck DeVore for the GOP nomination .
In a friendly statement Wednesday , DeVore said he looks forward " to engaging [ her ] on the issues Californians care about . "
A recent Field poll suggested that both Fiorina and DeVore polled at about 20 percent , with 60 percent of Republican voters undecided .
The ex-Fortune 500 CEO , who left Hewlett - Packard in 2005 with a severance package estimated to be worth between $ 21.5 million and $ 40 million , is expected to enjoy a significant financial advantage over DeVore , who entered October with just $ 144,000 in the bank .
The Fiorina - DeVore matchup has all the makings of another Republican battle between the conservative wing of the party and national leaders seeking the most electable candidate .
Fiorina has claimed that the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee is backing her bid , though an NRSC spokesman said no official endorsement has been made .
Still , NRSC Chairman John Cornyn pointed to Fiorina in September as an example of a " strong female candidate " running as a Republican in 2010 .
A string of conservative bloggers have lined up behind DeVore , and South Carolina Sen .
Jim DeMint said Tuesday that he was backing the assemblyman .
The winner of that race will face three - term Sen. Barbara Boxer in November .
Boxer 's favorable rating stood at 48 percent in a recent Field poll , a number that gives Republicans hope she is vulnerable against a well - funded opponent .
Boxer is known to be a formidable political opponent , but Fiorina said Wednesday that she 's ready for the challenge .
" After chemothereapy , Barbara Boxer just really is n't that scary any more , especially when you know what to expect , " said Fiorina , who battled breast cancer last spring .
" She has always taken the low road to high office . "
Though spending most of her life outside of politics , Fiorina is no stranger to the campaign trail , having served as one of then - Republican presidential candidate John McCain 's chief surrogates in 2008 .
Fiorina was eventually sidelined from that campaign after telling an interviewer that she did n't think either member of the GOP presidential ticket was qualified to run a major company .
In an election season in which the state 's economic condition is set to dominate the debate , Fiorina is now the second high - profile former CEO running for statewide office in California .
Former eBay CEO Meg Whitman announced last month she is running for governor .
National Democrats , meanwhile , appear eager to take on Fiorina , who left Hewlett - Packard five years ago amid controversy .
" The hallmark of Carly Fiorina 's résumé is her tenure at Hewlett - Packard , where she laid off 28,000 Americans while shipping jobs overseas , just before taking a $ 21 million golden parachute , " National Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Eric Schultz said .
" Given that record , the United States Senate is the last place Carly Fiorina should go next . "
This is number 1,789 , or thereabouts , in my long running series , " What the hell is going on in this country ? "
Every morning I wake up to emails from my researcher Hannah Lease .
There are now thousands on my system , each one detailing some new piece of madness or a liberty that has been lost , or is disappearing .
Over the years , themes have emerged .
One of the more interesting for future historians and sociologists is the paranoia that has infected our dealings with children .
Britain is now a society that on the one hand incarcerates the children of asylum seekers for periods longer than any uncharged terrorist can be held , and on the other is insisting that sixth formers and parents of children who are taught at home must have CRB checks .
Nowhere else in Europe would parents wishing to attend Christmas carol services and other events around the holiday season be asked to have CRB checks : even those who walk other people 's children to school have been told they must be checked .
Graham McArthur , the headmaster of Somersham School in Cambridgeshire and evidently one of the new breed of officious , trembling martinets that run our schools , was quoted in the Sunday Times as saying :
We rely quite a lot on parental volunteers .
It is a community school and parental engagement is very important to being part of the community .
For the carol service they will need clearance [ from the banned list ] which is basically something we can do on the day .
You need to see details of who they are , where they live and make several phone calls .
It will not surprise you to learn that parents are being asked to take their passports so that their details can be checked .
In Liverpool , parents have been banned from speaking to teachers without an appointment .
Sally Aspinwall , head teacher at the Beacon Church of England primary school in Everton , wrote to parents saying she was piloting new security procedures due to " recent health and safety guidance issued to schools by Ofsted " .
This mystifying action results , of course , in the reduction of easy , natural communication at everyone 's expense but Aspinwall no doubt rejoices in her ability to issue bossy edicts with nothing less than the backing of Ofsted .
We have become so obsessed with paedophilia and child abuse that we are prepared to watch children being forcibly taken from their parents because the state or local authorities believe they know what is best for the child .
But how transparent are the processes involved in removing a child ?
Last week , the senior Tory MP Tim Yeo used parliamentary privilege to accused Suffolk county council " of snatching a baby from the mother 's arms " .
He said that the council ignored the rights of the parents and child , and gave false evidence to an adoption panel without ever having questioned the ability of parents to care for the child .
Does this represent a society that is working for children , or is it another example of presumptuous intervention that shows itself as Dickensian heartlessness ?
I tend towards the latter , particularly when you consider the case of Child M , an Iranian boy of nine who has again been detained by the UK Borders Agency in Yarl 's Wood with a view to deporting him and his parents to Iran where they may face prosecution for possession of Salman Rushdie 's Satanic Verses .
Local authorities and the state constantly protest that they are striving in the interests of children , but reading these stories and looking at the record on databases one really wonders if authority is in fact more interested in control over children and parents than promoting consistent policies of reasonable care .
Certainly when it comes to the case of Child M , as with so many other kids locked up by the UK Borders Agency , the state 's much vaunted compassion suddenly seems to evaporate .
What puzzles me is the state 's unending curiosity .
Recently the health department launched an 83 - point questionnaire for parents of children who are entering school for the first time .
The Healthy Child Programme and 83 - point questionnaire has so far involved parents only in Lincolnshire .
They have been told it is confidential but actually their answers will be open for inspection by hundreds of health workers , who will then visit families offering support .
Here are some of the questions :
• Do you ( the parent ) have friends you can talk to ?
• How often does your child drink plain water ?
• How many times a week does your child eat red meat ?
• Does he or she often lie and cheat ?
• How does your child behave when you leave a room ?
Jill Kirby of the Centre for Policy Studies said :
Parents are not told how the information will be used , nor that they can refuse to give it ...
It risks labelling children and families as problem cases when the aim should be to help children escape from difficult backgrounds .
I do n't apologise for returning to the subject of children again .
It seems to me that in its myriad policies on children – whether the persecution of kids on the street by police seeking DNA samples , the drawing up of huge amounts of information for databases inaccessible to parents , the use of CCTV in classrooms , the introduction of biometric registration systems , the unbelievably impertinent instructions about parents attending school events , the insistence on CRB checks and the production of ID in the most ridiculous circumstances , the treatment of asylum seekers ' children or the fascination with the most intimate details of family life – the government is displaying a mistrust of children and parents , which I seriously suggest has an almost sociopathic nature .
As in Australia , the stakes are high in the United States .
American merchants , like their counterparts Down Under , complain that the high fees they must pay credit card companies and banks to accept their cards force them to increase prices on everything they sell  even for people who pay with cash  to make up the difference .
In the United States , the Government Accountability Office last week issued a report showing that consumers who did not use credit cards “ may be made worse off by paying higher prices for goods and services , as merchants pass on their increasing card acceptance costs to their customers . ”
The main consumer federation in Australia , Choice , says that while regulations here have had a few unintended consequences , they have created incentives for retailers and consumers alike to rely more on debit cards , which have much lower processing costs , instead of credit cards .
“ It drives me crazy , people buying chewing gum on a credit card , ” said Christopher Zinn , a spokesman for Choice , an Australian consumer group .
“ We all pay for it . ”
Though many people may not realize it , out of every dollar charged on a credit card , merchants in many countries , including the United States , get about 98 cents and sometimes less ; the other 2 cents go to banks and credit card companies .
Banks use these fees to cover fraud losses , their loss of interest on money until the consumer pays the bill , computer systems and employees who process credit card transactions .
The banks also pay Visa and MasterCard for their marketing and digital networks .
But the fees also generate tens of billions of dollars in revenue each year for banks that issue cards branded by Visa and MasterCard .
In the United States alone , banks that issue credit cards get an estimated $ 40 billion to $ 50 billion in income annually from interchange fees , which are the biggest single component of fees charged to merchants .
The banks and card companies are lobbying heavily against proposed changes .
They warn that lower fees will lead them to squeeze credit and raise the cost of credit cards at a time when the economy thirsts for credit to sustain an economic recovery .
Some of this has already happened in Australia , where in 2003 , after years of retailers ’ complaints , the nation ’s central bank required that the interchange fees that merchants pay banks that issue Visa and MasterCard cards be cut in half , to less than 1 cent .
Merchant fees for American Express and Diners ’ Club were not regulated because banks did not issue their cards .
But both card companies cut merchant fees anyway , to 2 cents , from 2.46 cents , to avoid losing customers to Visa and MasterCard .
It was founded in 1931 by Ferdinand Porsche , an Austro - Hungarian engineer born in Maffersdorf , Austria - Hungary .
Porsche is also known for designing the first Volkswagen , but Béla Barényi is credited with having conceived the basic design five years earlier .
The company currently produces 911( 997 ) , Boxster and Cayman sports cars and Cayenne sport utility vehicles .
The latest model line , the four - door Panamera saloon ( sedan ) , was launched on Monday , 20 April 2009 .
In August 2009 , Porsche SE and Volkswagen Group ( Volkswagen AG ) reached an agreement that Volkswagen AG and Porsche AG would merge in 2011 , to form an “ Integrated Automotive Group .
In a May 2006 survey , Porsche was awarded the title of the most prestigious automobile brand by Luxury Institute , New York ; it questioned more than 500 households with a gross annual income of at least US $ 200,000 and a net worth of at least US $ 720,000 .
The current Porsche model range includes sports cars from the Boxster roadster to their most famous product , the 911 .
The Cayman is a hard top car similar to the Boxster in a slightly higher price range .
The Cayenne is Porsche ’s mid-size luxury sport utility vehicle ( SUV ) .
The limited run Carrera GT ceased production in May 2006 .
A high performance luxury saloon / sedan , the Panamera , was launched on Monday , 20 April 2009 , but is due to be released worldwide in September and October .
Recently , a spider version of the Boxster was announced , and will be available after it is unveiled at the 2009 Los Angeles Auto Show .

That ’s right , Faux News thought Stewart ’s coverage was just great , no irony or sarcasm at all .
The sad news is , Fox is right .
The Daily Show earned that praise and deserves it , unfortunately .
Once again Stewart acted largely as an echo chamber for a climate story rather than as the insightful wit that cuts to the truth with clever juxtapositioning .
Completely absent was Stewart ’s trademark of letting a talking head crawl out on a limb , and then presenting some visual or commentary that exposes the lie .
Notwithstanding a couple of cheap shots at Inhofe , which is both too easy and pointless to the story , and affirming that the emails do not topple climate science , which is obvious to anyone with a brain , Stewart contributed nothing new .
Instead Stewart just let ’s the main claims of the CNN talking head stand .
Not just stand , but clearly accepts the claims as stated to be both accurate and true .
Jon , seriously … when Fox thinks you ’re doing a great job maybe it ’s time to double check just what it is you are doing .
Not to say that it ’s necessarily proof that you ’re screwing up , but it ’s sure not a good sign .
I am not asking Stewart to do anything different from his usual schtick ; quite the opposite , I want to know why he did n’t do his usual schtick ?
Make no mistake , many aspects of this story are too nuanced , complicated , or as yet unresolved to be suitable for The Daily Show to tackle .
Nor am I asking The Daily Show to be some sort of news show format .
It ’s not , it ’s a comedy show .
But it ’s a comedy show that does cover the news of the day , and does so with a particular style … usually .
Elements of the story , particularly the elements covered in the CNN report , did lend themselves to being deflated with the usual Daily Show format .
Further , this aired Dec 1st , when all of the information needed to craft a classic Stewartesque puncturing of the wingnut hysteria were easily available .
One phone call or two hours of an intern ’s time on the internet were all that was required , and yet that ’s not what we got .
How could Stewart have handled it ?
Well , take the “ hide the decline ” piece .
How hard would it have been to follow the talking head with this graph
clearly showing :
there was no temperature decline to hide in 1981 , and the CRU data is no different from the other data sets , hence obviously had not been tampered with .
Instead of exposing the misleading story , Stewart chose to reinforce it “ It ’s just scientist - speak for using a standard statistical technique — recalibrating data - – in order to trick you . ”
He then uses that to segue into helping spread the lie that the raw temperature data from the 1980s has been destroyed , another lie he could have debunked , but chose to repeat instead .
As for the accusations of draconian suppression of dissent , I can easily see Stewart using his standard ‘ speaker in the ear ’ bit to clarify that :
the alleged suppression was not of dissenting views , but of work and journals thought to be false , and that these works and journals did indeed turn out to be false .
Not only would that have been easy , it would have been standard Stewart style , but it ’s not what we got .
Instead we got a straight read as if Stewart were some Fox News sock puppet reading the teleprompter … no wonder Fox thought it was a wonderful performance .
So what does this mean ?
Is it that the facts are so hard to find that even The Daily Show ca n’t come up with them despite their considerable resources ?
What does that tell us about how the average member of the thinking public is getting their information ?
Or is Stewart & Co. really so clueless on simple climate science that they start to border on Denial ?
That may seem hard to believe , but since when does Stewart uncritically accept and repeat stories exactly as the appear on popular media ?
Yet he did so here , and also with his servile fawning over the Superfreaks climate scam .
Regardless of why , this is not good given how relatively influential Stewart is .
What next ?
Inhofe as a special and honoured guest ?
co-hosting with O’Rielly ?
Seriously Jon , if you ’re not going to give climate stories the standard Stewart lampooning with all of it ’s insight , accuracy and wit , please do n’t cover them at all .
Much more of this sort of coverage and Glenn Beck will be holding you up as an example for the popular media to emulate , and I am not sure you want to go there …

A Smoldering Gun From Nashville , TN
Guest post by Basil Copeland
The hits just keep on coming .
About the same time that Willis Eschenbach revealed “ The Smoking Gun at Darwin Zero , ” The UK ’s Met Office released a “ subset ” of the HadCRUT3 data set used to monitor global temperatures .
I grabbed a copy of “ the subset ” and then began looking for a location near me ( I live in central Arkansas ) that had a long and generally complete station record that I could compare to a “ homogenized ” set of data for the same station from the GISTemp data set .
I quickly , and more or less randomly , decided to take a closer look at the data for Nashville , TN .
In the HadCRUT3 subset , this is “ 72730 ” in the folder “ 72 . ” A direct link to the homogenized GISTemp data used is here .
After transforming the row data to column data ( see the end of the post for a “ bleg ” about this ) , the first thing I did was plot the differences between the two series :
The GISTemp homogeneity adjustment looks a little hockey - stickish , and induces an upward trend by reducing older historical temperatures more than recent historical temperatures .
This has the effect of turning what is a negative trend in the HadCRUT3 data into a positive trend in the GISTemp version :
So what would appear to be a general cooling trend over the past ~ 130 years at this location when using the unadjusted HadCRUT3 data , becomes a warming trend when the homogeneity adjustment is supplied .
“ There is nothing to see here , move along . ” I do not buy that .
Whether or not the homogeneity adjustment is warranted , it has an effect that calls into question just how much the earth has in fact warmed over the past 120 - 150 years ( the period covered , roughly , by GISTemp and HadCRUT3 ) .
There has to be a better , more “ robust ” way of measuring temperature trends , that is not so sensitive that it turns negative trends into positive trends ( which we ’ve seen it do twice how , first with Darwin Zero , and now here with Nashville ) .
I believe there is .
Temperature Data : Pasteurized versus Homogenized
In a recent series of posts , here , here , and with Anthony here , I ’ve been promoting a method of analyzing temperature data that reveals the full range of natural climate variability .
Metaphorically , this strikes me as trying to make a case for “ pasteurizing ” the data , rather than “ homogenizing ” it .
In homogenization , the object is to “ mix things up ” so that it is “ the same throughout . ”
When milk is homogenized , this prevents the cream from rising to the top , thus preventing us from seeing the “ natural variability ” that is in milk .
But with temperature data , I want very much to see the natural variability in the data .
And I cannot see that with linear trends fitted through homogenized data .
It may be a hokey analogy , but I want my data pasteurized – as clean as it can be – but not homogenized so that I cannot see the true and full range of natural climate variability .
I believe that the only way to truly do this is by analyzing , or studying , how differences in the temperature data vary over time .
And they do not simply vary in a constant direction .
As everybody knows , temperatures sometimes trend upwards , and at other times downward .
The method of studying how differences in the temperature data allows us to see this far more clearly than simply fitting trend lines to undifferenced data .
In fact , it can prevent us from reaching the wrong conclusion , as in fitting a positive trend when the real trend has been negative .
To demonstrate this , here is a plot of monthly seasonal differences for the GISTemp version of the Nashville , TN data set :
Pay close attention as I describe what we ’re seeing here .
First , “ sd ” means “ seasonal differences ” ( not “ standard deviation ” ) .
That is , it is the year to year variation in each monthly observation , for example October 2009 compared to October 2008 .
Next , the “ trend ” is the result of smoothing with Hodrick - Prescott smoothing ( lamnda = 14,400 ) .
The type of smoothing here is not as critical as is the decision to smooth the seasonal differences .
If a reader prefers a different smoothing algorithm , have at at it .
Just make sure you apply it to the seasonal differences , and that it not change the overall mean of the series .
I.e. , the mean of the seasonal differences , for GISTemp ’s Nashville , TN data set , is - 0.012647 , whether smoothed or not .
The smoothing simply helps us to see , a little more clearly , the regularity of warming and cooling trends over time .
Now note clearly the sign of the mean seasonal difference : it is negative .
Even in the GISTemp series , Nashville , TN has spent more time cooling ( imagine here periods where the blue line in the chart above is below zero ) than it has warming over the last ~ 130 years .
How can that be ?
Well , the method of analyzing differences is less sensitive – I.e. more “ robust ” — than fitting trend lines through the undifferenced data .
“ Step ” type adjustments as we see with homogeneity adjustments only affect a single data point in the differenced series , but affect every data point ( before or after it is applied ) in the undifferenced series .
We can see the effect of the GISTemp homogeneity adjustments here by comparing the previous figure with the following :
Here , in the HadCRUT3 series , the mean seasonal difference is more negative , - 0.014863 versus - 0.012647 .
The GISTemp adjustments increases the average seasonal difference by 0.002216 , making it less negative , but not enough so that the result becomes positive .
In both cases we still come to the conclusion that “ on the average ” monthly seasonal differences in temperatures in Nashville have been negative over the last ~ 130 years .
An Important Caveat
So have we actually shown that , at least for Nashville , TN , there has been no net warming over the past ~ 130 years ?
No , not necessarily .
The average monthly seasonal difference has indeed been negative over the past 130 years .
But it may have been becoming “ less negative . ”
Since I have more confidence , at this point , in the integrity of the HadCRUT3 data , than the GISTemp data , I ’ll discuss this solely in the context of the HadCRUT3 data .
In both the “ original data ” and in the blue “ trend ” shown in the above figure , there is a slight upward trend over the past ~ 130 years :
Here , I ’m only showing the fit relative to the smoothed ( trend ) data .
( It is , however , exactly the same as the fit to the original , or unsmoothed , data . )
Whereas the average seasonal difference for the HadCRUT3 data here was - 0.014863 , from the fit through the data it was only - 0.007714 at the end of series ( October 2009 ) .
Still cooling , but less so , and in that sense one could argue that there has been some “ warming . ”
And overall – I.e. if a similar kind of analysis is applied to all of the stations in the HadCRUT3 data set ( or “ subset ” ) – I will not be surprised if there is not some evidence for warming .
But that has never really be the issue .
The issue has always been ( a ) how much warming , and ( b ) where has it come from ?
I suggest that the above chart showing the fit through the smooth helps define the challenges we face in these issues .
First , the light gray line depicts the range of natural climate variability on decadal time scales .
This much – and it is very much of the data – is completely natural , and cannot be attributed to any kind of anthropogenic influence , whether UHI , land use / land cover changes , or , heaven forbid , greenhouse gases .
If there is any anthropogenic impact here , it is in the blue line , what is in effect a trend in the trend .
But even that is far from certain , for before we can conclude that , we have to rule out natural climate variability on centennial time scales .
And we simply cannot do that with the instrumental temperature record , because it is n’t long enough .
I hate to admit that , because it means either that we accept the depth of our ignorance here , or we look for answers in proxy data .
And we ’ve seen the mess that has been made of things in trying to rely on proxy data .
I think we have to accept the depth of our ignorance , for now , and admit that we do not really have a clue about what might have caused the kind of upward drift we see in the blue trend line in the preceding figure .
Of course , that means putting a hold on any radical socioeconomic transformations based on the notion that we know what in truth we do not know .

A three - day United Nations summit on world food security opened in Rome today , with Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon warning that on this day alone more than 17,000 children will die of hunger – one every five seconds , 6 million a year – even as the planet has more than enough food for all .
“ Today , more than one billion people are hungry , ” he told the assembled leaders , calling for immediate action on long - term remedies , a day after he himself fasted for 24 hours in solidarity with all those billion .
“ It was not easy .
But , for too many people , it is a daily reality . ”
The leaders unanimously adopted a declaration pledging renewed commitment to eradicate hunger from the face of the earth sustainably and at the earliest date .
They agreed to work to reverse the decline in domestic and international funding for agriculture , promote new investment , and proactively face the challenges of climate change to food security .
Mr. Ban laid out a full , comprehensive spectrum of measures to combat a scourge gravely exacerbated by climate change and population growth that will see two billion more mouths to feed in 2050 – 9.1 billion in all – with an overall need to grow 70 per cent more food .
The steps range from immediate needs such as food aid , safety nets and social protection to the longer - term goals achieved through increased investments in agricultural development , including provision of seeds , water supplies and land to ensure higher productivity , better market access , and fairer trade , above all for smallholder farmers , especially women .
“ These smallholder farmers are the heart and soul of food security and poverty reduction , ” Mr. Ban declared .
“ We must resist protectionism and end subsidies that distort markets .
This , ladies and gentlemen , lies at the core of food security .
Our job is not just to feed the hungry , but to empower the hungry to feed themselves . ”
He warned of a chain reaction over the past year that threatens the very foundations of life for millions of people , with rising energy prices driving up food costs and eating away the savings that would otherwise be spent on health care or education .
“ It is a vicious cycle that impoverishes not only its immediate victims but all people , ” he said .
“ Millions of families have been pushed into poverty and hunger .
Suffering on this scale spills over borders .
It sets back development and undercuts social order , as we well know .
Over the past year and a half , food insecurity led to political unrest in some 30 countries . ”
But it is not enough just to deal with the crisis when it arrives , even though the world responded with the greatest - ever food aid , pledging funding and improved policies at various summits , and even worse potential damage was averted .
“ Because the underlying problems persist , we will continue to experience such crises , again and again – unless we act , ” Mr. Ban said .
“ The food crisis of today is a wake - up call for tomorrow . ”
He stressed the inter- relationship between the food and global warming crises , pleading for agreement at next month ’s climate change summit in Copenhagen on curbing greenhouse gas emissions to keep the temperature rise below 2 degrees Celsius .
The melting of Himalayan glaciers would affect the livelihoods and survival of 300 million people in China and up to 1 billion people throughout Asia , while Africa 's small farmers , who produce most of the continent 's food and depend mostly on rain , could see harvests drop by 50 per cent by 2020 , he warned .
“ Today ’s event is critical .
So is the climate change conference in Copenhagen next month .
There can be no food security without climate security , ” Mr. Ban declared .
“ They must produce results – real results for people in real need , results for the one billion people who are hungry today , real results so millions more will not have to suffer when the next shock hits .
“ The world is impatient for us to make a difference .
I , too , am impatient .
And I am committed . ”
UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) Director - General Jacques Diouf said eliminating hunger require $ 44 billion of official development assistance ( ODA ) per year to be invested in infrastructure , technology and modern inputs .
“ It is a small amount if we consider the $ 365 billion of agriculture producer support [ subsidies ] in OECD ( Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development ) countries in 2007 , and if we consider the $ 1,340 billion of military expenditures by the world in the same year , ” he added .
UN World Food Programme ( WFP ) Executive Director Josette Sheeran told a First Ladies ’ summit in Rome yesterday that empowering women , who do much of the agricultural work in the developing world , was vital .
“ Women are the secret weapon to fight hunger , ” she said .
She called on 700 million women who have enough food to contribute 1 euro a week to the 700 million women who are hungry as part of WFP ’s “ Billion for a Billion ” Citizens ’ Action Campaign .
Launching an online version of the campaign ( www.wfp.org/1billion) on Saturday , she said : “ Now you can fill the cup of a hungry child with a simple click of a mouse .
If a billion internet users donate a dollar or a euro a week , we can literally transform the live of a billion hungry people across the world . ”
At a news conference later in the day , Mr. Ban said he remained positive about Copenhagen , citing much convergence in the areas of adaptation , technology and capacity building .
“ I am fighting for a real deal in Copenhagen , a deal that paves the way for a binding global climate treaty , ” he stressed .
Also today , he visited WFP headquarters to pay tribute to the five colleagues recently killed in Pakistan .
He has also held bilateral meetings with a number of leaders , including the Brazilian , Chilean , Egyptian , Italian , Libyan and Tanzanian presidents .
Some experts call the genocide in Darfur the world 's first conflict caused by climate change .
After all , the crisis was sparked , at least in part , by a decline in rainfall over the past 30 years just as the region 's population doubled , pitting wandering pastoralists against settled farmers for newly scarce resources , such as arable land .
" Is Darfur the first climate change war ? " asked economist and Scientific American columnist Jeffrey Sachs at an event at Columbia University in 2007 .
" Do n't doubt for a moment that places like Darfur are ecological disasters first and political disasters second . "
But new research would suggest the answer to Sachs 's question is no , at least regarding the novelty of Darfur .
Agricultural economist Marshall Burke of the University of California , Berkeley and his colleagues have analyzed the history of conflict in sub-Saharan Africa between 1980 and 2002 in a new paper in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
" We find that civil wars were much more likely to happen in warmer - than - average years , with one degree Celsius warmer temperatures in a given year associated with a 50 percent higher likelihood of conflict in that year , " Burke says .
The implication : because average temperatures may warm by at least one degree C by 2030 , " climate change could increase the incidences of African civil war by 55 percent by 2030 , and this could result in about 390,000 additional battle deaths if future wars are as deadly as recent wars . "
In fact , temperature change offered a better prediction of impending conflict in the 40 countries surveyed than even changes in rainfall , despite the fact that agriculture in this region is largely dependent on such precipitation .
Burke and his fellow authors argue that this could be because many staple crops in the region are vulnerable to reduced yields with temperature changes — 10 to 30 percent drops per degree C of warming .
" If temperature rises , crop yields decline and rural incomes fall , and the disadvantaged rural population becomes more likely to take up arms , " Burke says .
" Fighting for something to eat beats starving in their fields . "
Whereas 23 years in 40 countries provides a relatively large data set , it does not exclude other possible explanations , such as violent crime increasing with temperature rise , a drop in farm labor productivity or population growth .
" Fast population growth could create resource shortage problems , as well , " notes geographer David Zhang of the University of Hong Kong , who previously analyzed world history back to A.D. 1400 to find linkages between war and temperature change .
Those results were also published in 2007 in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
But " the driver for this linkage , " Zhang says , " is resource shortage , mainly agricultural production , which is caused by climate change . "
Burke and his colleagues specifically excluded records from prior to 1980 , because of the conflict rampant in the wake of Africa 's emerging colonial independence after World War II .
" A lag of a couple of decades would leave sufficient time for post - independence turmoil to wear out , " Burke argues .
" We took the approach that the best analogue to the next few decades were the last few decades . "
Proving the link — and providing a specific mechanism for the increase in conflict , whether agricultural productivity or otherwise — remains the next challenge .
" I believe that the historical experience of human society of climate change would provide us [ with ] the evidence of how climate cooling and warming during the last thousand years created human crisis , and also the lessons for human adaptive choices for climate change , " Zhang notes .
" We feel that we have very clearly shown the strong link between temperature increases and conflict risk , " Burke adds .
But " what interventions will make climate - induced conflict less likely ? "
The U.S. military , for its part , is concerned about the issue , analyzing the possibility for climate change to destabilize countries in recent reports , such as an essay from members of the CNA Military Advisory Board in November , " Climate and Energy the Dominant Challenges of the 21st Century . "
But , given the recent historical record in places like Darfur , the question about intervention may remain unanswered .
" We need 18 helicopters but no one has provided it and yet we are so concerned about Darfur , " said former United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan at an event at Columbia University in September , noting the stretched resources of the peacekeeping forces in that region .
" No one can tell me we do n't have 18 helicopters .
We have thousands . "
Recently both Russia and China have claimed to be able to use cloud seeding to increase rainfall and snowfall , or change the location of where it falls .
In the past , snow - making experiments have been carried out in North American ski resorts in the past with little evidence of success .
So how have the Russian and Chinese scientists achieved this feat and what evidence is there that it is in fact due to cloud seeding ?
The seeding method used is to add tiny particles of silver iodide to the clouds and there is solid science behind this method .
At temperatures a few degrees below zero degrees centigrade , clouds consist mainly of supercooled water droplets .
These clouds can be quite stable , but silver iodide has an ice - like structure and it will cause a few of these water droplets to freeze .
Once you have ice particles mixed in with the supercooled droplets , these crystals grow rapidly to form snowflakes , causing the cloud to precipitate .
The effect is that the water is released from the cloud .

This form of cloud seeding is not new -
It has been used since the 1960s in the western USA to try to make rain , as well as being used in Israel in the past .
The difficulty is it has always been hard to prove whether the cloud would have rained naturally if it had n’t been seeded .
Even tests where seeding lots of clouds takes place and un-seeded clouds are used as controls have n’t produce statistically significant results .
Therefore , if it works at all it ca n’t be hugely effective .
So although the underlying science behind the technique seems to be sound , what is presently wrong with the technique ?
We at Manchester University have been flying the UK atmospheric research aircraft in clouds that may or may not produce rain or snow , to investigate effective conditions for cloud seeding in different environments .
Last winter , we were flying in low clouds with temperatures just below freezing and we did not manage to seed any of the clouds and they were left entirely natural .
We found that on many occasions these clouds already contained a mixture of supercooled water droplets and ice crystals , and the ice crystals were growing and falling out as snow .
However this was n’t on account of our seeding efforts .
Interestingly , the origin of these ice particles seemed to be due to freezing caused by particles of dust , ash and organic material carried up into the cloud ( some of which can be attributed to pollution ) .
We found that once some ice is formed there is a powerful secondary ice particle production process which occurs at about minus six degrees Celsius .
This produces lots of ice crystals , meaning that even if the clouds had been seeded with silver iodide , it would have had little effect .
Snow was being produced very effectively and quite naturally anyway .
Interestingly , when we flew higher into clouds , well above the ground and away from a lot of the particulate material , we did find clouds at colder temperatures , as cold as - 30C that were made up entirely of supercooled water droplets so maybe seeding these would have had an impact .
So does cloud seeding work ?
Well our studies indicate that in many clouds that produce lots of snow it does not seem to , because there is plently of natural ice already .
However , I do n’t completely dismiss it as a method – I do believe it ’s possible it can be effective in some clouds in the right conditions and at the right temperature .
Nevertheless , I feel some of the stronger claims made recently need further verification , before we herald this as a breakthrough in scientists ’ ability to manipulate natural weather cycles .

NEWS : PROTEST IN CANBERRA
Mon 4th ( see below )
It ’s Day 43 without food , and Peter Spencer grows weaker .
For those who do n’t know , Peter Spencer ’s farm has been stolen from him by our government through Native Vegetation Legislation — which locked up 80 – 90 % of his entire farm but paid him no compensation .
The regrowth on his farm holds “ carbon credits ” of supposed value to the Commonwealth , yet Peter has been obliged by law to pay the rates on that land - that - holds - these - carbon - credits , and the mortgage for the right to do nothing with this land that really belongs to the Commonwealth .
Is this not an extortionate tax ?
Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has declined all requests to meet Peter .
In a grand failure of journalism , our largest dailies apparently think angry tweeting travelers is more important than that a $ 10 billion dollars crime , and a life in the balance .
Peter Spencer tried ingenious means to work within the rules .
But he has been driven into bankruptcy .
The 200 days he spent in court , with all costs associated with just trying to have his case heard , added to the burden .
( 200 days ! )
After there was no other route left open to him he started a hunger strike on the wind - monitoring pole atop his property .
“ A spokesperson for Mr Rudd yesterday said the Government had “ urged ” Mr Spencer to stop the protest .
… the Government believes this matter should be settled through the legal system … ” [ Source Daily Telegraph ]
Listen to this heartbreaking interview of an articulate , dedicated and tenacious man brought down by a failure of the Australian legal system , the failure of the Australian free press , and a failure of successive governments at State and Federal Level and from both sides of the political fence .
If you only have three minutes , listen from 5 minutes to the 8 minute mark .
Audio MP3 of Peter Spencer as he tells his story
If that link does n’t work see the AgMates page for the interview .
http://www.rippleaffect.com.au/dewplayer.swf?mp3=http://agmates.ning.com/group/peterspencerhungerstrike/forum/attachment/download?id=3535428%3AUploadedFi35%3A47901&showtime=1
This poignant interview should leave any citizen chilled to the bone .
We think we are free , we think our elected representatives are there to serve us .
Yet if we are unlucky , we too could be crushed by government ruling , financial ruined , and effectively pecked to death by legislative vultures .
What Peter has been through is appalling .
Government ineptitude or corruption has effectively forced him to be a slave of the Commonwealth with no just rewards for his work .
Peter is now destitute , and his wife is Danish , so she has moved to Denmark so she could work as a pharmacist .
He has hardly seen her in the last three years .
His wife and children have made an emotional return to be with him in this desperate hour .
It is dire .
The Sheriff has warned that they will repossess Peter Spencer ’s farm within the next eight days , evict his supporters from his house , auction off his property and belongings , and sell his family heirlooms .
Thirty years of toil and struggle destroyed .
Peter has said they will have to drag him away .
Here is a top farmer , producing the finest merino wool or high grade trout , and even prepared to set up a wind farm , but has been cut to pieces bit by bit as each legislative change robbed him and his ingenuity of every possible productive use of his property .
Peter tried to set up a wind - farm .
The Howard government changes the rules , making it unworkable ( though Peter has fruitlessly invested some money prior to the changes ) .
The Rudd government bought the renewable energy rules back , but too late for Peter .
The multi-million dollar wind farm development story he speaks of in the interview was described by the ABC .
If the developers buy his property ( as they want to ) they will save millions in royalties that Peter could have earned part of .
How many good farmers have already been pushed over the limit to the point where they used a gun , and were safely bewailed as a so - called victim of “ drought ” ( and “ climate change ” ) ?
If there are farmers out there facing ruin and at the end of your tether , please , curry the strength to tell us your story , do n’t let the fascists win .
I do n’t believe for a moment that the good people of Australia would let this grievously unfair fascist state grow stronger if they knew how bad it was .
There are only a few times in our lives when we need to sit up and pay attention , but this is one of them .
If we let them get away with stealing , with corruption , and with negligence the real fight in 5 or 10 years time will be that much harder and bloodier .
What can you do ?
PROTEST in CANBERRA Monday Jan 4th .
Brief Details of the March .
Arrive at 10.30 at Magna Carta Park , behind Old Parliament House Canberra .
Various speakers will address everyone assembled .
March will go to New Parliament house & then to the Lodge where more speeches / activities will occur .
See http://www.sosnews.org/ for more info .
Contact Alistair McRobert on 02 64545141 if you need to chat about precise details
Plenty of little things make a big difference .
Join the AgMates supporters of Peter Spencer ’s , or write to your elected representative , and send messages to your friends .
Warn them that the media is not giving them the real news .
Write letters to your newspapers .
Shame them for their failure .
Why is n’t Kevin Rudd being embarrassed over his failure to even meet with Peter Spencer ?
There ought be nothing less than an immediate Royal Commission .
The only Australian newspaper which is treating this seriously is The Daily Telegraph , which also did a story a few days ago .
The Advertiser may have run a reprint ?
The Australian only covered it accidentally as a chance to ping Barnaby Joyce .
Readers of The Sydney Morning Herald , The Age , The West Australian , The Mercury and The Courier Mail , would n’t have any idea that this travesty and dire situation is unfolding .
Their readers ought to be angry .
Let ’s shame them into doing their jobs .
My previous story on Peter Spencer , where comments are still running strong .
UPDATE : SHOCK !
PROTEST BUSES MAY HAVE BEEN CANCELED BY RTA ?
Could this be real ?
An unnamed officer from the Roads and Transport Authority ( RTA ) has said that five inspectors were dispatched to the North and the West of the state to target buses headed for Canberra for this protest .
At least two bus drivers have confirmed that their buses were booked to go , but have been cancelled due to the RTA harassment .
Buses can be held for up to six hours in the road side inspection places whilst being assessed for mechanical defects and and driving breaches .
It ’s all “ technically ” legal and profoundly disturbing .

A few weeks later she has me wrapped around her paw and is happy as can be .
Her hobbies include chasing ankles , climbing curtains and jumping in the dryer when my back is turned !
She has a favorite little stuffed mouse that she runs around the house chasing , and I always laugh when she goes over to her food bowl and drops the mouse in so that it will be right next to her when she eats … or maybe she thinks it wants to eat too ? 🙂

Leerlo en castellano .
There are very few means by which the working class can arm itself with a political tool which educates the class and helps it fight the crooks who , disguised as its defenders , betray it , sell it out and make deals over its interests with the bosses .
With this tribune I want to contribute something , so that those workers who come across this information might use it as a starting point for directing a discussion about the trade union bureaucracy , this great enemy of the working class , so that they can organise to combat it .
First of all therefore we have to understand what characterises the trade union bureaucracy .
The trade union bureaucracy does not practice democracy among the workers .
It does not consult the workers affiliated to the union , or those being represented , on its actions , attitudes and decisions , but always reaches deals with the bosses on the backs of the workers .
The union bureaucracy conducts its discussions with the bosses and collective agreements without witnesses in flash restaurants : or for less important problems , in the bosses ’ offices , behind closed doors .
They sign deals and contracts without workers ’ participation .
The trade union bureaucracy terrorises union members .
When workers criticise them they are hounded , threatened and intimidated , and subjected to psychological terrorism : or else they make sure they are put out of work .
The bureaucracy is the enemy of workers ’ assemblies and participation on the part of the workers .
The trade union bureaucracy does not itself organise , nor does it allow the workers to fight , and when it does allow an action on the part of the workers it is because it feels pressured .
When the demands are sufficiently justified and it fears the workers will supersede it , then it acts as a straitjacket .
In other cases when the bureaucracy allows an action on the part of the workers it is simply to exact pressure on the boss so that the latter caves to the bureaucracy ’s own desires .
The bureaucracy always seeks to contain workers ’ struggles , telling the workers not to fight and to maintain an atmosphere of peace and harmony , accepting the norms and conditions imposed by the bosses .
The trade union bureaucracy is demagogic , always offering things to the workers it never delivers on .
It sells out the workers , as it is bought - off and corrupted by the privileges and bribes it receives in return .
They also participate in labour inspectorates .
If your union leaders behave in anyway like this , well , that is bureaucracy for you .
The first task we as workers have is to fight them and kick them out of our unions .
With this statement , we take sides with all workers ready to begin a fight to kick these parasites out of our unions .
Namco Bandai has announced that it will soon be releasing “ Muscle March ” ( another odd game to come out of Japan ) in North America on Wii Ware .
The game has players take control of “ half naked muscular men ” and chase after a thief , who has apparently stolen their bodybuilding friends tub of protein powder ( WTF ? ) , through a number of environments .
The players follow the thief as they crash through walls , leaving holes in the form of bodybuilding poses , which the player must make their character squeeze through by gesturing with the Wii Remote and Nunchuk to match the pose .
At the end of the level , players must shake the controllers to catch up and tackle the thief and that ’s about it .
Players can choose from a number of flamboyant and interesting characters including an American boxer , a British female bodybuilder ( who is definitely a man ) , a top hat wearing Spaniard , a Japanese bodybuilder with swimming goggles and a polar bear in a diaper .
This could be one of the coolest games ever to come out on the Wii Ware , maybe the announcement trailer might clear things up a little –
To mark this week ’s focus on the dismal state of the U.S. job market , check out the following chart , which shows the trajectory of private sector U.S. employment since 1998 .
It tells a story of a lost decade for U.S. workers .
The U.S. now produces fewer private sector jobs than it did a decade ago .
This been the case since August , and it ’s getting worse .
In October , private sector companies employed 130.401 million U.S. workers , a million fewer than in October 1999 , when they employed 109.487 million .
Not since the Labor Department began tracking payroll employment in 1939 has there been such a stretch with no net job gains .
The problem resonates with President Barack Obama , who is holding a jobs summit on Thursday with executives , economists and union leaders , and with the Labor Department getting ready to tee up its November jobs report on Friday .
With the economy recovering from last year ’s shock , private sector firms might start hiring again .
But it likely will take months if not years to make up this gap .
How to explain the gap ?
One obvious answer is that the U.S. has suffered through two recessions during this stretch .
The first , in 2001 , was short and mild but included more than two years of job cuts .
The second one starting in 2007 has been long and brutal .
The other answer is that the U.S. has enjoyed a big burst of productivity growth during this stretch — which means firms are producing more with fewer workers .
In the long - run this is supposed to be a good development because it leads to profit and income gains .
But the short - term costs are looking increasingly more debilitating .
It ’s worth nothing that overall employment is higher than it was a decade ago , but that ’s only because the government has produced two million additional jobs during that stretch .
You can expect both sides of Washington ’s political spectrum to spin the lost decade for jobs in their own direction .
Republicans will use it to blast Mr. Obama ’s big government approach — though it ’s worth remembering that most of these jobs were lost when a Republican controlled the White House .
Democrats will use the data to demonstrate the benefits of a helping government hand in down economic times .
The labor market would indeed be worse if it were n’t for those two million extra government jobs .
But this hardly seems like the path to prosperity .
Correction : In October , private sector companies employed 108.401 million U.S. workers .
An earlier version of this post incorrectly stated the number as 130.401 million .
WASHINGTON — President Obama ’s speech Thursday in Oslo where he accepted the Nobel Peace Prize appears to have placated his political opponents and struck a nerve with his supporters .
He ’s receiving kudos from one of the most unlikely sources : Sarah Palin .
Following an interview with the former vice presidential candidate and fierce Obama critic on Thursday , USA Today reports that Palin “ praised ” him for his speech in Oslo , and “ said the president ’s defense of war to combat evil could have been taken from the pages of her memoirs . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ I liked what he said , ” Palin told USA Today .
“ I talked too in my book about the fallen nature of man and why war is necessary at times . ”
The speech “ sounded really familiar , ” Palin said .
“ Of course , war is the last thing I believe any American wants to engage in , but it ’s necessary .
We have to stop these terrorists . ”
A flurry of conservatives were livid when it was announced that Obama received the Nobel Peace Prize .
But they ’re largely happy with Obama ’s speech at Oslo , as well as his decision to escalate U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan .
Former Republican leader Newt Gingrich said it was “ actually very good , ” adding that Obama “ clearly understood that he had been given the prize prematurely , but he used it as an occasion to remind people , first of all , as he said : that there is evil in the world . ”
“ The irony is that George W. Bush could have delivered the very same speech , ” said Bradley A. Blakeman , Republican strategist and former Bush official .
“ It was a truly an American president ’s message to the world . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
Obama ’s speech and his Afghanistan move have ruffled feathers in the progressive base and defied key Democrats who strongly hold the view that it ’s unnecessary and counterproductive — including Sen .
Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) and Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) .
Many liberals criticized him for touting the virtues of war too heavily , agreeing with conservatives that many of his declarations were reminiscent of those Bush often made .
Palin is winding down her cross-country tour promoting her new book , “ Going Rogue . ”

DOVER — A 47 - year - old man was arrested in the woods last night after fleeing when a Dover Middle School janitor caught him masturbating outside of cheerleader tryouts .
Police responded to the school 6:48 p.m. after receiving the report from the janitor and immediately started searching the woods for Roy A. Chapman Jr. , who had left his vehicle behind at the alleged crime scene .
Capt .
Michael Raiche said Chapman committed the lewd act from a window outside the school 's gymnasium and none of the cheerleaders witnessed it .
" We had numerous officers form a perimeter and got a State Police K9 to respond , " Raiche said .
" The K9 was n't successful but one of our officers located the subject hiding in the woods . "
Following his arrest , Chapman allowed police to search his vehicle where they located a small amount of marijuana .
Chapman , of 52 Longshore Drive in Barrington , was subsequently charged with felony indecent exposure and lewdness , because of a previous conviction , and possession of controlled drug .
Raiche said it 's unknown if this incident was premeditated .
" We do n't know if he knew there was going to be cheerleader practice or if he was just going by and noticed the girls walking in , " Raiche said .
Chapman is being held on $ 2,500 cash bail and is scheduled for arraignment this afternoon at Dover District Court .

" Three Acres And Liberty " by Bolton Hall , 1907 , Macmillan
This original back - to - the - land book is much more than a how - to , also a why - to , and Hall 's reasons are as clearcut today as they were a hundred years ago .
From the Foreword : " We are not tied to a desk or to a bench ; we stay there only because we think we are tied .
In Montana I had a horse , which was hobbled every night to keep him from wandering ; that is , straps joined by a short chain were put around his forefeet , so that he could only hop .
The hobbles were taken off in the morning , but he would still hop until he saw his mate trotting off .
This book is intended to show how any one can trot off if he will . "

The Mantis lightweight tiller is not just a junior - sized toy cultivator , it 's an effective tool that can do things a full - sized cultivator can't do , apart from working in much smaller spaces .
The Mantis weighs 20 pounds ( 9 kg ) .
It was designed 30 years ago for professional landscape gardeners and it's the world 's best - selling tiller , with more than a million sales .
The twisted " serpentine " tines spin at 240 RPM -- twice the speed of ordinary tillers , digging down to 10 " ( 25 cm ) , cutting through hard sod , compact soil or tough weeds , turning it all into finely textured soil ready for planting .
The 9 - inch ( 23 cm ) tilling width makes tilling or cultivating between rows easy .
The Mantis breaks sod and chops it up , incorporates organic matter , mixes in compost or lime , works soil in tight spaces , including raised beds , weeds between rows and among plants .
Switch the tines around and dig just a couple of inches into the soil to weed a large 30 x 40 ft garden ( 9 x 12 metres ) in 20 minutes , chopping in the weeds as you go .
Available in three models : with an electric motor , a 2 - cycle gasoline engine , or a Honda 4 - cycle gasoline engine -- the Honda engine model is more powerful and quieter , it weighs 4 pounds more at 24 pounds ( 10.8 kg ) and it 's more expensive .
The attachments fit all three models : the Planter / Furrower has two special tines that dig deep , 6 " - wide furrows in any soil -- for tomatos , corn , beans , potatoes , asparagus , onions , root crops , also for building raised beds and cutting trenches ; the Plow attachment is propelled forward by the spinning tiller tines , you walk behind -- the hardened steel plow blade forms straight furrows , deep or shallow , much faster than working by hand , banks soil for planting ; also Border Edger , Lawn Dethatcher , Lawn Aerator , Hedge Trimmer Bars , more .

Tresemer delves into subjects such as the Alexander Technique , relaxation and mind - body techniques to explain the relaxed , natural swing that cuts the best -- Zen and the art of the scythe ( though he does n't say so ) .
Interesting recounting of the history of the scythe ( it took about 2,000 years to develop it ) .
Includes sections on scythe maintenance and harvesting and processing small grains .

Google will let its
Gears offline utility essentially languish as it attempts to move the Web forward into HTML 5.0 , Google executives said Monday .
According to Linus Upson , the engineering director at Google , Gears ' time has come and gone .
The technology will be supported for compatibility 's sake , but not improved upon .
" Yes , we are not driving forward in any meaningful way [ on Gears ] , " Upson said in an interview .
" We are continuing to maintain it , so that applications will continue to work ; we do n't want to break anything out there . "
Google Gears was as a tool for allowing Web - based Google applications to work offline , like rivals Microsoft Outlook or Lotus Notes .
But in May of 2008 , Google used its I /O Conference to and capabilities that include the ability to cache apps and databases , and apply canvas , video , and geolocation tags .
A " web worker " tag also allows for the background processing of Javascript , a tool to avoid , in one executive 's words , " hosing " a Web browser by monopolizing its CPU cycles .
HTML 5.0 , in Google 's view , is the future .
One indication of that direction has been the inclusion of the " My Location " feature in Google Maps , which attempts to use geolocation to identify the user 's position .
" We 're very focused on moving HTML 5 forward , and that 's where we 're putting all of our energy , " Upson said .
" When we started the Gears project , three years ago , maybe three and a half years ago now , we did it because we could n't get the browser vendors interested in building offline applications .
And so , so we said , okay , we 'll build a plugin that could do it .
And lo and behold , once we shipped Gears , suddenly the browser vendors got very interested in adding capabilities to build offline applications .
" And so , I think Gears has accomplished its mission very well , in getting these capabilities into HTML 5 , " Upson added .
" In fact , the team that designed Gears was also instrumental in designing the HTML 5 versions of those APIs .
You can almost think of what 's in HTML 5 , with app cache , and database , and those things , as essentially Gears [ version ] 2 , and that 's how we view it . "
Put another way , the goal of HTML 5.0 is to avoid " plug - in prison , " the requirement to call a variety of plug-ins to make various capabilities actually work , according to Jay Sullivan , a Mozilla Foundation vice president , who spoke at Google I /O last year .
Opera Mobile added last year as well , following in March 2008 .
Upson , who runs both the Chrome browser and Chrome OS engineering teams , said he 's readying the Mac version of Chrome for a release by the end of the year , as originally planned .
He did not directly address reports that said Gears would be left out of the Mac version of the Chrome browser , as Apple 's Mac OS X reportedly does not support it .
But he confirmed that that was the direction that Chrome would take .
" We want to move all applications to just use standards based HTML 5 APIs , and not focus on Gears going forward , " Upson added .
" And now that we 're a browser vendor , we can help move HTML 5 forward not as a plug - in , but as part of Chrome . "
" Everybody is in a recession .
Everybody wants a raise .
You just can't stop working , " she said .
" Everybody lost in this game , and they 're trying to win .
That 's what 's so crazy , to go on strike ... it 's just selfish . "
The National Football League on Wednesday announced that it would impose its most stringent rules to date on managing concussions , requiring players who exhibit any significant sign of concussion to be removed from a game or practice and be barred from returning the same day .
The league has maintained , despite widespread criticism , that it was safe to allow players to return to the field as soon as their symptoms were gone  even in the same game in which the injury occurred .
It has not been uncommon for players to return , either after passing a sideline test or by not revealing their symptoms .
The announcement is the latest of several recent changes to how the N.F.L. handles concussions , and comes at a time when some of its most high - profile players are coping with head injuries , including the star quarterbacks Ben Roethlisberger of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Kurt Warner of the Arizona Cardinals .
The new rule was made in the wake of heightened scrutiny of the league ’s approach to head injuries , outlined in a series of articles in The New York Times .
At a Congressional hearing in October , the N.F.L. was criticized for its practices and research methods .
Last week , the co-chairmen of the league ’s committee on concussions resigned under fire , on the same day the league announced that players who sustain concussions could be cleared to return only by independent experts .

L.A. 's California Science Center will start the new year defending itself in court for canceling a documentary film attacking Charles Darwin ’s theory of evolution .
A lawsuit alleges that the state - owned center improperly bowed to pressure from the Smithsonian Institution , as well as e-mailed complaints from USC professors and others .
It contends that the center violated both the 1st Amendment and a contract to rent the museum ’s Imax Theater when it canceled the screening of “ Darwin ’s Dilemma : The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record . ”
The suit was filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the American Freedom Alliance , an L.A. - based group described by senior fellow Avi Davis as a nonprofit , nonpartisan “ think tank and activist network promoting Western values and ideals . ”
The AFA seeks punitive damages and compensation for financial losses , as well as a declaration from the court that the center violated the Constitution and cannot refuse the group the right to rent its facilities for future events .
Advertisement
The AFA had planned an Oct. 25 screening of two films at the Exposition Park museum -- one a short Imax movie called “ We are Born of Stars , ” which favors Darwin ’s theory ; the other , “ Darwin ’s Dilemma : The Mystery of the Cambrian Fossil Record , ” a feature - length documentary that criticizes Darwin and promotes intelligent design .
Intelligent design is the theory that an intelligent being , rather than impersonal forces such as Darwinian natural selection , is responsible for shaping life on Earth .
An overwhelming majority of scientists and science and natural history museums consider the theory of evolution to have been proved beyond a doubt by genetic and fossil evidence .
Critics of intelligent design have dismissed it as a superficially scientific cloak for the straightforwardly religious belief known as Creationism that ’s anchored in a literal reading of the biblical Book of Genesis .
The AFA ’s Davis said his group has no position on Darwinism and intelligent design but is concerned that debate is being stifled by the scientific establishment .
During the fall , the AFA organized a series of public events , including the film screening , geared to the 2009 bicentennial of Charles Darwin ’s birth and the 150th anniversary of his landmark work , “ On the Origin of Species . ”
Advertisement
On Oct. 5 , the science center , one of 165 national affiliates of the Smithsonian that enjoy special access to loans from its massive collection , received an alert -- and a complaint -- from Harold Closter , director of the Smithsonian ’s affiliates program .
Closter gave the science center the head ’s - up about a news release that had been issued not by the AFA but by the Discovery Institute , a Seattle - based think tank that promotes intelligent design and whose researchers are featured in “ Darwin ’s Dilemma . ”
In an e-mail that ’s an exhibit in the lawsuit , he wrote that the news release wrongly implied that the California Science Center is “ a West Coast branch of the Smithsonian , and that the film showing is a Smithsonian event . ”
Closter asked science center officials to correct the error but did not mention canceling the screening .
The Smithsonian has a history with the Discovery Institute :
In an embarrassing episode in 2005 , it approved Discovery ’s rental of an auditorium at the Smithsonian ’s National Museum of Natural History for a screening of a different film promoting intelligent design .
That led to an outcry from the scientific community .
But , having signed a contract , the Smithsonian allowed the screening to go forward , trying to distance itself from the event by returning the $ 16,000 rental fee and emphasizing that the Smithsonian did not endorse the screening .
The California Science Center , in contrast , canceled the AFA ’s screening on Oct. 6 , saying that the AFA had violated its rental agreement .
Science center President Jeffrey Rudolph said in a statement entered in the case file that the news release violated a standard contractual requirement :
All promotional materials for outside users ’ events must be submitted to the museum before they can be made public .
Advertisement
The AFA ’s suit , filed Oct. 14 , contends that the contract issue was a “ false pretext ” and that pressure from the Smithsonian and the academic community was the real reason for canceling the film .
It alleges that Rudolph first met with museum board members , then “ contrived a justification ” -- the unauthorized news release -- for preventing the screening .
The AFA says that it should not have been held responsible for a release that it did n’t issue itself .
The AFA alleges that in failing to be honest and open about its reasons for negating the contract , the science center committed a contract fraud that should now expose it to punitive damages on top of the $ 75,000 or more that Davis says the AFA lost by hastily having to transfer the $ 20 per ticket screening to a smaller space at USC ’s Davidson Conference Center , where the pro-Darwin Imax film could not be shown properly .
Rudolph declined to comment last week , saying in a prepared statement that the screening “ was canceled because of issues related to the contract . ”
The Smithsonian is not a defendant in the suit .
The huge , Washington , D.C. research and museum institution is federally chartered and receives part of its funding from the federal government .
Advertisement
The suit contends , however , that the Smithsonian was part of “ a broad network of Darwin advocates [ that ] . . . jointly conspired ” with the California Science Center to stop its film screening .
A spokeswoman said the Smithsonian had no comment .
The first ruling in the case came Oct. 14 , when Superior Court Judge James C. Chalfant denied the AFA ’s initial request that he order the science center to permit the Oct. 25 screening .
But the suit for damages is moving forward , with a pretrial hearing scheduled Jan. 26 .
In a separate suit filed Dec. 1 , the Discovery Institute alleges that the California Science Center improperly has held back documents and e-mails pertaining to the film ’s cancellation , which it had sought under the California Public Records Act .
“ We want to find out what really happened , ” said John West , the senior fellow in charge of the Discovery Institute ’s Center for Science and Culture .
Government agencies that allow the public to rent their facilities can’t “ pick and choose only the viewpoints they like , ” he added .
Advertisement
Among the 44 pages that the Discovery Institute did get from the science center are e-mails filed as exhibits with its suit : “ I ’m less troubled by the freedom of speech issues than why my tax dollars which support the California ‘ Science ’
Center are being spent on hosting religious propaganda , ” wrote Hilary Schor , a USC professor of English , comparative literature and gender studies .
But another correspondent , Eugenie Scott , executive director of the National Center for Science Education , which champions evolution in clashes over which theory should be taught in public schools , urged “ NOT asking the museum to cancel the showing of the movie .
Really -- the story that ‘ big science is trying to squelch controversy . . . ' is going to be a bigger story and draw more attention to the movie ’s showing than the showing itself . ”
“ Darwin ’s Dilemma ” was screened in September at the University of Oklahoma ’s Sam Noble Oklahoma Museum of Natural History -- sponsored not by the museum but by a student organization that rented its auditorium .
West , the Discovery Institute official , noted approvingly that officials of the Oklahoma museum “ came under a lot of pressure ” from Darwinists opposed to the screening , “ but their response was to do more free speech , and open the museum for a counter - lecture ” opposing intelligent design .

The northwards spread of human Rhodesian sleeping sickness in Uganda is likely due to the movement of infected livestock , according to new findings from an interdisciplinary research group including members from the Centre for Infectious Diseases , University of Edinburgh ; the Ministry of Health , Uganda ; and the Universities of Oxford and Southampton .
The current study , published December 15 in the open- access journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases , provides evidence that the spatial distribution of the disease in a recently affected area is constrained by the location of livestock markets , indicating the role of cattle ( the predominant reservoir of disease ) in its spread .
A complex interaction of environmental and climatic factors was also found to affect distribution of the disease .
Human African trypanosomiasis ( HAT , or sleeping sickness ) is a fatal disease transmitted by the tsetse fly in sub-Saharan Africa .
Endemic in some regions , it spreads across 36 countries .
It is estimated that around 60,000 people are currently infected .
There are two forms of the disease ( an acute " Rhodesian " form , which the research focuses on , and a chronic " Gambian " form ) , but fears are growing that they may overlap in Uganda , which could render current diagnosis and treatment protocols ineffective .
Previous work implicated livestock movements in the spread of this disease .
Regulations were therefore reinforced that required the treatment of all cattle from endemic areas prior to sale at livestock markets .
The primary aim of the new research was to investigate potential reasons for this subsequent spread of the disease .
The researchers conducted both a one - step logistic regression analysis of HAT prevalence and a two - step logistic regression method , which enabled separate analysis of both occurrence and prevalence of the disease .
Both the occurrence and prevalence were negatively correlated with distance to the closest livestock market in all models .
To prevent the overlap of the two disease forms , a large - scale intervention , Stamp Out Sleeping Sickness ( stampoutsleepingsickness.org ) , has been applied .
This public - private partnership has treated over 250,000 animals to clean the disease from the overlap zone .
However , continued movements of untreated animals into the cleaned zones present an ongoing risk .
The authors conclude that " the stringent implementation of regulations requiring the treatment of cattle prior to sale at livestock markets should be a priority for the Ugandan Government . "
Future research by the group will aim to extend this study by assessing the risk of further Rhodesian HAT spread and the potential for overlap with the Gambian form of the disease .
Puzzling Over Exact Cover Problems Posted December 2009 .
This article will describe how to represent Kanoodle as an " exact cover problem " and how Donald Knuth implemented an algorithm to find solutions to exact cover problems .
We 'll also see how to solve Sudoku puzzles using these ideas ....

Mail to a friend Print this article Introduction
For a birthday gift , one of my children recently received a puzzle called Kanoodle that provides 12 distinctly shaped pieces : and asks the player to assemble them into a 5 by 11 rectangular grid .
Without assistance , the puzzle is extremely difficult so a booklet includes many starting configurations from which to begin .
After solving the puzzle a few times , I wondered if there was an algorithmic way for finding solutions and soon discovered that there was indeed a very interesting one .
This article will describe how to represent Kanoodle as an " exact cover problem " and how Donald Knuth implemented an algorithm to find solutions to exact cover problems .
We 'll also see how to solve Sudoku puzzles using these ideas .
First , we will describe a generic version of the exact cover problem .
Suppose we have a set S and a collection of subsets A 1 , A 2 , ... , A n .
We ask to find a subcollection of our subsets such that each element of S is in exactly one of the subsets .
Imagine we have the set S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5} and subsets A 1 = { 1 , 5} A 2 = { 2 , 4} A 3 = { 2 , 3} A 4 = { 3 } A 5 = { 1 , 4 , 5} Notice that the subsets A 3 = { 2 , 3} and A 5 = { 1 , 4 , 5} form a solution to the exact cover problem : each element of S appears in exactly one of the sets .
In the general situation , if we have a subcollection of the sets A 1 , A 2 , ... , A n , it is relatively easy to determine whether it is a solution .
However , it is much more difficult to find solutions .
One strategy , admittedly naive , is to consider all possible subcollections of the n sets and test each as a possible solution .
The problem is that there are 2n subcollections .
As we will see , the exact cover problem for Kanoodle will require us to examine a set S with 67 elements and a collection of 2222 of its subsets .
The number of subcollections of the sets is the impossibly large number 22222 = 7738385577878121270921913291177363957675 8053520443691507267467554511666433390225 6211182137926950211751902449516673226756 4728397797839387711580213688822763568480 7079420935807010204344332535213654505000 0110534739684220468927252571854522863758 5111967234385629106091901532146690670721 0178962154217210542515113476510755470378
0036162346002513302884046411618787327146 5491686973010799180477725197727867593234 5632338616017848339510720332157704828285 1869205647641463310698242417312882919566 5264713264067983600100179414810240875191 9075087446624702169205467746275821767903 1488509940948129354330970633083278012074 1650380339400461458446294783311131757068 58291419937603163400966242304
Notice that , in this naive approach , the amount of work required grows exponentially with the number of subsets n .
In fact , there is no known algorithm for finding all solutions to any exact cover problem that finishes in an amount of time bounded by a power of n .
Practically speaking , this means there is no feasible algorithm for solving the exact cover problem in general .
In fact , the exact cover problem is one of the NP - complete problems , a collection of problems of great interest in the theory of computation .
While there is no known algorithm that is guaranteed to find solutions to the general problem in a reasonable amount of time , we will describe an algorithm to find solutions and accept that it may not be able to produce results in our lifetimes .
Finding solutions to the exact cover problem
Let 's now look at an algorithm , called " Algorithm X " by Knuth , for finding solutions to the exact cover problem .
It 's not particularly sophisticated ; indeed Knuth refers to it as " a statement of the obvious trial - and - error approach . "
Let 's consider our example again , with slightly different notation .
Imagine our set S is the set S = { 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5} and that we have subsets A = { 1 , 5} B = { 2 , 4} C = { 2 , 3} D = { 3 } E = { 1 , 4 , 5} We will visualize this situation using a matrix , a rectangular array in which each column corresponds to an element of S and each row is one of our subsets .
A dot in a particular cell in the matrix means that the subset corresponding to that row contains the element of S corresponding to that column .
Let 's consider one of the elements of S , say , the element 1 .
It is contained in two subsets , A and E .
Therefore , any solution to the exact cover problem must contain one , but not both , of these subsets .
We will consider each of these two possibilities in turn .
Here is the basic step in the algorithm .
Let 's begin by looking for solutions containing the subset A. Since A contains the elements 1 and 5 , any other subset containing these two elements cannot be part of a solution .
So we travel down the columns corresponding to elements 1 and 5 and eliminate any row corresponding to a subset containing 1 or 5 .
In this case , we eliminate subset E . After removing these rows and columns , we are left with this simpler configuration for which we seek a solution to the exact cover problem .
We now start the algorithm again from this configuration .
If we ever come to a matrix with no columns , then every element of S has been placed into a unique subset .
In other words , we have found a solution .
If we ever come to a matrix containing a column with no entries , then that element cannot be placed into a subset and we will not be able to find a solution with the choices that we have made so far .
Remember that we began by attempting to place the element 1 in a subset and we initially chose subset A . We also need to consider , in the same way , placing 1 into subset E and looking for solutions .
In other words , from the initial configuration , we have two possible routes we must search for solutions .
We will represent this with a search tree , as shown below .
Each node in the tree corresponds to a particular configuration of elements and subsets .
Each edge is labeled by the subset chosen to be part of the solution we seek .
Algorithm X , written more carefully , looks like :
If the matrix has no columns , we 've found a solution .
Stop the algorithm .
If a column has no entries , there is no solution .
Stop the algorithm .
Choose a column c. Consider each row r with an entry in c .
Include r as part of a possible solution .
Consider each column c' that has an entry in row r. Remove column c'. Remove each row with an entry in c' .
Apply the algorithm to the new matrix .
We have some choice in how we implement the third step in which we choose a column c .
In the example above , we have simply chosen the leftmost column at each step .
However , the search tree will typically have a smaller number of nodes , which means our algorithm will finish more quickly , if we choose the column c that has the smallest number of entries .
While the algorithm , as written above , shows that we need to remove rows and columns from our matrix , we will also need to reinsert them later .
For instance , in the example we stepped through above , we initially sought to place element 1 in the subset A , and this caused us to delete rows and columns from the matrix .
However , we must also go back to consider placing 1 in the subset E .
To do this , we need to restore the matrix to its original configuration , which requires us to reinsert the rows and columns we initially removed .
All told , we need to be able to perform a rather small set of operations .
We need to be able to list all the entries in a row or column , and we need to be able to remove and reinsert rows and columns .
This observation leads to Knuth 's clever implementation , which he calls Dancing Links .
Implementing Algorithm X with Dancing Links
To implement Algorithm X , we will need to be able to remove rows and columns from our matrix , and we will need to be able to put them back in .
In addition , we will be working with matrices having a large number of rows and columns and relatively few entries in each row .
For instance , when we look for solutions to the Kanoodle problem , our matrix will have 2222 rows and 67 columns .
Each row will have no more than 6 entries in it .
We could store this information , in the usual way , as a matrix containing 0's and 1's to indicate an element 's membership in a particular set .
However , Knuth describes a linked list structure that makes the removal of rows and columns , and their reinsertion , straightforward and requires less storage than simply storing the entire matrix .
We 'll begin by describing a doubly - linked list , which is an ordered list of items together with a link from each item to its predecessor and successor .
Notice that the list is circularly linked though our figures may not always indicate the links between the left and right elements .
For each element a in the list , L[a ] will denote it predecessor , the element to the left of a , and R[ a ] will denote its successor to the right .
Notice that it is easy to remove an element from the list .
For instance , if we want to remove element a , we simply reroute the links from a's predecessor and successor .
That is , we reroute the links coming in to a .
We do this by setting : R[ L[a ] ] = R[a ]
L[ R[a ] ] = L[a ]
Notice that there 's no need to change the links out of a .
In fact , this makes it very simple to reinsert a .
Simply set R[ L[a ] ] = a
L[ R[a ] ] = a Now to implement Algorithm X , we store the columns of the matrix in a doubly - linked list .
Remember that individual columns will disappear and reappear as we implement Algorithm X .
We will therefore include a special element , which we 'll call the root , at the beginning of the list so we 'll have some consistent way to refer to the list of columns .
Each column will itself form a doubly - linked list consisting of all the entries in the rows of the matrix .
Furthermore , each row will be represented in a doubly - linked list as well .
The result for the matrix of our example is shown below .
( As before , this figure does not show the links between the elements at the top and bottom or between the left and right . )
This is an ideal setup for implementing Algorithm X . Each element of the matrix is contained in two doubly - linked lists : one for the row and one for the column .
An entire row may be removed by removing each element in the row from its column 's list .
Columns may be removed by removing the column header from the list of columns .
Rows and columns are reinserted by adding them back into the appropriate doubly - linked list .
As the algorithm progresses , the links are continually being modified in a way that led Knuth to call this implementation " Dancing Links . "
Viewing Kanoodle as an exact cover problem
We can apply Algorithm X to find solutions to the Kanoodle puzzle once we understand how to view the puzzle as an exact cover problem .
Remember that we have the following pieces .
and an empty grid of 5 rows and 11 columns .
A solution is found when : Every piece is used exactly once .
Every square in the grid is covered exactly once .
A solution will be determined by a placement of each piece on the board .
We will therefore have one row in our matrix for each possible placement of each of the pieces , which leads to 2222 rows .
There will be 67 columns : one for each of the Kanoodle pieces and one for each cell in the 5 by 11 grid .
A particular placement of a particular piece has an entry in the columns corresponding to the piece and the cells in the grid in which the piece lies .
For instance , this placement gives a row with five entries in the columns labeled by A , [ 4 , 3 ] , [ 5,3 ] , [ 5,4 ] , and [ 5,5 ] .
( The cell [r , c ] is in row r and column c. )
The search tree for Kanoodle is huge and there are many solutions .
To help the algorithm run faster , I used the symmetry of the board to restrict the possible placements of the piece L. For instance , once we find a solution , we may reflect the board vertically , reflect horizontally , or rotate by a half - turn to obtain another solution .
In this way , I assumed that the center of piece L is always in one of the following shaded positions , and I considered each of the possible placements of L separately .
I ran my version of Dancing Links for several hours in a few of these cases and generated many thousands of solutions , a few of which are shown below .
However , my poor laptop would need more time if it were to find all of the solutions .
Since I had satisfied my initial urge to find an algorithmic means for generating solutions , and since I was interested in studying the search tree that Dancing Links traversed , I turned my attention to Sudoku puzzles .
Sudoku is also an exact cover problem
Many readers will be familiar with Sudoku puzzles , like the one shown here .
There is a nine by nine grid of cells with nine boxes consisting of three by three grids .
Initially , some of the cells contain one of nine possible symbols , usually chosen to be integers in the range 1 to 9 .
A solution is found when Every cell contains exactly one of the symbols .
Every column has exactly one occurrence of each symbol .
Every row has exactly one occurrence of each symbol .
Every three by three box has exactly one occurrence of each symbol .
For instance , the solution ( there is only one ) to the puzzle above is With the rules explained as above , we will set up an exact cover problem in which a row of our matrix corresponds to a possible way of filling a cell with a symbol .
There will be 324 columns :
The first 81 are labeled by the 81 different cells and will be used to indicate that a symbol has been placed in a particular cell .
The next 81 are labeled by the nine rows and nine possible symbols .
An entry in the column R = 3 , S = 7 means that the third row contains the symbol 7 .
= 3 , = 7 means that the third row contains the symbol 7 .
The next 81 are labeled by the nine columns and nine possible symbols .
The final 81 are labeled by the nine boxes and nine possible symbols .
For instance , placing the symbol 5 in the first row and first column of the puzzle leads to a row in the matrix with four entries in the columns corresponding to ( a ) the cell in the first row and first column , ( b ) a 5 being placed in row 1 , ( c ) a 5 being placed in column 1 , and ( d ) a 5 being placed in the upper - left box .
The matrix is initially set up with one row for each cell whose symbol is given and nine rows for each of the other cells corresponding to the nine different symbols that may be placed in that cell .
The puzzle above produces a matrix with 457 rows and 324 columns .
The complexity of the search tree that results from applying Algorithm X reflects how difficult the puzzle is .
For instance , the puzzle above is labeled as " Easy , " and the search tree in this case is the simplest possible : there is no branching .
In other words , once we fill in the symbols given by the puzzle , there is , at every step , a cell whose symbol is uniquely determined .
Algorithm X determines this rather quickly : we simply look for columns with a single entry .
By contrast , the following puzzle is labeled as " Evil . "
Algorithm X completes the middle row before coming to a branching point : the cell shaded red may be filled in with either a 4 or 5 .
If we put a 5 in that cell , the entries in 19 more cells are determined before we come to a dead end ( it is impossible to place the symbol 9 in the seventh row ) :
However , putting a 4 in the red cell leads to a solution with no more branching :
The search tree for this puzzle looks like : Evil , of course , wears many faces .
The following puzzle has a search tree that is shown below and drawn without intermediate nodes to emphasize the branching at levels 30 , 31 , and 32 .

World News Print This U.S. : Release of secret reports delayed By Bryan Bender The Boston Globe
The missed deadline spells trouble for the White House ’s promises to introduce an era of government openness , say advocates , who believe that releasing historical information enforces a key check on government behavior .
They cite as an example the abuses by the Central Intelligence Agency during the Cold War , including domestic spying and assassinations of foreign officials , that were publicly outlined in a set of agency documents known as the “ family jewels . ’’
The documents in question - all more than 25 years old - were scheduled to be declassified on Dec. 31 under an order originally signed by President Bill Clinton and amended by President George W. Bush .
But now Obama finds himself in the awkward position of extending the secrecy , despite his repeated pledges of greater transparency , because his administration has been unable to prod spy agencies into conformance .
Some of the agencies have thrown up roadblocks to disclosure , engaged in turf battles over how documents should be evaluated , and have reviewed only a fraction of the material to determine whether releasing them would jeopardize national security .
In the face of these complications , the White House has given the agencies a commitment that they will get an extension beyond Dec. 31 of an undetermined length - possibly years , said the administration officials , who spoke on the condition they not be identified discussing internal deliberations .
It will be the third such extension : Clinton granted one in 2000 and Bush granted one in 2003 .
The documents , dating from World War II to the early 1980s , cover the gamut of foreign relations , intelligence activities , and military operations - with the exception of nuclear weapons data , which remain protected by Congress .
Limited to information generated by more than one agency , the records in question are held by the Central Intelligence Agency ; the National Security Agency ; the departments of Justice , State , Defense , and Energy ; and other security and intelligence agencies .
None of the agencies involved responded to requests for comment , saying they could not discuss internal deliberations .
“ They never want to give up their authority , ’’ said Meredith Fuchs , general counsel at the National Security Archive , a research center at George Washington University that collects and publishes declassified information .
“ The national security bureaucracy is deeply entrenched and is not willing to give up some of the protections they feel they need for their documents . ’’
The failure to meet the disclosure deadline “ does not augur well for new , more ambitious efforts to advance classification reform , ’’ said Steven Aftergood , a specialist on government secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists in Washington .
“ If binding deadlines can be extended more or less at will , then any new declassification requirements will be similarly subject to doubt or defiance . ’’
Obama laid out broad goals for reforming the system in May , when he ordered a 90 - day review by the National Security Council .
Government , he said , “ must be as transparent as possible and must not withhold information for self - serving reasons or simply to avoid embarrassment . ’’

The review is part of Obama ’s efforts to make all government operations more public , including his decision to release White House visitor logs and set up a new office to expedite the release of government files under the Freedom of Information Act .
Among the revisions Obama said he wanted considered were the establishment of a National Declassification Center to coordinate and speed up the process , as well as new procedures to prevent what he called “ over classification . ’’
But officials said an executive order that has been drafted by the White House to replace a disclosure order that Bush signed in 2003 is meeting resistance from key national security and intelligence officials , delaying its approval .
“ The next phase is most crucial , ’’ said William J. Bosanko , director of the Information Security Oversight Office at the National Archives and Records Administration , who was appointed by Obama in April 2008 to oversee the government classification system .
“ It is a bit of a test .
You have an administration that has committed to certain things and tried to shape the direction but then you have the bureaucracy which is very adept at resisting change . ’’
A key concern among intelligence agencies is that they could lose what amounts to veto power over disclosure of their secrets that are maintained by other agencies , according to several officials who have been privy to the agency comments on the draft executive order .
Also , a turf war has broken out over which spy agency should be represented on a panel set up in 1996 to hear appeals from people who are seeking the release of information .
Obama aides want the Office of the Director of National Intelligence , set up in 2005 to oversee all spy agencies , to replace the CIA , much to the consternation of CIA officials , the officials said .
The White House is meeting even more resistance on its position that no information shall remain classified indefinitely .
Depending on the type of information involved , the White House is proposing that virtually all classified information - not just some categories - be automatically released 25 years , 50 years , or in the case of records that involve intelligence sources , 75 years after they are created .
The draft Obama guidelines , a copy of which were obtained by Aftergood , include an additional five - year extension for the most sensitive documents .
Defense and intelligence information undergoes a more rigorous review before being made public - often decades after it is generated - than more general government files that do not require officials to have special security clearances to handle them .
The documents in question are considered part of the nation ’s permanent record , and therefore hold special historical significance .
Only three percent of government records are so designated .
As the delays mount , so does the backlog of classified data to be reviewed .
Aftergood and others worry that if automatic deadlines are not enforced , many documents will never reach the public because the agencies who have custody of them can continue to make the same arguments .
“ The only way to get a handle on this is to allow classification to expire at some point , ’’ said Aftergood .
“ This is information that is not just from years ago , but generations ago .
The new delay is discouraging because the innovations in the Clinton order are being subverted .
That means even bolder reforms that some of us hope for will be that much more difficult . ’’
Still , even if such information is eventually declassified , that does n’t mean that the public will get to see it in a timely manner .
Officials estimate that there are 400 million pages of historical documents that have been declassified but remain in government records centers and have not been processed at the National Archives , where the public can view them .

President Obama will maintain a lid of secrecy on millions of pages of military and intelligence documents that were scheduled to be declassified by the end of the year , according to administration officials .

The songs are varied , offensive and , in at least one case , openly racist .
" If you jump up and down , Balotelli dies " is a favourite with supporters of arguably the most famous Italian football club , Juventus .
" A negro cannot be Italian " is the chant that explains the vitriol .
The target of the abuse is 19 - year - old Mario Balotelli , a footballer with Italian champions Inter Milan and a rising star of Italy 's Under - 21 national team .
In England , Germany or France , Balotelli would be making headlines in the sports pages as one of the most exciting young prospects in the national sport .
In Italy , his treatment at the hands of a minority of hostile football fans is turning him into a symbol of the country 's seeming inability to embrace a multi-ethnic identity .
Last Monday , Juventus were fined for anti-Balotelli chanting at a match for the second time this season .
Balotelli was born – and immediately abandoned by his Ghanaian parents – in the Sicilian capital , Palermo .
He is an Italian passport holder and was brought up by adopted parents in Brescia from the age of two .
He speaks with the accent of his region , but has received far more racist abuse than other black stars in Italian football because his Italian identity is seen by some as a provocation .
" The difference [ from other black players ] is Balotelli is totally black and totally Italian , and that has provoked a short circuit among fans , " said Sandro Modeo , a correspondent for Corriere della Sera .
As Italy 's immigrant total reaches 7 % , the treatment of many of the " Balotelli generation " – the half - million children of immigrants born in Italy who qualify by law for Italian citizenship on their 18th birthday – is becoming an increasingly controversial issue in a country which still , overwhelmingly , considers itself white .
Yesterday , a black Italian writer , Pap Khouma , wrote an open letter to La Repubblica , headlined " Being a black Italian : my life as an obstacle course " .
In it , he described incidents of routine discrimination : regular requests to provide his permit to stay in Italy ; being mistaken for a street - seller by his Milanese neighbours .
On one occasion , running through Milan 's streets late for work , Khouma was stopped by a policeman , asked for his papers and escorted to the local station as a non-EU " foreigner " .
" Have you any idea , " Khouma asked the paper 's readers , " what it means to be Italian and black in Italy in 2009 ? "
For Gian Antonio Stella , a columnist for Corriere della Sera , the racism is evident and ignoring it a national pastime .
" Britain has reflected on its colonial past , Germany has done the same with Nazism , but Italians still believe the myth of the Good Italian , soft colonialism and insist the racial laws of the 1930s were passed by fascists , not Italians , " he said .
Despite the difficulties , the Balotelli generation is beginning to make its presence felt .
The Italian under - 14 cricket team is largely made up of Asian - Italians and won a European tournament this summer .
Lihao Zhang , an 11 - year - old girl of Chinese extraction , living in Voghera , the Lombardy heartland of the xenophobic Northern League party , received glowing press reviews after winning a school competition this year for poetry written in local dialect .
" The offspring of immigrants are easing into Italian culture , meaning Italian traditions are not going to be lost , " said Alessandro Campi , a professor of political science at the University of Perugia .
" If anything , these children will have more problems with their own families ' cultures than with their friends ' . "
As for Balotelli , a one - match ban for Juventus fans from their home stadium , follow - up fines of over € 20,000 ( £ 18,000 ) for the club and questions in parliament have failed to stop the chants , which are not limited to Turin , where the club is based .
The coach of Ghana 's national team , Milovan Rajevac , has publicly invited him to play for the country in next summer 's World Cup .
And the beginnings of a backlash against the abuse may be beginning .
Some commentators are now calling for the 6ft 2in striker to be selected immediately for the Italian team .
" I am sorry for Balotelli , he should be left alone to play football , but right now he is symbol of a cultural shift in Italy and a yardstick for whether we can make that change , " said Stella , the Corriere della Sera columnist .
Growing up in rich , industrial Brescia , the player became used to racial abuse during school matches , with parents pointing to his height and claiming " with these Africans you can never tell what age they really are " .
" Mario always needed love and affection , " his adoptive sister Cristina told the French newspaper L'Equipe .
" He would n't go to sleep without his mother holding his hand . "
On the pitch as a professional , he has sometimes been unable to ignore the hostility from the stands .
Faced with Roma fans who reportedly threw bananas at him in a bar , he stuck his tongue out at an opposition defender after scoring against them .
For that , claimed the Roma captain Francesco Totti , he " deserved a slap " .
" It 's a shame that everyone is more upset with me than with the people yelling at me , " replied Balotelli .
If Balotelli is indeed picked by Italian national coach Marcello Lippi to play in the World Cup next summer , the selection may signal a new era for black Italians .
And as more and more of their white compatriots realise that the country 's ethnic make - up is changing , support is at least beginning to emerge across the political spectrum .
" Balotelli is stubborn , combative and can be a bit of a bully , but at the same time he is generous , brave and irreverent , " said Fare Futuro , a think - tank run by the prominent centre right politician Gianfranco Fini .
" He is pure talent .
Genius and lack of restraint all in one .
What else could be more Italian than that ? "

The excuses coming from the mouths of Reds will actually have some foundation after today ’s Liverpool versus Sunderland match against , in which a balloon helped Darren Bent to score an unlikely , and freakish goal .
Poor Pepe Reina looked like he ’d just had his Porsche Cayenne stolen as the ball deflected off a balloon on the pitch and hit the back of the net in the first half of the game at the Stadium of Light .
The ball appeared to be heading straight for Reina before hitting the balloon , which has apparently thrown onto the pitch by a Liverpool fan .
Red Dwarf creator Rob Grant delivered the most amusing remark with his observation on Twitter that Man City have put in a £ 40 m bid for the balloon .
The talks between the G5 plus 1 and Iran are careening toward a premature breakdown .
If they do fall apart , it will be due in large part to a serious diplomatic miscalculation by the Obama administration .
Along with and its European allies , the Obama seized on a plan that cleverly asked Iran to divest itself of the bulk of its stock of low - enriched uranium ( LEU ) .
It seemed to represent a golden opportunity to set back Iran ’s nuclear program , and despite the warning signs that such an objective is not achievable by the West , it lured the West away from a serious effort to find a diplomatic compromise with Iran aimed at defusing the decades - long hostility between Washington and Tehran .
The origins of the immediate diplomatic drama surrounding the proposal lay in Iran ’s need to supply fuel for its U.S. - built Tehran research reactor producing medical radioisotopes .
Iran had obtained 23 kilograms of fuel enriched to 20 percent from Argentina under a cooperation agreement signed in 1988 that ended in 1993 .
But that supply is expected to run out in late 2010 , and Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki sent a letter to the IAEA in June requesting its help in purchasing enough 20 percent enriched uranium under the Agency ’s supervision so that medical reactor would again have a long - term supply .
But that would require a relaxation of the international sanctions against Iran ’s nuclear program .
And when the Obama administration got wind of the Iranian request , it created a new diplomatic strategy aimed at forcing Iran to accept terms that would give up most of its LEU for about a year .
During a visit to Moscow in July , President Barack Obama ’s White House adviser on the Iranian nuclear issue , Gary Samore , reportedly approached Russian officials about a proposal that would require that Iran send its low enrich uranium to Russia to be converted into the more highly enriched fuel rods , thus setting the clock of Iran ’s already achieved breakout capability back for about a year .
That proposal was in line with the diplomatic objective that Samore had brought to the White House in January 2009 .
In a paper co-authored with Bruce Reidel of the Brookings Institution and published in December 2008 , Samore had suggested that Iran ’s LEU should be exported to Russia to be converted into fuel rods for the Bushehr reactor in order take away Iran ’s nuclear break - out capability .
Then just one week after Iran had agreed to participate in talks with the Group of 5 plus 1 , Tehran informed the IAEA that it was constructing a second uranium enrichment facility near Qom .
The United States , Britain and France denounced the existence of the facility as a nuclear " deception " , and U.S. officials insisted Iran had only revealed the facility because it had been discovered by Western intelligence .
The circumstantial evidence , however , suggests that the facility had indeed been started as part of a back - up in the event of a bombing attack on the primary enrichment plant at Natanz and had been made public to neutralize the implicit threat of an Israeli attack which Iranian strategists believed U.S. hoped to use for diplomatic leverage in the talks .
That was not an entirely unrealistic assumption .
Samore had advocated repeatedly before joining the administration the exploitation by U.S. negotiators of the possibility of an Israeli attack .
And in July , Vice - President Joe Biden had ostentatiously flashed an apparent green light for an Israeli strike against Iranian nuclear facilities should it deem it necessary .
Iran ’s declaration of the Qom site provided yet another rationale for the Obama administration to adopt a tough and aggressive approach to Iran in the meetings starting October 1 .
The result was a proposal from the G5 Plus 1 that Iran would ship 80 percent of its low enriched uranium to Russia , which would then go to France for transformation into fuel rods for the Tehran reactor .
The real point from the U.S. viewpoint was that Iran would divest itself immediately of the bulk of percent of its LEU , allowing the United States to claim a diplomatic victory .
It would take nine to twelve months for Iran to build up enough LEU to have a break - out threat once again .
U.S. officials suggested that the proposal would buy time for the two sides to reach a broader agreement free of the possibility of an Iranian bomb .
But the logic of that rationale was faulty .
The idea that the Obama administration , having portrayed Iran as bent on acquiring nuclear weapons , and its possession of enough LEU to give it a breakout capability as unacceptable , would turn around a few months later and offer a deal that would allows Iran to accumulate more LEU in the future is hardly credible .
Iranian negotiators did not reject the Western proposal presented at the October 1 meeting .
They were under orders to be cooperative , with the obvious aim of depriving the west of a rationale for breaking off the talks and proceeding with new economic sanctions against Iran .
But Assistant Secretary of State William Burns , the senior U.S. representative at the meeting in Geneva told reporters on background that the Secretary of Iran ’s Supreme National Security Council Saeed Jalili , had agreed that Iran would send 1,200 kilograms of its 1,500 kilograms of LEU in exchange to be exchanged for uranium enriched to 19.75 per cent , as Reuters reported .
A senior Iranian official told Reuters on October 16 , however , that Iranian negotiators had not agreed to any Western plan , implying that they had been willing to discuss a deal involving those elements , but had not agreed to any detailed arrangements .
The same official made it clear that Iranian negotiators would have no authority to reach agreement on anything at the second round of talks scheduled for October 19 - 21 in Vienna .
The second round of talks revolved around a draft agreement by the outgoing Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei specifying the amount of Iranian LEU to be shipped to Russia and of 20 percent enriched uranium to be returned to Iran .
A French diplomat told the Washington Post that it was " not that far " from what the West ’s ideal solution .
On October 21 , the final day of the three - day meeting in Vienna , news media again reported that Iranian negotiators had agreed to the ElBaradei plan .
Iran ’s IAEA representative Ali Asghar Soltanieh suggested the draft was " on the right track " but that , " We have to thoroughly study this text . "
ElBaradei himself made it clear there had been no agreement on the text , giving Iran two days for its response to it .
In Tehran , however , public and private discussions of how to respond to the draft took four or five days .
Former nuclear negotiator , Ali Larijani , now the speaker of the parliament , and Alaeddin Boroujerdi , head of the parliamentary committee on National Security and Foreign Affairs , both insisted that Iran should be buying the higher - enriched uranium rather than having to trade its LEU stocks for it .
Iran ’s LEU as Bargaining Chips
But there was a more fundamental , objection to the ElBaradei proposal .
According to the reformist website Kaleme , Mir Hossein Mousavi , Ahmadinejad ’s electoral rival and the leader of the post-election opposition movement , said that , if the conditions demanded by the ElBaradei plan were carried out , " all the efforts of thousands of scientists will go to the wind . "
Conservative parliamentarian Hesmatollah Falahatpisheh said any deal with the West involving the export of Iran ’s LEU stocks should be conditioned on ending the economic sanctions on Iran , particularly a lifting of sanctions on raw uranium imports . "
And Mohsen Rezai , the conservative secretary of the Expediency Council , said that Iran should retain 1,100 kilograms of the roughly 1,500 kilograms of LEU in its stockpile rather than sending 1,200 kilograms abroad , as called for in the ElBaradei plan .
Those objections to the plan all reflected recognition that the ElBaradei draft would deprive Iran of the bargaining leverage they have so painfully accumulated in the form of its LEU stocks .
Senior Iranian national security officials had acknowledged in informal conversations that their main purpose in accumulating low enriched uranium was to compel the United States to sit down and bargain seriously with Iran .
They had observed that , in the past , before the enrichment program began , the United States exhibited no interest in negotiations .
From that strategic perspective , Iran is now in a position to negotiate with the United States in a way that it was not under Rafsanjani and Khatami , thanks to its LEU stocks .
The remarks of Larijani and Boroujerdi about the deal have been widely misinterpreted as evidence of a deep split in the Iranian political elite on how to respond to the ElBaradei plan .
The New York Times published two articles in the same week suggesting that the Obama had achieved a major political objective in bringing to light deep fissures in the Iranian leadership over the issue .
But that analysis was based on the assumption that the president had already embraced the western proposal , whereas he had carefully guarded his political - diplomatic flexibility on the issue .
In fact , there is reason to believe that , behind the scenes , a new consensus was being forged between the government and opposition critics of the ElBaradei plan .
Mousavi ’s denunciation of the western plan came on October 29 – the same day Iran ’s counterproposal was described in the state media .
And when Boroujerdi , the parliamentary committee chairman , called on October 26 for a plan to send Iran ’s LEU to Russia in several phases and to demand " necessary guarantees " against being tricked , he was describing what would become the Iranian counterproposal to ElBaradei ’s draft on October 29 .
Although no official statement was made , the state news agency IRNA indicated that the Iranian proposal called for the LEU shipments to be made in batches rather than in one single shipment and that insisted that the receipt of the uranium for Tehran ’s medical reactor would have to come before a second batch went out .
IRNA called the " simultaneous exchange " feature of the proposal a " red line " in Iran ’s negotiating position .
Another feature of the proposal was the insistence that part of the demand for uranium for the medical reactor be met through straight purchase arrangements .
Although the Iranian counterproposal eliminates everything about the ElBaradei draft that made it attractive to the Obama administration and its allies , the official Iranian response carefully avoided outright rejection of the draft .
In fact it reportedly expressed a " positive attitude " and a willingness to hold further talks on it .
That was another obvious effort to avoid handing the G5 plus 1 an opportunity to declare and end to the negotiations on the grounds that Iran had refused to negotiate seriously .
When that counterproposal was ignored by Iran ’s negotiating partners , Ahmadinejad advanced yet another proposal to put roughly a quarter of its LEU under seal by the IAEA on Iranian soil until the uranium for its medical reactor is delivered , rather than sending it abroad .
But Obama warned November 15 , " We are now running out of time " for negotiations on the ElBaradei proposal .
It now seems certain that the G5 plus 1 will declare an end to the negotiations before the end of December and move to the next phase of sanctions .
Thus the talks with Iran will have ended without having attempting to explore the possibility of a larger bargain with Iran .
That would have involved an end to overtly hostile U.S. policies and a symbolic recognition of Iran ’s legitimate interests and status in Middle Eastern politics .
That the Obama administration did not even try , despite Obama ’s commitment to diplomatic engagement , is partly due to the desire of Samore and other advisers to try to impose a diplomatic solution on Iran that could be portrayed as a diplomatic victory over Iran , even if only in the short - term .
Michael Schumacher would have made an F1 comeback for Ferrari instead of Mercedes , reckons test driver Marc Gene .
Writing on his blog for Spanish newspaper El Mundo Gene claims Schumacher would have been the third driver at Ferrari in 2010 had the regulations allowed him him to race .
That would have meant Schumacher teaming up with his 2006 title rival Fernando Alonso as well as Felipe Massa .
It goes some way towards explaining Luca di Montezemolo ’s doleful remarks about Schumacher ’s “ twin brother , identical in every way , who seems to have it in his head to go and race in Formula 1 with Mercedes . ”
I ’m torn between whether I ’d rather see Schumacher return to Mercedes , the team that helped him get his break in international motor racing , or take on Alonso at Ferrari .
What do you think ?
And did Ferrari give any serious thought to giving Massa the elbow so they could have a Schumacher - Alonso dream team ?

Towards the full automation of scientific discovery
A Robot Scientist encompasses a combination of different technologies : computer controlled scientific instruments , integrated robotic automation to link the instruments together , a computational model of the object of study , artificial intelligence and machine learning to iteratively create hypotheses about a problem and later interpret experimental results ( closed - loop learning ) , and the formalisation of the scientific discovery process .
We show how these elements come together to create an automated closed - loop learning system : a Robot Scientist .
Automation in all its forms has played an integral role in the development of human society since the 19th century .
The advent of computers and computer science in the mid-20th century made practical the idea of automating aspects of scientific discovery , and now computing is playing an increasingly prominent role in the scientific discovery process [ 1 , 2 ] .
Experimental scientists use computers for instrument control , data acquisition and data analysis , and the functionality available on scientific instrumentation controlled by computers is improving rapidly .
In addition , an increasing number of scientists no longer conduct physical experiments , instead using simulation or data - mining to discover new knowledge from existing data [ 3 ] .
Artificial intelligence ( AI ) has been used in an attempt to automate some of the intelligent aspects of the scientific discovery process still predominantly carried out by human scientists .
Some examples of systems using AI components follow :
DENDRAL was an AI program developed in the 1960s that used background knowledge of chemistry to analyse experimental mass spectra data .
It used heuristic search to determine solutions for the chemical structures responsible for the spectra , and was the first application of AI to a problem of scientific reasoning .
This version became known as Heuristic - DENDRAL .
A variant called Meta -DENDRAL followed , and was the first expert system for scientific hypothesis formation .
It took a set of possible chemical structures and corresponding mass spectra as input , and inferred a set of hypotheses to explain correlation between some of the proposed structures and the mass spectrum .
This information was then used to describe the knowledge that Heuristic - DENDRAL could utilise in its search for suitable structures [ 4 ] .
AM was an Automated Mathematician , a heuristic artificial intelligence program that modelled mathematical discovery in the mid 1970s [ 5 ] .
It was said to have discovered numbers , prime numbers and several interesting mathematical conjectures .
This system later evolved into EURISKO , developed in the late 1970s , which was more flexible in that it could be applied to other task domains .
EURISKO was used successfully , for example , in optimising the design of integrated circuits for microchips [ 5 ] .
KEKADA was a another heuristic based system that could develop hypotheses and plan experiments , searching for surprising phenomena [ 6 ] .
Kulkarni and Simon used this system to model the discovery of the urea synthesis pathway by Krebs .
However , KEKADA had limited background knowledge when compared to human scientists , and like AM and EURISKO , needed more heuristics in order to continue its discoveries .
BACON [ 7 ] , ABACUS [ 8 ] , Fahrenheit [ 9 ] and IDS [ 10 ] were automated data driven discovery systems that could discover scientific laws as algebraic equations .
They relied on data being entered by the experimenter , or on simulation of experiments .
More recently , another example of a data driven system uses iterative cycles of algorithmic correlation to extract natural laws of geometric and momentum conservation , using data captured from motion - tracking experiments [ 11 ] .
Most intelligent scientific discovery programs still do not ' close the loop ' ( feeding their results back into their experimental models ) and do not design or execute their own experiments .
Now , with recent advances in hardware and technology , the limitations of being unable to run experiments are diminishing .
For example , microfluidics ( ' lab - on - a- chip ' ) based approaches to experimentation may soon allow small controllable biological experimental systems to be linked to automated scientific discovery [ 12 , 13 ] .
We look forward to these advances in technology promoting future developments in automated scientific discovery .
Integrated robotic systems are now capable of carrying out highly complex scientific discovery processes [ 14 – 18 ] .
The majority of such automation is designed to perform experiments , previously conducted manually , in a more efficient , reliable and accurate manner than a human could ever achieve .
Automation also enables previously impractical experiments to be carried out ( such experiments may involve dangerous chemicals , pathogenic organisms , numerous assays or process steps , or need frequent measurements over long periods ) .
With this type of system a human scientist typically sets - up the automated system to perform a sequence of processes , the system then executes the various steps automatically , and finally the human analyses the results .
Any computation involved is usually connected with running the system , or with data management , visualisation and analysis .
Complex databases are required to manage scientific data and knowledge and , as a result , science increasingly depends on efficient information management and manipulation [ 19 ] .
Computational models or simulations have been used to give insight into how complex systems work ; they represent the current state of understanding , provide a basis for predictions , and also have the benefit of being relatively cheap to execute .
Models can be perturbed by making computational modifications to external conditions or to the architecture of the models themselves , then tested against acquired data .
Such models can be constructed manually using human knowledge ( e.g . [ 20 ] ) or be automatically derived from experimental data ( e.g . [ 11 ] ) .
The formal recording of scientific experimental data and meta - data can help towards creating better models , as well as facilitating the easier reuse of that data .
Recording scientific data and meta -data in formal languages can provide complete , accurate , and detailed descriptions of why experiments were performed , how they were carried out , what the observed and derived results were , and how these results were interpreted .
A well implemented formalisation provides the transparency required for science , allowing others to understand exactly why , as well as how an experiment was done , and provides all the essential information required to repeat that experiment .
To fully automate the scientific discovery process , computers also need to be able to create the initial hypotheses that define the reasons for carrying out the experiments , and then to be capable of learning from the results .
Deduction , induction and abduction are types of logical reasoning used in scientific discovery [ 21 ] .
Deduction enables the inference of valid facts from existing known facts and rules , induction enables the inference of hypothesised rules from known facts , and abduction enables the inference of hypothesised facts from known facts .
The full automation of science requires ' closed - loop learning ' , where the computer not only analyses the results , but learns from them and feeds the resulting knowledge back into the next cycle of the process [ 22 ] .
Computational closed - loop learning systems have certain advantages over human scientists : their biases are explicit , they can produce full records of their reasoning processes , they can incorporate large volumes of explicit background knowledge , they can incorporate explicit complex models , they can analyse data much faster , and they do not need to rest .
The Robot Scientist concept
The combination of computational methods , automated instruments , closed - loop learning , advanced laboratory robotic systems and formal logical expression of information leads to the concept of a ' Robot Scientist ' [ 23 ] .
A Robot Scientist uses techniques from the field of artificial intelligence to carry out cycles of experimentation on a laboratory robotic system .
It automatically generates hypotheses from the available background knowledge and model(s ) , designs physical experiments to test these hypotheses , carries out the experiments on a laboratory robotic system , and then analyses and interprets the results ( see Figure 1 ) .
Because computers are involved throughout , it is possible to explicitly capture every detail of the scientific discovery process : goals , hypotheses , results , conclusions , etc .
Moreover , in addition to all the direct experimental data there is also a wealth of useful meta - data that can be captured , such as environmental conditions , detailed experiment content layout information , and instrument settings , protocols and runtime logs .
These meta - data can be especially important when studying complex biological systems where the specifics of the environment can have such a large effect on results .

Robot Scientist prototypes
Here we describe our two prototype Robot Scientists , ' Adam ' and ' Eve ' .
Adam has already proven itself by discovering new knowledge [ 24 ] , whilst Eve is still under development .
Both robots are designed to carry out biomedical scientific research .
A Robot Scientist to study yeast metabolism - ' Adam '
Our first prototype Robot Scientist , Adam , was physically commissioned at the end of 2005 ( see Figure 2 ) .
It was designed to carry out microbial growth experiments to study functional genomics in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , specifically to identify the genes encoding ' locally orphan enzymes ' .
A locally orphan enzyme is an enzyme that is known to exist in an organism , but where the corresponding gene is as yet unidentified ( definition agreed with Yannick Poullot and Peter D. Karp , who defined the term ' orphan enzyme ' which has a slightly different meaning , see [ 25 ] ) .
Adam uses a comprehensive logical model of yeast metabolism ( based on the Forster iF F708 model ) , coupled with a bioinformatic database ( Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes - KEGG ) and standard bioinformatics homology search techniques ( PSI - BLAST and FASTA ) to hypothesise likely candidate genes that may encode the locally orphan enzymes .
This hypothesis generation process is abductive .
There were two types of hypothesis generated .
The first level links an orphan enzyme , represented by its enzyme class ( E.C. ) number , to a gene ( ORF ) that potentially encodes it .
This relation is expressed as a two place predicate where the first argument is the ORF and the second the E.C. number .
An example hypothesis at this level is :
encodesORFtoEC (' YBR166C ' , ' 1.1.1.25 ')

The second level of hypothesis involves the association between a deletant strain , referenced via the name of its missing ORF , and a chemical compound which should affect the growth of the strain , if added as a nutrient to its environment .
This level of hypothesis is derived from the first by logical inference using our model of yeast metabolism .
An example of such a hypothesis is : affects growth ( ' C00108 ' , 'YBR166C ' ) , where the first argument is the compound ( names according to KEGG ) and the second argument is the deletant strain .
More examples of Adam 's hypotheses can be found on our website ( see appendix note 1 ) .
Adam then designs the experimental assays required to test these hypotheses for execution on the laboratory robotic system .
These experiments are based on a two - factor design that compares multiple replicates of deletant strains with and without metabolites compared against wild type strain controls with and without metabolites .
Full details of the experiment design process ( such as how suitable metabolites were chosen ) can be found on the Robot Scientist website ( see appendix note 1 ) .
Adam 's robotic system comprises various automated laboratory instruments served by three robotic arms ( see Figure 3 ) .
Experiments are created by combining the planned yeast strains , metabolites and defined growth medium solutions in SBS ( Society for Biomolecular Screening ) format microtitre plates , at medium to high throughput using a number of conventional liquid handlers ( one of which is capable of aspirating or dispensing different volumes in 96 wells simultaneously - see appendix note 2 ) .
Adam is capable of creating up to 1000 individual experiments in a day , with a typical experiment running for 4 days .

There are also four computers controlling the robotics , plus a networked computer server which runs all the other code vital to Adam 's function : the metabolism model , bioinfomatics , hypothesis generation , experiment planning , results relational database , data analysis etc. ( not shown ) .

The measurements observed by the system are optical density measurements taken at 595 nm recorded by the two microtitre plate readers ( see appendix note 3 ) , which when plotted over time become graphs that act as a proxy for cellular growth and indicate phenotype .
The growth curves are smoothed , after which biologically significant parameters are extracted and statistically analysed to determine whether the original hypotheses have been confirmed or refuted .
Scientific knowledge gained from this process is used to update the model of yeast metabolism .
Full details about all these processes can be found on the Robot Scientist website ( see appendix note 1 ) .
The yeast S. cerevisiae is extensively studied as a model for eukaryotic cells .
Yeast has a small physical size and fast generation time which makes it suitable for high - throughput experimentation , plus the growth curve results are relatively easy to observe and highly sensitive to changes in genotype and environment .
There already exists a vast amount of information about yeast , including a detailed ( but still incomplete ) logical model of its metabolic pathways [ 26 ] .
In Adam this model was used both as the basis for forming hypotheses , and also when designing the experiments required to test these hypotheses [ 20 ] .
Adam 's software
Adam is intended to be fully automated , with human intervention required only to supply library strain stocks and consumables .
As such , Adam includes a collection of software components that together allow the system to perform cycles of experimentation .
In Adam 's early work , the Inductive Logic Programming program C - Progol 5 [ 27 , 28 ] was used to automatically infer hypotheses for the investigation of aromatic amino acid metabolism .
The inference was a restricted form of Abductive Logic Programming [ 29 ] , where an incomplete background theory and experimental observations were used to infer facts concerning gene function .
A logic program corresponding to the Aromatic Amino Acid Biosynthesis pathway of S. cerevisiae was used as the background theory and the inferred facts matched an ORF from yeast to a catalysing enzyme .
The hypotheses completed the background theory by rediscovering the missing ORF / enzyme relations .
For Adam 's most recent hypothesis generation work we have a detailed logical computer model of the metabolic reaction pathways in yeast ( written in Prolog ) , from which locally orphaned enzymes are identified .
The bioinformatics method of hypotheses generation attempts to use sequence similarity techniques to identify likely candidates for the ORFs that catalyse these reactions , thereby allowing the Robot Scientist to discover novel biology .
The method is described by the following steps :
1. Identify Enzyme Commission ( E.C. ) numbers corresponding to enzymes which participate in yeast metabolism but have no known ORF assigned to them .
2 . For each E.C. number find the ORFs in other organisms that code for that enzyme .
Use all organisms from the KEGG genome database for this search .
Collect all amino acid sequences for these ORFs .
These are known as the ' query sequences ' .
3 . For each query sequence use sequence similarity search ( PSI - BLAST or FASTA ) to identify the most similar sequences / ORFs in S. cerevisiae .
4 . A single hypothesis is the mapping of one S. cerevisiae ORF to one E.C. class - e.g. YER152C → 2.6.1.39 .
There are typically many hypotheses for each enzyme class .
Experiment design code then uses the system model to generate biological experiment plans involving deletant strains and metabolite solutions to test the hypotheses , creating microplate layouts using Latin - square design to improve the detection of quantitatively small differences above the background noise .
The microplate layouts and related liquid handler volume files are passed to the robotic system control software , that executes the experiment plans .
The resulting growth curve data is processed using algorithms based on cubic splines to fit , smooth and de-noise the curves , and then to extract biologically significant parameters such as growth rate and lag time .
The parameters from multiple experiment replicates are analysed using machine learning ( random forests [ 30 ] ) to obtain statistically significant results that can be used to either confirm or refute hypotheses , potentially resulting in new scientific knowledge that can be used to update the system model .
The cycle can then repeat with further hypothesis generation .
Finally , there is a comprehensive custom - made relational database that stores all the data and meta - data generated throughout the various stages ( MySQL ) .
Further details describing all the software and informatics can be found online at our website ( see appendix note 1 ) .
Adam 's results
Adam conceived 20 hypotheses concerning the identity of genes encoding 13 locally orphan enzymes in S. cerevisiae .
Adam tested all these hypotheses on its robotic system and was able to confirm by experimentation , with a high degree of confidence , the correctness of 12 of them [ 24 ] .
Conventional manual biological experiments were performed to verify 3 of these conclusions , and additional detailed literature searches revealed evidence supporting a further 6 more .
Subsequent comparative genomics also indicated a number of possible reasons why the identities of some of the genes encoding these locally orphan enzymes had remained unknown for so long : there appear to have been gene duplication events with retained overlapping functions , a number of the enzymes appear to catalyse more than one associated reaction , and some of the functional annotations in the existing literature are incorrect .
Adam 's use of bioinformatic and quantitative phenotypic analyses were needed to deconvolve this functional complexity .
Interestingly , Adam also came to an incorrect conclusion regarding one of its original 20 hypotheses which highlights a weakness in its system model .
This was because the hypothesised gene candidate YIL033C was predicted to be a glutaminase enzyme , and Adam confirmed this activity experimentally by performing assays involving 11 metabolites predicted to have differential effect on a glutaminase deletant .
However , it transpires that YIL033C has a cAMP - dependent protein kinase sub - unit which is involved in regulating metabolism , and this could also explain the observed phenotype .
Adam 's current metabolism system model does not represent kinase control mechanisms , and so Adam did not take this into account .
There is also the possibility that YIL033C is both a kinase and a glutaminase , and some evidence exists to support this theory ( see [ 31 ] ) .
See the Robot Scientist website for more details on Adam 's results , its hardware and its software ( see appendix note 4 ) .
Formalisation
We formalised the information related to Adam 's investigations .
This was based on the generic ontology of scientific experiments : EXPO [ 32 , 33 ] .
We developed a custom version of EXPO called LABORS ( see appendix note 5 ) which was tailored to formalise Adam 's experiments .
We also developed an ontology to describe experimental actions ( both by humans and machines ) called EXACT [ 34 ] .
LABORS was developed when no generic formalism for the logical description of experiments was available .
The OBI project aims to provide such a formalism and the first release is due in the near future [ 35 ] .
The Robot Scientist project joined the OBI consortium in October 2008 , and the LABORS representations which are common to other biological domains have been aligned with the OBI representations .
However , other terms specific to automated investigations still remain within LABORS .
Use of LABORS resulted in the generation of a nested tree structure 10 levels deep containing over 10,000 research elements , connecting all the experimental information to the observations .
These data are expressed in the logical programming language Datalog [ 36 ] , and have been made publicly available ( see the ' Results ' section on the Robot Scientist website - see appendix note 4 ) .
This explicit logical description makes Adam 's investigations more explicit , reproducible , and reusable .
A Robot Scientist to study chemical genetics and drug design - ' Eve '
Our second Robot Scientist , Eve , was physically commissioned in the early part of 2009 ( see Figure 4 ) .
Both the software and the biological assays are still under development .
Eve is a prototype system to demonstrate the automation of closed - loop learning in drug - screening and design .
Eve 's robotic system is capable of moderately high - throughput compound screening ( greater than 10,000 compounds per day ) and is designed to be flexible enough such that it can be rapidly re-configured to carry out a number of different biological assays .
Figure 4

( a) An external view of Eve 's laboratory robotic system , also showing Adam's at the extreme left , and ( b ) a view looking down on some of the instruments within Eve 's robotic system .

The main goal with Eve is to integrate machine learning and automated quantitative structure - activity relationship ( QSAR [ 37 ] ) into the drug - screening process , to improve both the efficiency and quality , as well as reduce the cost , of a primary drug screen .
Eve will begin by performing a standard mass screen against the target assay , monitoring the results in real time , and when sufficient hits are found it will stop the mass screen .
After verifying the hits
Eve will then switch to a more targeted approach using machine learning and QSARs to look at the chemical structures of the hit compounds , and generate hypotheses about what it considers would be useful compounds to test next .
It then plans the screening experiments to test these hypotheses , runs these experiments on the robotic system , uses machine learning to analyse these results , and then iteratively cycles around testing other compounds until it can identify the best set of lead compounds for the target .
Eve will first test those compounds which are available from its own compound library , then suggest other compounds that are commercially available that should be tested .
Potentially Eve could even suggest new compounds that should be synthesised for testing .
Eve will initially use an automation - accessible compound library of 14,400 chemical compounds : the Maybridge ' Hit - finder ' library ( see appendix note 6 ) .
This compound library is cluster - based and was developed specifically to contain a diverse range of compounds .
It was selected as a subset of the full Maybridge compound library by a two - stage filtering process based first on ' Lipinski 's rule of five ' [ 38 ] to reduce the set to 200,000 compounds , then secondly by using a Pharmacophore Fingerprinting process [ 39 ] and cluster analysis to further reduce the set to 14,400 compounds .
We realise that this is not a large compound library by industrial standards ; a pharmaceutical company may have many hundreds of thousands or even millions of compounds in its primary screening library .
Our aim is to demonstrate the proof - of - principle that incorporating machine learning and QSARs into the screening process can improve on the current mass screening approach .
Eve 's laboratory robotic system ( see Figure 5 ) contains a carefully selected set of instruments designed to give the system the flexibility to prepare and execute a broad variety of biological assays , including : cellular growth assays , cell based chemical compound screening assays , and cellular morphology assays .
There are three types of liquid handling instruments included in the system , one of which uses advanced non-contact acoustic transference ( see appendix note 7 ) , as used by many large pharmaceutical companies .
For observation of assays , the system contains two multi-functional microplate readers ( see appendix note 8 ) capable ( with the appropriate filters ) of recording measurements across a broad range of both excitation and emission wavelengths .
There is also an automated cellular imager ( see appendix note 9 ) capable of taking images of the well contents of microplates using both bright - field and a broad range of other wavelengths .
This automated high - throughput microscope could be used to collect cell morphological information , for example to see how cells change size and shape over time after the addition of specific compounds .
Also , the primary biological assays intended to be used on Eve will create one or more fluorescent protein markers that can be detected on the readers and imager , such that Eve can not only quantify the amount of marker produced using the readers , but also potentially localise it to specific cellular regions or organelles using the imager .
Eve also utilises control software for the robotic system that is flexible enough to allow us to reconfigure the experimental process ( see appendix note 10 ) .
In all , we believe this system is equivalent to the best systems available in the Pharmaceutical industry .

In addition , Eve is also physically connected to Adam via a linear track slide which allows the transfer of microtitre plates in either direction .
This will allow development of assays using equipment from both systems and further increases the flexibility available in experimental design .
Eve 's software
As with our other Robot Scientist Adam , Eve is also intended to be fully automated .
Eve will include software components that will allow the system to perform cycles of targeted drug screening .
There are three stages to this approach ; mass screening , hit verification , and hypothesis - driven targeted screening .
For each of these stages there will be experiment design code that generates the biological experiment plans , which combine chimeric yeast target strains and chemical compounds .
First , the mass screening experiment plans will be generated and passed to the robotic system control software ( see appendix note 10 ) for execution .
Monitoring software will automatically analyse the mass screening data in real time to identify and quantify chemical ' hits ' , and when there are sufficient hits , the system will be switched into the verification mode .
Experiment generation code will then create the verification microplate layouts to re-screen each hit against the target at multiple concentrations and with multiple replicates .
Once these have been executed on the robotic system , the resulting dose - response curves will be analysed by curve smoothing algorithms and statistical tests to create a refined list of verified hits that includes quantitative information about how each chemical affected the target .
This list will then be passed to machine learning code that uses the quantitative information and QSARs to inspect the chemical structures of the hits and create hypotheses about other possibly active compounds .
Cycles of targeted screening then commence to test these hypotheses , with the experiment planning code generating microplate layouts and executing them on the robotic system .
The aim is for the machine learning code to analyse each successive cycle of this targeted screening and progressively refine an optimal list of lead compounds .
Eve will use the same relational database that was developed for Adam to store all its data and meta - data , with some modifications specific to the drug discovery research and storing additional instrument meta -data .
Formalisation of Eve
As with Adam , the intention is to formalise all data and meta - data relating to Eve , again by creating a derivation of the EXPO ontology .
There are many similarities between Adam and Eve 's data and meta -data , as well as in the types of instruments used on the systems , so we plan to identify the common elements in both the LABORS and new Eve ontologies , and update EXPO to include this common understanding .
The Future
The immediate future for our Robot Scientist work involves the continued development of the new Eve system and the improvement and continued use of the Adam system .
Additionally , the two systems will be capable of working together to address scientific questions .
By combining the functionality of the instrumentation on both systems we will be able to discover more about yeast , bacteria and C. elegans by preparing experiments that measure a variety of phenotypes including growth , fluorescent protein expression , cellular morphology , chemical susceptibility , growth competition , multiple gene deletions , and other visible phenotypic assays .
For example , Adam 's robotic system could prepare plates containing multiple cellular strains that could then be passed to Eve 's robotic system where multiple compounds could be added before visualisation of the morphological effects using the automated cellular imager .
The longer - term aim is for Robot Scientists to become more commonplace in the laboratory : automating reasoning , decision making and information management , as well as automating the execution of experimental procedures .
We believe that such automation is necessary to meet the challenges of 21st century biological research .
Happy birthday Bob Hawke , who turned 80 on this very morn .
He 'll celebrate with a black - tie dinner at the Sydney Opera House , thus giving photographers the chance to capture two great Aussie icons in a single snapshot - one with glorious white sails , the other with luxuriant silver hair .
I have the " Silver Bodgie " to thank for providing one of my more memorable moments covering Australian politics .
It came during the 2007 election , when Bob Hawke was " g' daying " and " hello darlinging " his way around a pedestrianised shopping precinct as he sought to lend his charisma and panache to a rather dour Labor party candidate who was in urgent need of a personality transplant .
Needless to say , the Silver Bodgie was magnificently presented : resplendent in an electric blue sports jacket , an open - necked white shirt , even whiter leather loathers , no socks and a heavy gold chain that hung lazily from his sun-tanned neck .
At a distance he could easily have been mistaken for a sales rep trying to sell retirement homes on the Gold Coast , but up close there was no doubting his presence .
For surely nobody else in Australia has such a extravagant head of hair , so perfectly coiffured that it looked like it has been groomed by his very own squadron of stable hands working since the crack of dawn .
Oddly , I had spent that morning compiling a report on how green issues had intruded on the campaign , and I was keen to get Bob Hawke 's input .
And he was more than delighted to help , since he claimed to be the first Australian prime minister to have been alert to the dangers of greenhouse gas emissions , and had acted accordingly .
Shortly after launching into the interview , Hawkie was a few words short of a near perfect sound - bite when his voice started to be over - powered by a busker , who had spotted him approaching and decided to honour him with a musical tribute : a quick rendition of Advance Australia Fair .
Rather than stop Mr Hawke in mid-flow , I tried to make sense of the melody to the listeners back home .
It was now drowning out the former prime minister , and could hardly be ignored .
" They 're playing the national anthem for you , Mr Hawke , " I said .
" I gathered that , " he replied abruptly , shooting me the most withering of looks .
Then , with the microphone still on , he started to hum along with the anthem , bouncing from one word to the next - an impromptu performance in which the Silver Bodgie delivered radio gold .
That morning I left Bob Hawke thinking that the only leader I have ever witnessed do retail politics with more aplomb is another Rhodes scholar , Bill Clinton .
And it helps explain why the Silver Bodgie is Labor 's longest serving prime minister , with four election victories to his name .
Regardless of what you thought of his politics , it was hard not to like him - from his endearing habit of breaking down in tears on national television to that moment of spontaneity on the morning of Australia 's America 's Cup triumph in 1983 when he essentially gave the whole country the day off .
By far the best profile that I have read of Bob Hawke comes from the pen of one of my favourite Australian journalists , Craig McGregor , who had trailed him for a few days in 1977 , when he was still a union leader .
" He drinks like a fish , " wrote McGregor , " swears like a trooper , works like a demon , performs like a playboy , talks like a truckie - and acts like a politician .... Bob Hawke is your typical Australian , oversize . "
McGregor went on to say that no other country in the world could have produced a leader like Bob Hawke : " In a way he sums up the best , and the worst , of us .
For that reason alone , he could make a great prime minister . "
The profile also included a quote from Hawke himself , which offers a good starting point for anyone covering Australian politics .
" I do n't think in Australia we are going to change things dramatically , " he said before becoming prime minister .
" We are a very conservative country .
And you have to move with within the constraints of what the nation 's economic performance will allow .
Whatever a future Labor government may achieve , it will live or die according to its economic performance . "
Prophetic words from the prime minister who " opened up " the Australian economy , and who , with his Treasurer Paul Keating , laid many of the structural foundations for its present - day prosperity .
Almost 30 years on , Hawke still has a penchant for the killer sound - bite .
Asked last week what sort of leader Tony Abbott would be , Hawkie deadpanned : " Temporary . "
Like McGregor , I 've always looked upon Hawke as an emblematic leader , a man of contradictions who led a country full of contradictions ( yes , Whitlamite , a " schizophrenic country " ) .
He was the son of a Congregationalist minister whose catchphrase as a union leader was : " You can get f*****. "
He was a brilliant scholar who won a Rhodes Scholarship , although his students days are best remembered - memorialised even at the Turf Tavern in Oxford - by his skill at downing a yard of ale quicker than anyone else in the world .
He was a heavy drinker who gave up the bottle while he was prime minister ; he was a back - slapping larrikin , who thought nothing of crying in public .
He was the longest serving Labor prime minister who , despite his personal popularity , had a surprisingly conservative political outlook and governing philosophy .
So is it an exaggeration to say that , more so than any post - war prime minister , he was a complicated man who personified the complicated country he led ?
UPDATE : To avoid any confusion , the Silver Bodgie is indeed the Silver Bodgie .
Parrgirl 's definition is spot on : " Bodgies were delicious blokes from the 50s /60s with the tight duds and glorious shocks of brushed back hair . "
And richer than the description from an online dictionary of Aussie slang : " The word was used to describe a young Aussie male , distinguished by his complete conformity to certain fashions of dress - and loutish or rowdy behaviour - the antipodean counterpart of the pommie ' teddy boy ' . "
Seems like the the Silver Bodgie had a fine old time at his Opera House bash .
It was attended by Kevin Rudd , along with the former Labor prime ministers , Gough Whitlam and Paul Keating .
A burlesque stripper pretending to be John Howard also made an appearance , wearing skimpy swimwear - something which seems to be in vogue among Liberal leaders .
The story is here and the pictures are here .

A new article in the December 4 issue of Science addresses how the combined efforts of government commitments and market transition could save forest and reduce carbon emissions in Brazil .
The Policy Forum brief was authored by contributors from the Woods Hole Research Center , Instituto de Pesquisa Ambiental da Amazonia ( IPAM ) , Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais , Aliança da Terra , Environmental Defense Fund , University of Florida , Universidad Rey Juan Carlos , and the Universidade Federal do Pará .
According to Daniel Nepstad , a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Research Center and the study 's lead author , " market forces and Brazil 's political will are converging in an unprecedented opportunity to end deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon with 80 percent of the forest still standing . "
Brazil has lowered deforestation rates 64 percent since 2005 .
This remarkable achievement was possible through a government crack - down on illegal activities in the region .
It was helped by a retraction of the cattle and soybean industries , and a growing effort to exclude deforesters from the beef and soy markets .
The article describes how Brazil could build upon this progress to end forest clearing by the year 2020 , and the additional funding that will be required to reach this goal .
The study estimates that $ 6.5 to $ 18 billion will be needed from 2010 to 2020 to achieve the end of deforestation , resulting in a 2 to 5 percent reduction in global carbon dioxide emissions .
The steps include the support of low - deforestation livelihoods for forest peoples and smallholders ; identifying and rewarding responsible cattle ranchers and farmers ; improved enforcement of environmental laws ; and investments in protected area management .
This estimate utilizes a sophisticated economic model of the Amazon region that estimates and maps the value of forgone profits from ranching and soy farming that are associated with forest conservation .
Britaldo Soares - Filho of the Universidade Federal de Minas Gerais , the article 's second author , describes , " Our economic models integrate the best available information on soils , roads , and the costs of production to capture the economic logic of the Amazon 's drivers of deforestation . "
Brazil has emerged as one of the most progressive nations in the world in assuming commitments to lower greenhouse gas emissions within the United Nations climate negotiations .
In December of 2008 , this nation declared that it would cut deforestation to 20 % of its historic level by 2020 .
Brazil 's position going into Copenhagen next week , when climate negotiations should culminate in a new climate agreement , could be even more progressive .
Paulo Moutinho , leader of IPAM 's climate change program , in Brazil , and a scientist at the WHRC , states , " Brazil was , for many years , the country that said that rich nations must lead in developing a solution to climate change .
Now , Brazil is showing that leadership . "
These lessons are key , especially in light of the UN climate conference beginning on December 7 , in Copenhagen , Denmark .
Understanding the relationship between climate and weather is important in climate science .
Here ’s NASA :
The difference between weather and climate is a measure of time .
Weather is what conditions of the atmosphere are over a short period of time , and climate is how the atmosphere “ behaves ” over relatively long periods of time .
And again :
Climate is the average of weather over time and space .
Who could argue with that succinct statement ?
Easy for all of us to understand .
Now Tamino , in his long running blog , says :
Time and time again , peoplewhodontagreewithus - ists try to suggest that the last 10 years , or 9 years , or 8 years , or 7 years , or 6 years , or three and a half days of temperature data establish that the earth is cooling , in contradiction to mainstream climate science …
Of course that raises an interesting question : how long a time span do we need to establish a trend in global temperature data ?
It ’s sometimes stated that the required time is 30 years , because that ’s the time span used most often to distinguish climate from weather .
Although that ’s a useful guide , it ’s not strictly correct .
The time required to establish a trend in data depends on many things , including how big the trend is ( the size of the signal ) and how big , and what type , the noise is …
Well , I agree with the statistical principles involved here .
But his comment does raise a very interesting point .
Is the global temperature value measured for a year just noise on top of the climate signal ?
If the global temperature value measured in 2009 is less than that measured in 2008 did the world actually cool that year ( relative to 2008 ) , or is it just noise ?
Digression on Noise and Signal
For those not so familiar with the technical terms it ’s worth explaining signal and noise a little .
Let ’s choose a non-controversial topic and suppose we want to set up a radio communications link .
We have a receiver which amplifies the tiny incoming radio signal so that we can hear it – or retransmit it – whatever we want to do with this signal .
The noise is the random element that get mixed in with the signal .
In amplifiers they are frequently the random movement of electrons ( that increase with temperature ) .
In reception of the signal they are the other radio waves at similar frequencies that have been reflected , diffracted and otherwise distorted their way to your receiver .
In this case , noise is stuff that is NOT the signal .
It threatens to stop you measuring your signal – or at least make it less accurate .
Noise can have a systematic bias or it can be random .
And in the real world of engineering problems , dealing with noise is often a significant problem to be solved .
Signal and Noise in Climate
We are thinking here specifically of the average global temperature .
Often known by its acronym , GMST ( global mean surface temperature ) .
What Tamino appears to be saying is that the temperature from year to year is just the “ noise ” on top of the climate ( temperature ) signal .
Well we do n’t want noise to upset our measurement so in that case we do need to call on statistical processes to give us the real signal .
But is it true ?
Is this the right way to look at it ?
Other commentators and scientists have made a similar point .
Easterling ’s paper
Is the climate warming or cooling ?
submitted to GRL ( 2009 ) says :
Numerous websites , blogs and articles in the media have claimed that the climate is no longer warming , and is now cooling .
Here we show that periods of no trend or even cooling of the globally averaged surface air temperature are found in the last 34 years of the observed record , and in climate model simulations of the 20th and 21st century forced with increasing greenhouse gases .
We show that the climate over the 21st century can and likely will produce periods of a decade or two where the globally averaged surface air temperature shows no trend or even slight cooling in the presence of longer - term warming .
But there ’s a very interesting paper in Current Opinion in Environmental Sustainability ( 2009 ) from Kevin Trenberth on the global energy budget .
It ’s worth paying close attention to what he has to say , and for anyone interested in the subject of the global temperature , read the whole paper .
From the introduction :
The global mean temperature in 2008 was the lowest since about 2000 ( Figure 1 ) .
Given that there is continual heating of the planet , referred to as radiative forcing , by accelerating increases of carbon dioxide and other greenhouses due to human activities , why is the temperature not continuing to go up ?
The stock answer is that natural variability plays a key role and there was a major La Nina event early in 2008 that led to the month of January having the lowest anomaly in global temperature since 2000 .
While this is true , it is an incomplete explanation .
In particular , what are the physical processes ?
From an energy standpoint , there should be an explanation that accounts for where the radiative forcing has gone .
Was it compensated for temporarily by changes in clouds or aerosols , or other changes in atmospheric circulation that allowed more radiation to escape to space ?
Was it because a lot of heat went into melting Arctic sea ice or parts of Greenland and Antarctica , and other glaciers ?
Was it because the heat was buried in the ocean and sequestered , perhaps well below the surface ?
Was it because the La Nina led to a change in tropical ocean currents and rearranged the configuration of ocean heat ?
Perhaps all of these things are going on ?
Interesting .
Trenberth is saying that we need to understand what happens to the global energy “ account ” in shorter time periods than decades .
In fact , it ’s essential .
Because if we do n’t know whether the earth warms or cools in one year , there might be important aspects of the climate that we have n’t understood in sufficient detail – or we are n’t measuring in sufficient detail .
And if the earth has warmed but we do n’t know where the energy actually is that is a problem to be solved as well .
All of which leads to the inescapable conclusion that the average global temperature value for one year is not “ noise ” .
It is the “ signal ” .
( See the technical note on temperature measurement at the end of this post )
After all , if there is a radiative imbalance in the earth ’s climate system such that we take more energy in than we radiate out it must be warming .
But if this energy is not being stored somewhere then the earth has n’t warmed in that year .
In fact , if there is less heat in the climate system , we radiated out more than we received in .
There is n’t some secret place that is storing it all up .
Roger Pielke
Sr has made that point ( probably many times ) .
What I ’m not saying is that earth is on a long term cooling trend .
And I ’m definitely not saying that the cold weather yesterday means the earth is cooling .
But if the global temperature in one year is cooler than the global temperature in the previous year then the earth has cooled .
It ’s not noise .
It ’s only noise if we ca n’t measure temperature accurately enough to be sure whether the temperature has gone up or down .
Possibly I have misunderstood Tamino .
I did post a comment on this topic to his recent blog post ( twice ) but possibly due to a moderating snafu , or possibly because there were much more important questions to be answered , it did n’t get published .
Conclusion
As NASA says , the climate is the average of the weather .
Monthly and annual averages of specific values like temperature and total heat stored in the climate system can change in apparently random ways .
But that does n’t mean that these changes do n’t reflect real changes in the system .
I can draw a trend line through a longer time series and show lots of deviations from the trend line .
But that does n’t give some kind of superior validity to the trend line .
I could take 10000 years of climate data and show that 100 year periods are just noise .
What is the climate doing ?
It ’s apparently random , but actually always changing .
Over the last 40 years it has warmed .
For the more recent shorter period that Trenberth covered , it cooled .
Over the last 20,000 years it has warmed .
Over the last 10 million years it has cooled .
If there ’s less heat in the earth ’s climate at the end of 2010 compared with 2009 , the planet will have cooled .
And if there ’s more heat at the end of 2010 compared with 2009 , the planet will have warmed .
Not noise , it really will have changed .
Why the total heat stored goes up and down , and how that heat is distributed is at the heart of the complex subject known as climate science .
Technical Note
More on this on a later post , but as many physicists will point out , taking the average temperature around the world is a little odd .
That might seem strange – how else can you see whether the world is warming ???
As a thought experiment , if you have 5 places to measure temperature , nicely distributed , the average temperature ,
T av = T 1 + T 2 + T 3 + T 4 + T 5 .
But it ’s not really meaningful .
T 1 might be measured in a big lake – and water stores a lot of energy per unit volume .
T 2 might be measured on a big piece of plastic and be storing almost no energy .
Adding up these different numbers and dividing by the number of measurements is not really a useful number .
Sure if you keep calculating this same average it kind of gives you a clue where things are headed .
But it could be misleading .
The piece of plastic might go up 10 °C and the lake might go down 5 °C so the average has gone up .
But the total heat in the system will have gone down .
Two more useful methods would be :
Sum up the energy actually stored - as Trenberth does in his paper – but it ’s tougher Average the fourth power of the temperatures – T4
Energy is radiated out as the fourth power of temperature , so averaging this value gives you more idea how much energy the system is radiating – as a proxy for the energy changes in the system .
It ’s easy to show that global average temperature can go up while total radiated energy is going down .
Just have the colder places heat up more than the warmer places cool down and T av increases while T4 av decreases .
More on this in another post .
My Secret Santa got me a book on graphic design , a mug ( which I very much needed ) with a mustache on it , and a CD with music ( The Playlist of Instant Attraction ) , a letter , and an Illustrator file with a design for something I requested a long time ago .
I really like the presents ( the mug is especially awesome ) .
Thanks immensely , ithackston !
1MW : The US media is very critical of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez .
He 's frequently denounced as " anti-American " , a " leftist strongman " , and a dictator .
Can you briefly summarize some of the positive social , economic and judicial changes for which Chavez is mainly responsible ?
Eva Golinger ---- The first and foremost important achievement during the Chávez administration is the 1999 Constitution , which , although not written nor decreed by Chávez himself , was created through his vision of change for Venezuela .
The 1999 Constitution was , in fact , drafted - written - by the people of Venezuela in one of the most participatory examples of nation building , and then was ratified through popular national referendum by 75 % of Venezuelans .
The 1999 Constitution is one of the most advanced in the world in the area of human rights .
It guarantees the rights to housing , education , healthcare , food , indigenous lands , languages , women 's rights , worker 's rights , living wages and a whole host of other rights that few other countries recognize on a national level .
My favorite right in the Venezuelan Constitution is the right to a dignified life .
That pretty much sums up all the others .
Laws to implement these rights began to surface in 2001 , with land reform , oil industry redistribution , tax laws and the creation of more than a dozen social programs - called missions - dedicated to addressing the basic needs of Venezuela 's poor majority .
In 2003 , the first missions were directed at education and healthcare .
Within two years , illiteracy was eradicated in the country and Venezuela was certified by UNESCO as a nation free of illiteracy .
This was done with the help of a successful Cuban literacy program called " Yo si puedo " ( Yes I can ) .
Further educational missions were created to provide free universal education from primary to doctoral levels throughout the country .
Today , Venezuela 's population is much more educated than before , and adults who previously had no high school education now are encouraged to not only go through a secondary school program , but also university and graduate school .
The healthcare program , called " Barrio Adentro " , has not only provided preventive healthcare to all Venezuelans - many who never had access to a doctor before - but also has guaranteed universal , free access to medical attention at the most advanced levels .
MRIs , heart surgery , lab work , cancer treatments , are all provided free of cost to anyone ( including foreigners ) in need .
Some of the most modern clinics , diagnostic treatment centers and hospitals have been built in the past five years under this program , placing Venezuela at the forefront of medical technology .
Other programs providing subsidized food and consumer products ( Mercal , Pdval ) , job training ( Mission Vuelvan Caras ) , subsidies to poor , single mothers ( Madres del Barrio ) , attention to indigents and drug addicts ( Mission Negra Hipolita ) have reduced extreme poverty by 50 % and raised Venezuelans standard of living and quality of life .
While nothing is perfect , these changes are extraordinary and have transformed Venezuela into a nation far different from what it looked like 10 years ago .
In fact , the most important achievement that Hugo Chávez himself is directly responsible for is the level of participation in the political process .
Today , millions of Venezuelans previously invisible and excluded are visible and included .
Those who were always marginalized and ignored in Venezuela by prior governments today have a voice , are seen and heard , and are actively participating in the building of a new economic , political and social model in their country .
2 MW--- On Monday , President Chavez threw a Venezuelan judge in jail on charges of abuse of power for freeing a high - profile banker .
Do you think he overstepped his authority as executive or violated the principle of separation of powers ?
What does this say about Chavez 's resolve to fight corruption ?
Eva Golinger ---- President Chávez did not put anyone in jail .
Venezuela has an Attorney General and an independent branch of government in charge of public prosecutions .
Chávez did publicly accuse the judge of corruption and violating the law because that judge overstepped her authority by releasing an individual charged with corruption and other criminal acts from detention , despite the fact that a previous court had not granted conditional freedom or bail to the suspect .
And , the judge released the suspect in a very irregular way , without the presence of the prosecutor , and through a back door .
The suspect then fled the country .
This is part of Venezuela 's fight against corruption .
Unfortunately - as in a lot of countries - corruption is deeply rooted in the culture .
The struggle to eradicate corruption is probably the most difficult of all and will probably not be achieved until new generations have grown up with different values and education .
In the meantime , the Chávez administration is trying hard to ensure that corrupt public officials pay the consequences .
That judge , for example , engaged in an act of corruption and abuse of authority by illegally releasing a suspect and therefore was charged by the Public Prosecutor 's office and will be tried .
It has nothing to do with what Chávez said or did n't say , it has to do with enforcing the law .
3 MW --- Why is the United States building military bases in Colombia ?
Do they pose a threat to Chavez or the Bolivarian Revolution ?
Eva Golinger ---- On October 30th , the US formally entered into an agreement with the Colombian government to allow US access to seven military bases in Colombia and unlimited use of Colombian territory for military operations .
The agreement itself is purported to be directed at counter - narcotics operations and counter - terrorism .
But a US Air Force document released earlier this year discussing the need for a stronger US military presence in Colombia revealed the true intentions behind the military agreement .
The document stated that the US military presence was necessary to combat the " constant threat from anti-US governments in the region " .
Clearly , that is a reference to Venezuela , and probably Bolivia , maybe Ecuador .
It 's no secret that Washington considers the Venezuelan government anti-US , though it 's not true .
Venezuela is anti-imperialist , but not anti-US .
The US Air Force document also stated that the Colombian bases would be used to engage in " full spectrum military operations " throughout South America , and even talked about surveillance , intelligence and reconnaisance missions , and improving the capacity of US forces to execute " expeditionary warfare " in Latin America .
Clearly , this is a threat to the peoples of Latin America and particularly those nations targeted , such as Venezuela .
Most people in the US do n't know about this military agreement , but it they did , they should question why their government , led by Nobel Peace Prize winner Barack Obama , is preparing for war in South America .
And , in the midst of an economic crisis with millions of people in the US losing jobs and homes , why are millions of dollars being spent on military bases in Colombia ?
The US Congress already approved $ 46 million for one of the bases in Colombia .
And surely more funds will be supplied in the future .
4 MW--- What is ALBA ?
Is it a viable alternative to the " free trade " blocs promoted by the US ?
Eva Golinger ---- The Bolivarian Alliance of the Americas - Trade Agreement for the People , is a regional agreement created five years ago between Venezuela and Cuba , and now has 9 members : Bolivia , Cuba , Ecuador , Honduras , Nicaragua , Venezuela , Antigua and Barbuda , St. Vincent and the Grenadines , and Dominica .
ALBA is a trade agreement based on integration , cooperation and solidarity , contrary to US trade agreements which are based on competition and exploitation .
It promotes a way of trading between nations that assures mutual benefits .
For example , Venezuela sells oil to Cuba and Cuba pays with services - doctors , educators and technological experts that help to improve Venezuela 's industries .
Venezuela sells oil to Nicaragua and Nicaragua pays with food products , agricultural technology and aide to build Venezuela 's own agricultural industry , which long ago was abandoned by prior governments only interested in the rich oil industry .
ALBA seeks to not just provide economic benefits to its member nations , but also social and cultural advances .
The idea is to find ways to help members develop and progress in all aspects of society .
ALBA recently created a new currency , the SUCRE , which will be used as a form of exchange between member nations , eliminating the US dollar as the standard for trade .
5 MW --- Are US NGO's and intelligence agents still trying to foment political instability in Venezuela or have those operations ceased since the failed coup ?
Eva Golinger ---- In fact , the funding of political groups in Venezuela , and others throughout Latin America that promote US agenda , has increased since the April 2002 coup against President Chávez .
Through two principal Department of State agencies , USAID and the National Endowment for Democracy ( NED ) , the US government has channeled more than $ 50 million to opposition groups in Venezuela since 2002 .
The USAID / NED budget to fund groups in Venezuela in 2010 is nearly $ 15 million , doubled from last year 's $ 7 million .
This is a state policy of Washington , which the Obama Administration plans to amp up .
They call it " democracy promotion " , but it 's really democracy subversion and destabilization .
Funding political groups favorable to Empire , equipping them with resources , strategizing to help formulate political platforms and campaigns - all geared towards regime change - is a new form of invasion , a silent invasion .
Through USAID and NED , and their " partner NGOs " and contractors , such as Freedom House , International Republican Institute , National Democratic Institute , Pan-American Development Foundation and Development Alternatives , Inc. , hundreds of political groups , parties and programs are presently being funded in Venezuela to promote regime change against the Chávez government .
US taxpayer dollars are being squandered on these efforts to overthrow a democratically elected government that simply is n't convenient for Washington .
Remember , Venezuela has 24 % of world oil reserves .
That 's a lot !
6 MW--- How hard has Venezuela been hit by the economic crisis ?
Do the people understand Wall Street 's role in the meltdown ?
Eva Golinger ---- Actually , the Chávez government has taken important steps to shelter Venezuela from the financial crisis .
People here in Venezuela absolutely understand Wall Street 's role in the crisis and know that the US capitalist - consumerist system is principally responsible for causing the financial crisis , but also the climate crisis that the world is facing .
The Venezuelan government took preventive steps against the financial crisis , such as withdrawing Venezuela 's reserves from US banks two years ago , creating cushion funds to ensure social programs would not be cut and diversifying Venezuela 's oil clientele so as not to be dependent solely on US clients .
Recently , several banks have been nationalized by the Venezuelan government and others have been liquidated .
But this was more due to the mismanagement and internal corruption within those banks .
The Venezuelan government reacted quickly to take over the banks and guarantee customers ' savings would not be lost .
In fact , it 's the first time in Venezuela 's history that no customers have lost any of their money during a bank liquidation or takeover .
This is part of the Chávez Administration 's policy of prioritizing social needs over economic gain .
7 MW --- Here 's an excerpt from a special weekend report by Bloomberg News :
" Americans have grown gloomier about both the economy and the nation ’s direction over the past three months even as the U.S. shows signs of moving from recession to recovery .
Almost half the people now feel less financially secure than when President Barack Obama took office in January ... Fewer than 1 in 3 Americans think the economy will improve in the next six months ....
Only 32 percent of poll respondents believe the country is headed in the right direction , down from 40 percent who said so in September . " ( Bloomberg )
The frustration and disillusionment with the US political / economic system has never been greater in my lifetime .
Do you think people in the United States are ready for their own Bolivarian Revolution and steps towards a more progressive , socialistic model of government ?
Eva Golinger ---- The rise of Barack Obama neutralized a growing sentiment for profound change inside the US .
Hopefully , the slowdown in US activism will only be temporary .
South of the border , there is tremendous change taking place .
New social , political and economic models are being built by popular grassroots movements in Venezuela , Bolivia and other Latin American nations that seek economic and social justice .
I believe strongly that models in process , like the Bolivarian Revolution , provide inspiration and hope to those in the US and around the world that alternatives to US capitalism do exist and can be successful .
The US has a rich history of revolution .
There are many groups inside the US dedicated to building a better , more humanist system .
Unity and a collective vision are essential aspects of building a strong movement capable of moving forward .
Every nation has its moment in history .
This is the time of Latin America .
But there is great hope that the people of the US will soon unite with their brothers and sisters south of the border to bring down Empire and help build a true world community based on social and economic justice for all .
Bio .--- Eva Golinger , winner of the International Award for Journalism in Mexico ( 2009 ) , named “ La Novia de Venezuela ” by President Hugo Chávez , is a Venezuelan - American attorney from New York , living in Caracas , Venezuela since 2005 and author of the best - selling book , “ The Chávez Code : Cracking US Intervention in Venezuela ” ( 2006 Olive Branch Press ) .

Paramount and MTV Films announced today that they ’ve greenlit the 3rd installment of JACKASS in “ eye- popping 3D ” for release on October 15 , 2010 .
It begins shooting in late January with Dickhouse Production ’s Jeff Tremaine directing yet again and producing alongside Spike Jonze and Johnny Knoxville .
Said the star in the statement , “ We ’re going to take the same 3D technology James Cameron used in AVATAR and stick it up Steve O ’s butt .
We ’re taking stupid to a whole new dimension . ”
( His mother must be so proud … )
I love how the studio announcement boasts about how foul the franchise is .
It pointed out that 2002 ’s Jackass : The Movie earned more than more than $ 64 million and was heralded as “ a disgusting , repulsive , grotesque spectacle , but also hilarious and provocative .
God help me , thumbs up ” by critic Richard Roeper .
2006 Jackass : Number
Two earned over $ 72 million and was described by The New York Times as being “ debased , infantile and reckless in the extreme , this compendium of body bravado and malfunction makes for some of the most fearless , liberated and cathartic comedy in modern movies ” .
SALE OF CREEDS 1
Zeus .
Hermes .
Several Dealers .
Creeds .
Zeus .
Now get those benches straight there , and make the place fit to be seen .
Bring up the lots , one of you , and put them in line .
Give them a rub up first , though ; we must have them looking their best , to attract bidders .
Hermes , you can declare the sale - room open , and a welcome to all comers .
-- For Sale !
A varied assortment of Live Creeds .
Tenets of every description .-- Cash on delivery ; or credit allowed on suitable security .
Hermes .
Here they come , swarming in .
No time to lose ; we must not keep them waiting .
Zeus .
Well , let us begin .
Her .
What are we to put up first ?
2
Zeus .
The Ionic fellow , with the long hair .
He seems a showy piece of goods .
Her .
Step up , Pythagoreanism , and show yourself .
Zeus .
Go ahead .
Her .
Now here is a creed of the first water .
Who bids for this handsome article ?
What gentleman says Superhumanity ?
Harmony of the Universe !
Transmigration of souls !
Who bids ?
First Dealer .
He looks all right .
And what can he do ?
p. 191
Her .
Magic , music , arithmetic , geometry , astronomy , jugglery .
Prophecy in all its branches .
3 First D. Can I ask him some questions ?
Her .
Ask away , and welcome .
First D. Where do you come from ?
Py. Samos .
First D. Where did you get your schooling ?
Py .
From the sophists in Egypt .
First D. If I buy you , what will you teach me ?
Py. Nothing .
I will remind you .
First D. Remind me ?
Py .
But first I shall have to cleanse your soul of its filth .
First D. Well , suppose the cleansing process complete .
How is the reminding done ?
Py .
We shall begin with a long course of silent contemplation .
Not a word to be spoken for five years .
First D. You would have been just the creed for Croesus 's son !
But I have a tongue in my head ; I have no ambition to be a statue .
And after the five years ' silence ?
Py .
You will study music and geometry .
First D. A charming recipe !
The way to be wise : learn the guitar .
4 Py . Next you will learn to count .
First D. I can do that already .
Py .
Let me hear you .
First D. One , two , three , four , --
Py .
There you are , you see .
Four ( as you call it ) is ten .
Four the perfect triangle .
Four the oath of our school .
First D. Now by Four , most potent Four !-- higher and holier mysteries than these I never heard .
Py .
Then you will learn of Earth , Air , Fire , and Water ; their action , their movement , their shapes .
First D. Have Fire and Air and Water shapes ?
p. 192
Py. Clearly .
That cannot move which lacks shape and form
You will also find that God is a number ; an intelligence ; a harmony .
First D. You surprise me .
Py .
More than this , you have to learn that you yourself are 5 not the person you appear to be .
First D. What , I am some one else , not the I who am speaking to you ?
Py .
You are that you now : but you have formerly inhabited another body , and borne another name .
And in course of time you will change once more .
First D. Why then I shall be immortal , and take one shape after another ?
But enough of this .
And now what is your diet ?
6
Py .
Of living things I eat none .
All else I eat , except beans .
First D. And why no beans ?
Do you dislike them ?
Py. No .
But they are sacred things .
Their nature is a mystery .
Consider them first in their generative aspect ; take a green one and peel it , and you will see what I mean .
Again , boil one and expose it to moonlight for a proper number of nights , and you have -- blood .
What is more , the Athenians use beans to vote with .
First D. Admirable !
A very feast of reason .
Now just strip , and let me see what you are like .
Bless me , here is a creed with a golden thigh !
He is no mortal , he is a God .
I must have him at any price .
What do you start him at ?
Her .
Forty pounds .
First D. He is mine for forty pounds .
Zeus .
Take the gentleman 's name and address .
Her .
He must come from Italy , I should think ; Croton or Tarentum , or one of the Greek towns in those parts .
But he is not the only buyer .
Some three hundred of them have clubbed together .
p. 193
Zeus .
They are welcome to him .
Now up with the next .
7 Her . What about yonder grubby Pontian 1 ?
Zeus .
Yes , he will do .
Her .
You there with the wallet and cloak ; come along , walk round the room .
Lot No. 2 . A most sturdy and valiant creed , free - born .
What offers ?
Second D. Hullo , Mr. Auctioneer , are you going to sell a free man ?
Her .
That was the idea .
Second D. Take care , he may have you up for kidnapping .
This might be matter for the Areopagus .
Her .
Oh , he would as soon be sold as not .
He feels just as free as ever .
Second D. But what is one to do with such a dirty fellow ?
He is a pitiable sight .
One might put him to dig perhaps , or to carry water .
Her .
That he can do and more .
Set him to guard your house , and you will find him better than any watch - dog .
-- They call him Dog for short .
Second D. Where does he come from ?
and what is his method ?
Her .
He can best tell you that himself .
Second D. I do n't like his looks .
He will probably snarl if I go near him , or take a snap at me , for all I know .
See how he lifts his stick , and scowls ; an awkward - looking customer !
Her .
Do n't be afraid .
He is quite tame .
8 Second D.
Tell me , good fellow , where do you come from ?
Dio. Everywhere .
Second D. What does that mean ?
Dio .
It means that I am a citizen of the world .
Second D. And your model ?
Dio. Heracles .
p. 194
Second D.
Then why no lion 's - skin ?
You have the orthodox club .
Dio .
My cloak is my lion 's - skin .
Like Heracles , I live in a state of warfare , and my enemy is Pleasure ; but unlike him I am a volunteer .
My purpose is to purify humanity .
Second D. A noble purpose .
Now what do I understand to be your strong subject ?
What is your profession ?
Dio .
The liberation of humanity , and the treatment of the passions .
In short , I am the prophet of Truth and Candour .
Second D. Well , prophet ; and if I buy you , how shall you 9 handle my case ?
Dio .
I shall commence operations by stripping off yours superfluities , putting you into fustian , and leaving you closeted with Necessity .
Then I shall give you a course of hard labour .
You will sleep on the ground , drink water , and fill your belly as best you can .
Have you money ?
Take my advice and throw it into the sea .
With wife and children and country you will not concern yourself ; there will be no more of that nonsense .
You will exchange your present home for a sepulchre , a ruin , or a tub .
What with lupines and close - written tomes , your knapsack will never be empty ; and you will vote yourself happier than any king .
Nor will you esteem it any inconvenience , if a flogging or a turn of the rack should fall to your lot .
Second D. How !
Am I a tortoise , a lobster , that I should be flogged and feel it not ?
Dio .
You will take your cue from Hippolytus ; mutates mutandis .
Second D. How so ?
Dio .
' The heart may burn , the tongue knows nought thereof ' 1 . 10
p. 195
[ paragraph continues ]
Above all , be bold , be impudent ; distribute your abuse impartially to king and commoner .
They will admire your spirit .
You will talk the Cynic jargon with the true Cynic snarl , scowling as you walk , and walking as one should who scowls ; an epitome of brutality .
Away with modesty , good - nature , and forbearance .
Wipe the blush from your cheek for ever .
Your hunting - ground will be the crowded city .
You will live alone in its midst , holding communion with none , admitting neither friend nor guest ; for such would undermine your power .
Scruple not to perform the deeds of darkness in broad daylight : select your love - adventures with a view to the public entertainment : and finally , when the fancy takes you , swallow a raw cuttle - fish , and die .
Such are the delights of Cynicism .
11 Second D. Oh , vile creed !
Monstrous creed !
Avaunt !
Dio .
But look you , it is all so easy ; it is within every man 's reach .
No education is necessary , no nonsensical argumentation .
I offer you a short cut to Glory .
You may be the merest clown -- cobbler , fishmonger , carpenter , money - changer ; yet there is nothing to prevent your becoming famous .
Given brass and boldness , you have only to learn to wag your tongue with dexterity .
Second D. All this is of no use to me .
But I might make a sailor or a gardener of you at a pinch ; that is , if you are to be had cheap .
Three - pence is the most I can give .
Her .
He is yours , to have and to hold .
And good riddance to the brawling foul - mouthed bully .
He is a slanderer by wholesale .
12 Zeus .
Now for the Cyrenaic , the crowned and purple - robed .
Her .
Attend please , gentlemen all .
A most valuable article , this , and calls for a long purse .
Look at him .
A sweet thing in creeds .
A creed for a king .
Has any gentleman a use for the Lap of Luxury ?
Who bids ?
Third D. Come and tell me what you know .
If you are a practical creed , I will have you .
p. 196
Her .
Please not to worry him with questions , sir .
He is drunk , and cannot answer ; his tongue plays him tricks , as you see .
Third D. And who in his senses would buy such an abandoned reprobate ?
How he smells of scent !
And how he slips and staggers about !
Well , you must speak for him , Hermes .
What can he do ?
What is his line ?
Her .
Well , for any gentleman who is not strait - laced , who loves a pretty girl , a bottle , and a jolly companion , he is the very thing .
He is also a past master in gastronomy , and a connoisseur in voluptuousness generally .
He was educated at Athens , and has served royalty in Sicily 1 , where he had a very good character .
Here are his principles in a nutshell :
Think the worst of things : make the most of things : get all possible pleasure out of things .
Third D. You must look for wealthier purchasers .
My purse is not equal to such a festive creed .
Her .
Zeus , this lot seems likely to remain on our hands .
Zeus .
Put it aside , and up with another .
Stay , take the pair 13 from Abdera and Ephesus ; the creeds of Smiles and Tears .
They shall make one lot .
Her .
Come forward , you two .
Lot No. 4 . A superlative pair .
The smartest brace of creeds on our catalogue .
Fourth D. Zeus !
What a difference is here !
One of them does nothing but laugh , and the other might be at a funeral ; he is all tears .
-- You there !
what is the joke ?
Democr .
You ask ?
You and your affairs are all one vast joke .
Fourth D. So !
You laugh at us ?
Our business is a toy ?
Democr .
It is .
There is no taking it seriously .
All is vanity .
Mere interchange of atoms in an infinite void .
Fourth D. Your vanity is infinite , if you like .
Stop that laughing , you rascal .
-- And you , my poor fellow , what are you crying for ?
I must see what I can make of you .
14
p. 197
Heracl .
I am thinking , friend , upon human affairs ; and well may I weep and lament , for the doom of all is sealed .
Hence my compassion and my sorrow .
For the present , I think not of it ; but the future !-- the future is all bitterness .
Conflagration and destruction of the world .
I weep to think that nothing abides .
All things are whirled together in confusion .
Pleasure and pain , knowledge and ignorance , great and small ; up and down they go , the playthings of Time .
Fourth D. And what is Time ?
Heracl .
A child ; and plays at draughts and blindman 's - bluff .
Fourth D. And men ?
Heracl .
Are mortal Gods .
Fourth D. And Gods ?
Heracl .
Immortal men .
Fourth D. So !
Conundrums , fellow ?
Nuts to crack ?
You are a very oracle for obscurity .
Heracl .
Your affairs do not interest me .
Fourth D. No one will be fool enough to bid for you at that rate .
Heracl .
Young and old , him that bids and him that bids not , a murrain seize you all !
Fourth D. A sad case .
He will be melancholy mad before long .
Neither of these is the creed for my money .
Her .
No one bids .
Zeus .
Next lot .
15 Her. The Athenian there ?
Old Chatterbox ?
Zeus .
By all means .
Her .
Come forward !-- A good sensible creed this .
Who buys Holiness ?
Fifth D. Let me see .
What are you good for ?
Soc .
I teach the art of love .
Fifth D. A likely bargain for me !
I want a tutor for my young Adonis .
Soc .
And could he have a better ?
The love I teach is of
p. 198
the spirit , not of the flesh .
Under my roof , be sure , a boy will come to no harm .
Fifth D. Very unconvincing that .
A teacher of the art of love , and never meddle with anything but the spirit ?
Never use the opportunities your office gives you ?
Soc. Now by Dog and Plane - tree , it is as I say !
16
Fifth D. Heracles !
What strange Gods are these ?
Soc .
Why , the Dog is a God , I suppose ?
Is not Anubis made much of in Egypt ?
Is there not a Dog-star in Heaven , and a Cerberus in the lower world ?
Fifth D. Quite so .
My mistake .
Now what is your manner 17 of life ?
Soc .
I live in a city of my own building ; I make my own laws , and have a novel constitution of my own .
Fifth D. I should like to hear some of your statutes .
Soc .
You shall hear the greatest of them all .
No woman shall be restricted to one husband .
Every man who likes is her husband .
Fifth D. What !
Then the laws of adultery are clean swept away ?
Soc .
I should think they were !
and a world of hair - splitting with them .
Fifth D. And what do you do with the handsome boys ?
Soc .
Their kisses are the reward of merit , of noble and spirited actions .
Fifth D. Unparalleled generosity !-- And now , what are the 18 main features of your philosophy ?
Soc. Ideas and types of things .
All things that you see , the earth and all that is upon it , the sea , the sky , -- each has its counterpart in the invisible world .
Fifth D. And where are they ?
Soc. Nowhere .
Were they anywhere , they were not what they are .
p. 199
Fifth D. I see no signs of these ' types ' of yours .
Soc .
Of course not ; because you are spiritually blind .
I see the counterparts of all things ; an invisible you , an invisible me ; everything is in duplicate .
Fifth D. Come , such a shrewd and lynx - eyed creed is worth a bid .
Let me see .
What do you want for him ?
Her .
Five hundred .
Fifth D. Done with you .
Only I must settle the bill another day .
19 Her .
What name ?
Fifth D. Dion ; of Syracuse .
Her .
Take him , and much good may he do you .
Now I want Epicureanism .
Who offers for Epicureanism ?
He is a disciple of the laughing creed and the drunken creed , whom we were offering just now .
But he has one extra accomplishment - - impiety .
For the rest , a dainty , lickerish creed .
Sixth D. What price ?
Her .
Eight pounds .
Sixth D. Here you are .
By the way , you might let me know what he likes to eat .
Her .
Anything sweet .
Anything with honey in it .
Dried figs are his favourite dish .
Sixth D. That is all right .
We will get in a supply of Carian fig - cakes .
20 Zeus .
Call the next lot .
Stoicism ; the creed of the sorrowful countenance , the close - cropped creed .
Her .
Ah yes , several customers , I fancy , are on the look - out for him .
Virtue incarnate !
The very quintessence of creeds !
Who is for universal monopoly ?
Seventh D. How are we to understand that ?
Her .
Why , here is monopoly of wisdom , monopoly of beauty , monopoly of courage , monopoly of justice .
Sole king , sole orator , sole legislator , sole millionaire .
p. 200
Seventh D. And I suppose sole cook , sole tanner , sole carpenter , and all that ?
Her. Presumably .
Seventh D. Regard me as your purchaser , good fellow , and 21 tell me all about yourself .
I dare say you think it rather hard to be sold for a slave ?
Chrys .
Not at all .
These things are beyond our control .
And what is beyond our control is indifferent .
Seventh D. I do n't see how you make that out .
Chrys .
What !
Have you yet to learn that of indifferentia some are praeposita and others rejecta ?
Seventh D. Still I do n't quite see .
Chrys .
No ; how should you ?
You are not familiar with our terms .
You lack the comprehensio visi .
The earnest student of logic knows this and more than this .
He understands the nature of subject , predicate , and contingent , and the distinctions between them .
Seventh D. Now in Wisdom 's name , tell me , pray , what is a predicate ?
what is a contingent ?
There is a ring about those words that takes my fancy .
Chrys .
With all my heart .
A man lame in one foot knocks that foot accidentally against a stone , and gets a cut .
Now the man is subject to lameness ; which is the predicate .
And the cut is a contingency .
Seventh D. Oh , subtle !
What else can you tell me ?
22
Chrys .
I have verbal involutions , for the better hampering , crippling , and muzzling of my antagonists .
This is performed by the use of the far - famed syllogism .
Seventh D. Syllogism !
I warrant him a tough customer .
Chrys .
Take a case .
You have a child ?
Seventh D. Well , and what if I have ?
Chrys .
A crocodile catches him as he wanders along the bank of a river , and promises to restore him to you , if you will first
p. 201
guess correctly whether he means to restore him or not .
Which are you going to say ?
Seventh D. A difficult question .
I do n't know which way I should get him back soonest .
In Heaven 's name , answer for me , and save the child before he is eaten up .
Chrys .
Ha , ha .
I will teach you far other things than that .
Seventh D. For instance ?
Chrys .
There is the ' Reaper . '
There is the ' Rightful Owner . '
Better still , there is the ' Electra ' and the ' Man in the Hood . '
Seventh D. Who was he ?
and who was Electra ?
Chrys .
She was the Electra , the daughter of Agamemnon , to whom the same thing was known and unknown at the same time .
She knew that Orestes was her brother : yet when he stood before her she did not know ( until he revealed himself ) that her brother was Orestes .
As to the Man in the Hood , he will surprise you considerably .
Answer me now : do you know your own father ?
Seventh D. Yes .
Chrys .
Well now , if I present to you a man in a hood , shall you know him ?
eh ?
Seventh D. Of course not .
23 Chrys .
Well , but the Man in the Hood is your father .
You do n't know the Man in the Hood .
Therefore you do n't know your own father .
Seventh D. Why , no .
But if I take his hood off , I shall get at the facts .
Now tell me , what is the end of your philosophy ?
What happens when you reach the goal of virtue ?
Chrys .
In regard to things external , health , wealth , and the like , I am then all that Nature intended me to be .
But there is much previous toil to be undergone .
You will first sharpen your eyes on minute manuscripts , amass commentaries , and get your bellyful of outlandish terms .
Last but not least , it is forbidden to be wise without repeated doses of hellebore .
p. 202
Seventh D. All this is exalted and magnanimous to a degree .
But what am I to think when I find that you are also the creed of cent - per-cent , the creed of the usurer ?
Has he swallowed his hellebore ?
is he made perfect in virtue ?
Chrys .
Assuredly .
On none but the wise man does usury sit well .
Consider .
His is the art of putting two and two together , and usury is the art of putting interest together .
The two are evidently connected , and one as much as the other is the prerogative of the true believer ; who , not content , like common men , with simple interest , will also take interest upon interest .
For interest , as you are probably aware , is of two kinds .
There is simple interest , and there is its offspring , compound interest .
Hear Syllogism on the subject .
' If I take simple interest , I shall also take compound .
But I shall take simple interest : therefore I shall take compound .'
Seventh D. And the same applies to the fees you take from 24 your youthful pupils ?
None but the true believer sells virtue for a fee ?
Chrys .
Quite right .
I take the fee in my pupil 's interest , not because I want it .
The world is made up of diffusion and accumulation .
I accordingly practise my pupil in the former , and myself in the latter .
Seventh D. But it ought to be the other way .
The pupil ought to accumulate , and you , ' sole millionaire , ' ought to diffuse .
Chrys .
Ha !
you jest with me ?
Beware of the shaft of insoluble syllogism .
Seventh D. What harm can that do ?
Chrys .
It cripples ; it ties the tongue , and turns the brain .
25 Nay , I have but to will it , and you are stone this instant .
Seventh D. Stone !
You are no Perseus , friend ?
Chrys .
See here .
A stone is a body ?
Seventh D. Yes .
Chrys .
Well , and an animal is a body ?
p. 203
Seventh D. Yes .
Chrys .
And you are an animal ?
Seventh D. I suppose I am .
Chrys .
Therefore you are a body .
Therefore a stone .
Seventh D. Mercy , in Heaven 's name !
Unstone me , and let me be flesh as heretofore .
Chrys .
That is soon done .
Back with you into flesh !
Thus :
Is every body animate ?
Seventh D. No .
Chrys .
Is a stone animate ?
Seventh D. No .
Chrys .
Now , you are a body ?
Seventh D. Yes .
Chrys .
And an animate body ?
Seventh D. Yes .
Chrys .
Then being animate , you can not be a stone .
Seventh D. Ah ! thank you , thank you .
I was beginning to feel my limbs growing numb and solidifying like Niobe's .
Oh , I must have you .
What 's to pay ?
Her .
Fifty pounds .
Seventh D. Here it is .
Her .
Are you sole purchaser ?
Seventh D. Not I .
All these gentlemen here are going shares .
Her .
A fine strapping lot of fellows , and will do the ' Reaper ' credit .
26 Zeus .
Do n't waste time .
Next lot , -- the Peripatetic !
Her .
Now , my beauty , now , Affluence !
Gentlemen , if you want Wisdom for your money , here is a creed that comprises all knowledge .
Eighth D. What is he like ?
Her .
He is temperate , good - natured , easy to get on with ; and his strong point is , that he is twins .
p. 204
Eighth D. How can that be ?
Her .
Why , he is one creed outside , and another inside .
So remember , if you buy him , one of him is called Esoteric , and the other Exoteric .
Eighth D. And what has he to say for himself ?
Her .
He has to say that there are three kinds of good : spiritual , corporeal , circumstantial .
Eighth D. There 's something a man can understand .
How much is he ?
Her . Eighty pounds .
Eighth D. Eighty pounds is a long price .
Her .
Not at all , my dear sir , not at all .

Why IronPython ?
IronPython is an excellent addition to the .NET Framework , providing Python developers with the power of the .NET framework .
Existing .NET developers can also use IronPython as a fast and expressive scripting language for embedding , testing , or writing a new application from scratch .
The CLR is a great platform for creating programming languages , and the DLR makes it all the better for dynamic languages .
Also , the .NET framework ( base class library , presentation foundation , etc. ) gives developers an amazing amount of functionality and power .

Chinese farmers are “ growing houses ” instead of growing food
What is this picture about ?
Why is this poor woman being blocked out by hundreds of Chengguan ( City Urban Administrative and Law Enforcements ) ?
[ Netease ]
On December 17 , Wuhan City organized over 800 law enforcement officers to forcefully demolish nearly 40,000 square meters of illegal buildings that are near the Wuhan City to Huangshi City railway construction site .
The phenomenon of local famers rushing to “ grow houses ” is very common .
What does “ growing houses ” mean ?
It is yet another unique phenomenon in China , formed in the last couple of years of amazingly fast social and economic development .
When the entire nation is being modernized , countless high raises are erected every year , cities are expending and county ’s infrastructures are also expending in order to support the economic growth .
Highways , railroads and airports ; bridges , tunnels and subway systems … are being built in almost every corner in China .
This means some of the existing residential and farmland in the rural areas might be in the blue - print of a governments ’ huge project .
The government pays for development compensations for every house they have to tear down in order to build the development project .
This motivated the farmers to build houses everywhere in the rural area of China .
When some of them are permitted by the government but most are illegally and cheaply built .
They even start to build houses in the agricultural fields therefore people say the farmers are “ growing houses ” instead of growing food .
Why do the farmers “ grow houses ” ?
The answer is simple , to gain enormous profits when the time comes .
They admit the fact that they are “ gambling on development ” .
Usually development compensations are standardized , the standard amount of the compensation is usually more than double of the cost of these “ planted houses ” , especially if they are building them cheaply and not up to the standards .
Sounds easy enough ?
But you may ask if these houses are built illegally , should n’t the government have the rights to tear them down without giving them any compensation ?
Do n’t they regulate these illegal houses ?
The answer is yes , government ’s development compensation is only for legal buildings , for those illegal buildings , not only there is no compensation , the houses will be forcefully demolished also .
Then why are the farmers still doing this ?
If it was really that simple , then this trend of “ growing houses ” would not exist today .
The farmers use persistence and the weaknesses within the local government to win the battles .
They are persistent when local government tries to stop them from building illegal houses .
The government sometimes would send people to forcefully tear down the illegal houses .
However , some of these houses have no foundations and the brick walls are put together with just mud .
When the house gets tore down , residents would rebuilt it overnight , the house comes back the next day again .
It ’s like cutting weeds , they just grow back .
If an illegal house is not torn down in time , after three , five years , new house becomes old house .
Not only it already has become the farmers ’ home , it also develops into a community of illegal houses .
This community is quite prosperous .
It is not only populated with great number of residents but it also develops streets , markets and so on facilities .
Now facing the highly populated and economically active community , demolition of this place is not so easy anymore .
In order to avoid further complications compensations must be given for large scale of eviction and demolition .
Then it becomes like a de facto marriage that the government tacitly approves .
The farmers also use strategies like build first and get the permits later or build on top of the existing legal buildings .
They build residencies in their vegetable fields ; build a second floor or even a third floor on top of their existing one story house as long as the foundation can hold it .
And of course , there is always corruption , in some of the towns even the local government officials themselves are growing houses .
Obtaining building permits can be achieved through “ connections ” and bribery .
Not all farmers can strike rich from “ growing houses ” , that ’s why they call it “ gambling on the government development ” .
If it is a gamble , that means sometimes the farmers lose , that is when the government is determined enough to send an “ army ” to deal with the farmers to demolish the illegal buildings .
Now back to the news :
On December 17 , Wuhan City organized over 800 law enforcement officers to forcefully demolish nearly 40,000 square meters of illegal buildings that are near the Wuhan City to Huangshi City railway construction site .
The phenomenon of local famers rushing to “ grow houses ” is very common .
Protesting the forceful demolition , a farmer woman was blocked out by hundreds Chengguan ( city management ) from her illegally built building .
Farmers took out wheels from a truck in attempt to stop the demolition team .
The “ planted ” houses are glued together with mud .
Experts pointed out that farmers “ grow houses ” are directly motivated by profits , however a deeper reason was because they fear for their lives after losing their land to the government project .
In order to stop the root of the “ growing houses ” problem , the government should make efforts to find employment opportunities for the farmers and include them into the new city lives .
Farmers are picking wood from demolished buildings .
Over tens of thousands square meters of houses were demolished
Related news from Zhengwu :
Recently , a reader reported that someone is building houses in the dark at night near the outskirts of Wuhan train station .
Yesterday 6 pm , reporter secretly visited the site and found the construction was in full swing .
Around 30 workers were transporting bricks .
Some of them were working on the wall .
There were 7 - 8 newly built houses near the construction site .
Factory worker Mr. Wang who had lived here for over 30 years said , here is very close to the Wuhan train station .
There were rumors said it will be developed by the government .
The villagers all started to “ grow ” houses after hearing this news .
Just one night , hundreds of square meters of vegetable field turned into a row of houses .
These houses were made of red bricks , the windows and doors were made of recycled waste materials .
They were very poorly built and could not be lived in .
The reporter saw in a distance , two workers are working on the ongoing tunnel construction outside of the Wuhan railway station .

We ’re still trying to figure out just how intertwined Lou Engle , the self - professed “ visionary ” behind prayer group TheCall ( one word ! ) , is with leading conservatives inside the GOP , but Alternet spotted him with the Family Research Council and Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich , so there ’s some connection — at least as much as Barack Obama has with Rick Warren .
But Engle , who supported Prop 8 and asked followers to pray and fast to defeat marriage in Maine , now finds himself in the Absolute Nutjob category , a special place usually reserved for folks like Patricia and Kelvin Mckinney , who perform exorcisms on gay demons .
Fitting , then , that Engle also knows a thing or two about gay demons , as he reveals in this Sept. 25 , 2007 , sermon .
They are appearing in newspapers and on posters alongside major roads in Britain .
There is Barack Obama 's head , on it superimposed the image of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , Iran 's leader .
The slogan reads : " Who poses the greatest nuclear threat ? "
For many people the answer is clear – after all , Obama has n't so far called for Israel to " vanish from the page of time " .
But for the Kremlin the Obama image is the latest step in an ambitious attempt to create a new post -Soviet global propaganda empire .
Two decades after the demise of Pravda , the Kremlin 's 24 - hour English language TV channel , Russia Today ( RT ) , is launching its first major advertising blitz across the UK .
Dubbed North Korean TV by its detractors , the channel , available on satellite and cable TV , gives an unashamedly pro-Vladimir Putin view of the world , and says it seeks to correct the " biased " western view offered by the BBC and CNN .
" What we see as black and white might not be black and white .
It 's making people question their own stereotypes , " Margarita Simonyan , RT 's 29 - year - old editor - in - chief , explains .
" We offer an alternative to the mainstream view . "
Certainly , RT 's advertising campaign is provocatively contrarian – casting doubt , for example , on climate change in the week of the Copenhagen summit , and comparing a British bobby to a tattooed football hooligan .
But is anyone actually going to watch it ?
" I do n't believe in unbiased views .
Of course we take a pro-Russian position .
The BBC says it openly promotes British values , " notes Simonyan .
Next year the Russian government will spend $ 1.4 billion ( £ 866 m ) on international propaganda – more than on fighting unemployment .
In January RT launches a Spanish service aimed at Latin America , a region of growing Kremlin geopolitical interest ; RT already broadcasts in Arabic .
The Kremlin has trebled the budgets for its main state news agencies , Ria Novosti and ITAR - Tass , despite Russia 's deep economic crisis ; there is a paid - for monthly supplement in the Daily Telegraph , Russia Now , and a revival of the Soviet - era radio station Voice of Russia .
The Kremlin employs two major PR agencies , Ketchum and GPlus , and in London uses Portland PR .
And then there are the angry bloggers – a shadowy army of Russian nationalists who are active on western newspaper websites , including the Guardian 's Comment is free site .
Anyone who dares to criticise Russia 's leaders , or point out some of the country 's deficiencies , is immediately branded a CIA spy or worse .
" They [ the Kremlin ] are coming to realise that information matters and that control of information internationally matters even more , " says Evgeny Morozov , a Yahoo !
fellow at Georgetown University 's institute for the study of diplomacy .
Morozov , who is writing a book on how authoritarian regimes are exploiting the internet , said the Kremlin was taking a more " aggressive " approach following last year 's war in Georgia .
The Russian government lost the PR battle over the conflict , at least initially , and failed to get its message across to shivering European consumers during two recent gas wars with Ukraine .
" They have realised it is only by controlling what gets printed in the international media they can advance their hard policy agenda items , " Morozov says .
Current Russian aims , he says , include thwarting Nato expansion and winning recognition for Moscow 's puppet states of South Ossetia and Abkhazia .
Morozov takes a dim view of RT – pointing out that it has a predilection for fringe guests and discredited conspiracy theorists .
" For me it 's a comedy channel .
You watch it to see how badly mangled Russia 's attempts at influencing foreign opinion are , " he suggests , adding that Russia has moved from Pravda to Pravda 2.0 .
Insiders at RT praise the professionalism of the staff .
It includes several British journalists and newsreaders .
" Generally people there are pretty talented , " one former employee said .
" But nobody is under any illusions as to what it 's all about .
There is such a lack of objectivity .
It 's like North Korea TV . "
RT enjoys more freedom than Russia 's domestic state - controlled channels .
But while there is sometimes broad - based criticism of the regime , there is an unspoken understanding that you cannot criticise Putin , the ex-employee said .
Other sources familiar with the Kremlin's PR strategy say that there is a lingering misunderstanding among top Russian officials as to how the western world works .
" They think it 's enough to have good PR and that this is sufficient to act as a counterweight to the bad publicity caused by events in Russia , " one said .
" Obviously it is n't . "
Asked how the Kremlin could improve its image in the west , he replied : " They could stop beating up opposition demonstrators for a start . "
In the long run , however , the PR strategy may pay off .
More and more newspapers are closing their bureaus in Moscow , and the number of foreign correspondents covering Russia is dwindling .
Some observers believe that over the next decade the Kremlin 's growing internet presence is likely to spill over into the western mainstream .
Simonyan insists that RT is not mere government propaganda .
Instead , she says , western reporters often have such " strong opinions " that they " fail to see the truth " about life in Russia .
" We do n't believe we live in a country where everything is bad , " she says , speaking from RT 's gleaming offices in central Moscow .
Wall screens broadcast RT , the BBC and CNN ; clocks show the time in Moscow , New York and London ; journalists sit in an open - plan office amid a soft hum of Russian and English .
" We live in a country where some things are getting better and some things are getting worse , " Simonyan suggests .
She is unrepentant about RT 's relentlessly pro-Russian coverage of last year 's Georgian war – focusing on the suffering of the South Ossetians but completely ignoring the Russian bombing of Georgian civilians .
Given the bad blood between London and Moscow , and the unresolved feud over the murder of Alexander Litvinenko , does she really think RT can find an audience in Britain ?
" People will be surprised at how much there is in the world that they have n't been told before , " she says .

Spectacular satellite images suggest that Mars was warm enough to sustain lakes three billion years ago , a period that was previously thought to be too cold and arid to sustain water on the surface , according to research published in the journal Geology .
The research , by a team from Imperial College London and University College London ( UCL ) , suggests that during the Hesperian Epoch , approximately 3 billion years ago , Mars had lakes made of melted ice , each around 20 km wide , along parts of the equator .
Earlier research had suggested that Mars had a warm and wet early history but that between 4 billion and 3.8 billion years ago , before the Hesperian Epoch , the planet lost most of its atmosphere and became cold and dry .
In the new study , the researchers analysed detailed images from NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , which is currently circling the red planet , and concluded that there were later episodes where Mars experienced warm and wet periods .
The researchers say that there may have been increased volcanic activity , meteorite impacts or shifts in Mars ' orbit during this period to warm Mars ' atmosphere enough to melt the ice .
This would have created gases that thickened the atmosphere for a temporary period , trapping more sunlight and making it warm enough for liquid water to be sustained .
Lead author of the study , Dr Nicholas Warner , from the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London , says :
" Most of the research on Mars has focussed on its early history and the recent past .
Scientists had largely overlooked the Hesperian Epoch as it was thought that Mars was then a frozen wasteland .
Excitingly , our study now shows that this middle period in Mars ' history was much more dynamic than we previously thought . "
The researchers used the images from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter to analyse several flat - floored depressions located above Ares Vallis , which is a giant gorge that runs 2,000 km across the equator of Mars .
Scientists have previously been unable to explain how these depressions formed , but believed that the depressions may have been created by a process known as sublimation , where ice changes directly from its solid state into a gas without becoming liquid water .
The loss of ice would have created cavities between the soil particles , which would have caused the ground to collapse into a depression .
advertisement
In the new study , the researchers analysed the depressions and discovered a series of small sinuous channels that connected them together .
The researchers say these channels could only be formed by running water , and not by ice turning directly into gas .
The scientists were able to lend further weight to their conclusions by comparing the Mars images to images of thermokarst landscapes that are found on Earth today , in places such as Siberia and Alaska .
Thermokarst landscapes are areas where permafrost is melting , creating lakes that are interconnected by the same type of drainage channels found on Mars .
The team believe the melting ice would have created lakes and that a rise in water levels may have caused some of the lakes to burst their banks , which enabled water to carve a pathway through the frozen ground from the higher lakes and drain into the lower lying lakes , creating permanent channels between them .
Professor Jan-Peter Muller , Mullard Space Science Laboratory , Department of Space Climate Physics at University College London , was responsible for mapping the 3D shape of the surface of Mars .
He adds :
" We can now model the 3D shape of Mars ' surface down to sub - metre resolution , at least as good as any commercial satellite orbiting the Earth .
This allows us to test our hypotheses in a much more rigorous manner than ever before . "
The researchers determined the age of the lakes by counting crater impacts , a method originally developed by NASA scientists to determine the age of geological features on the moon .
More craters around a geological feature indicate that an area is older than a region with fewer meteorite impacts .
In the study , the scientists counted more than 35,000 crater impacts in the region around the lakes , and determined that the lakes formed approximately three billion years ago .
The scientists are unsure how long the warm and wet periods lasted during the Hesperian epoch or how long the lakes sustained liquid water in them .
advertisement
The researchers say their study may have implications for astrobiologists who are looking for evidence of life on Mars .
The team say these lake beds indicate regions on the planet where it could have been warm and wet , potentially creating habitats that may have once been suitable for microbial life .
The team say these areas may be good targets for future robotic missions .
The next step will see the team extend their survey to other areas along the equator of Mars so that they can ascertain how widespread these lakes were during the Hesperian Epoch .
The team will focus their surveys on a region at the mouth of Ares Vallis called Chryse Planitia , where preliminary surveys of satellite images have suggested that this area may have also supported lakes .
The study was a collaboration between the Department of Earth Science and Engineering at Imperial College London and Space Physics at UCL .
The project was funded by the Science and Technology Facilities Council , the Royal Society and the Leverhulme Trust .

BERLIN –
The celebrations of the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall started off well enough – former President George H.W. Bush , ex-Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev , and former West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl gathered in front of nearly 2,000 dignitaries in Berlin last week to celebrate their role in bringing about the end of the Cold War .
It was a happy affair , with Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev exchanging laughs and smiles as they recalled Nov. 9 , 1989 , a day that all agreed advanced world freedom and ended the looming threat of the cold war .
But in the week since , as leaders have gathered here to mark the Mauerfall anniversary , agreement has been tough to come by and fractures between allies have shown themselves in what has been billed as an event to celebrate unity .
One of these signs was the absence of US President Barack Obama as other heads of state gathered underneath the Brandenburg Gate Monday night to make a symbolic journey from the old East Berlin to West Berlin .
They group then toppled a wall of dominoes along the path of the Berlin Wall .
But President Obama sent Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is his place , infuriating many Germans , as the US president is beloved here .
Some in Berlin asked if this snub indicated that the alliance between the US and Germans is strained .
The events of the last week have fueled German concerns .
As German Chancellor Angela Merkel was flying back from Washington after meeting with Obama and giving a speech to US Congress , General Motors , whose board was appointed by the Obama administration , canceled a deal that would have saved German automotive jobs .
Ms. Merkel was stunned and angry .
The White House did n’t comment .
Then Ms. Clinton , speaking last night at a dinner here , took what many perceive as a shot at Germany for failing to commit additional troops to the war effort in Afghanistan .
The wall celebrations should be “ should be a call to action , not just a commemoration of past actions , ” she said .
“ ' That call should spur us to continue our cooperation and look for new ways that we can meet the challenges that freedom faces now …
We owe it to ourselves and to those who yearn for the same freedoms that are enjoyed and even taken for granted in Berlin today . ”
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has also found himself in bit of a political pickle following some claims he made about being in Berlin on Nov. 9 , 1989 .
Soon after Mr. Sarkozy posted a picture that shows him picking at the wall with a hammer on what he claims is Nov. 9 , journalists and former French officials immediately began questioning his story .
This is hardly a scandal , but it drew attention away from a major diplomatic event .
It also comes as Sarkozy is trying to build closer ties with Germany , despite Merkel ’s resistance .
Meanwhile Russian President Dmitry Medvedev , representing the direct descendant of the defeated Soviet Union , has said and done all the right things .
He praised the collapse of the wall and offered praise for Germany ’s advances in the past two decades .
Of course , Mr. Medvedev has reason be happy with Germany ’s progress ; Berlin and Moscow rely on one another as key economic partners .
Who would have thought it 20 years ago ?
Small cell lung cancer has a poor prognosis Scientists have identified a drug which may offer hope to patients with a particularly lethal form of lung cancer .
The drug eliminated small cell lung cancer tumours in 50 % of mice , and blocked the cells ' ability to resist standard chemotherapy treatment .
The Imperial College London team now hope to test it in patients with an inoperable form of the disease .
Their study appears in the journal Cancer Research .
We hope to take this drug into clinical trials next year
Professor Michael Seckl
Imperial College London Lung cancer is a major killer , and the small cell version of the disease , which makes up 20 % of total cases , has a particularly poor prognosis .
Only around 3 % of patients survive for five years .
The cancer spreads quickly , so surgery is not often an option .
Chemotherapy , sometimes supplemented with radiotherapy , often reduces the size of tumours , but they usually grow back rapidly , and become resistant to further treatment .
A growth hormone called FGF - 2 appears to speed division of the cancer cells , and to trigger a survival mechanism which makes them resistant to chemotherapy .
PD173074 blocks FGF - 2 from attaching to tumour cells .
The researchers say it could potentially be taken as a pill , rather than fed into the body via a drip .
It was originally developed in 1998 to stop blood vessels from forming around tumours .
Further trials needed Researcher Professor Michael Seckl said : " We urgently need to develop new treatments for this disease .
" We hope to take this drug , or a similar drug that also stops FGF - 2 from working , into clinical trials next year to see if it is a successful treatment for lung cancer in humans . "
Initially , the new drug was tested on cells taken from human tumours .
It stopped the cells proliferating , and neutralised their defences , allowing them to be killed off with standard chemotherapy .
Follow - up tests on mice showed the drug was effective against tumour cells , both in isolation , and in combination with the standard chemotherapy agent , cisplatin .
Dr Joanna Owens , of the charity Cancer Research UK , said : " It is encouraging to see potential new drugs for lung cancer in the initial stages of development .
" The early results from this study are impressive but we will need to wait for the results of clinical trials before we will know if the drugs could work for patients . "

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) - Iraq , emerging from the shadows of war , expects to boost its oil output to rival the level of top producer Saudi Arabia after awarding some of its most attractive oilfields to global energy companies this week .
At the end of a two - day bidding round for 10 oil contracts -- the second auction since the 2003 U.S. invasion -- Baghdad had received pledges from oil firms to boost output by 4.765 million barrels per day , almost double Iraq ’s current output .
If all deals from the two auctions and others on the table are added to national production , Iraq would have output capacity of 12 million barrels per day in six years , overtaking Russia and challenging top exporter Saudi ’s 12.5 million bpd , Oil Minister Hussain al - Shahristani said .
“ Iraq is a powerhouse in the region and it will regain its place , its rightful place , ” Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari told Reuters in Bahrain after the auction concluded .
Iraq has leveraged its huge and cheap - to - pump reserves to lure the world ’s top energy firms into deals at knock - down rates .
Some 30 international oil companies braved the threat of violence and attacks to come to Iraq , putting aside security concerns just days after car bombs killed 112 people in Baghdad .
Oil majors from the United States appeared conspicuously uninterested in the fields on offer in the second round , confounding expectations that they might end up with the lion ’s share of Iraq ’s oil sector as a result of the U.S. - led war .
Security may still be an issue .
The series of car bombs on Tuesday was the third major assault on government buildings in Baghdad in four months and a bloody reminder of the fragile security as Iraq heads into a general election in March .
Thousands of Iraqi soldiers and police were deployed in the streets of the capital to protect the auction and army helicopters buzzed overhead .
Oil executives travelled in convoys of armoured SUVs with armed guards .
“ The terrorists tried to send a message to the companies through the bombings ... that Iraq is unstable and investment will be overshadowed by risks , ” Shahristani told state television on Friday night .
“ But this message was not delivered and never deceived them .
They came and submitted competitive offers that surprised the global oil industry . ”

Amid fierce competition , a group led by Russian energy giant Lukoil won a deal to develop the West Qurna Phase Two oilfield , which with 12.9 billion barrels of reserves is one of the world ’s largest untapped supergiant fields .
Supergiants have reserves of 5 billion barrels or more .

Lukoil ’s win was made sweeter by the fact it had lobbied unsuccessfully since the 2003 U.S. invasion to revive a Saddam Hussein - era contract for the field .
The 12.6 billion barrel Majnoon field , another supergiant , went to a partnership of Royal Dutch Shell and Malaysia ’s Petronas on Friday .
Only two of five fields offered on the first day were initially awarded as firms steered clear of more dangerous or troublesome areas , including the supergiant East Baghdad field partly under Baghdad ’s Sadr City slum , and northern fields where violence is still rife .
The Qayara field in the north near the violent city of Mosul , which was not awarded on Friday , was won by Angolan state - oil firm Sonangol on Saturday .
Sonangol ceded to Iraq ’s demand that it more than halve its fee to $ 5 a barrel .
The African oil giant also won the nearby Najmah field .
DOOR OPEN ONLY FOR A WHILE
For most other fields , companies undercut what the government was willing to pay .
The big fields were awarded at lower fees than deals from the first bid round as energy firms upped their game to avoid returning home empty - handed from a rare opportunity to access cheap Middle East reserves .
“ They were astonishingly low figures .
But 2009 will be remembered as the year that Iraq opened its door to the international oil companies and then shut it .
It ’s 10 fields and that ’s it , ” said a senior oil executive .
“ So it ’s strategic for the oil firms , either you are here or you are n’t and this is the chance . ”
Lukoil and Statoil agreed the lowest fee in their deal for West Qurna Phase Two .
The firms pledged to boost output to 1.8 million bpd for just $ 1.15 per barrel .
Shell and Petronas won Majnoon with a fee of $ 1.39 per barrel and a pledge to raise output to 1.8 million bpd , more than double what Iraq expected .
France ’s Total had negotiated for that field under Saddam Hussein and was among the front runners to win it .
Halfaya , with 4.1 billion barrels of reserves , was consolation for Total .
CNPC , Total and Petronas won it with a fee of $ 1.40 per barrel and a plateau production target of 535,000 bpd .
Petronas also won the small Gharaf field with Japan ’s Japex .
Russia ’s Gazprom won the Badrah field .
Shahristani told companies that missed out not to worry as Iraq had “ scores ” of fields , including supergiants , left to offer , he said .

How to triple your salary by selling out to industry
Does Dr. Gerberding suffer from an " ethics deficiency ? "
Did the CDC cover Merck 's back ?
Who else is on the Merck team at the CDC ?
( Natural News )
You 've heard it before , how the pharmaceutical industry has a giant " revolving door " through which corporations and government agencies frequently exchange key employees .
That reality was driven home in a huge way today when news broke that Dr. Julie Gerberding , who headed the CDC from 2002 through 2009 , landed a top job with Merck , one of the largest drug companies in the world .
Her job there ?
She 's the new president of How convenient .
That means the former head of the CDC was very likely cultivating a relationship with Merck all these years , and now comes the big payoff : Heading up a $ 5 billion division that sells cervical cancer vaccines ( like Gardasil ) , chickenpox vaccines and of course H1N1 swine flu vaccines , too .
So what 's the problem with all this ?
The problem is that .
When they are , it createsbetween Big Government and Big Pharma .
We 've already seen this with the government - led push for swine flu vaccines that are manufactured ( and sold ) by drug companies like Merck .
You might even say that the CDC already functions as the marketing division of the pharmaceutical industry .
It was the CDC that pushed so hard for swine flu vaccines , even amid the obvious realization that swine flu was no more dangerous than seasonal flu .
To this day , the CDC still has n't bothered to recommend vitamin D for the prevention of either seasonal flu or swine flu .
It remains heavily invested in the lucrative vaccine approach -- an approach that just happens to financially benefit the very corporations that are hiring ex-CDC employees like Dr. Gerberding .
Getting a job offer from Big Pharma , by the way , is one of the most - desired career paths for many CDC employees ( and FDA workers , for that matter ) .
It 's easy to accomplish it , too : Just operate in your government position as if you were a Big Pharma lackey .
If you produce enough good business for the drug industry , sooner or later they 'll offer you a lucrative position that doubles or triples your government salary ( or even better ) .
Now , I do n't want to lump all CDC employees in this same pathetic group , because there are indeed a great many bright , honest scientists working at the CDC who do excellent work tracking pandemics and trying to save lives .
They are overshadowed , however , by those ambitious profit seekers who see their CDC job as merely a stepping stone for a far better - paying job at a major drug companies .
And by any measure , Dr. Gerberding just cashed in big .
Her actual salary at Merck has n't been publicly released yet , but given that she 's heading up a $ 5 billion vaccine industry , it 's probably not chump change .
I 'd bet she 's now making at least ten times the salary of the President of the United States ( and probably a lot more ) .
So now , Dr. Gerberding 's new job involves the incessant promotion of yet more vaccines -- a job not very different from the one she held at the CDC , come to think of it .
More vaccines for more diseases afflicting more people ... it 's just another day at Merck , where the world is never so healthy that it does n't need one more mandatory vaccine .
As a special bonus to Merck in all this , Dr. Gerberding has a wealth of contacts not merely throughout the CDC , but also at the World Health Organization .
When you 're the former head of the CDC , the top public health officials of the world are literally just one call away .
But starting today , that call is a commercial , corporate - sponsored call , not a public health call .
There 's a huge difference .
My question in all this is whether Dr. Gerberding has any real ethics when it comes to issues like vaccines and public health .
If she does have such ethics , why would she accept a job with a company that has been engaged in outright scientific fraud ?
( https://www.naturalnews.com/027582_Merck_Viox...
Why would she go to work for a company that maintained a " hit list " of doctors to attack and " neutralize ? "
This is true -- it came out in recent court documents ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027116_Merck_doct... ) .
Why would she take a job with a company that has a pattern of threatening doctors who speak out against its drugs ?
( https://www.naturalnews.com/026420_Merck_Viox...
Why would she be okay with the idea of working for a company that commits scientific fraud by hiding documents showing its drugs to be dangerous ?
( https://www.naturalnews.com/024072_Zetia_Merc...
Why would she feel okay about working for a company that dumps chemicals and vaccine waste products into the public water system ?
( https://www.naturalnews.com/023124_water_Merc...
Why would she want to collect a paycheck from a company that has been caught hiring ghost writers to pen " independent " science papers submitted to science journals , when they were actually crafted by Merck ? ( https://www.naturalnews.com/023052_Merck_scie...
Why would she feel comfortable representing a company that committed blatant scientific fraud with its Vytorin cholesterol drug study ?
( https://www.naturalnews.com/022485_scientific...
Maybe Dr. Gerberding is fine with all this .
Maybe she has really " flexible " ethics .
Or maybe she suffers from an " ethics deficiency " -- an epidemic disease for which Merck apparently has no vaccine at all .
In any case , she 's now allied herself with a company engaged in so many repeated acts of fraud that in my opinion all its executives should be arrested and prosecuted for crimes against humanity .
Those executives will now include Dr. Gerberding , it seems .
You might say , though , that she has n't done anything yet for Merck .
But check this out :
As a previous NaturalNews story explains , when a fourteen - year - old girl named Jessica died following a cervical cancer vaccine injection ( made by Merck ) , the CDC covered for Merck and pointed the finger at the girl 's birth control pills .
Care to guess who was heading the CDC at the time of this maneuver ?
Dr. Julie Gerberding , now a top Merck executive .
You pat my back and I 'll pat yours .
For years , under the lead of Dr. Gerberding , the CDC has maintained a rather bizarre position that .
This is explained in a Dallas Morning News article ( http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/... ) , among other places .
The CDC , in other words , has been running defense for Merck for many years , downplaying vaccine side effects and insisting that Merck 's vaccines are safe .
Now that the president of Merck 's vaccine division and the former chief of the CDC are one and the same , it brings up obvious questions of whether there was some level of ongoing collusion between the CDC and Merck and how deeply Dr. Gerberding might have been involved .
Some of the word games played by Dr. Gerberding demonstrate amazing Clintonian - like speech patterns designed to deflect blame from Merck 's vaccines .
Listen to this exchange where Dr. Gerberding indirectly admits that ( or as she says , " Autism - like symptoms , " which is exactly the same thing , as the symptoms define the disease in the first place ) .
Watch it yourself in this segment on YouTube -- this is aon the link between vaccines and autism : That the CDC 's chief would be offered one of the very top jobs at Merck now makes me wonder just how deep the culture of collusion between Merck and the CDC really goes .
How many other CDC employees are in line for future job offers from Merck -- and what might they do in order to win those jobs ?
There 's a solution to all this , of course :
Pass a law that bans employees of the CDC , FDA , FTC , EPA or USDA from ever working for pharmaceutical companies .
The people who run the regulatory agencies and public health offices should never be allowed to leap into employment at the very same companies they were once regulating .
There 's just too much risk of cross-contamination of influence , which is why we have the corruption and collusion problems we 're seeing today with the FDA , FTC and CDC , all of which seem to be operating as marketing extensions of the pharmaceutical industry .
As long as the revolving door remains wide open between Big Pharma and Big Government , there will be a strong tendency towards corporate collusion that betrays the people whom government is supposed to serve .
Instead of our government serving the People , in other words , it increasingly exists to serve the interests of Big Business .
And big business does n't get much bigger than Big Pharma .
After all , inventing fictitious disease , creating pandemic panics , then selling questionable patented drugs to gullible consumers is a lucrative business model .
And now the official job of the former head of the CDC is to make sure it all stays that way .
So roll up your sleeves , folks :
There 's a vaccine with your name on it , and Dr. Gerberding is here to make sure Merck sticks it to ya .
A wing of al - Qaeda has claimed it was behind the attempt to blow up a Christmas Day transatlantic flight , saying it was in retaliation for U.S. attacks in Yemen .
On an Islamist website , Al - Qaeda in Arabian Peninsula , which is based in Saudi Arabia and Yemen , named 23 - year - old Nigerian Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab and said he co-ordinated with members of the group .
They also said the explosives he carried on the Northwest Airlines flight were made by al - Qaeda members .
The group said it provided the Nigerian suspect with a " technically advanced device , " but it failed to detonate because of a technical fault , Reuters reported .
Yemeni forces , helped by U.S. intelligence , carried out two airstrikes against al - Qaeda operatives in the country this month .
The second one was a day before the attempted bombing of the plane as it was about to land in Detroit .
Meanwhile , Britain 's home secretary confirmed Monday that Abdulmutallab had been added to one of Britain ’s security watch lists .
Alan Johnson said Abdulmutallab was added to the list after his visa application was denied 14 months ago , when officials suspected the school he applied to was not genuine .
Abdulmutallab received a degree in engineering and business finance from University College London last year and later applied to re-enter Britain to study at another institution .
Johnson said there are different security watch lists .
The list Abdulmutallab was on meant he could transit through Britain but not enter the country .
" If you are on our watch list , then you do not come into this country , " Johnson said .
" You can come through this country if you are in transit to another country , but you cannot come into this country . "
The U.S. government said Abdulmutallab had also been on a broad watch list that includes more than 500,000 names after his father alerted embassy officials in Nigeria in November about his son 's religious beliefs .
But U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano has said there was not enough information to put him on a no - fly list , which contains the names of people deemed to be a threat to the security of aircraft or air travellers .
Abdulmutallab is being held in a federal prison in Michigan after suffering burns in the alleged bombing attempt .
He is accused of trying to light an explosive device on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 from Amsterdam on Friday .
U.S. authorities have said he claimed to be carrying out an attack on orders from al - Qaeda .
His family released a statement Monday saying the suspect had cut off contact with his relatives .
" From very early childhood , Farouk , to the best of parental monitoring , had never shown any attitude , conduct or association that would give concern , " the family 's statement read .
" We , along with the whole world , are thankful to almighty God that there were no lives lost in the incident .
May God continue to protect us all , amen . "
Six days before Thanksgiving , a 21 - year - old Air Force enlistee , Tre Francesco Porfirio , was pulling duty in Afghanistan when three high - velocity bullets tore through his pancreas — the fist - size organ that produces insulin and enzymes we need to extract fuel from the food we eat .
With an injury like that , Porfirio's prognosis was very difficult :
If he could survive long enough to get to a specialized transplant center , he could perhaps get a transplant of islet cells from a deceased donor and take anti-rejection drugs for the rest of his life .
Or doctors could remove his pancreas , leaving him completely dependent on insulin .
Either way , an early death from complications of Type 1 diabetes was highly likely .
But doctors who improvised a way to help the serviceman quickly made Porfirio a pioneer in the technique of islet - cell transplantation instead .
On Tuesday , Dr. Camillo Ricordi , director of the University of Miami's Diabetes Research Institute , told the story of a long - distance islet cell transplant — a still - experimental procedure considered to be the best hope for treating those , such as Type 1 diabetes patients , with a non-functioning pancreas .
The transplant involved flying Porfirio 's shattered pancreas — now removed — from an operating room at Walter Reed Army Medical Hospital in Washington to Ricordi 's specialized laboratory , more than 1,000 miles away , at the University of Miami's Miller School of Medicine .
There , on the night before Thanksgiving , the delicate islet cells of Porfirio's own pancreas were extracted and purified — a specialized operation performed at only a handful of transplant centers across the country .
Until now , if you were a patient who could n't make it in time to one of 15 cities with medical centers equipped to prepare islet cells for transplant , you were out of luck .
But physicians willing to try anything to help Porforio have shown that may no longer be true .
The stew of islet cells prepared at the University of Miami was sent back to Walter Reed .
There — under the supervision of Ricordi 's team in Coral Gables , Fla. , watching remotely — physicians carefully fed the purified cells through a tube into the airman 's liver .
Within days of the procedure , performed on Thanksgiving , Porfirio's islet cells did what all physicians hope they will do in such cases :
They began to produce insulin , effectively doing the work of the excised pancreas .
Porfirio is unusual also in that his islet cells came from his own pancreas , which , while in shreds , was not dead yet .
Most patients must rely on a deceased donor 's pancreas and must take anti-rejection drugs to ensure their immune system does n't attack the foreign cells .
The ability to use Porfirio's own islet cells for the transplant , while " very rare , " according to Ricordi , means he will not face rejection issues that make such transplants a lifelong challenge for recipients .
That remote transplant , said Ricordi in an interview , is a first : it could mean patients whose pancreas is destroyed by diabetes or trauma can be treated , potentially , anywhere in the country .
Having shown that islet cells can be prepared for transplantation remotely and returned in time to a waiting patient — and then , that physicians with minimal training in such transplants can be supervised in doing them —
Ricordi's team says that many more patients may gain access to the procedure .
Patients with chronic pancreatitis , an inflammation of the insulin - producing organ , may , with some fancy logistics , be able to get the treatment they need close to home .
And patients whose pancreas is compromised or destroyed by trauma can be treated where they are .

Authorities in the US have scooped up poisoned fish floating to the surface of a Chicago - area waterway in an operation designed to keep invasive Asian carp out of the Great Lakes and prevent an ecological disaster .
Illinois officials said a single Bighead carp , one of two prolific species of Asian carp viewed as a threat , had turned up in the huge fish kill that began overnight along 10 kilometres of the Chicago sanitary and ship canal south - west of the city .
Poison was dumped into the waterway so maintenance could be performed on an electrical barrier designed to keep the carp out of the Great Lakes .
The Asian carp was found 64 kilometres from Lake Michigan , the closest to the Great Lakes the species has been found , authorities said .
About 90 tonnes of dead fish are expected to be collected , weighed , inventoried , and dumped in a landfill over the next few days .
Most of the dead fish scooped up so far have been native carp and shad .
Silver carp and the Asian Bighead , which can grow to 1.5 metres and weigh more than 45 kilograms , have come to dominate sections of the Mississippi River and its tributaries .
Authorities fear that if the carp reach the Great Lakes , the largest fresh - water resource in the world , they could create an " ecological disaster " by consuming the bottom of the food chain and ruining the lakes ' $ US7 billion ( $ 7.6 billion ) fishery .
Since the 1990s , floods allowed the carp to escape into rivers from research facilities and commercial fish ponds in the South , where they were introduced to clean away weeds and other detritus .
The carp have multiplied and become a " nuisance species " , according to the US Fish and Wildlife Service .
Along some stretches of the Illinois River the carp make up 95 per cent of the biomass and they are considered poor for eating or as a game fish .
Silver carp , which leap into the air when disturbed by passing motorboats , have injured boaters .
Two electrical barriers in the canal were erected in 2002 and 2006 to shock any fish , particularly carp , that try to swim up the canal to Lake Michigan .
To allow time to complete the maintenance , more than 900 kilograms of the natural poison rotenone , that prevents fish gills from absorbing oxygen , was dumped into the canal .
The toxin , which is used as a broad - spectrum insecticide and pesticide , kills fish and freshwater snails but does not harm other animals .
It dissipates within two days , though authorities planned to introduce a neutralising agent to speed up the process .

Amatoya Reconnaissance and Suppression Vehicle - Click above for image gallery
Designer Liam Ferguson 's vision of how to fight fires almost makes us wish we were firemen – as long as we could have the keys to one of these .
The Amatoya is a site recon and light tanker vehicle designed with a philosophy much more military than civilian .
The seating position is like that of a AH - 1 Cobra gunship , with the co-pilot up and behind the driver .
The Amatoya is built on a monococque steel body , like armed forces MRAPs , insulated with NASA 's aerogel , and painted with " military grade sacrificial thermo ceramic intumescent paints .
" The Remotely Operated Suppression Cannon Outfit ( ROSCO ) can has a 2,200 - liter ( 581 gallons ) total water capacity , all the better for the fact that the crew members do n't need to leave the vehicle to employ it .
Nor should they have much problem getting to the fire , with absurd clearances all around , directional spotlights , and a thermal imaging camera .
The only weak point would appear to be the rubber tires , which would melt long before the Space - Shuttle - worthy body would .
Still , we 'd take one in a second .

He certainly has the common touch – Michael Portillo once described him as having " the charisma of Che Guevara " – and while his appeal is broadest among the Palestinian masses , he has crucially been able to win the support of Fatah 's increasingly influential younger members .
SANAA ( Reuters ) - A young Nigerian man charged with trying to blow up a U.S. plane on Christmas Day was not deeply religious when he arrived in Yemen in 2004 but evolved into a devoted follower of Islam , a former teacher said .
Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , 23 , stayed in Yemen for a year between 2004 to 2005 , before returning for another stay from August 4 to September 21 of last year , Yemeni officials have said .
A teacher at the Sana Institute for the Arabic Language , who taught Abdulmutallab during his time in Yemen , said he was “ closer to being secular ” when he first arrived in the country .
“ But during his visit last year , he was more committed to praying and Islam , ” the teacher said .
A fellow student who holds U.S. citizenship said Abdulmutallab had not exhibited any violent tendencies and a community leader in the neighborhood where the institute is located said he had been very friendly to cleaning staff , even offering them chocolates .
“ Nobody expected he would harm anyone , ” the student said .
Abdulmutallab was taken into custody after being overpowered by passengers and crew as the U.S. passenger jet approached Detroit on Christmas Day after taking off from Amsterdam .
Yemeni authorities have tightened entry - visa regulations for applicants looking to join Arabic language institutes , after the December 25 incident , a Yemeni security official said .
Foreigners of different nationalities have been known to travel to Yemen ’s language institutes , mainly in the capital Sanaa , to study Arabic .
The institute where Abdulmutallab studied teaches mostly American , Canadian and Malaysian students , who are either Muslims , students of Middle Eastern studies or researchers , the teacher said .
Authorities suspect Abdulmutallab moved to al Qaeda ’s main hideout in Yemen sometime between September of last year and December 7 , when he boarded a flight to Ethiopia , the security official said .
The official said Abdulmutallab ’s visa allowing him to stay in Yemen had expired when he left the country last month and that it was unclear why this had not prompted airport security to examine his case more closely .
The Nigerian youth , who had been studying for his masters degree in Dubai before returning to Yemen in August , comes from a wealthy family and is the son of a prominent former banker .
Nigerian officials said the suspect has been living outside Nigeria for a while and snuck back into the country on December 24 , before departing the same day .
It has been quite a while since the “ King of All Media , ” Howard Stern stole some headlines .
Stern will definitely create some buzz with his newest radio show contest .
Stern announced today that he will hold a $ 100,000 Tiger Woods Mistress Beauty Pageant on his radio show .
Could this turn out to be one of the biggest stories of 2010 or a failed attempt to ride out into the sunset after 30 + plus years of broadcasting ?
Stern casually mentioned the idea for this contest shortly before he left for his annual holiday break .
It looks like the prize amount dropped dramatically from his original plans of a seven - figure prize .
Longtime Stern advertiser Ashley Madison will be sponsoring the contest .
Stern did not reveal a date for the contest or a minimum requirement of entrants .
Stern teased the idea of celebrity judges including Tiger ’s wife Elin Nordegren but I ’d suspect the chances of that happening are slim and none with slim just leaving town .
I think the idea is brilliant but there is one major flaw at the outset .
The amount of the prize just shows how out of touch the show is with media in the new century .
A $ 100,000 prize may have sealed the deal in the 90s with a Bill Clinton Mistress Pageant , but that is chump change today .
For one , chances are that some of these women are being offered more just for an interview .
Two , CBS could sweep in here , make this a seven - figure prize , and steal the contest for one of its own shows with a dual radio and television broadcast .
Three , I would venture to guess that a few of these women will be offered more money for book and movie deals .
Are any of these women really going to subject themselves to the humiliation and criticism that comes along with a Stern Show Beauty Contest for $ 100,000 ?
Honestly , these girls could make this in a night playing online blackjack at home , and minus the shame .
Stern show producer and ace pitcher , Baba Booey reported on the show that he has been in touch with a new woman who claims to have had an affair with Tiger Woods who has yet to go public .
The show could go down this road and have four or five women who have n’t gone public , yet claim to have affairs .
The problem is , how would anyone verify any of them ?
Most of the women already revealed look to make good livings ( not all ) and after taxes would be looking at a prize that wo n’t change their life too much in 2010 .
Now ask them in 2015 when the publicity dies down and you could probably put this thing together for $ 10,000 .
This announcement comes as we head into the final two years of Stern ’s Sirius contract .
Stern started a five - year deal with the company in January 2006 .
Reportedly Stern ’s deal was for an estimated $ 500,000,000 which likely consisted of stock options and production costs .
This may tick off a lot of Stern fans , but in the end it has been a colossal failure .
The stock at Sirius tanked , the company merged with XM , and right now the future of the operation is very much up in the air .
Stern definitely did his part and brought millions of listeners with him , but I highly doubt those listeners put a dent into the costs of producing the Stern Show , which makes the deal a huge bomb for Sirius .
The Tiger Woods Mistress Beauty Pageant may get some initial buzz , but it is really hard to fathom the idea that Sirius will get any new listeners in the current economic climate off of this lame attempt at publicity .
Over $ 12 a month for radio ( which is well worth it as a five - year subscriber ) , is the first thing that will be eliminated from the unemployment budget and the last thing anyone is going to sign up for who is just coming out of debt with a new job .
In the end I think this is a fun idea , but the execution is just bad on several accounts .
I think the show should have waited until they had at least four written commitments before announcing the contest .
The money is n’t right , the timing is off , and the chances that Stern looks like a fool for not being able to pull this off are greater than us hearing a contest on the radio show .
Hey , I could announce a contest here on the blog but if nobody enters the contest does n’t happen and it is all for nothing .
In that case … CamelClutchBlog.com will be holding a $ 10 Tiger Woods Mistress Beauty Pageant .
Update : Apparently some people are getting their panties in a bunch about the comment I made about Stern ’s lack of success at Sirius .
I think it is interesting how so many people assume that I am taking a shot at Howard .
As a longtime Stern listener and fan ( attended the Morning Zoo funeral here in Philly ) , that was not my intent .
From my standpoint , I put the blame on Sirius for mismanaging their investment .
I will write a blog at a later date specifically on that topic , but I blame Sirius for blowing it and not Howard .
Howard can only do what he is paid to do which is entertain .
It is up to Sirius to go out and market him , not Howard .
Update # 2 – Howard Stern officially announced that the Tiger Woods Mistress Beauty Pageant will take place live on his show on March 10 .
Stay tuned !
Update # 3 – Jamie Jungers won the pageant today on the Howard Stern Show .
Jaimeee Grubs came in second .

Installing a security alarm or some other security system is a great way to ensure your office is protected from intruders and anyone else who may want to break in .
This can save you significant amounts of money , especially if you hold valuable stock or other items on your premises .
There are numerous other benefits associated with installing an office security system .
For example , it will help your staff feel safer – especially if you have people working night - shift or in a dodgy neighbourhood .
With this in mind , we ’ve outlined five of our top reasons why you should consider installing a security alarm system for your office .
They include :
It Will Encourage Customers to Trust You
Having a visibly obvious security system installed will not only protect your business from fire and theft but will also help customers trust you and your services .
A business that takes security seriously is much more likely to do things properly , as opposed to one that ’s secured with a padlock and heavy chain or something similar .
Additionally , people will be much more likely to trust you with their sensitive information if your premises are properly secured .
It Will Help Secure Your Stock and Other Valuables
Many businesses carry thousands of dollars worth of stock .
If you do n’t hold a lot of stock , the chances are that you use valuable electronic equipment .
Or , you may even have customer items that are awaiting repair or replacement .
Whatever the case , the chances are that you have a large number of valuable items on your premises , and having a reliable security system will help you protect these .

The group said it did not support or encourage Nazi ideology
A university in West Yorkshire is to investigate claims two students set up a Facebook group for a Nazi - inspired drinking game .
The Adolf Hitler Drinking Game involved laying out cards in a swastika shape and drinking the contents of a pint glass called the holocaust .
The game is thought to have been created by two students from the University of Huddersfield .
A university spokesman said the claims were being taken " very seriously " .
' Extremely disturbed '
The Facebook group described the game as " ball - busting " and leaving players " completely ruined beyond belief " .
The game 's rules included giving a Nazi salute and referring to a player as Mein Fuhrer .
A disclaimer on the page read : " This game , group and its creators in no way support , encourage or promote Adolf Hitler or the ideologies of the Nazi party " .
Professor Peter Slee , deputy vice - chancellor at the University of Huddersfield , said : " We are shocked to hear about this game , and extremely disturbed at the allegations that students at this university have been taking part in it .
" This is a highly unusual incident and the university prides itself on its multi-cultural , cohesive campus .
" We will be investigating these allegations , which we take very seriously , and will take appropriate action once these investigations are complete . "
According to sources familiar with Apple 's plans , the company will drop deployment support for its WebObjects web application server in Mac OS X Snow Leopard Server later this year .
WebObjects is Apple 's enterprise framework for developing web applications and the company 's Java web application server that deploys them .
Apple acquired the product when it bought NeXT in the final days of 1996 .
Originally priced at $ 50,000 per deployment license , Apple dramatically lowered the price of WebObjects to $ 699 in 2000 and then in 2005 bundled the software for free deployment with Mac OS X Server .
Later this year however , WebObjects will disappear entirely in the release of Snow Leopard Server , which sources say has scrubbed any mention of the deployment runtime .
While Apple 's efforts to sell WebObjects to third parties has waned , the company 's use of the technology progressively increased .
Apple was able to put WebObjects to work immediately in building a new build - to - order online store in 1997 just months after acquiring NeXT .
Since then , the company has used WebObjects to build the iTunes Store , its Dot Mac site , iTunes U , and iPhone App Store .
Apple 's use of WebObjects appears to have been pulled back in some areas on the MobileMe front , which is in the process of tearing down the old WebObjects - based Dot Mac Groups , Home Page , web mail , and iDisk features and replacing them in part with other technologies .
Signup for the MobileMe service is still done via https://secure.me.com/wo/WebObjects/Signup.woa, so it 's not as if Apple is retreating away from WebObjects across the board in its MobileMe unit .
Additionally , there 's no apparent plans in progress to scale back the company 's broad use of WebObjects in its online stores , iTunes , or the App Store , all of which have broken records in online retailing and have scaled impressively as the company experienced dramatic surges of growth .
Instead , it appears Apple is simply reserving WebObjects for its own use rather than continuing to try to sell it to an unappreciative audience that either prefers the immediacy of web development tools like Ruby on Rails , which Apple included with Leopard Server , or the familiarity of PHP and MySQL , which has long been a part of Mac OS X Server .
WebObjects Origins
When Apple acquired NeXT , it was interested primarily in its Unix - based NEXTSTEP operating system which the company subsequently adapted as the foundation of Mac OS X ; WebObjects was picked up by Apple for free , despite being the apex of NeXT 's focus at the time .
NeXT , founded by Steve Jobs in 1985 after his ouster from Apple , originally built state of the art hardware running an advanced set of development frameworks on top of Unix , resulting in a powerful computing system that was far ahead of its time .
While Jobs ' futuristic NeXT Cubes of the late 80s offered great performance value for their price in comparison to Unix workstations and high end Macs , there were no budget model offerings due to an agreement pressed by Apple that prevented NeXT from competing in the consumer market .
That forced NeXT into a tight niche that made its products popular only among higher education , research , investment houses and intelligence services , all of which appreciated its stability and performance over the cost savings afforded by lower end hardware .
NeXT eventually backed out of the hardware business in 1993 and began selling NEXTSTEP first as an operating system for standard Intel PCs and PA - RISC and SPARC workstations , then as a development layer that could run on top of Sun Solaris or Windows NT .
NeXT even created an open specification for its development frameworks called OpenStep in a partnership with Sun that attempted to make NeXT 's development and operating environment the standard for all computers .
After a series of failed partnerships involving IBM and HP ( who abandoned NeXT to work on a NeXT frameworks clone with Apple under the name of Taligent ) and then Sun ( which abandoned NeXT after attention began to swirl around Java ) , NeXT was left with impressive piles of technology that nobody seemed to want .
Microsoft had refused to develop for NEXTSTEP , with Bill Gates famously saying he'd rather " piss on it " than develop software for the platform .
Selling an operating system in competition with the Windows PC monopoly was becomingly clearly impossible , even for firms with far more resources than NeXT .
That reality led NeXT to apply its advanced development frameworks as a way to build web applications , resulting in WebObjects in early 1996 .
The web itself had been developed using NEXTSTEP by Tim Berners - Lee , who in 1990 wrote the first web server and browser on a NeXT computer at CERN .
Developing a way to expand simple web pages into dynamic , object - oriented applications appeared to be NeXT 's last hope for survival .
Jobs and WebObjects
In a February 1996 interview with Wired , Jobs announced , " The desktop computer industry is dead .
Innovation has virtually ceased .
Microsoft dominates with very little innovation .
That 's over .
Apple lost . "
Jobs said , " the desktop market has entered the dark ages , and it 's going to be in the dark ages for the next 10 years , or certainly for the rest of this decade .
It 's like when IBM drove a lot of innovation out of the computer industry before the microprocessor came along .
Eventually , Microsoft will crumble because of complacency , and maybe some new things will grow .
But until that happens , until there 's some fundamental technology shift , it 's just over .
" The most exciting things happening today are objects and the Web .
The Web is exciting for two reasons .
One , it 's ubiquitous .
There will be Web dial tone everywhere .
And anything that 's ubiquitous gets interesting .
Two , I do n't think Microsoft will figure out a way to own it .
There 's going to be a lot more innovation , and that will create a place where there is n't this dark cloud of dominance . "
In that interview , Jobs underlined three parts to the web : clients , servers and pipes .
" On the client side , " Jobs said , " there 's the browser software .
In the sense of making money , it does n't look like anybody is going to win on the browser software side , because it 's going to be free .
And then there 's the typical hardware .
It 's possible that some people could come out with some very interesting Web terminals and sell some hardware . "
It would be another decade before Jobs could unveil the iPhone as " a breakthrough Internet device . "
In terms of pipes , Jobs predicted huge growth in selling Internet access .
" As for the server market , companies like Sun are doing a nice business selling servers .
But with Web server software , no one company has more than a single - digit market share yet .
Netscape sells hardly any , because you can get free public - domain software and it's very good .
Some people say that it 's even better than what you can buy . "
It would be just a few years before Jobs would turn Apple into one of the largest distributors of the open source Apache web server .
" Our company , " Jobs said of NeXT , " decided that people are going to layer stuff above this very simple Web server to help others build Web applications , which is where the bottleneck is right now .
There 's some real opportunity there for making major contributions and a lot of money .
That 's what WebObjects is all about . "
Jobs later added that the web is " more than publishing .
It 's commerce .
People are going to stop going to a lot of stores .
And they 're going to buy stuff over the web . "
By the end of the year , the brand new WebObjects would reach version 3.0 and NeXT would be acquired by Apple .
Within the next year , WebObjects enabled Apple to revolutionize its online retail presence .
It would subsequently change how people buy music in iTunes , and then set the model for selling mobile software in the iPhone App Store .
WebObjects at Apple
In its first year at NeXT , WebObjects attracted high profile attention from a variety of large corporations from Disney to Dell , including AAA , the BBC , Chrysler , Deutche Bank , Ford , Nike , Nissan , Motorola , and Reebok .
Once owned by Apple however , corporate interest began to wane .
Dell , which had just developed its new WebObjects store in December 1996 , now scrambled to rid itself of WebObjects under the pressure of Microsoft , cobbling together a replacement built using Active Server Pages that launched in September 1997 , just days before Apple 's own WebObjects site went online in November .
Jobs unveiled the store by presented Michael Dell under a bullseye target , saying " we 're coming after you , buddy ! "
While WebObjects helped Apple to expand its online retail presence faster , embarrass competing music stores , and leave smartphone software rivals in the dust , the company has had a hard time selling the product to anyone else .
In his 1998 autobiography On The Firing Line , then CEO Gil Amelio wrote , " WebObjects looked to be clearly one of the jewels of the NeXT software .
It is going to factor importantly into the future .
I still can't figure out why it is n't getting more attention from the press . "
Without a real server operating system or any Mac server hardware to sell apart from its rebranded PowerMacs sold as Workgroup Servers , Apple decided to port WebObjects from Objective - C to Java in 2000 in order to enable servlet deployment by any Java server .
This was also intended to catch the wave of excitement surrounding Java and tap mainstream developers ' familiarity with the language .
WebObjects and Cocoa diverge
Apple also floated the idea of changing Mac OS X's Objective - C to read more like Java , but idea that sunk .
While WebObjects worked to become more mainstream in the enterprise , Mac OS X was retargeted to consumers , lopping off commonality it once shared with WebObjects , such as EOF database connectivity , which later reappeared in a desktop friendly but very different form in Tiger 's CoreData .
What would become Cocoa 's Foundation frameworks remained Objective - C , while WebObjects adopted a Java Foundation .
This left WebObjects familiar to both Java and Cocoa developers , but clearly in a unique middle ground between both .
In 2006 , Apple deprecated its WebObjects development tools along with its Cocoa - Java bridge that so few were using .
The latest version of Xcode no longer supports developing new WebObjects applications .
Instead , Apple recommends using WOLips , an open source suite of tools that plug into the Eclipse IDE and provide a better development environment for writing Java code than the company 's own Objective - C-centric Xcode .
Das hier ist einer der Beiträge , die ich gerne lesen würde , die aber keiner schreibt : Die Linke , weil ihr der Sachverstand fehlt , und die Braungelbe Brühe , weil sie es zwar wissen , aber es keinesfalls laut sagen können .
Es ist ziemlich klar erkennbar , warum die CSU die Mehrwertsteuer für Hotels gesenkt werden möchte - in Bayern liegt der Umsatz mit Reisenden direkt bei 25 Milliarden Euro , und daran hängen auch noch andere Wirtschaftszweige , Baugewerbe , Entsorgung , Landwirtschaft .
Der Einbruch bei den Übernachtungszahlen im letzten
Jahr tut natürlich weh , und die CSU war schon immer die erste Partei , die jeden Grundsatz über Bord warf , wenn es denn opportun erschien .
Und mit dem Hinweis , dass die Ösis ja auch weniger Steuern zahlen , kann man in Bayern durchaus Wahlen gewinnen - Hauptsache , die Troler haben den Schaden .
Aber die FDP ?
Die FDP behauptet von sich , gegen Subventionen zu sein .
Natürlich ist eine Steuersenkung für Hotels eine Subvention , und deshalb argumentiert die FDP mit der Marktwirtschaft , denn in anderen Ländern sei die Steuer auch niedriger , und so wäre der Wettbewerb verzerrt - da müsse man nachziehen .
Die logische Frage aber wäre : Wenn das so ist , warum macht man das nicht auch in anderen Bereichen ?
Warum senkt man nicht durchgehend die Mehrwertsteuer ?
Warum nur Hotels - und warum liegen gerade die der FDP so am Herzen ?
So viele FDP - wählende Hotelbesitzer , sollte man meinen , gibt es auch nicht .
Und da irrt man .
Es gibt sie , und es sind viele , und sie wählen häufig die Besserverdienendenpartei .
Denn das Hotelgewerbe wird längst nicht mehr von kleinen Pensionen und Mittelständlern betrieben .
Das grosse Geschäft läuft nach dem gleichen System wie alle anderen Transaktionen mit Geschäftsimmobilien ab .
Sprich , man hat einen Immobilienfonds , einen Vertrieb , Investoren und Objekte , die an Hotelbetreiber vermietet werden .
Solche Fonds gehen in aller Regel von einer positiven Geschäftsentwicklung aus : Die Rendite soll in den späteren Jahren nach hohen Anfangsverlusten steigen .
Ziemlich viel Krempel , den solche Fonds Mitte der Neunziger bis Anfang des Jahrzehnts entwickelt haben , hat die aktuelle Krise einfach nicht kommen sehen und entsprechend nicht eingeplant .
Kommen die Hotelbetreiber jetzt in Zahlungsengpässe , ist es aufgrund der enormen Kosten eines Betreiberwechsels ziemlich normal , dass die Betreiber Mietminderungen durchsetzen können - denn in der Krise ist es schwer , solche Immobilien wieder an den Mann zu bringen , wenn es durch die vielen derartig investierenden Fonds ohnehin schon einen übersättigten Markt gibt .
Niedrigere Mieten aber ändern nichts daran , dass die Fremdfinanzierung solcher Fonds weiterhin die üblichen Zinsen verlangt .
Die Einnahmen sinken , die Ausgaben bleiben gleich .
Oder , was in diesem Sektor angesichts der Neufinanzierung von abgelaufenen Krediten auch nicht selten ist : Nachdem durch die Miete eines derartigen Objekts auch der Immobilienwert berechnet wird , kann es sein , dass bei der versuchten neuen Kreditaufnahme die benötigte Summe höher als der Wert der Immobilie ist .
Dann müssen die Anleger mitunter nachschiessen .
Oder der Fonds muss in den schlechten Markt hinein Immobilien verkaufen , um liquide Mittel zu haben .
Wie man es dreht und wendet : Die Banken sind bei diesem Spiel mit ihren Sicherheiten auf der besseren Seite .
Aber die Investoren sind im Feuer .
Schenkt man den Hotelbetreibers aber eine Milliarde , können die grösseren Häuser noch eine Weile länger ihren Verpflichtungen für die Fonds nachkommen .
Dann gibt es zwar keine billigeren Übernachtungspreise , aber die FDP sorgt dafür , dass das besserverdienende Klientel mit entsprechenden , momentan hochriskant gewordenen Investitionen hoffen kann , dass ihre Geldanlagen bis zum Ende der Krise durchhalten .
An dieser Milliarde für die Hotelbetreiber hängt eben nicht nur der Job der osteuropäischen Putzfrau , sondern auch viele Millarden , die bei den Fonds in den Büchern stehen .
Aber nur solange die Zahlungen kommen .
Wenn nicht , verlieren die Anleger wirklich viel Geld .
Und vielleicht auch das Vertrauen in die FDP .
In a blown - up image from a scanning tunneling microscope , it looks just like an endless sheet of chicken wire : a simple flat sheet made up of a lattice of hexagons .
But this nanoscopic material called graphene , first generally acknowledged to exist just five years ago , turns out to have a variety of unique , and potentially very useful , characteristics — ones several MIT researchers are actively trying to better understand and turn into real - world applications .
Graphene , a form of the element carbon that is just a single atom thick , had been identified as a theoretical possibility as early as 1947 .
Even as Institute Professor Mildred Dresselhaus , her physicist husband Gene , and others were working in the 1960s with multiple layers of graphene , many scientists were saying that such an ultra - thin sheet of matter could never be found or even made .
" It was very controversial ; there were many people who were skeptical , " about the research , she says .
Now that it has been found , with widely publicized results published in 2004 by researchers at the University of Manchester , UK , " the topic has exploded , " she says .
Researchers are focusing on how to harness its properties , and trying to find ways to produce it in sufficient quantity for extensive research and eventually for commercial applications .
MIT has become a major center of work on this hot topic , with several different research groups pursuing various aspects — including physical , chemical , electronic and engineering — of the novel material .
While many universities and commercial laboratories are pursuing research on graphene 's basic properties or on potential applications , MIT is unusual in having faculty members involved in so many different aspects of graphene research and working collaboratively on these projects , says Tomas Palacios , an assistant professor of electrical engineering and computer science and a leader of one of MIT 's research groups exploring graphene 's possible electronic applications .
A successor to silicon ?
Eight MIT researchers , along with colleagues at Harvard and Boston University , have just received a major U.S. Department of Defense grant for graphene research .
With this five - year grant , Palacios says , MIT and its collaborators " would become one of the strongest multidisciplinary teams working on graphene in the world . "
Its unique electrical characteristics could make graphene the successor to silicon in a whole new generation of microchips , surmounting basic physical constraints limiting the further development of ever - smaller , ever - faster silicon chips .
But that 's only one of the material 's potential applications .
Because of its single - atom thickness , pure graphene is transparent , and can be used to make transparent electrodes for light - based applications such as light - emitting diodes ( LEDs ) or improved solar cells .
The potential solar cell applications are now being studied by some MIT researchers including Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering Vladimir Bulovic and Associate Dean of Engineering for Research Karen Gleason .
Graphene could also substitute for copper to make the electrical connections between computer chips and other electronic devices , providing much lower resistance and thus generating less heat .
And it also has potential uses in quantum - based electronic devices that could enable a new generation of computation and processing .
" The field is really in its infancy , " says Michael Strano , associate professor of chemical engineering who has been investigating the chemical properties of graphene .
" I do n't think there 's any other material like this . "
The mobility of electrons in graphene — a measure of how easily electrons can flow within it — is by far the highest of any known material .
So is its strength , which is , pound for pound , 200 times that of steel .
Yet like its cousin diamond , it is a remarkably simple material , composed of nothing but carbon atoms arranged in a simple , regular pattern .
" It 's the most extreme material you can think of , " says Palacios .
" For many years , people thought it was an impossible material that could n't exist in nature , but people have been studying it from a theoretical point of view for more than 60 years . "
Palacios and his team just last month published new results showing that graphene can be used to make frequency multipliers that could enable much faster computer chips and communications devices .
Once obscure , now red-hot
As early as 1981 , a review article on graphene by the Dresselhauses , as well as numerous peer - reviewed papers on the subject , described the electrical and mechanical properties of graphene layers .
" We were n't exactly looking for single isolated layers at that time , " says Mildred Dresselhaus ; rather , they were working with multiple graphene layers sandwiched between layers containing other molecules .
" These materials obviously had different properties , different from anything else , " Dresselhaus says .
" That 's what excited us . "
When she started working in 1961 on the properties of carbon and its many forms of atomic arrangements , it was not a popular subject for research , Dresselhaus recalls .
" There were probably 10 people in the world " doing such research in the 1960s , she says .
" Now there are thousands . "
At the American Physical Society annual meeting last month , she says , there were more sessions devoted to graphene and related carbon research than any other subject .
" This is by far the most popular topic " in physics today , she says .
Another team studying graphene at MIT is led by Pablo Jarillo - Herrero , an assistant professor of physics , who is studying its basic physical properties and using graphene 's unique behavior as a way to study fundamental quantum - mechanical effects .
For example , in graphene , electrons behave as if they were massless particles propagating according to the laws of relativistic quantum mechanics , a behavior that is normally reserved to particles traveling near the speed of light in accelerators or in the cosmos .
Such behavior is at the heart of the ultra - high mobilities exhibited by graphene devices .
Jarillo - Herrero says that because the material is so new and its fundamental properties still being discovered , " we have some applications in mind , but many totally new ones will for sure come up as we continue doing research . "
Scaling up production
Carbon atoms have a propensity to bind very strongly to each other , as well as to other kinds of atoms .
The molecular bonds they form are easy to make and very hard to break .
That 's what gives carbon molecules and crystals their unrivaled strength .
Graphite , the material of ordinary pencil lead , is essentially a jumbled mass of tiny scraps of graphene .
The trick that enabled the first demonstrations of the existence of graphene as a real separate material came when researchers at the University of Manchester applied sticky tape to a block of graphite and then carefully peeled off tiny fragments of graphene and placed them on the smooth surface of another material .
That method is sufficient for scientific research .
" For the physicists , that 's all they need , " says Strano .
" They do n't care if they go to a lot of effort to make five tiny pieces , they can study those for years . "
But when it comes to possible commercial applications , it 's essential to find ways of producing the material in greater quantities .
One of the MIT research teams , led by Jing Kong , the ITT Career Development Associate Professor of Electrical Engineering , is working on developing such methods .
In preliminary work , they have created sheets of graphene by chemical vapor deposition , a technique that they hope can be developed to make larger quantities of the material .
Kong 's method uses equipment that is " very compatible to conventional semiconductor processing . "
The method " is quite straightforward , and not too expensive , " she says , which could help to enable commercial applications .
For specialized functions such as computer chips , further research will be needed to improve the quality and uniformity of the graphene sheets , she says , but for other applications such as solar - cell electrodes , the existing process allows the researchers to start the investigation .
Dresselhaus is a bit more cautious about making graphene sheets suitable for commercial applications for the next generation of electronics .
" Incorporating them into something useful for society is already underway , but to provide the next generation of semiconductor electronics , that 's really a decade away , " she says .
The widespread excitement about graphene " is well - deserved , " she says , though it remains to be seen what applications will prove to be practical or affordable .
" It has very exceptional properties , and it 's simple .
It 's strong , it 's light , and it 's relatively inexpensive .
I 've always liked it . "

PHILADELPHIA  The Philadelphia Phillies do n't scare easily , but Halloween night , the New York Yankees left the Phillies with a few terrifying memories that could change the momentum of the World Series .
The Yankees , with their 8 - 5 victory Saturday night , took a 2 - 1 Series edge .
It 's hardly an invincible lead , but the Yankees made it clear that they are in command of the Series .
" Not trying to sound too overconfident or arrogant , " Yankees winning pitcher Andy Pettitte says , " Our club feels good about ourselves .
We feel like we 've got a real strong team .
We felt good about coming in here … and we feel good about being up 2 - 1 .
" This was a big win for us . "
The Yankees offense , dormant the first two games with only four runs , woke up and produced three homers and five extra - base hits in a five - inning period .
Alex Rodriguez , with the help of the first instant replay ever used in World Series history , and Nick Swisher ended their slumps with homers .
The Yankee bullpen gave up just one run in the final three innings .
And perhaps more frightening , the Phillies now have to face ace CC Sabathia Sunday night .
SIGHTS & SOUNDS : The voice of the Yankees
FALL CLASSICS : Vote for your favorite World Series moment
" It 's a big game , I just have to make sure I 'm not too ramped up , " Sabathia says .
" They 're all big this time of year , but it was great to see guys wake up and swing the bats . "
The Phillies , who lost consecutive postseason games for the first time in three years , trailing a series for the first time , also have become concerned with Cole Hamels .
A year ago , he was the MVP of the World Series .
Now , the Phillies are n't sure if they can turn to him again .
He is 1 - 2 with a 7.58 ERA this postseason .
" I would n't be hesitant to start him , but at the same time , " Phillies manager Charlie Manuel says , " We 'll see how the series goes .
He showed for three innings that he can pitch .
If he can do it for three innings , why can't he keep going ? "
Hamels did n't allow a hit the first three innings .
He walked Mark Teixeira , and then watched Rodriguez hit a line drive towards the top of the right - field fence .
It caromed off a TV camera .
Rodriguez stopped at second base , signaled it a home run , and Yankees manager Joe Girardi came out to argue .
The umpires convened , went inside to check the replays , and emerged , signaling a home run , cutting the Phillies ' lead to 3 - 2 .
Ironically , the first use of video replay also involved Rodriguez , back on Sept. 3 , 2008 , when his home run was upheld at Tropicana Field in Tampa .
" Well , it 's only fitting , right ? " Rodriguez said .
" I 'm just glad we got a good ruling .
It was a little weird to have the first home run and the replay and the whole nine yards .
" But it was a big hit .
I think it woke our offense up a little bit . "
Indeed , the Yankees went on to to score in every inning until the ninth .
The onslaught continued in the fifth .
Swisher , hitting .111 with just one extra - base hit in the postseason , ended his slump with a double down the left - field line .
Melky Cabrera struck out for the first out , but then Andy Pettitte hit a bloop single to center , scoring Swisher .
Hamels was never again the same .
Derek Jeter hit a soft single to center .
Johnny Damon followed with a two - run double into the right - center gap , with Pettitte crossing the plate just ahead of Jeter .
" I could have caught him , " Jeter said , " but it would have been embarrassing . "
Jeter scoffed at the notion that the Yankees were much more relaxed at the plate , and cautioned that it's a sign the Yankees ' offense will be just as lethal the rest of the series .
" When you get a couple of hits , people say you 're relaxed , " Jeter says .
" When you do n't get hits , they say you 're pressing .
" It was just a nice win for us .
It 's not always going to happen when you score eight runs , but it felt good for this night .
We feel good , but we know they 're not out of it . "
The Phillies , who pounded out three runs and four hits in the first two innings , were shut down the rest of the way .
They managed just one more hit — Jayson Werth 's second homer of the game — until Carlos Ruiz 's solo homer in the ninth .
Their only consolation was that they forced Yankees closer Mariano Rivera into the game , but he needed only five pitches to record the final two outs .
" Game 3 is very important , it 's a big win for us , " says Yankees catcher Jorge Posada .
" What 's nice is that the whole lineup contributed .
Hopefully now , we can keep it going . "
The men were jailed after a failed bid to seek asylum in the US Two men have started appeals against the UK 's first convictions for inciting racial hatred via a foreign website .
Simon Sheppard , 51 , was sentenced to four years and 10 months , and Stephen Whittle , 42 , to two years and four months at Leeds Crown Court in July .
Sheppard , from Selby , North Yorks , and Whittle , of Preston , Lancs , controlled US websites featuring racist material .
Sheppard 's counsel Adrian Davies told the Appeal Court on Thursday the sites were " entirely lawful " in the US .
He said that there was no evidence that anyone in England and Wales - except for the police officer in the case - had ever seen any of them .
Referring to the jailed UK extremist Muslim cleric Mr Davies said : " Despite this , Mr Sheppard has been sentenced to a longer term of imprisonment than Abu Hamza , " he told the court .
" These are matters which , in my submission , ought to attract the closest and most careful scrutiny of the court of the supposed legal basis of these convictions . "
' Grotesque images '
During their first trial in 2008 , Sheppard and Whittle had skipped bail and fled to California , where they sought asylum claiming they were being persecuted for their right - wing views .
However , they were subsequently but were deported back to the UK .
The investigation began when a complaint about a leaflet called " Tales of the Holohoax " was reported to the police in 2004 after it was pushed through the door of a Blackpool synagogue .
It was traced back to a post office box in Hull registered to Sheppard .
Police later found published material including grotesque images of murdered Jews alongside cartoons and articles ridiculing ethnic groups .
The pair were charged under the Public Order Act with publishing racially inflammatory material , distributing racially inflammatory material and possessing racially inflammatory material with a view to distribution .
' Abusive and insulting ' Sheppard , of Brook Street , Selby , was found guilty of 16 offences and Whittle , of Avenham Lane , Preston , was found guilty of five .
Sentencing , Judge Rodney Grant said that he had rarely seen material which was so abusive and insulting .
At the Court of Appeal on Thursday , Mr Davies said that the Act did not contemplate a situation where publication was in an electronic form but only in " hard copy " form .
And publication did not result merely when a website was set up but only when someone actually looked at it .
The hearing continues .

Seven protesters charged over anti-Army demo refuse to stand for judge in court
Seven Muslim protesters accused of screaming insults at soldiers during an Iraq homecoming parade refused to stand for a judge yesterday .
The men are alleged to have shouted ' murderers ' , ' rapists ' , ' terrorists ' and ' baby killers ' while waving placards at the 2nd Battalion Royal Anglian Regiment marching through Luton .
At the town 's magistrates ' court , they denied using threatening , abusive , insulting words and behaviour likely to cause harassment , alarm and distress to others .
Protesters : ( from left to right ) Jabair Ahmed , Shajjadar Choudhury , Ziaur Rahman , Jalal Ahmed , Munim Abdul and Yousaf Bashir arrive at Luton Magistrates ' Court
After refusing to stand they were threatened with being found in contempt of court by a clearly angry District Judge Carolyn Mellanby .
They insisted it was a ' grave and cardinal sin ' to show anyone other than Allah respect by standing .
Eventually , a compromise was reached where they would enter the court after her during the trial , which is expected to last six days .
The maximum penalty each of the men can receive is a £ 1,000 fine .
The defendants were given an extra 20 minutes on top of their lunch break to go to pray at a mosque a few minutes ' walk away .
A separate ' quiet ' room has been set aside for their regular prayer intervals for the rest of the week .
The seven accused men are Munin Abdul , 28 , Jalal Ahmed , 21 , Jabair Ahmed , 19 , Yousaf Bashir , 29 , Shajjadar Choudhury , 31 , Ziaur Rahman , 32 , and white Muslim Ibrahim Anderson , 32 , all from Luton .
They are alleged to have chanted : ' British army murderers ' , ' British soldiers burn in hell ' and ' Baby killers shame on you ' .
The Muslim protesters brandished banners calling British soldiers ' butchers ' during the parade
Trouble flared on March 10 last year as the regiment - known as the Poachers - marched to a meeting with the Duke of Gloucester , the regiment 's colonel - in - chief , and local dignitaries in Luton town centre .
They had just returned from a second tour of duty in Iraq , and had previously fought in Afghanistan .
The battalion has lost 12 soldiers in both campaigns .
The soldiers are based in Germany , but Bedfordshire is one of the regiment 's main recruiting grounds .
Avirup Chaudhuri , prosecuting , said a group of peaceful anti-war protesters arranged with the police that they would assemble at a specific point on the route , but a splinter group went elsewhere to voice dissent .
When their abusive protest started there was a furious reaction from members of the public .
Although the chants were aimed at the regiment , it is the members of the public supporting them that the prosecution say were caused alarm and distress .
Mr Chaudhuri said police twice had to form a barrier around the protesters to protect them .
At one point it is alleged pieces of bacon were thrown at the Muslims while there were shouts of ' go and have a shave ' and ' Bin Laden 's wife is a whore ' .
The court heard that defendant Bashir had suffered two attacks on his home since the protests .
In one of these his car was firebombed and completely burnt out .
Proud : The Royal Anglian Regiment , marching along Watford High St in Luton
Despite the nature of the allegations against them the seven men did not appear in the dock because they are not charged with an imprisonable offence and are not in custody .
When they refused to stand , Judge Mellanby said : ' It is procedure that all people stand when I come into court .
I am asking them to defer to conventional practices in respect to the court .
I 'm not asking them to stand for me . '
Neil Mercer , defending Abdul and Rahman , said : ' In Muslim countries it is a grave and cardinal sin to show respect in this way to anyone other than God himself .
Their reasons would be the same if it was the Queen , with respect . '
He added : ' It is an important religious observance which , if they break , they find themselves in mortal sin .
They cannot make a show of respect to a human being , whoever that human being is , whether it is the Queen or the Lord Chief Justice or an imam . '
Intel Core i7 D0 Core Performance Advantage Revealed
The Intel Core i7 is a new line of desktop processors based on the Nehalem microarchitecture , which evolved from the Core microarchitecture that powered the highly successful Intel Core 2 line of microprocessors .
Like its predecessors , the new Core i7 processors are manufactured using Intel 's 45 nm fabrication process with high -k ( hafnium ) dielectric and metal gate technology .
However , that is where the similarity ends .
Unlike the Core 2 processors , the new Core i7 processors have a monolithic design .
That means the entire quad - core processor is fabricated on a single die .
The quad - core version of the Core 2 processor , on the other hand , combines two dual - core dies in a multi-chip package ( MCP ) .
The Core i7 processor also introduces a slew of new technologies :
an integrated DDR3 memory controller
a three - tier cache design
QuickPath Interconnect
Intel Turbo Mode technology ( now renamed Intel Turbo Boost )
When first launched on November 17 , 2008 , Intel offered three Core i7 models based on the C0 core stepping - the Core i7 - 965 Extreme Edition , the Core i7-940 and the Core i7-920 .
They followed this up with the new D0 core stepping on May 31 , 2009 .
The first processors to feature the new D0 stepping was the Core i7 -975 Extreme Edition , the Core i7-950 and the Core i7-920 .
This was followed up lately by the Core i7 - 960 on October 20 , 2009 .
What Is A Core Stepping ?
Stepping is another word for a revision number .
It is basically a way for microprocessor manufacturers to designate " steps " in the evolution of their microprocessor designs .
Instead of using a revision number ( 1.1 -> 1.2 ) , they use a combination of a letter and a number ( B0 -> B1 ) .
All microprocessor designs usually start with a A0 core stepping .
However , this is often not the version that goes to market .
Evolutionary changes before the actual launch would mean microprocessors often launch with higher core steppings than A0 .
So what 's the big deal about core steppings ?
They are important because they denote evolutionary changes in a microprocessor 's design .
These include bug fixes as well as internal improvements , and even new features .

According to Talking Biz News , editors at Reuters killed an investigation into embattled hedge fund manager Steven Cohen after Cohen called its CEO to complain .
Reporter Matthew Goldstein had been looking into allegations , raised most recently in a lawsuit filed by Cohen 's ex-wife , that Cohen engaged in insider trading in the 1980s .
According to Talking Biz News ' Chris Roush , Cohen got the story killed last week by calling Devin Wenig , the CEO of Thomson Reuters Market Division , which oversees the firm 's journalism arm , to complain .
Cohen 's ex-wife accused him in a lawsuit last week of profiting from insider information about GE 's purchase of RCA in 1986 , and Goldstein reported earlier this month that B.J. Kang , the lead FBI agent on the Galleon case , looked into Cohen 's firm SAC Capital Advisors two years ago .
Given the PR Cohen has been facing of late , Goldstein 's story must really have been a standout to merit an effort to quash it through corporate channels .
A Reuters spokeswoman told Roush that all the company 's decisions are made " purely on journalistic grounds " ; Goldstein told Gawker , " As you can imagine I can't comment on this . "
UPDATE : There 's evidence that Goldstein 's reporting — and that of his partner on the SAC Capital Advisers beat , Svea Herbst - Bayliss — has attracted intense interest at the highest levels of Reuters .
The company helpfully includes the names of each story 's editors in its bylines , and Goldstein and Herbst - Bayliss ' story on Cohen 's ex-wife 's allegations bears the fingerprints of the company 's top management , including Global News Editor Jack Reerink and Americas News Editor Martin Howell .
Their involvement in a relatively routine story about public allegations — the Wall Street Journal and other papers were all over it , too , and the story was based on court filings — suggest that the subject of Steven Cohen is indeed being handled with care at Reuters .
( CNN ) --
A birthday celebration that culminated in a trip to catch the blockbuster movie " The Twilight Saga : New Moon " could land 22 - year - old Samantha Tumpach in prison for three years .
The Chicago , Illinois - area woman captured three minutes of the film on her videocamera while taping part of her sister 's surprise party at a Muvico theater in Rosemont .
Theater managers contacted police , who arrested Tumpach .
She spent two days in jail .
Now she faces a felony charge of illegally copying a movie .
" The motion picture industry has encouraged theater owners to adopt a ' zero - tolerance ' policy prohibiting the video or audio recording of any portion of a movie , " Muvico Entertainment , which oversees the theater , told HLN 's " Prime News . "
Attempts to reach Tumpach and any representation were unsuccessful .
Piracy has been an ongoing issue for the motion picture industry .
The Motion Picture Association of America estimates that illegal piracy costs its business billions of dollars every year .
Muvico said the group believes that hidden cameras in theaters are the direct source of more than 90 percent of all pirated movies .
Still , CNN legal analyst Lisa Bloom said three years appears excessive for the incident , if it should be prosecuted at all .
Illinois state law is fairly broad on this subject , she said , and she believes that " it 's a ridiculous distortion of the law to prosecute this young woman , who recorded only a few minutes of the film as part of a birthday video . "
Experts say the MPAA , and by extension Summit Entertainment , which produced " New Moon , " walks a fine line with cases like this .
Kelli Gillespie , an entertainment reporter for the CW , says the movie industry is trying to avoid a similar situation to what the music industry faced with illegal downloads and is trying to work with " ever - changing technology that 's available to so many consumers without alienating their fan base . "
What happens now ?
Muvico Entertainment says it 's up to local police to determine Tumpach 's future .
However , the MPAA or Summit Entertainment may want to step in to assist a fan , Gillespie says .
It 's in their best interest , she said , " to figure out a way where you are n't punishing the consumer . "
Tonight , in the midst of browbeating the media for missing the " all Muslims burn with hatred for America " angle of the Ft. Hood shooting story , O'Reilly terribly misinterpreted why we 're trying to win hearts and minds in the Middle East .
Yes , Bill O'Reilly , the only reason we 're dicking around over there installing potable water systems is because we do n't yet have the capability to kill every single Muslim in the Middle East .
And your guest , Lt. Col.
Peters , of course knows this .
He is a soldier , and we all know that soldiers secretly die a little on the inside when they are forced to hand out boring old life - sustaining Powerbars to Afghan villagers instead of getting to have an awesome firefight with them .
( O'Reilly was right in one important aspect , though : killing every Muslim in Afghanistan would definitely end the war there , seeing as how 99 percent of Afghans are Muslim .
Seems like we 're disturbingly well on our way to doing this . )
Bill O'Reilly : Always good for a laugh , followed by a long period of reflective silence , followed by a little more laughing , then a bit of weeping , then silence again , then some more weeping , and , finally , a week - long bout of problem drinking .
There was widespread condemnation from around the world today of an Iraqi court ruling fining the Guardian for reporting criticism of the country 's prime minister , Nouri al - Maliki .
A broad range of leading journalists , Iraq experts , civic society activists and former officials involved in Iraq 's postwar reconstruction said the ruling and fine – for an article quoting intelligence officials as saying Maliki was becoming increasingly authoritarian – reflected a marked decline in press freedom in Iraq .
The article was written by Ghaith Abdul - Ahad , an award - winning Iraqi staff correspondent for the Guardian .
Bill Keller , editor of the New York Times , said : " This ruling has to send a shiver up the spine of anyone who hopes for a genuinely democratic Iraq .
What the court calls libel is , in most countries , called journalism .
" Indeed , if a respected journalist like Ghaith Abdul - Ahad can be punished for reporting on concerns about a trend toward authoritarian government , the verdict would seem to lend credence to those very concerns . "
Maliki's Dawa party issued a statement today denying that the prime minister had been behind the court ruling over the April article , claiming that the case had been brought by the Iraqi national intelligence service ( INIS ) without prompting from the political leadership .
The statement also insisted that Iraq 's judiciary remained independent .
But many commentators ridiculed the idea that INIS would act without the prime minister 's approval and pointed out that the court awarded damages in the case to Maliki .
Another American journalist who has written extensively about Iraq , Seymour Hersh of the New Yorker , said : " The notion that the newly organised government of Iraq would not understand the basic tenets of press freedom makes a mockery of the sacrifice of the soldiers and the journalists who have lost their lives or been injured doing their jobs there . "
Peter Galbraith , a former US ambassador and adviser to the Iraqi Kurd leadership , described Abdul - Ahad 's article as " an important story about Iraqi prime minister Maliki 's efforts to create an intelligence service loyal to him personally and to concentrate power in his own hands at the expense of his partners in parliament and government .
" The Iraqi government 's response in effect affirms the main points of the story as well as raising troubling issues about freedom of the press in Iraq six years after the US and Britain invaded Iraq with the goal of building democracy in that country . "
Andy Bearpark , a British expert on post - war reconstruction who was director of operations and infrastructure in the US - led coalition provisional authority in Iraq after the fall of Saddam , agreed that the squeeze on media freedom in Iraq called into question the democracy that the war had ostensibly been fought to build .
" Freedom from tyranny , and the freedom of speech which underpins it , was the reason so many people , Iraqi and others , tried so hard and suffered so much after Saddam was removed in 2003 .
It is a tragedy to see their efforts undermined in this way , " said Bearpark , who is now head of the British Association of Private Security Companies .
The Baghdad court delivered its judgment on Tuesday , ignoring expert testimony from three senior members of the Iraqi journalists ' union that Abdul - Ahad 's article was not defamatory .
The Guardian has said it will appeal against the verdict .
The New York - based Committee to Protect Journalists expressed disappointment at what it called the " politicisation of the Iraqi judiciary " .
Its Middle East and North Africa co-ordinator , Mohamed Abdel Dayem , said : " That the courts would devote their time to this type of irresponsible suit is outrageous considering that scores of journalist murders remain unpunished .
It is vital that this decision be reversed in the appeals process . "
Abdel Bari Atwan , editor of the Arabic - language newspaper al - Quds al - Arabi , described the tribunal that delivered the verdict as a kangaroo court .
" It is an affront to the legal system and freedom of expression , " he said .
" Despite the fact that the Americans spent $ 800 bn to create a democracy and promote freedom of expression , what we have seen in Iraq is an appalling media where the opposition points of view rarely surface .
It is sectarian or factional or financed by the Americans . "
John Owen , a professor of journalism at City University in London , said the ruling " makes a mockery of any claims of a new democratic Iraq " .
He added : " If prime minister Maliki and his government resort to this legal strong - arming after the Guardian publishes a well - sourced story , what will it do to an Iraqi Anna Politkovskaya or international journalist who does even more critical reporting and commentary ?
This legal chill must be challenged by all press rights groups and concerned news organisations with reporters covering Iraq . "
Some commentators went as far as to compare Maliki 's behaviour to the rule of Iraq 's former dictator .
Patrick Cockburn , a journalist and the author of three books on Iraq , said : " This means we 're halfway down the road to the end of the free press in Iraq , which was one of the few gains from the overthrow of Saddam Hussein .
And what makes this so menacing is that not even Saddam tried this ploy [ of suing for defamation in the courts ] to stifle reporting on Iraq , which after all said far ruder things about him than has been said about Maliki . "
Mamoun Fandy , an expert on the Gulf at the International Institute for Strategic Studies , said the comparisons to Saddam were misplaced .
He said : " It is new that a leader or an intelligence agency in that part of the world takes a journalist in their jurisdiction to court instead of jailing him or ordering him being bumped off . "
How do you define the perimeter of a clandestine raid ?
Where does it begin , and end ?
In Iraq , the Times reported ,
former American intelligence officials said that Blackwater guards were supposed to only provide perimeter security during raids , leaving it up to C.I.A. officers and Special Operations military personnel to capture or kill suspected insurgents or other targets .
“ They were supposed to be the outer layer of the onion , out on the perimeter , ” said one former Blackwater official of the security guards .
So raids are like onions ?
This sounds more like a scene from “ Shrek ” ( “ Ogres have layers .
Onions have layers .
You get it ?
We both have layers . ” ) than a rational plan for respecting restrictions on contractors taking on governmental roles .
And the layers , in this case , were sliced through pretty quickly , according to both the Times : “ In the chaos of the operations , the roles of Blackwater , C.I.A. , and military personnel sometimes merged . ”
Instead of being onion skins ,
“ They were the drivers and the gunslingers , ” said one former intelligence official .
It seems to have gone beyond that , too .
The Times writes that Blackwater employees took part “ in secret flights transporting detainees around war zones . ”
( The denials made by the C.I.A. and Blackwater — which , in the single note of comedy in this story , has changed its name to Xe — on that point are not quite categorical . )
Once you ’re on a secret flight , the borders of propriety can be hard to see .
In other instances , the Times writes , “ Blackwater was charged with providing personal security for C.I.A. officers wherever they traveled ” in Iraq and Afghanistan .
“ Personal security ” turned out to have lots of layers , too :
That gave Blackwater greater influence over C.I.A. clandestine operations , since company personnel helped decide the safest way to conduct the missions .
Safest for whom ?
How accountable was Blackwater , and to whom ?
To the government , to its stockholders , to a larger American political mission ?
How much trouble did Blackwater cause for American soldiers who have to walk through the streets in Iraq when the company ’s employees shot up a traffic circle in Baghdad ?
That cost the company some contracts , but not all of them .
A business that simply wants to fill the terms of a contract may not think or care about how its actions affect long - term views of America in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The Times said that its reporting “ raises concerns ” ; the Washington Post , in a follow - up , went with “ raise questions . ”
( Some credit for concern - and - question raising should go to Jeremy Scahill , at The Nation . )
And how about the contractors — not Blackwaters ’ executives , but the ones in war zones ?
When they come home , in some cases , perhaps , with post - traumatic stress , do they have the same support ( as inadequate as it is ) that our soldiers do ?
There really are too many layers here .
As Donkey said to Shrek , “ You know , not everybody likes onions . ”
There are layers upon layers to the Steelers ’ collapse — the Super Bowl champions have just lost their fifth game in a row .
But while the offensive line ca n’t defend Roethlisberger , who was sacked eight times , the A.C.L.U. has been defending a woman who was told she could n’t hang a Steelers banner on her home , in a Ravens neighborhood .
This season , Steelers fans need all the help they can get .

Can sainthood be " diminished ? "
If a Catholic saint has been proven to standing at the side of God -- passing along mere humans ' prayers for God 's miraculous intervention in their lives -- can there be a lesser class of worthies ?
Rabbi Irwin Kula raises the question now that Pope Benedict XVI has concluded -- from records that the Vatican is still not opening fully to scholars -- that wartime Pope Pius XII showed a life of such heroic virtues that he is worthy of considering for sainthood .
Benedict has said Pius , pope from 1939 to 1958 , " spared no effort in intervening " on behalf of the Jews , though in many cases " secretly and silently , " according to Religion News Service .
Secretly .
Silently .
And evidently with little proven effect , say critics complaining about Pius ' moral leadership .
Rabbi Irwin Kula , National Center for Jewish Learning and Leadership , while acknowledging the Church 's perfect right to its own religious standards , said ,
If Pius 's sainthood cannot withstand scholars ' scrutiny of its own historical records and sainthood can only be gained by maintaining secrets then all the Church will have accomplished in declaring Pius XII a saint is to diminish the category of sainthood in the eyes of millions of people of all faiths .
Do you hear an echo in today 's news ?
Many people who are urging world religious leaders to speak loudly , clearly , publicly against a bill in Uganda to jail , even execute , homosexuals and punish people for failing to turn in gay friends or family .
The arguments for silent diplomatic and religious persuasion have had no impact .
Indeed , some Ugandan leaders sneer at it .
The bill goes to Parliament next month .
If Pius XII is a moral exemplar , what are the lessons of his life that should be emulated ?
Can there be " secret " moral leadership ?
Where 's the " leadership " in that ?
The battle lines are drawn .
The armies are lined up .
The guns are loaded .
But here in Copenhagen , a phony war is underway .
For the past two days , negotiators have been bogged down in minor technical details and endless delays .
For hours plenary meetings have been taken up by countries complaining about the process .
Then finally solutions are agreed , and everyone files out to the relevant gatherings – only to find them cancelled on arrival .
All of Monday disappeared down that hole .
Today , it looked like some real work was getting done .
But with just hours left before the ‘ high - level ’ segment ( with ministers , and – increasingly – heads of state themselves ) begins , several different texts were in circulation , all laden with square brackets ( indicating disagreement ) around even minor issues of contention that should have been resolved last week .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At this rate , Copenhagen will not only fail , it will be a disaster .
Of course , these conferences – especially high - stakes ones like this – never end that way .
Some face - saving arrangement is always cobbled together .
But the question now is when the phony war will erupt into open hostilities – and whether heads of state will be able to resolve them in the time they have left .
The biggest question , one which has bedevilled climate negotiations for more than a decade , is finally reaching crunch point – about whether developing countries , which were exempted from taking on carbon emissions targets by Kyoto , will finally agree on binding measures to rein in their future emissions .
Everyone agrees that industrialised countries should act first ; that much was agreed as far back as 1995 .
And some can claim to have done so , in Europe at least .
But the Bush Administration lost us a decade , and time has now run out : science demands that for temperature rises to be limited to 1.5 degrees , and carbon concentrations eventually returned to 350 parts per million , global emissions must peak by 2015 .
It is no accident that both India and China oppose any mention in the negotiating text of this global peaking year , or of an eventual target for atmospheric carbon levels of 350 p pm .
They know that accepting these limits necessarily implies that their era of high - carbon growth is over .
For these science - based targets to be met , India can not burn all its coal .
Nor can China .
Nor can South Africa .
They must shift to low - carbon growth , and they must start that shift now .
In fairness , no - one is arguing that developing countries should take on mandatory Kyoto - style reductions right now .
Instead the debate is around how far their future emissions must depart from the ‘ business - as - usual ’ baseline .
The small island states – who stand to lose most as sea levels rise – now argue that developing countries should aim for 15 - 30 % below baseline by 2020 .
China and India say they will never accept this .
The United States is also central here .
America will never ratify Kyoto – everyone knows this .
But the Obama administration has come here offering serious targets , of initial 17 per cent cuts below 2005 levels by 2020 .
It could deepen this ambition , but Obama faces a tough ( if not impossible ) battle to get any climate plan through the Senate , and the administration also knows that it is politically toxic domestically to take on any improved target unless China does likewise .
These are the two main belligerents facing each other over the trenches here at Copenhagen .
In the next day or two the cannons will open fire .
When the dust dies down , we will see whether we still have a habitable climate left .
LIFE Magazine , as it is wont to do , assembled yet another of its utterly interesting photo essays .
The topic this time ?
The Secret Service .
Updated .

A few of the more interesting photos showcase the agents performing their other important duty , that being what LIFE writes is " taking down counterfeiters , fiscal gangsters , and ID thieves . "
For this they shed the trademark suits in favor of SWAT gear , gadgets and guns :
[ T ]he weaponry available to agents is among the most advanced and lethal on the planet , including SIG Sauer P229 pistols fit with huge .357 cartridges ; classic Remington 870 shotguns ; light ( 7 lb. ) , 30 - round , state - of - the - art M4 carbines ; Uzis ; and the compact , thoroughly nasty - looking Belgian FN P90 submachine gun with a top - mounted magazine of armor- piercing rounds .

Also cool is that The Beast ( the Presidential Limo , complete with 8 - inch armor ) , along with a number of other vehicles known as the " Secure Package , " travel the globe with the President ( by way of huge C - 5 or C - 17 military transport planes ) , so that he and his entourage can travel safely in strange lands .
These vehicles are quick , agile , and contain a number of important electronics , gadgets and communication tools , to be used if the motorcade becomes fractured or the Secret Service needs to spirit the Prez off at high speeds .

Question
What , if anything , prevents the execution of a Haskell term from being a proof in equational logic ?
Below are some things thay may impede treating Haskell as a logical system with terms being true equations .
Any feedback on these reasons would be welcome .
Are they are valid reasons ?
What is their possible impact ?
Are there more reason ?
--------------------Reason
( 1)------------------
There are some equations that are not expressible in Haskell e.g. mirror ( mirror x ) = x .
It is not possible at the value level , because Haskell does not support dependent types and thus cannot express the type of the proposition " forall a . forall x: Tree a , mirror ( mirror x ) = x " , and therefore a proof term also cannot be constructed .
Another example from Torrini et al discusses specifying order .
A partial order that is also linear is called a total order .
The class linorder of total orders is specified using the usual total order axioms .
They conclude that such axiomatizations are not possible in Haskell .
--------------------Reason
( 2)------------------
According to Thompson the equations in Miranda ( and I assume Haskell ) are not pure mathematical equations due to * where * and other reasons .
According to Danielsson the fact that they are not always structurally equations does not prevent functional programmers from
using them as if they were valid equations .
Danielsson show that this informal * fast and loose * use of equational axioms and theorems is * morally correct * .
In particular , it is impossible to transform a terminating program into a looping one .
These results justify the informal reasoning that functional programmers use .
Kieburtz states that neither the syntax nor type system discriminate between values and latent computations .
To prove some property of a Haskell program the verification logic must support such distinctions .
To address this shortcomming of Haskell Kieburtz has included P - Logic in the Programatica Project to provide a verification logic for Haskell
--------------------Reason
( 3)------------------
There is no formal specification for the meaning of a Haskell program ( i.e. its meaning is not defined in a logic ) .
At the level of precise logical specification and logical interoperability this could be a problem ( e.g. semantic web likes logic ) .
This should not be a problem for programming tasks , after all most languages like Java do not have a formal semantic definition in logic ( like Maude or CafeOBJ ) .

HUNTSVILLE , AL --
After six years of seemingly never - ending budget increases , taxpayers have finally caught a break on the Madison County Jail expansion .
Late Tuesday afternoon , Huntsville Mayor Tommy Battle announced that the jail 's general contractor , Lee Builders , has agreed to subtract $ 1.45 million from its final bill .
The negotiated settlement comes on the heels of an independent audit by the city that flagged a number of questionable charges by Lee and several jail subcontractors .
The final tab for the jail will be $ 79,811,693.31 -- right at $ 50 million over budget .
The city is suing the original builder , Dawson Contracting , in hopes of recovering some of that money .
Battle said Lee Builders agreed to give the city a $ 595,000 credit for an inmate video visitation system that never worked properly .
The city spent $ 600,000 replacing it with a new system last summer .
The audit also flagged billing errors related to overtime and rental equipment costs , the mayor said , plus meals and entertainment charged to the city that fell outside the scope of the contract .
He said it is " not out of the norm " to have $ 1.45 million in disputed charges on a nearly $ 80 million construction job .
" We sat down with Lee Builders , and they worked with us very closely and very well " to clear up the audit , Battle said .
" At the end of the process , we both determined there was that much credit due . "
A resolution on Thursday 's City Council meeting agenda directs the city 's Public Building Authority to pay Lee 's final bill : $ 1,178,144 after the reductions .
When the dust settles , the city will have paid Lee and its subcontractors $ 48,623,324 .
Lee was hired to finish the Wheeler Avenue lockup in late 2006 , after the city terminated Dawson over cracks in a support beam .
Then - Mayor Loretta Spencer agreed to pay Lee 7.5 percent above its costs to finish the jail .
Battle said he will steer clear of " cost plus " contracts on future city construction jobs .
Beason & Nalley , a local accounting firm , pored over about 40,000 pages of jail invoices .
Finance Director Randy Taylor said the audit cost about $ 90,000 .
NH Legislators again raise the bar for the 10th Amendment Movement  felony charges proposed for federal agents violating gun rights in New Hampshire
Pre-filed for the 2010 legislative session in New Hampshire , House Bill 1285 ( HB1285 ) seeks to exempt firearms , firearm accessories , and ammunition manufactured in New Hampshire from federal law and regulation . 
Introduced by State Rep. Dan Itse , the bill currently has 5 other co-sponsors , including 10 - 4 pledge signer , Carol Vita . ( h/t NHLiberty.org )
While the bills title focuses on federal gun regulations , it has far more to do with the 10th Amendments limit on the power of the federal government .
It states , in part :
The Tenth Amendment to the Constitution for the United States guarantees to the states and their people all powers not granted to the federal government elsewhere in the constitution and reserves to the State and people of New Hampshire certain powers as they were understood at the time that New Hampshire ratified the Bill of Rights , particularly the Tenth Amendment in 1790 .
The guaranty of those powers is a matter of contract between the State and people of New Hampshire and the several States comprising the United States as of the time that the compact was agreed upon and adopted by New Hampshire and the several States comprising the United States .

The regulation of inter-state commerce was delegated by the People of the Several States to the federal government in the US Constitution .
Since the regulation of intra-state commerce was not delegated to the federal government , this authority , as codified in law by the 10th Amendment , remains with the State governments or the People themselves .
HB1285 includes this principle in its text :
a personal firearm , a firearm accessory , or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in New Hampshire and that remains within the state of New Hampshire is not subject to federal law or taxation , or federal regulation , including registration , under the authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce .
It is declared by the legislature that those items have not traveled in interstate commerce .
The authority of congress to regulate interstate commerce in basic materials does not include authority to regulate firearms , firearms accessories , and ammunition made in New Hampshire from those materials .
Firearms accessories that are imported into New Hampshire from another state and that are subject to federal regulation as being in interstate commerce do not subject a firearm to federal regulation under interstate commerce because they are attached to or used in conjunction with a firearm in New Hampshire .
Unlike many other states that are considering Firearms Freedom Acts ( FFA ) , the New Hampshire legislation includes official sanctions on any state or federal official violating the law , if adopted .

State Agents :

Federal Agents :
Any official , agent , or employee of the government of the United States , or employee of a corporation providing services to the government of the United States that enforces or attempts to enforce a act , order , law , statute , rule or regulation of the government of the United States upon a personal firearm , a firearm accessory , or ammunition that is manufactured commercially or privately in New Hampshire and that remains within the State of New Hampshire shall be guilty of a class B felony .
( emphasis added )
NULLIFICATION
Some supporters of the legislation say that a successful application of such a state - law would set a strong precedent and open the door for states to take their own positions on a wide range of activities that they see as not being authorized to the Federal Government by the Constitution .

The Best of Michael Boldin
Gourmet chefs are taking the art of cooking with marijuana to a higher level .
In Denver , US , a new medical - marijuana shop called Ganja Gourmet serves cannabis - infused specialties such as pizza , hummus and lasagna .
Across town in the Mile - High City , a Caribbean restaurant plans to offer classes on how to make multi-course meals with pot in every dish .
And in Southern California , a low - budget TV show called Cannabis Planet has won fans with a cooking segment showing viewers how to use " weed " in teriyaki chicken , shrimp capellini and steak sandwiches .
The evolution of pot cooking was perhaps inevitable given the explosion of medical marijuana around the US in recent years .
Many health - conscious patients would rather eat the drug than smoke it .
And they would prefer to eat something other than sugary treats .
" When I started using marijuana , I was eating a brownie every day .
I gained a ton of weight , " said Michael DeLao , a former hotel chef who hosts the Cannabis Planet cooking segments on Los Angeles ' KJLA .
" Then I learned how to really cook with marijuana , and once more people learn about all the possibilities , we 're going to see a lot more people wanting this in their food . "
All patrons at the Ganja Gourmet must show a medical marijuana card that proves they have a doctor 's permission to use pot for some kind of illness .

A year ago I wrote a lengthy article for Oil Drum - Campfire describing the beginning of my conversion from a career of professional life often an desk to one of a farmer .
Due to the interest and spirited responses to my article of last December I thought that Oil Drum readers might find it interesting to know what has transpired this past year on the farm and what I think I have learned .
If you get lost a bit I would recommend reading the previous article .
Background
For a variety of complex reasons ( which continue to evolve as this experiment continues ) I have come to believe that our future world will require a significantly larger number of farmers than it has today .
The short term causes of this need can be found in energy issues as often discussed on TOD and in the status of our financial system / consumer economy , while the primary long - term driver is the onrushing freight train of climate change .
I believe that we have unwittingly raced into a civilizational dead end and need to quickly retrench and reconfigure our place in this world ( although I do not expect this to happen ) .
I am convinced that we cannot avoid massive change nor probably catastrophic upheaval .
I do have hope we can adapt .
With this in mind I have chosen to move forward and work towards a possible future .
Many of us must learn small scale farming .
Farming needs to become more local and it needs to be performed as ecologically as possible ( sustainable farming being something of an oxymoron ) .
We need to grow our numbers of farmers and reduce their average age from approximately 60 to a more demographically supportable age .
We will need to reclaim land from suburbia and the pet horse industry .
Who is going to do this ?
Well , for one , I am .
A quick bit of additional background to add to last years data ; whether it clarifies or obscures what I am doing is open to one ’s interpretation I guess .
I am 55 years old and a retired CIA officer .
I was formally educated as an electrical engineer and spent my entire professional career with the United States Government .
I have traveled the world extensively and have directly witnessed some of the highs and lows of the human race on this earth ( more lows than highs I am sorry to say ) .
I am of an analytical bent imposed upon an operational background .
I have expended significant thought and heavily researched the issues , mentioned above , which have brought me to my conclusions .
I performed the due diligence , to the best of my ability , which such serious concerns demand .
I am convinced and , thus , my duty is to act .
Year Three
When one compares the below production figures for this year with those presented in last years post it is critical to remember that the farmed acreage was significantly greater this year than last .
I had about 2 acres in vegetable crops this year ( as opposed to 1 in 2008 ) and about 1 acre in fruit this year ( roughly the same as last ) .
During the growing season this year we raised 35 different vegetables , 4 herbs and various fruit / berries .
For reference : in 2008 we grew 23 different vegetables and the fruit / berries .
With the extra acre in production this year we naturally grew a lot more produce than last year .
However , the difficult and unusual weather during the year mostly wiped out our fruit production and adversely impacted many of the other crops .
The only fruit we grew in any volume this year was blackberries and pears .
The rest did not survive the weather .
For 2008
I estimated that sold production was about 1 million calories of food and that total production ( to include that sold , what we consumed , what had to be thrown away due to it not selling , donations to the poor , and that composted due to its not being deemed of sufficient quality for sale ) was 2 million calories .
For 2009
I estimate that sold production was about 2.9 million calories and that total production was 5 million calories .
We are getting better at this .
FYI : The total calories of production of produce of any kind that were edible are naturally higher than the above sold production numbers indicate .
A lot of product never gets harvested due to its quality not being sufficient for sale in the current environment , lack of labor to harvest and / or insufficient markets to sell the product at .
This may change in the future .
Energy Use
For 2009 the farm consumed the following energy inputs ( actual thru end of Nov and estimated thru end of Dec ) :
Total Fuel : 1067 gallons
673 gallons – Gasoline / Vehicle – Pickup and Van
217 gallons – Gasoline / farm tractors / mowers / weed eaters , etc
31 gallons - Diesel for tractors
87 gallons – kerosene for greenhouse heater
59 gallons – propane for greenhouse heater Electricity , $ 60 / month May to Nov – primarily for AC for refrigerated vegetable storage room but also consumption due to the presence of farm workers
Numbers for 2008 were respectively :
Total Fuel : 950 gallons
681 – Gasoline / Vehicle – Pickup
200 – Gasoline / farm tractors / mowers / weed eaters etc
17 - Diesel for tractors
52 – Kerosene for greenhouse heater Electricity aprox $ 30 / mo
Of particular note is that the largest component of my farm ’s energy use is transportation fuel that is almost totally consumed in delivering product to my markets .
This year ’s transportation fuel number of 673 gallons was 8 gallons LESS than it was in 2008 while the product delivered was approximately three times higher .
Production / Energy Ratios
I have used the same methodology to calculate total calories as detailed last year .
The results are impressive ( to me at least ) .
Once again these figures are sold production .
Another interesting number , in survival terms perhaps , is Total Production to energy consumed , but that is more of a topic for a different post .
FYI : there is great room for improvement in the area of sold production as having more labor and sales outlets would generate much greater revenues from the same amount of crops .

Labor Issues
For the first 2 years of farming I was the sole worker ( with small amounts of assistance from my wife – approx 10 % of my hours ) .
This last year I intended to have one full time worker in addition to the time my spouse could spare .
The issue of hired labor has proven to be a hard lesson in one of the ‘ gotcha ’s ’ of small scale vegetable farming .
A few items for illustration purposes .
I advertised for one full time worker for the season ; 50 - 60 hours per week , Mon – Sat , all farm labor duties , etc .
The first worker signed up for the season and lasted 2 months .
He decided he wanted to work 40 hr wks , not on weekends , only was interested in greenhouse work and was bothered by having dirt stained hands .
This kid grew up on a large cotton farm .
The next 3 workers were laid off landscapers from the local area .
One worked one day and did not return .
The other two I fired for lack of effort , talking / texting on cell phones while working and not showing up for work on time or for entire days .
The next worker showed up after driving clear from Massachusetts , and did not even work a full day .
The next worker was a dream .
A 17 year old 6 months out of Mexico ( US Citizen – but non-English speaker ) who worked rings around me and more than twice as hard as the best of the others .
He had to return to high school at the end of August .
The last worker was a recent college graduate who had failed to find work after graduation .
Nice person but not a very hard worker and kind of depressed .
I have heard from many other vegetable farmers that it is very difficult to find good farm workers among young Americans .
Most farmers want to train and use young Americans as they recognize that our future is dependent on finding our replacements , but the core requirement is to get the work done efficiently .
Almost all of the small farmers I know , however , are heavily dependent on immigrants to get the heavy hauling done .
Why is this the case ?
It may be because young Americans are not willing to work hard , as I frequently hear stated , but I am not so sure .
I believe it may be because most young Americans do not know “ how ” to work hard .
In my limited experience they have simply never been trained how to work hard physically .
I tried to explain to them how my father taught me to work hard when I was young and just got the minimum wage stare in return .
I would tell them that , even if you are 20 years old , if you work hard physically all day for 10 hours you will not be going out to the movies at 11 pm during the week because you will be asleep before that time .
It just did not sink in .
My parents thought my generation was getting soft and told me so .
It seems that the current crop of youngsters is mostly clueless when it comes to hard times and giving 100 % effort .
I suspect that they are going to get to learn how to perform the hard way .
Another annoyance was that none of the American kids I hired spent any time thinking about what they were doing and trying to become better at it , as on the last day they were here they still had not adequately learned the tasks we were doing , nor had their ability to work harder / faster improved .
The Mexican boy was completely different and worked like his life depended on it from minute one .
He was smart .
He never wasted time .
He immediately found something to do when he was done with his last task without being told ; he learned my way of doing things within a day or two ( rather than arguing about it ) ; he was always thinking ahead to the next thing to do , would jump right in and take something over if he could see that he could do it faster than I could , was never late , never wasted time , etc .
I was amazed .
I paid him much better than the others as well .
For next year I will return to the well for American workers , but I am going to try and be much more selective .
I want to find 2 workers who are really motivated to learn this type of farming ; hopefully they will have some experience and ideally they would be a couple .
And I am going to try to hire the Mexican boy again for the summer .
Plus my wife intends to join me full time on the farm as she has decided that she really likes the lifestyle and has all sorts of plans on how to add to our operation .
So that means 4 - 5 full time workers next year .
A big change .
And probably some big headaches !
Labor for 2007 – Approx 3000 hours
Labor for 2008 – Approx 3300 - 3500 hours ( spouse included )
Labor for 2009 - Appox 3300 hours , spouse 800 hours , hired labor 1400 hours for a total of about 5500 hours
Equipment Issues
For three years I have used the type and scale of equipment ( 2 wheeled walk - behind tractor , small power equipment and heavy use of hand tools ) recommended in the very popular Eliot Coleman organic farming books .
I have come to the conclusion that this scale of equipment is not suitable if one is trying to operate a profitable farm as opposed to operating what most would consider a large personal garden .
By ‘operating a farm ’
I mean that one is trying to grow an amount of food well in excess of one ’s family needs and to try to generate a workable income .
A ‘ family ’ feeding operation can exist and persist with significant inefficiencies , especially in the presence of a large number of family members , but a profitable farming operation must be highly efficient in order to turn a profit .
My presumption is that large farm families with many children , structured along the traditional lines of the past , are not only going to be much less common , but are not desirable in any sustainable sense .
The only other farmer that I know who was using this same type of small equipment has evolved to larger more capable machinery .
The 2 wheeled ( walk - behind ) tractors are excellent machines for certain tasks ( tilling , running a flail mower and limited rotary plowing ) , but are not capable of efficient work at many required farming tasks ; among them being furrow plowing , as they are not capable of rolling the sod over to speed its rotting nor are they capable of flipping over large rocks ; cultivating , as it is not possible to exert sufficient steering control over the machine to cultivate close enough to the crop rows ; pulling a transplanter ; bed forming ; root digging , as the machine is not powerful enough to pull a root digger even when loaded with substantial amounts of wheel weights ; etc .
One ’s opinion may vary on this issue if the soil they have to work is very soft and largely rock free .
That is not the case here in Virginia .
For my operation there are 3 core farm efficiency issues : weeding ( cultivating ) , bed preparation , and transplanting .
None of these activities can be efficiently performed using small scale equipment .
It is either not powerful enough , accurate enough or just does not have enough weight and HP .
A large amount of hand labor is required and with the problems in finding good workers and the cost of such labor it seems better to use human labor on tasks that generate greater return on investment .

Profits ( or Not ? ) and Costs
Last year I chose not to discuss revenues as I considered it , at the time , to be extraneous to the subject at hand .
I no longer consider that to be the case and wanted to offer some comments on this issue as it does directly impact those who might consider attempting to transition to this occupation .
If one is embarking on even very large scale family gardening where the goal is to provide their family ’s total sustenance then scaling for profit is not the point .
Rather keeping expenses to the absolute minimum is critical , otherwise you are better off financially going to the supermarket .
In this world using mostly hand tools , physical labor and maybe a tiller is all that is necessary .
Farming is another story .
The purpose of this occupation is to grow large amounts of food so that others can work at other tasks .
Doing one ’s part for The Division of Labor .
After 3 years of using small scale equipment , inputting huge amounts of labor and having access to fairly lucrative farmers markets to sell my produce at , I think I can say with confidence that one cannot make enough money via the above methods to make this a viable occupation .
At this point in time I am just about even in terms of expenses and revenues ( not counting as the CPA ’s do - depreciation and all that - but in raw terms ) .
This means that I have worked about 10,000 hours and my spouse has worked about 1100 hours for $ 0 / hr .
That is not a typo .
$ 0/hr .
I am not counting as income the decent collection of equipment , tools and knowledge I did not posses before I started that could come in very handy in the future .
But we are attempting to build an intermediate future that lands somewhere between the unsustainable present and civilizational collapse .
So it is necessary to scale up the farm ’s capabilities without drifting into full industrial farming practices .
I expect that in my “ research / experimentation ” process that I will try a number of the modern practices of vegetable farming used on 5 - 15 acre vegetable farms and see how they fit my needs / goals .
Examples of these techniques would be plastic mulch ( I am using straw at this time and will do both in 2010 ) and a heavy concentration on using transplants .
It is worth noting that my 2009 revenues were 2 ½ times that of 2008 which were 2 times that of 2007 .
This indicates to me that I am learning and making progress even though I have not made a “ profit ” yet .
Costs :
Home gardening can be done on the cheap .
Even large scale home gardening can be done relatively inexpensively providing that one has the time and physical strength or a large family .
Farming requires resources .
Those resources can be partially counted in terms of family , paid workers , draft horses or slaves ( the future anyone ? ) , but it is certain that those resources will need to include lots of equipment and ( dare I say it ) machinery if the farmer is expected to generate enough extra product to allow others to perform their part of the division of labor .
Equipment costs …a lot .
For this kind of farming to succeed in the future food is going to have to cost the consumer a lot more and a lot of other professions are going to have to give up their overpaid ways .
Health and Welfare Issues
Another factor pushing me towards increased mechanization is the physical toll that minimal equipment farming takes on your body .
I have reached the age where , no matter how much effort one puts into maintaining strength , there is an inevitable physical decline year on year .
Over the last three years I have noticed some of that decline and suffered a number of minor issues that I can attribute to aging .
My knees and lower back cause me problems if I kneel or bend over for many hours while harvesting and weeding .
This will only get worse and is a common complaint of vegetable farmers much younger than I .
I have one shoulder that is very painful at times due to arthritis and one can expect the other to follow in due course .
I have a partially bum hip due to an old work injury that flares up occasionally .
I age … unfortunately .
Increased mechanization will allow me to extend the timeframe that I can perform the physical work of the farm .
On the plus side I think that I can claim that I am much more physically capable than the average 55 year old and the positive impact of this occupation / lifestyle on ones mental health cannot be overstated .
Publications
These are resources that are very useful to someone working towards the type of operation I am running .
Always keep in mind that what works for one expert grower on his farm in a certain part of the country may not work well in your circumstances .
Some of the claims that people make in books leave so much of the rest of the story out that they may as well be making it up ( Though I have seen it written I do not believe that one person can farm 2 acres of crops , harvest them and sell at markets and gross $ 25 K an acre .
That is a 5000 hour / yr job ) .
Growing for Market – magazine
Johnny ’s Seeds – catalog , has great info on growing various crops
High Mowing Seeds – catalog , great growing info as well
How To Grow More Vegetables – Jevons
Square Foot Gardening – Bartholomew
The New Organic Grower – Coleman
Though I have a lot of books on farming / gardening and have read many others , I have not found a really good book on how to farm .
People like Coleman write books on advanced gardening and other farmers write books that are for experienced farmers .
I do not think a high quality book on beginning farming exists .
Most of farming seems to have to be learned by direct observation , hands on attempts and through trial and error .
Planning skills are crucial .
Crop knowledge is crucial .
Markets are crucial .
Everything is crucial .
The Future
One can always change their minds of course or have life decide to shove you down a different path , but I think this is it for me .
I figure to run this one full out to the end .
My wife is planning on ending her own personal life sentence in the business world and will join me in the spring .
She has a lot of ideas and is very enthusiastic not to mention a workaholic too .
It looks like full commitment with no intention of looking back .
It was a startling admission from one of the architects of the modern financial system .
John Reed , who with Sandy Weill created Citigroup , said the merger was a mistake .
What 's more , Reed went on to say that the repeal of the Glass - Steagall Act , which was needed to make the merger legal , was also a mistake .
He said we should " compartmentalise the industry for the same reason you compartmentalise ships " and keep " consumer banking separate from trading bonds and equity " .
Reed 's mea culpa came a decade late and left the world 's financial system a few hundred billion dollars short .
Twenty years ago , the fall of the Berlin Wall shook the world .
The fall of the wall that separated commercial and investment banking 10 years ago took rather longer to reverberate around the world .
The Citigroup merger was so big that it literally required an act of Congress , but that did n't keep it from needing $ 45 bn in taxpayer funds to survive .
Today , Citigroup and the other financial monsters created in the wake of that fateful merger are struggling to recover from their self - inflicted wounds and repay billions in bailout dollars from the US government .
After nearly 30 years of financial innovation , it 's time to reconsider the laissez - faire attitudes that have wreaked such havoc .
The savings and loan crisis of the 1980s should have warned us of the dangers of freeing stodgy lenders to take on risks they did n't understand .
Instead , the free - market acolytes argued that we needed even less regulation , not more .
The collapse of Long - Term Capital Management in the 1990s should have warned us of the dangers of exotic financial instruments .
Instead , the wizards spread their poison throughout the financial system , and banks became more and more like hedge funds .
Time and again , we have given the wizards of Wall Street all they want , and what do we get ?
Bigger and bigger messes .
Time and again , we have been told that an increasingly unfettered financial system will unlock more capital and give us ever - growing prosperity .
Instead , we are suffering through the greatest economic crisis since the 1929 crash that prompted the adoption of Glass - Steagall Act in the first place .
A year ago , Alan Greenspan , the high priest of laissez - faire capitalism , admitted that he was " absolutely , precisely " wrong in thinking that self - interest would protect the financial system from self - inflicted collapse .
Yet , the belief that unfettered finance would bring blessings to shareholders and customers alike dies hard .
Instead of wondering which institutions might be too big to fail , it 's time to consider whether the financial behemoths are too big to succeed .
Sandy
Weill spent his career trying to build the world 's biggest bank , only to see it destroy billions in shareholder wealth and require federal bailout funds to keep it alive .
John Reed 's admission that the grandiose dreams of the bankers have turned out to be nightmares should bring pause to those who still argue that bigger is better .
Chris Dodd has introduced a bill in the Senate to overhaul financial regulation , saying the current system was " created piece by piece over decades " , forgetting the parts that have been dismantled piece by piece .
His draft bill has garnered favourable comments from Timothy Geithner , the US Treasury secretary , even though it differs in some respects from Barack Obama 's plan .
It is reassuring to see lawmakers renounce their faith in unfettered free markets and propose measures to bring order to the chaos they helped create .
The bankers who have left us with yet another mess either do n't know what they 're doing or , worse , have created an inherently unmanageable financial system .
Either way , we have to admit that unfettered finance is too dangerous to be left to the financiers .
It 's time to impose new controls on those who have shown themselves incapable of self - control .
The
Tax Foundation reported last week
that more than 143 million individual income tax returns were filed in 2007 , and 46.6 million of those returns had a zero or negative tax liability , setting a new record for the number of “ non-payers . ”
This group represented almost one out of every three tax returns filed in 2007 ( 32.6 percent , see chart above ) , and reflects tax filers whose exemptions , deductions , and credits wiped out any federal income taxes that would have been due .
According to the Tax Foundation , every dollar withheld from the paychecks of the “ non-payers ” during the year was refunded , and in about half of the cases , substantial additional money was refunded to the tax filer .
There were an additional 15 million people in 2007 who did not earn enough income to file a tax return , bringing the total number of Americans who paid no federal income taxes to more than 61 million , or 39 percent of the tax - eligible population ( 158 million including filers plus non-filers ) .
What are the implications of this and what does this have to do with the Bush tax cuts ?

You 're looking at the heart of one of the biggest digital cameras ever conceived — 74 CCD sensors that will go into an enclosure the size of a Mini Cooper .
The 570 - megapixel shooter is being built at Fermilab by an international team of particle physicists and astronomers , who think it will help solve one of the great mysteries of the cosmos :
What is dark energy ?
Of course , we do n't really know whether dark energy even exists .
What we do know is that the universe has been expanding since the big bang .
But rather than slowing down like everything else fighting gravity 's pull , this expansion seems to be speeding up .
Something must be causing this , and astronomers call that something dark energy .
The hope is that scientists can use detailed photos to chart the light from galaxies and supernovas , which will show the growth of the cosmos and at least give them more evidence for the existence and effect of dark energy .
Once the $ 35 million rig is complete , astronomers will mount it to a telescope in Chile and , over the course of five years , use it to map some 300 million galaxies .
It gives a whole new meaning to shooting stars .
• Boycott unaware that he was being heard by listeners • BBC : ' We apologised as soon as we realised it was audible '

This article is more than 10 years old
The BBC apologised to radio listeners today after a foul - mouthed outburst from Geoffrey Boycott during its cricket coverage .
The outspoken 69 - year - old commentator was overheard shrieking " fucking tosser " during the corporation 's Radio 5 Live sports extra coverage of England 's one - day international match against South Africa this morning .
His comment was understood to have been made after England took a sixth wicket as they bowled South Africa out for 119 in the fourth one - day international in Port Elizabeth .
It was not known who the comment was directed at and Boycott was unaware comments were being broadcast , a BBC source said .
Ryan McLaren was the sixth South African wicket to fall , caught by Paul Collingwood at backward point for a fifth - ball duck , giving James Anderson the fourth of his five wickets during the innings .
A Radio 5
Live spokesman said : " An off - air comment made by Geoffrey Boycott in a live broadcast was heard by some listeners which we apologised for as soon as we realised it had been audible . "

BEIJING ( AP ) — China has started treating severely infected swine flu patients with blood plasma donated by survivors — a therapy not yet proven to work but one that has shown potential to save lives .
In many parts of China , government - run blood collection stations have been harvesting plasma from people who have high levels of swine flu - fighting antibodies in their blood , because they recently recovered from or were vaccinated against the virus .
The plasma is being stored in preparation for transfusions for severely or critically ill patients .
The treatment is based on the principle that transferring antibodies , the immune system ’s search - and - destroy force , can help a patient fight the virus and recover faster .
Because the approach is still being evaluated for safety and effectiveness , the World Health Organization has not recommended it .
Any therapy involving blood transfusions risks introducing new infections of blood - borne diseases such as HIV , hepatitis and syphilis .
Some patients could also develop allergic reactions .
Evidence from cases of bird flu and the 2002 - 03 severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak have shown promising results using plasma from recovered patients .
Plasma therapy is also used to treat hepatitis B , rabies , and other infectious diseases .
Concerns about resistance to antiviral drugs like Tamiflu have also driven interest in additional therapies , particularly in pandemic situations where hospital intensive care units come under strain from severe cases .
It is not clear how many Chinese have received the treatment .
Media in recent weeks have reported at least 10 patients have been treated this way , including a baby and a pregnant woman .
Some health experts support China ’s approach .
Microbiologist Guan
Yi of the University of Hong Kong co-authored a paper in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2007 about a bird flu patient who recovered quickly after being treated this way .
“ I think it ’s a good strategy , ” Guan said .
In severe cases , the virus penetrates deep into the lungs and replicates in great amounts , which Tamiflu is ineffective in limiting , he said .
“ The best way to treat the severe patients is with neutralized antibodies , which are only found in people who have accepted vaccination or in convalescent plasma , ” said Guan .
Dr. Xu Zhenqiu , who has used the therapy , said plasma treatment offers some hope .
“ It provides us with an alternative treatment when saving patients , which gives us more hope of saving lives , ” Xu said in a telephone interview .
The health ministry was cautious in stating its position on the therapy , saying more research was required .
Other experts are not fully convinced of the treatment ’s effectiveness .
“ I think it needs careful study , ” said Dr. Frederick Hayden , a virus expert at the University of Virginia and a World Health Organization flu consultant .
“ I think it ’s a very potentially important intervention , but there is insufficient information … to make a routine recommendation for care in seriously ill patients . ”
Chinese health authorities have appealed for donations of plasma and hundreds , if not thousands , of people have already done so , according to news reports .
Blood supply safety is a perennial concern in China , where worries still persist despite strengthened controls in recent years on blood collection centers .
China also banned blood sales in 2003 after it was discovered unclean blood - buying businesses had passed the HIV / AIDS virus to thousands of people in the 1990s .
Guan said though he supports China ’s treatment strategy , he has urged the government to strictly regulate plasma donations .
“ My concern is they have no standard protocol .
Different regions and different hospitals may be screening the blood differently , ” he said .
“ I urge them to standardize the whole procedure . ”

The FIA Formula 1 World Championship entry list does not have a number 13 .
The number is generally considered to be an unlucky number .
It was used in the early years of the sport but in the 1920s it was dropped after the Delage factory team suffered two fatal accidents with the number in the course of just a few months .
The first was Paul Torchy , who crashed into a tree during the San Sebastian Grand Prix in September 1925 ( below ) .
That was the last major international event of the year and the Delage factory team did not reappear until the Targa Florio in Sicily in April 1926 .
Italian Count Giulio Masetti was in the number 13 on that occasion and was killed when his car went up an embankment and overturned near the village of Sclafani Bagni , near Caltavuturo .
He was crushed beneath the car ( below ) .
After these incidents the Automobile Club de France stopped using the number .
Since then it has been a tradition not to use the number in top level motor racing .
There have been two occasions when the number has been used in F1 .
The first was at the Mexican Grand Prix in 1963 when Moises Solana used the number on a BRM at his home event in Mexico City ( below ) .
The second occasion was in 1976 when Divina Galica tried to qualify for the British Grand Prix in a Surtees entered by Nick Whiting , brother of the FIA ’s Formula 1 Race Director Charlie Whiting ( below ) .
She failed to qualify .
Other countries have unlucky numbers , notably the Japanese .
They do not think the number 4 is lucky .
Thus when Tyrrell employed Satoru Nakajima and later Ukyo Katayama both raced the number 3 .
It took seven months but President Obama has finally found someone to take the cybersecurity czar job no one wanted .
Howard Schmidt , a former Microsoft security executive and a one - time cybersecurity adviser to President George W. Bush , has been appointed to the position of cybersecurity coordinator , according to a White House announcement Tuesday .
Schmidt served as vice chair , and then chair , of the President 's Critical Infrastructure Protection Board and as Special Adviser for Cyberspace Security for the White House from December 2001 until May 2003 , when he reportedly left the position out of frustration that the government was n't making cybersecurity a priority .
After leaving the White House , he became chief information security officer at eBay .
In his new position , he will be responsible for coordinating the federal government 's cybersecurity initiatives to secure government networks and critical U.S. infrastructures .
This will include working with the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that agencies have money allocated for cybersecurity priorities , and coordinating the government ’s response to a major cyber incident or attack .
According to the Associated Press , Obama was directly involved in the selection of Schmidt , who was chosen after an extensive search .
But the announcement of Schmidt came with little fanfare on Tuesday and followed months of reports from other candidates that they either turned down the job or otherwise discouraged the White House from courting them .
Obama announced last May that he was creating a new office to be led by a cybersecurity czar .
For nearly a year , however , he could find no one to take the job , because of what many viewed as its undesirable placement in the federal hierarchy .
The czar , Obama stated , would report to the National Security Council and the National Economic Council , putting the position one rung lower in the executive branch hierarchy than many security experts had wanted .
Observers had hoped the czar would report directly to the president , which would have helped insulate the office from agency turf battles and ensure quick access to top decision makers .
The White House was quick to dispel concerns on Tuesday that Schmidt 's office would be exiled from the West Wing .
An unidentified White House official told the Associated Press that Schmidt would have regular and direct access to the President for cybersecurity issues .
Schmidt , Microsoft 's chief security officer until 2001 , is the second former Microsoft executive to take a top federal cybersecurity position .
Department of Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano appointed Philip Reitinger in March to the position of deputy undersecretary of the department ’s National Protections Program Directorate .
Reitinger was Microsoft 's chief trustworthy - infrastructure strategist , a job that required him in part to help develop and implement strategies for enhancing the security of critical infrastructures .
In his new position , he oversees the protection of the government ’s computer networks and works with the private sector to help secure critical infrastructures .
There have been concerns about how the White House intends to address cybersecurity issues , particularly in the private sector , and protect civil liberties at the same time .
Obama asserted in his speech in May that the new White House cybersecurity office would include an official whose job is to ensure that the government ’s cyberpolicies do n’t violate the privacy and civil liberties of Americans .
“ Our pursuit of cybersecurity will not include — I repeat , will not include — monitoring private - sector networks or internet traffic , ” he said .
“ We will preserve and protect the personal privacy and civil liberties that we cherish as Americans . ”

... the Soldier !
Sorry , Demomen .
You fought the good fight and kept it far closer than anybody could have predicted .
But in the end , at the noon Thursday deadline , the Soldiers kept their razor - thin lead , with 6,406,065 killed Demomen to the Demo 's score of 6,372,979 killed Sollys .
What a week it 's been .
We 're really big fans of both the police and the fire department , so it 's been a real treat for us , as they 've been here pretty much non -stop since last Thursday .
There were the arguments between Demo and Soldier - supporting staffers ; that unexplained knifing in the elevator ; Drew Wolf ; and a host of other calamities that resulted from the creation of this massive update .
At one point we even saw a police officer and a fireman in a fist fight over who was more mad at us .
Anyway , it was all worth it to give you this update .
Which is now live .
Enjoy .

When you pin a tab in Google Chrome , it shrinks to an extent that you can only see the favicon .
This is a great feature for those users who have lot of tabs open and want to save up some space , but the biggest headache is that the pinned tabs are not permanent .
The moment you close and then start another session of Google Chrome , all pinned tabs will be lost .
Is there any way to make tabs pinned permanently ?
Yes , you can make a number of tabs pinned permanently by using a small command switch .
First right - click the Google Chrome shortcut and head over to Properties .
Now add :
– - pinned - tab - count=x
at the end of Target path .
Replace x by any number of pinned tabs you want , for example , we chose 4 .
So the complete path becomes :
C:\Users\Nakodari\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe – - pinned-tab-count=4
Now in the final step add the complete website URLs next to this command switch .
Make sure there is a space between each URL .
C:\Users\Nakodari\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe – - pinned - tab - count=4 https://www.addictivetips.com/
http://www.twitter.com/
http://www.facebook.com
http://www.google.com/reader/
If you want to 6 tabs to be permanently pinned , then you will have to enter 6 URLs and change the value of x to 6 .
It ’s that easy .

Some are funny .
Others strike an emotional chord .
But some
Ad campaigns are truly bizarre .
From a commercial encouraging you to rent your wife to robots selling fried chicken ( or attempting to do so ) , we look at ten commercials which are known for the notoriety rather than the products they are attempting to promote .
Some famous celebrities have helped engender this list , including Hulk Hogan and the present day Governor of California .
You may cringe in disbelief .
10 Rent a Wife
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvmNOspTbmM
A Belgian video rental service used a twisted metaphor for this commercial , leading to controversy .
It depicts a couple in the mood for love making when the man suddenly packs her off in a box for disposal .
Seconds later , the doorbell rings with another woman at his disposal .
There was no mention of the video rental service anywhere in the advertisement and the unsuspecting viewer might just have thought the rent - a - wife scheme to be true , only to have checked the website to find an innocuous rental store .
Perhaps the creators of the advert should let the poets make use of the metaphors .
9 Robocop trying to sell fried chicken
Advertisement
You ’ve goto hand it to the Koreans for coming up with something like this .
The person who conjured up this idea must have been on something while coming up with this , because he or she has made a very absurd assumption that a robocop devours and relishes the same kind of food that humans eat .
The entrance of this friendly monster through the television and the whisking away of the whole fridge at the end of the advert make it all the more unreal .
What ’s more , he wants ‘ frieda chicken ’ . ??
8 Do not Murder
Of all the things that the Church of Scientology preaches ‘ Do not murder ’ is perhaps the least controversial .
However , because it cannot end there , they went ahead and made an advertisement about it .
The advert was supposedly an informational one which would act as a ‘ roadmap to a happier life through values of compassion and caring that every member of a civilized society holds dear ’ .
The content of the ad is simply a bullet which has just left a revolver while desperate voices cry out in the background and ends with the message ‘ Do not murder ’ .
Very obfuscating , indeed .
7 Sumo Wrestling and Sprite
Sumo wrestling being a rather obscure sport to most people outside of Japan , it seems only natural that those who conjured up this idea were aiming for the bizarre .
And that ’s exactly where they got .
Iridescent sumo wrestlers bumping into each other to create orgasmic pleasure ?
Naa .
The event is far more likely to produce an earthquake .
And all this to simply relate the idea of ‘ LYMON ’?
Utterly disturbing .
6 Sheila ’s Wheels
‘ For bonzer car insurance deals , girls get onto Sheila ’s wheels ’ .
If you are a girl in the United Kingdom ( excluding Northern Ireland ) , you wont have to keep your hands on the steering wheel while you drive because ‘ women make the safest drivers ’ .
Coquettish crooning accompanied by a band which follows their tune as the convertible waltzes past the countryside is hardly the way to sell car insurance and just when you thought it could n’t get any worse , a mouse appears to be driving the car .
5 Ice Cream at the Bar
And now to some edification on the art of being illogical .
Set an animated lass to cavort in a bar and then at the end of it all , tell the prospective customer to buy your brand of ice - cream .
To make it more interesting use a blackboard somewhere along the way to feign erudition and make sure the girl carries the ice - cream with her so that the sensual waves trigger off pleasure which will become readily apparent .
Essentially , make sure that your customer is made to believe that consuming ice - cream has the same effects as alcohol .
4 Pufuleti Gusto
What do Romanians turn to when they need to inject optimism into life ?
After years of communist rule , high rates of unemployment , the defection of Nadia Comaneci and the retirement of Dan Petrescu and Gheorghe Hagi , they seem to have come up with the answer .
Or that ’s what this commercial claims .
Because when you have just accidentally chopped off your head when peeling an orange , but still have the strength to ask for the Pufuleti snack , there must be something to it .
3 Hulk Hogan and the air conditioner
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9jnxp19vf8
Hulk Hogan was the undisputed master of the ring who could possibly do anything and everything .
Well , that ’s what the makers of this advert for air conditioners thought .
Because it is otherwise inexplicable why you would rope in a wrestling star to sing a lullaby to an infant to market a device from which cool air emanates into the room .
And the song which is simply a tune of the days of the week does not make up for the faux pas .
The only thing that could have made it worse is a video cassette of Hulk Hogan ’s singing as a free gift .
Simply excruciating .
2 Of Monsters , transvestites and Light
While this commercial may not seem weird in the end , a second look will expound to you the theory of relativity .
Unearthly , grotesque creatures create the suspense but the producers misjudged the addition of the transvestite as somewhat of an unfamiliar , foreign object .
Now , this would be perfectly acceptable anywhere in the world but Thailand .
1 Arnold ’s Vitamin Drink
A greater absurdity in the annals of television commercial history has not been recorded .
By comparison , it is the toffee apple surrounded by candy floss , the benchmark against which all things bizarre are judged .
Takeda Chemical Industries roped in the ‘ Terminator ’ , Arnold Schwarzenegger to market a seemingly energy boosting substance and the result has been a pyrotechnic display beyond human reasoning .
The jejune background score , Arnold ’s attempt to speak Japanese , and the metamorphosis in the end make this a classic .
Maybe this is what he had in mind when he said he ’ll be back .
Welcome back to the working week !
For today , the last Monday of the month , some Monday - related entertainment .
First , here are some scans from The Executive Coloring Book .
It may seem mildly amusing today , but it must ’ve been downright subversive to some when it was first released in 1961 ( here ’s a review from Time magazine , dated Frdiay , December 29 , 1961 , in which it ’s reviewed alongside the equally counter - culture Uncle Shelby ’s ABZ Book , written by good ol ’ Shel Silverstein .

„ De uitputtende werkzaamheden vanwege mijn verantwoordelijke positie en het drukke leven hadden een ernstige impact op mijn seksuele prestaties .
Ik kon vaak geen seks hebben en , wanneer het wel lukte , was het maar voor kort .
Uiteindelijk realiseerde ik me dat ik iets moest doen want mijn vriendin raakte gefrustreerd en ik was bang dat ze me zou dumpen .
Ik heb toen de Climax control pillen geprobeerd en , na een paar dagen , zag ik een duidelijk verschil .
Ik had zin in seks , ik had geen erectie problemen en ik kon de liefde bedrijven voor een lange tijd en weer plezier geven aan mijn vriendin . ”

Roger Carr recently wrote in comments :
HELP WANTED : I am trying to purchase ( or plunder ) a full copy of this story , mentioned here on this forum : A Washington , D.C. resident John Lockwood was conducting research at the Library of Congress and came across an intriguing headline in the Nov. 2 , 1922 edition of The Washington Post : Arctic Ocean Getting Warm ; Seals Vanish and Icebergs Melt .
The article mentions “ great masses of ice have now been replaced by moraines of earth and stones , ” and “ at many points well - known glaciers have entirely disappeared . ”
The original source of the story resurfacing recently was from an Inside the Beltway column of August 14th , 2007 .
The newspaper article was located in the Library of Congress archives by James Lockwood .
Here is the text of the Washington Post ( Associated Press ) article :
The Arctic ocean is warming up , icebergs are growing scarcer and in some places the seals are finding the water too hot , according to a report to the Commerce Department yesterday from Consul Ifft , at Bergen , Norway .
Reports from fishermen , seal hunters and explorers , he declared , all point to a radical change in climate conditions and hitherto unheard - of temperatures in the Arctic zone .
Exploration expeditions report that scarcely any ice has been met with as far north as 81 degrees 29 minutes .
Soundings to a depth of 3,100 meters showed the gulf stream still very warm .
Great masses of ice have been replaced by moraines of earth and stones , the report continued , while at many points well known glaciers have entirely disappeared .
Very few seals and no white fish are found in the eastern Arctic , while vast shoals of herring and smelts , which have never before ventured so far north , are being encountered in the old seal fishing grounds .
UPDATE :
The source report of the Washington Post article on changes in the arctic has been found in the Monthly Weather Review for November 1922 .
It is much more detailed than the Washington Post ( Associated Press ) article .
It seems the AP heaviliy relied on the report from Norway Consulate George Ifft , which is shown below .

Thanks to Michael Ronayne for locating it and many other resources you can find in the comments section below .
If Yogi Berra were here to comment on the hullabaloo over the changes in the arctic today , I ’m pretty sure he ’d say .
“ It ’s Deja Vu all over again ” .

Hello !
Sorry , it has been a while yet again .
My computer was dying and made it completely impossible to browse on the internet much less upload photos and post things .
Que sera sera …
In the meantime , I have been thinking up projects and made these mitten - glove things as an adaptation of a vintage pattern for fair - isle mittens .

From The Daily Beast :
Danny Glover , Jesse Jackson , and other activists talk to Lloyd Grove about disappointment in the African - American community with the president ’s first year .
Danny Glover heaved a sigh when I asked him recently what he thought of President Obama ’s performance so far .
It was n’t a sigh of relief .
“ I think the Obama administration has followed the same playbook , to a large extent , almost verbatim , as the Bush administration .
I do n’t see anything different , ” the activist movie actor said of Obama ’s policies in Iraq , Afghanistan , and the Middle East .
“ On the domestic side , look here :
What ’s so clear is that this country from the outset is projecting the interests of wealth and property .
Look at the bailout of Wall Street .
Why not the bailout of Main Street ? ”
“ He may be just a different face , and that face may happen to be black — and if it were Hillary Clinton , it would happen to be a woman , ” says Danny Glover .
“ But what choices do they have within the structure ? ”
RELATED : Poll : Obama ’s Approval Rating Falls Below 50 Percent
More in sorrow than in anger , Glover went on : “ What choice does he have — in four years , eight years ?
Let ’s just call a spade a spade .
Really .
There are no choices out there .
He may be just a different face , and that face may happen to be black — and if it were Hillary Clinton , it would happen to be a woman — but what choices do they have within the structure ? ”
lover is among a growing chorus of African - American opinion leaders who are publicly and privately expressing varying degrees of resignation , disappointment , and outright anger concerning a presidency on which so many hopes have ridden .
Who can forget the iconic image of the tear - streaked Rev. Jesse Jackson — who in 1984 and 1988 waged formidable campaigns of his own for the Democratic presidential nomination — as he stood overcome with emotion amid the jubilant crowd at Chicago ’s Grant Park as Obama gave his victory speech ?

A survey conducted by the New Zealand based research firm UMR Research found that nearly half of the respondents think that it 's morally okay to watch porn on the Internet .
Downloading music and movies illegally , on the other hand , is frowned upon by an overwhelming majority of the respondents .
A recent survey among 1000 New Zealanders has revealed some interesting findings regarding the pleasures of the Internet .
Of the polled group , nearly half ( 41 % ) thought that watching porn online is morally acceptable .
Downloading music illegally , or watching a movie online without paying , was okay with a much smaller group , 18 and 13 percent respectively .
In fact , hiding your online porn viewing habits from your spouse is still more morally accepted than downloading a movie or music album without paying for it .
Of the respondents , 18 percent thought that is was fine to secretly watch porn in a marriage .
At first sight the results of the survey are not really that surprising .
Downloading music and movies without consent from the copyright holders is in violation of the local laws in New Zealand and watching porn obviously is n’t .
Still , a closer look at the findings reveals some remarkable inconsistencies .
Firstly , most of the adult entertainment is actually viewed on sites that are dominated by copyright infringing content .
So , many of the people who watch porn online are actually pirating as well , without realizing it .
Another remarkable finding was that people seem to be fine with copyright infringement if it ’s on a video streaming site such as YouTube .
Of all respondents , 31 percent said that it is morally acceptable to stream copyrighted TV - shows on YouTube , while only 13 percent believed that downloading copyrighted video was morally okay .
Thus , streaming copyrighted content is somehow perceived as more acceptable for some odd reason .
The 5 percent difference between the moral acceptability of music and video downloading is another mystery that is left unexplained .
Overall , this survey shows how malleable peoples ’ perceptions are when it comes to copyright issues online , with approval rates swaying back and forth between different types of media and the various distribution platforms .

In an article in yesterday 's ' Wall Street Journal ' , Google CEO Eric Schmidt denied the company is to blame for the news industry 's problems and said it is committed to playing a role in helping struggling publishers survive the transition to the online age .
In the op - ed piece Google boss Eric Schmidt said : " With dwindling revenue and diminished resources , frustrated newspaper executives are looking for someone to blame .
“ Much of their anger is currently directed at Google , whom many executives view as getting all the benefit from the business relationship without giving much in return .
The facts , I believe , suggest otherwise .
“ We send online news publishers a billion clicks a month from Google News and more than three billion extra visits from our other services , such as Web Search and iGoogle .
" That is 100,000 opportunities a minute to win loyal readers and generate revenue - for free , ” he says .
“ It 's understandable to look to find someone else to blame .
But as Rupert Murdoch has said , it is complacency caused by past monopolies , not technology , that has been the real threat to the news industry , ” he adds .
“ We recognize , however , that a crisis for news - gathering is not just a crisis for the newspaper industry , ” Schmidt says .
“ We also acknowledge that it has been difficult for newspapers to make money from their online content .
But just as there is no single cause of the industry 's current problems , there is no single solution . ”

Australian police have offered a reward of Aus$ 1 m ( US $ 926,000 , £ 567,000 ) to find a man suspected of ordering the killing of a self - proclaimed vampire .
Mark Adrian
Perry allegedly ordered the 2003 murder of Shane Chartres - Abbot , a prostitute who said he drank blood .
At the time of his death , Mr Chartres - Abbot was on trial for allegedly raping Mr Perry 's former girlfriend and biting off part of her tongue .
Police in Victoria state say they believe Mr Perry is in Australia .
A 'centuries - old vampire '
Mr Chartres - Abbot was shot in broad daylight in Melbourne , in front of his father and pregnant girlfriend .
A man has already been convicted for carrying out the shooting , but Mr Perry - who is believed to have ordered the killing - is still at large .
" There will be some people who know where Perry is and $ 1 m is a lot of money , " said Victoria state police Det Insp Steve Waddell .
Mr Chartres - Abbot had allegedly told Mr Perry 's former girlfriend that he was a centuries - old vampire who drank blood to survive .
Mr Perry was last seen in Queensland in 2007 .
Police said they believed he had changed his name and appearance .
BLOOMINGTON , Minn . - Hundreds of
fans rose before dawn Monday for the chance to meet the conservative star , who brought her book tour to Minnesota's
.
Die -hard supporters treated the event like another Black Friday , lining up outside in freezing weather before the mall doors opened at 5 a.m .
Emily Calhoon , a high school junior from Minnetonka , took the day off school with a group of fellow students and arrived at 4:45 a.m. Calhoon , 16 , said she likes Palin 's conservatism .
" She 's a lot more relatable than the stereotypical old rich white male , " said Calhoon as she waited in line , clutching a copy of Palin 's memoir of her life and political career , " Going Rogue . "
The former Alaska governor and 2008 Republican vice presidential nominee arrived just before noon .
Wearing her trademark red , she took the stage joined by her husband , Todd , and carrying their son Trig .
But , not everyone at the mall was a fan .
Bloomington police said a local man threw a tomato at Palin from the second level of the rotunda at 2 p.m. .
Police say the tomato missed Palin by about 10 feet , but hit two officers after striking the stage .
The man was arrested on a gross misdemeanor count of fourth - degree assault on a police officer and a misdemeanor count of disorderly conduct .
Screenshots sent to Gizmodo from an anonymous source reveal the possible price and tariff details of the Nexus One Google phone , along with some extra hardware details .
The Google - designed handset is expected to be launched at an invitation - only Android - themed special event on Tuesday January 5th .
If these leaked pictures are correct , then the Nexus One will retail for $ 530 unlocked , ready to be used with any GSM carrier .
Those wanting to buy the handset subsidized will pay $ 180 and have to sign up for a two year contract .
There appears to be only one plan available for these customers , and that is the T - Mobile Even More Individual 500 Plan , which gives you 500 minutes , free weekend and in - network calls and unlimited SMS , MMS and data .
That bring the total cost over two years to $ 2,100 .
The screenshots also offer a teaser about hardware accessories .
There will be a dock for an extra $ 40 to allow you to “ Charge your phone while streaming music and backing up your data ” and a car docking station ( $ 50 ) : “ Nexus One is dock - aware and will optimize its display for navigation and hands - free use . ”
According to Gizmodo , you will be able to buy up to five handsets per Google account , Google will actually ship the handset to countries outside the US .
As the handset is unlocked , there seems no reason not to ship it to countries that use the GSM standard , and that price starts to look very attractive next to even the subsidized iPhone when converted from US dollars into stronger currencies .
It does n’t look like Google or T - Mobile stand to lose much on this deal .
If you decide you do n’t like the ( subsidized ) Nexus One , you can cancel within 120 days .
The early - termination fee will be a staggering $ 350 .

It is hard to believe that Forex remains a relatively unknown financial market , especially considering that it is considered the largest financial market in the world .
But when it comes to large - scale economic investments , the first thing most investors think about remains in the stock market .
What is Forex ?
The typical images of Wall Street brokers , the numbers on the screen , the highly valued securities of the biggest companies in the world , the bubbles , and the crashes come to mind … 63 times higher than the stock market ?
Or that in Forex an impressive 5 trillion dollars circulate daily ?
But after all , what is Forex , and why have n’t you heard of what is considered to be the biggest financial market in the world ?
For more information , you can consult this link , where Forex is defined and explained in great detail .
But allow us to make a short summary .
In basic terms , Forex ( acronym of the English expression for foreign exchange ) is the decentralized financial market where all exchange transactions take place .
That is , whenever a business involves two types of currency ( such as the US dollar and the euro ) , Forex can play an important role .
As Forex acts predominantly on differences between currency values ​​rather than speculative goods , it can be considered a relatively stable market .
It is , moreover , impressive due to the large volumes it involves : it is no accident that the largest investors in the world – such as governments or large multinational companies – invest so much in this market .
In addition to presenting great opportunities for investors , Forex helps entrepreneurs and producers to mitigate the risk involved in multinational transactions , ensuring that future contracts between both do not depend on a possible decrease or peak in the base price of a currency .
Is it possible to invest in Forex independently ?
Even though Forex is the largest market in the world , and one of the favorite financial platforms of the great “ sharks ” of the world economy , Forex can present excellent opportunities for private investors who seek to monetize their capital independently .
Fortunately , betting on this promising market has never been easier than it is now .
Through the Internet , it is possible to find a number of different brokers that guarantee quick and cheap access to the Forex market .
It is possible to learn more about the different types of Forex brokers that are available to the common investor .
Check out the Forex brokers that can offer you promising results .
When investing , remember that , as in the stock market , there are a thousand and one possible reasons to justify increasing or decreasing the value of your investments .
From supply and demand to political and economic instability , all factors that reflect on the value of a currency must be considered when investing .
Although currencies like the Yen are becoming increasingly popular in the financial markets , the “ old acquaintances ” of the dollar , the pound , and the euro continue to be the preference of investors .
ATTENTION : investment in foreign exchange derivative contracts ( FOREX ) like all investments , has risks .
This article explains some technical aspects and associated nomenclature , we do not make investment recommendations .
Above all , information is sought .
Before investing , find out what the risks are , how to mitigate them , and if they suit your risk profile .
There is no good investor who is not a well - informed investor .
British man said to be mentally ill executed in China
Akmal Shaikh was arrested in 2007 A British man convicted of drug smuggling in China has been executed , the Foreign Office has confirmed .
Akmal Shaikh , 53 , a father - of - three , of London , had denied any wrongdoing and his family said he was mentally ill .
The execution took place despite repeated calls from his family and the British government for clemency .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown said he was " appalled and disappointed " .
But the Chinese Embassy said Mr Shaikh had no previous record of mental illness .
Mr Shaikh 's family made continued calls for leniency right up until the execution deadline , citing his mental state , saying that he suffered from bipolar disorder .
His daughter Leilla Horsnell said : " I am shocked and disappointed that the execution went ahead with no regards to my dad 's mental health problems , and I struggle to understand how this is justice . "
Brothers Soohail and Nasir Shaikh , who travelled to China to visit their cousin in prison and make a last - minute plea for clemency , said they were " deeply saddened , stunned and disappointed " .
' Lethal injection '
In a statement issued after the execution , the Chinese Embassy said Mr Shaikh 's rights " were properly respected and guaranteed " and British concerns were " duly noted and taken into consideration " .

It said : " As for his possible mental illness which has been much talked about , there apparently has been no previous medical record . "
A report from the official Chinese news agency Xinhua said that China 's Supreme People 's Court had not been provided with any documentation proving that Mr Shaikh had a mental disorder .
Mr Shaikh is the first EU national to be executed in China in more than 50 years .
Foreign Office minister Ivan Lewis said he was believed to have died by lethal injection .
His body will not be repatriated to the UK , and Mr Lewis said Mr Shaikh had been buried quickly " in accordance with the Muslim faith " .
Mr Shaikh 's family said he had been delusional and duped into a carrying a suitcase that did not belong to him when he was found with 4kg of heroin in Urumqi , north - west China , in September 2007 .
His daughter has said drug smugglers in Poland convinced him they would make him a pop star in China .
' Inadequate interpretation ' Mr Lewis held last - ditch talks with the Chinese ambassador in London on Monday evening .
He said the government had made 27 representations to China in two years , and believed it had done everything it possibly could .
The way the Chinese authorities have stubbornly failed to take account of this poor man 's severe mental illness shows that China is still stuck in the dark ages

The execution made him " sick to the stomach " , he said , and China " had a responsibility to adhere to the most basic standards of human rights " .
The Chinese ambassador has been summoned to the Foreign Office .
In a statement , Mr Brown said : " I condemn the execution of Akmal Shaikh in the strongest terms , and am appalled and disappointed that our persistent requests for clemency have not been granted .
" I am particularly concerned that no mental health assessment was undertaken .
" At this time our thoughts are with Mr Shaikh 's family and friends and I send them our sincere condolences . "
Foreign Secretary David Miliband also condemned the execution .
He said the UK was opposed to the use of the death penalty in all circumstances , but also " deeply regretted " that his specific concerns in this case , including " mental health issues , and inadequate professional interpretation " had been ignored .

Conservative leader David Cameron echoed the condemnation , saying he " deplored and deeply regretted " the execution .
" It is appalling that the concerns [ about Mr Shaikh 's mental health ] were not independently assessed during the more than two years [ he ] was in custody , and taken properly into account in the judicial process , " he said .
The legal charity Reprieve had taken up Mr Shaikh 's case for the family .
Through the charity , the family issued a statement thanking all those who tried to help including Reprieve , the Foreign Office , those who attended a vigil outside the Chinese embassy in London , and the organisers of a Facebook group calling for clemency .
CHINA DEATH PENALTY
China executed 1,718 people in 2008 , according to Amnesty International Last year 72 % of the world 's total executions took place in China , the charity estimates
It applies to 60 offences , including non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement
Those sentenced to death are usually shot , but some provinces are introducing lethal injections
Executions shrouded in secrecy
They asked for privacy " as they come to terms with what has happened to someone they loved " .
Katherine O'Shea , Reprieve 's communications director , said it was " devastated " Mr Shaikh had been killed .
" That such a thing can happen in this day and age is really something that should alarm all of us , " she said .
" This guy was a very vulnerable person , extremely ill .
He slipped through the cracks of society , and he was frankly failed by China and by their legal system .
And it's an absolute disgrace that he should have been killed . "
Philip Alston , a UN special rapporteur , said the execution amounted to a violation of Chinese and international law .
International law " points very strongly in the direction " of the principle that the death penalty should only be used for crimes which result directly in the death of others , he said .
" It is time for the international community to mount a much more concerted effort to put an end to these sorts of executions , " he added .
' Dark ages '
In its statement , the Chinese Embassy said Mr Shaikh was convicted of " serious " drug trafficking .
" The amount of heroin he brought into China was 4,030g , enough to cause 26,800 deaths , threatening numerous families , " it said .

It added : " The legal structures of China and UK may be different , but it should not stand in the way of enhancing our bilateral relations on the basis of mutual respect . "
A spokeswoman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry , Jiang Yu , told a press briefing in Beijing no - one had the right to comment on China 's judicial sovereignty .
" We express our strong dissatisfaction and opposition to the British government 's unreasonable criticism of the case .
We urge [ them ] to correct their mistake in order to avoid harming China - UK relations , " she said .
BBC world affairs correspondent Mike Wooldridge said in the final appeal for clemency before the execution Britain had expressed the hope that its relationship with China would count for something .
" But in the event , its influence has been severely tested in this case , " he said .
Charity MDF , The Bipolar Organisation , described the execution as " medieval rough justice " and an " absolute tragedy " .
Spokesman Robert Westhead said : " The way the Chinese authorities have stubbornly failed to take account of this poor man 's severe mental illness shows that China is still stuck in the dark ages . "

The deadly rampage at Fort Hood is forcing Pentagon officials to confront difficult questions about the military 's growing Muslim population .
The military has worked hard to recruit more Muslims since the start of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the number of Muslim troops , while still small , has been increasing .
There were 3,409 Muslims in the active - duty military as of April 2008 , according to Pentagon statistics .
Military personnel do n't have to disclose their religions , and many officials believe the actual number of Muslim soldiers may be at least 10,000 higher than the Pentagon statistics .
For instance , the military " Officer Record Brief " of Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan , the suspect in the Fort Hood shootings , said he had " no religious preference " and did n't identify him as a Muslim .
Even now , Muslim soldiers remain fairly rare in some parts of the military .
At West Point , Army officials said there were just 24 Muslim cadets out of a total student body of 4,400 .
The Muslim cadets worship in an interfaith center on the bucolic New York campus , but do n't have a dedicated mosque .
The push to boost Muslim representation has proven to be a double - edged sword for the military , which desperately needs the Muslim soldiers for their language skills and cultural knowledge , but also worries that a small percentage of those soldiers might harbor extremist ideologies or choose to turn their guns on their fellow soldiers .
London , England ( CNN ) --
Wednesday 's release of a British computer expert held by Shiite Muslim insurgents in Iraq since 2007 came about as part of efforts to settle the six - year - old insurgency , an Iraqi government spokesman said .
Peter Moore had been held hostage since May 2007 .
He was released Wednesday in good health , British Foreign Secretary David Miliband told reporters in London , England .
" He is undergoing medical checks and he will be reunited with his family as soon as possible back in the UK , " Miliband said .
" He is obviously -- to put it mildly -- delighted at his release . "
A little known - group calling itself The Islamic Shiite Resistance of Iraq claimed to have been behind Moore 's kidnapping .
Iraqi government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh said government officials were not involved in the talks that led to Moore 's release , but said the decision to free him " is part of the national reconciliation program " aimed at convincing Iraq 's remaining armed factions to lay down their arms .
" The Iraqi government was not part of this effort , but was always supportive of the efforts , " al - Dabbagh said .
He said the goal is to convince those factions still taking up arms against the U.S. - backed Iraqi government to " give up all violence and to be part of the political process through the normal rule of law here in Iraq . "
Moore , a computer expert for U.S. - based consulting firm BearingPoint , was kidnapped amid the sectarian warfare and insurgent attacks that ravaged Iraq in the years following the U.S. invasion in 2003 .
He was one of five Britons seized from the Iraqi finance ministry by people posing as security forces and government workers on official business .
The other four men were guards working for the Canadian security firm GardaWorld .
The bodies of security guards Jason Creswell and Jason Swindlehurst were handed over in June 2007 , while Alec MacLachlan 's body was returned in September 2009 .
The fourth , Alan McMenemy , is believed dead , though there was no indication Wednesday of his status .
" We have believed for some time that he has been killed and his immediate family have been told our view of his likely fate , " Miliband said .
" I call again today on the hostage - takers to return Alan 's body as soon as possible . "
Speaking to CNN from his home in the English city of Leicester , Moore 's father , Graeme Moore , said he was " absolutely overjoyed for the lad . "
But he sharply criticized the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office and Miliband , whom he said kept them in the dark about his son 's case .
The elder Moore said he heard from a reporter that the Foreign Office planned to release a statement on his son's case , " and I did suspect the worst . "
" But when I saw the breaking news on the television , I went through the ceiling with joy , " he said .
He called Miliband 's statement that the agency had been in " close touch " with the Moore family a " disgraceful " lie , telling CNN , " They do n't talk to Peter 's family .
They never have . "
There was no immediate response from the Foreign Office to the criticism .
Moore 's kidnappers released at least three videos .
In December 2007 , the Arabic language TV station Al - Arabiya showed a video of a man who identified himself as " Jason . "
He said on tape that the date was November 18 .
The hostage - takers demanded in the video that all British troops be withdrawn from Iraq within 10 days or they would " kill the hostage ... as an initial warning . "
In February 2008 , Moore appeared in a video , pleading with the British government to agree to a prisoner swap .
" It 's a simple exchange -- release those that they want so we can go home , " he said .
" It 's as simple as that .
It is a simple exchange of people .
This is all they want , just have their people released . "
The British Embassy in Iraq received a third video in March , but it has not disclosed its contents .
The United States , too , is awaiting the release of almost a dozen Americans listed as missing in Iraq , some for as many as six years , U.S. State Department spokesman Darby Holladay said in an e-mail to CNN .
While the U.S. government has called for their release and information on their status , Holladay said , the government 's policy is to not make concessions to terrorists or hostage - takers , including concessions such as prisoner release or ransom .
CNN 's Mohammed Tawfeeq and Jill Dougherty contributed to this report .
Looking back over the year , that 2009 was a great year for small films that said big things , while Hollywood enjoyed huge commercial success but appeared to have nothing to say .

6. Star Trek
Total Gross : $ 257,730,019
Those prepared to hate the reboot of STAR TREK – whether they ’re diehard fans or those in the anti-sci - fi camp–may be convinced to lower their shields after seeing this fun , action - filled film .
Best known for creating mythology - driven series like LOST , J.J. Abrams has imbued his version with the elements that have made his shows such mind - bending entertainment while still keeping the soul of the saga intact .
STAR TREK begins with an attack by an impossibly advanced Romulan ship captained by the tattooed , snarling Nero ( Eric Bana ) .
Among the survivors is the infant version of James T. Kirk ( Chris Pine ) , who grows up to wreak havoc on the Iowa countryside .
When Captain Christopher Pike ( Bruce Greenwood ) meets an adult Kirk , he encourages him to join Starfleet , giving him the opportunity to meet Spock ( Zachary Quinto ) , Uhura ( Zoe Saldana ) , and the rest of the characters audiences have loved for decades .
Abrams has assembled a fine cast who seem to be aware of their predecessors but never resort to impressions .
Both Quinto and Pine do a fine job with their portrayals of Kirk and Spock , and Karl Urban could n’t be better as Leonard McCoy .
The supporting players –Simon Pegg ( Scotty ) , John Cho ( Sulu ) , and Anton Yelchin ( Chekov ) –all capture the essence of what drove their characters , though their screen time is limited .
STAR TREK manages the nearly impossible : it pleases hardcore fans with plenty of in - jokes and references ( and an appearance by the original Spock , Leonard Nimoy ) , but it does n’t alienate newcomers with tons of technobabble .
The action and effects rank with any other top - tier summer blockbuster , but there ’s plenty of humor to balance the excitement .
For anyone who ( wrongly ) felt he had to hide his trekker tendencies , this undeniably cool version of STAR TREK offers a chance to wear the “ geek ” label with pride .

2. Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince
Total Gross : $ 301,959,197
Though HARRY POTTER AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN director Alfonso Cuaron still holds the crown for best film in the series , David Yates is making an attempt at a coup with HARRY POTTER AND THE HALF - BLOOD PRINCE .
Dark , gleefully funny , and beautifully shot , this adaptation of J.K.
Rowling ’s novel should please fans despite numerous changes to the 650 - page source material .
In this sixth film in the series , Harry ’s ( Daniel Radcliffe ) inevitable confrontation with the dark wizard Voldemort grows closer , and Hogwarts headmaster Dumbledore ( Michael Gambon ) wants the young student to be prepared .
He guides Harry through a memory of a young Voldemort , but an important moment is missing .
Harry must extract this memory from the new Hogwarts teacher , Horace Slughorn ( a perfectly slimy Jim Broadbent ) , who is as eager for fame as he is reluctant to revisit this painful moment .
Meanwhile , romance rules the school of witches and wizards , with Hermione ( Emma Watson ) and Ron ( Rupert Grint ) refusing to admit their feelings for each other .
Harry also harbors a secret love of his own : Ron ’s younger sister , Ginny ( Bonnie Wright ) .
But despite his crush , Harry keeps an eye on Snape ( Alan Rickman ) and Draco Malfoy ( Tom Felton ) , who may be responsible for attacks on the school .
HALF - BLOOD PRINCE deftly balances the humor of Hogwarts heartbreak and the thrills of dark villains attacking the school .
The cast is as talented as ever , and the youngest members –Radcliffe , Grint , and Watson –have developed their talent well .
However , this film is most remarkable for its fine cinematography from AMELIE director of photography Bruno Delbonnel .
Using a muted palette , Delbonnel makes Hogwarts look hauntingly beautiful in a way that fans have never seen .
There ’s always plenty of fun and adventure in the series , but this entry boasts impressive visuals as well .

This is the fourth post in an article series about MIT 's Linear Algebra course .
In this post I will review lecture four on factorizing a matrix A into a product of a lower - triangular matrix L and an upper - triangular matrix U , or in other words A=LU .
The lecture also shows how to find the inverse of matrix product A·B , how to find the inverse of transposed matrix AT , and introduces permutation matrices .
Here are the previous lectures :
Lecture 4 : A=LU Factorization
Lecture four starts with a small review of inverse matrices .
Remember from previous lecture that the inverse of matrix A is matrix A - 1 such that multiplying them together A·A - 1 produces the identity matrix I .
Another key fact to remember is that matrix multiplication is associative ( can change parenthesis ) and that for square matrices the right - inverse is also the left - inverse A·A - 1 = A - 1·A = I .
Lecture then continues with finding the inverse of matrix product A·B .
The answer is found by reasoning what should we multiply A·B to get the identity matrix .
Let 's try B - 1·A - 1 .
If this is the inverse of A·B , then multiplying it with A·B from the left and right sides should produce the identity matrix I . Let 's test this .
From the right side : ( A·B ) · ( B - 1·A - 1 ) .
Since we can rearrange parenthesis , this is the same as A· ( B·B - 1 ) ·A - 1 .
But B·B - 1 is identity , therefore A· ( B·B - 1 ) ·A - 1 = A·I·A - 1 = A·A - 1 = I . Seems good so far .
Now the left side : ( B - 1· A - 1 ) · ( A·B ) .
We rearrange parenthesis again , B - 1 · ( A - 1·A ) ·B and just like in the previous example , A - 1·A is identity and B - 1·I·B is B - 1 ·B = I .
We have found the inverse of ( A·B ) .
It 's ( B - 1·A - 1 ) .
Next , while we 're at it , the lecture continues with finding the inverse of transposed matrix AT .
It 's found by reasoning again .
Let 's first look at the equation A·A - 1 = I .
We can transpose both sides of this equation and it will still hold .
If we transpose the right side , we get the same identity matrix I , because IT=I .
But what about the left - hand side ?
Transposing the left - hand side we get ( A·A - 1 ) T = ( A - 1 ) T·AT .
Now left - hand side is still equal to right - hand side , therefore ( A - 1 ) T·AT = I .
But from this equation it 's instantly obvious that the inverse of AT is ( A - 1 ) T .
We can therefore note and remember that ( AT ) - 1 = ( A - 1 ) T .
Finally the lecture moves on to today 's key topic of A=LU decomposition .
As usual , the topic is introduced by an example .
Let 's take a look at this 2 x 2 matrix A :
And let 's try to find the elementary matrix E 21 that will eliminate the element at row 2 , column 1 .
Multiplying the first row by 4 and subtracting it from the second row will produce a zero at 2 , 1 .
But look at the right - hand side .
It 's the upper - triangular matrix U ( all elements below the diagonal are 0 ) that we were looking for !
Now if we multiply both sides by the inverse of E 21 , we get ( E 21 ) - 1·E 21 ·A = ( E 21 ) - 1·U .
But ( E 21 ) - 1·E 21 is identity , therefore A = ( E 21 ) - 1·U .
From this equation it 's instantly obvious that the lower - triangular matrix L is nothing else but ( E 21 ) -1 !
Another form of factorization is A = LDU , where D is the diagonal matrix that contains the pivots .
For this example it would be :
Now imagine that we have some arbitrary 3 x 3 matrix A .
To reduce matrix A into upper - triangular matrix U , we first eliminate the element at position 2,1 , that is , we multiply A ( from the left side ) with elimination matrix E 21 .
Then we eliminate the element at 3,1 by multiplying ( from the left side ) with elimination matrix E 31 .
Finally we eliminate the element at 3,2 by multiplying with elimination matrix E 32 :
E 32 ·E 31 ·E 21 ·A = U
It follows from this equation that the lower - triangular matrix is the inverse of E 32 ·E 31 ·E 21 , that is ,
L = ( E 32 ·E 31 ·E 21 ) - 1 = E 21 - 1·E 31 - 1·E 32 - 1
We have found the factorization of a 3 x 3 matrix :
A = E 21 - 1·E 31 - 1·E 32 - 1·U = L·U
The algorithm for finding matrices L and U should now be clear .
First do the elimination to find matrix U , then invert the product of elimination matrices used for finding U to find L. Actually it 's even easier , you do n't even need to keep elimination matrices E , or find their inverse .
You can just keep the multipliers used in each elimination step .
Please see the video to find out how it works .
Next , the cost of elimination algorithm is discussed .
How many steps does it take to go from matrix A to U ?
Turns out the elimination is O ( n3 ) process ( more carefully , it takes around n3/3 steps ) .
( See my notes on MIT 's Introduction to Algorithms for more info about O - notation . )
Since we sometimes need to do row exchanged to do elimination , the last ten minutes of lecture are spent on permutation matrices .
Remember from lecture two that multiplying a matrix from the left side with a permutation matrix exchanges its rows .
The key facts about permutation matrices P are :
The inverse of P is its transpose : P -1 = P T .
= P .
There are n!
permutation matrices for n x n matrices .

The United States Postal Service recently announced its stamps of 2010 , including one particular set that I think will be of interest to you all : The Sunday Funnies Collection !
Based on popular newspaper comic strips , the series will include stamps involving Archie , Garfield , Dennis the Menace , the cast of " Beetle Bailey , " and my personal favorites , Calvin and Hobbes !
tweetmeme_url = ' http://comicsalliance.com/2010/01/04/comic-strip-postage-stamps-coming-in-2010-for-calvin-and-hobbes/'; tweetmeme_source = ' ComicsAlliance ' ; digg_url = ' http://digg.com/comics_animation/Coming_to_Postage_Stamps_Calvin_and_Hobbs_other_Comics';
It speaks well of " Calvin and Hobbes " creator Bill Watterson -- and his decisions to both end the comic in its heyday and to resist merchandising it -- that as the strip sits among so many " classic " comic strips , it still seems fresh , exciting and vital , while most of the others just seem rote , exhausted , and exceedingly far past their prime .
While I would have vastly preferred an entire set of C&H stamps -- perhaps involving Stupendous Man , Calvinball , or snowman art -- I 'm still thrilled that I will soon be able to turn the upper right - hand corner of my envelopes into a tiny , two - way mirror where my favorite boy and tiger can make faces at me and the recipients of my letters .
The stamps go on sale in July .

They ’re commonplace , even cliché , in the United States , but they ’re now the icons of a complex transformation in China .
The country ’s ever - growing consumer culture almost requires an increased sense of individuality and its own counterculture .
And considering the shape and energy of its emerging underground music scene , it ’s hard not to project a parallel mindset onto China similar to that of the United States in the 1960s and ’70s .
But photographer Matthew Niederhauser , whose new book Sound Kapital documents the newly formed underground Beijing rock scene , says such projection is a mistake .
“ Too often , ” says Niederhauser , “ I see journalists who parachute into Beijing for a few days seeking out performers who will feed them controversial quotes . ”
The motivations of these bands , he says , are not so easily classified .
“ The music scene is not about revolution right now , but about embracing an alternative , creative and open lifestyle in Beijing — something that China desperately needs . ”
Niederhauser became immersed in Chinese culture as he traveled through the country and researched its urban development and the impact of cultural tourism in Tibet .
In 2007 he stumbled upon a small but passionate group of rockers in Beijing who stood apart from cultural norms .
He picked up a camera and started shooting .
After two years he had an impressive collection of band photos and a unique understanding of the scene .
LISTEN : “ Some Surprises Come Too Soon , ” by P.K. 14 http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/12-pk14-some-surprises-come-too-soon.mp3
China , according to Niederhauser , “ continues to face a litany of challenges . ”
Many of these stem from its “ relentless industrialization and embracement of a free market economy that tends to reinforce mindless consumerism . ”
To which , these bands are a response .
Oh yeah , and the music is good , too .
A handful of bands from the Beijing scene have recently toured the United States , drawing big crowds of fans .
Read on for arresting photos from Niederhauser ’s book and his take on China ’s shot of adrenaline into the complacency of rock music .
You can also hear songs from the compilation CD that comes with Sound Kapital .

Wired.com :
As an indie rock fan in the United States , I do n’t feel like a similar scene could exist here anymore without the bands being marginalized as posers and hipsters .
But in your photos there seems to be an authenticity in the subjects that ca n’t be faked .
Is this just my perception as a Westerner looking in , or do you think there ’s something about really tough circumstances in China leading to more authentic rock and attitude ?
Niederhauser :
The socioeconomic circumstances of China cannot be divorced from the music scene .
Beijing is undergoing an unprecedented transformation .
I originally returned in 2007 to begin a project documenting urban development and nouveau riche leisure activities .
I feel that if anything bonds these musicians together , is that they are repelled by and do n’t wish to participate in a largely vacuous and inherently unsustainable consumer culture taking hold of China .
While they might not brazenly attack the government , their embrace of such a fringe lifestyle along with the music they produce is a powerful statement in and of itself .
This choice comes with a social stigma that is hard to imagine outside of China .

LISTEN : “ Beijing Is Not My Home , ” by Demerit http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/18-demerit-beijing-is-not-my-home.mp3
There certainly is something authentic about the burst of creativity in Beijing ’s music scene , and it definitely stems from some of the tougher circumstances performers face there .
I am not saying this ca n’t happen in the United States anymore , but compared to my own experience in New York before returning to China , the performers in Beijing have an unaffected air that I could n’t really find in Manhattan or Brooklyn .
Seeing concerts in venues like D - 22 , Yugong Yishan , MAO Livehouse and 2 Kolegas simply blew me away my first month back in Beijing .
I could never have imagined something like that occurring when I first lived there in 2000 .
I feel the music scene in the United States is getting a bit too comfortable .
It seems to be bored with pleasure and reconciled to churning out a lot of the same shit to feed media giants and booking agencies .
Performers in China continue to struggle to make ends meet in a society that marginalizes anyone who marches to a different beat .
They embrace a way of life that we tend to cut down with irony or scoff at in United States .

The songs from the Sound Kapital compilation sound really well produced .
Where are these bands recording ?
Is there a burgeoning studio scene growing in parallel with the bands , or are they using old studios previously used to record other types of music ?
LISTEN : “ Cat , ” by The Gar http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/07-the-gar-cat.mp3
Niederhauser :
The bands use many different established and improvised studios in China .
There is n’t an Electric Lady Studios or Dischord House in Beijing .
Some bands even travel abroad to record like P.K. 14 .
Still , even with the current wave of solid releases , the problem is n’t a lack of good studios , but a lack of good producers .
Rock and punk in China is just taking root , and it ’s only been in the past few years that the music scene has reached a critical mass that seems to perpetuate itself with the support of independent labels .
For now , the biggest producers in China are known for churning out cloying pop tunes and rarely take on or know how to approach anything remotely unconventional .
There are some exceptions like Yuli Chen , who works on a lot of independent projects even though he also produced the sound for the Olympics opening ceremony .
Some labels like Maybe Mars even import producers such as Martin Atkins , Wharton Tiers and Brian Hardgroove .
It ’s all very ad hoc , but continues to have a lot of potential .

If this underground scene is like the ’60s or ’ 70s in the United States , a lot of these bands could stand to make a lot of money .
Could they end up becoming part of the wealth machine that so many of them are rebelling against ?
LISTEN : “ AV Terminator , ” by AV Okobu http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/02-av-okobu-av-terminator.mp3
Niederhauser :
There is certainly a lot of hope these bands will in some way gain the recognition they deserve and be able to support themselves solely through their music .
Even though most people in China refuse to fork out money for media , there is huge potential in the 1.3 billion people still unaware of such alternative music forms .
The burgeoning scene in Beijing could be the tip of the iceberg , when you take the whole country into consideration .
I can only hope that this burst of creativity continues to spark scenes in other cities .
Shanghai , Wuhan and Guangzhou already sport steady concert scenes and continue to produce new talent .
I think it is only a matter of time until this spreads through the interior of the country .
( more below )
As for the wealth machine , it is too early to tell .
Converse consistently throws money around and even sponsored a tour for P.K. 14 and Queen Sea Big Shark that met with great success without being overtly commercial .
Red Bull and Pepsi also sponsor over - hyped “ Battle of the Bands ” competitions that many performers refuse to participate in , as the companies try to tie them to their products in an unseemly manner .
There also seems to be big bucks in the large music festivals popping up around the country that can draw up to tens of thousands of kids .
Stuff like this is very new to the scene .
Unfortunately all of this commercial involvement with larger shows can also draw the conservative eye of the Cultural Ministry , who are more than ready to cut performers off , like they did to foreign bands and Rebuilding the Rights of Statues ( ReTROS ) for this year ’s Modern Sky Festival in October .

What gear and setup did you use to shoot the portraits ?
Niederhauser : I shot all the portraits with a Canon 5D and a single strobe hooked up to a Profoto 7B pack in RAW .
The Canon 5D was the first digital camera that I felt really rivaled film in quality .
I can easily make 20 × 24 prints that are supersharp .
LISTEN : “ Hard Heart , ” by Queen Sea Big Shark http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/01-queen-sea-big-shark-hard-heart.mp3
As for lenses , I relied primarily on the Canon EF 16 - 35 mm L II with my Canon EF 24 - 70 mm filling in the gaps .
I also have a lot of film from the music scene that I shot on a 35 mm Ricoh GR1V , but when shooting portraits and concerts I really lay into the shutter and sometimes need to take over a thousand shots in a night to get what I want .

All of the photos are taken against the same exact wall in the back room of D - 22 .
It has a lot of character with its chips and stains , while its ruddy tone allows the person to pop out of the background .
More importantly , it ties everyone together .
You know all the performers are going to the same place and provides an underlying visual link for Beijing ’s music scene .

Do you think there ’s something inherently individualistic or rebellious about loud rock music , or are these rockers well - versed in the Western music scenes that they resemble and are emulating them ?
LISTEN : “ My Great Location , ” by Rebuilding the Rights of Statues http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/10-rebuilding-the-rights-of-statues-my-great-location.mp3
Niederhauser :
The performers in Beijing are now well - versed in the Western music canon , but their sound is certainly not a simple emulation .
Nearly 60 years of rock and punk was suddenly dumped on Chinese youth about 10 years ago , and how they continue to pick it apart and digest the fragments manifests in many different ways .
There are over a dozen highly individualistic acts that continue to amaze me including Xiao He , Carsick Cars , AV Okubu , Rebuilding the Rights of Statues , Lonely China Day , P.K. 14 , Snapline , Guai Li , Demerit , Hedgehog and many more .
Rock and punk and even hip - hop and electronica no longer split into clear Western and Eastern divides .
No matter where you are in the world , this type of music emerges from urban environments in distinctly different ways .
Beijing , for now , is in the middle of creative orgy , and it is hard to see what will come out of the mess .

What reception have these bands had in the United States ?
Do you think we like the music for its novel origins , or do you find that the music is innovative even if you put it on the same level as U.S. rock ?
LISTEN : “ Zhong Nan Hai , ” by Carsick Cars http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/19-carsick-cars-zhong-nan-hai.mp3
Niederhauser : I just finished a three - week tour of the East Coast with Carsick Cars , P.K. 14 , and Xiao He for the Maybe Mars Chinese Underground Showcase .
The crowds and other local bands who played with them responded enthusiastically throughout the tour , especially in Washington and New York as well as a number of colleges .
These bands are playing energetic and infectious concerts on a nightly basis .
You really can’t plug them as a novelty act .
I would n’t have spent two years documenting all of the performers if I thought the music sucked in the first place .

Where do these musicians practice ?
Are there garages or some equivalent where the bands can rehearse ?
Or do they have to rent space somewhere ?
Niederhauser :
There are more and more practice spaces emerging in Beijing and especially in Tongzhou , a nearby suburb where bands flock due to low rents and living costs .
LISTEN : “ Sunday Girl , ” by Ourself Beside Me http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/06-ourself-beside-me-sunday-girl.mp3
Still , a lot of bands are now complaining about practice spaces being hard to book even as they continue to crop up in back hutongs or cramped rooms attached to basement parking garages around the city .
There are definitely notorious spaces that some of the more established bands continually use , but landlords often jack up rates due to noise complaints , or kick people out unexpectedly .
Wired.com :
Where do they get their gear ?
Are there music stores like Guitar Center selling electric guitars and amps , or do they order them online ?
Or are there boutique music shops ?
LISTEN : “ Spring House , ” by White http://www.wired.com/images_blogs/rawfile/2009/12/05-white-spring-house.mp3
Niederhauser :
There are tons of boutique music shops popping up all over the city , especially along Gulou Dongdajie which is near the Drum and Bell Towers in northern Beijing .
People also shop online domestically , while companies like Gibson continue to get a foothold by offering instruments to bands for use during recordings .
Still , some musicians on the recent Maybe Mars Chinese Underground Showcase in the U.S. were consistently scouring eBay for items they could n’t find in China .

" One of our first patients , just 17 years old , was brought to us in a wheelchair , " says Professor Christer Lindquist , a pioneer in the use of a brain surgery technique for people with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder ( OCD ) , known as Gamma Knife .
" This boy would set himself maths problems , which he had to solve before he could eat .
His OCD had become so severe , and the maths problems he set himself so complex , that he could n't solve them any more , so he could n't eat . "
At Butler hospital in Providence , Rhode Island , Lindquist and colleagues put the boy in an MRI - like machine and passed beams of gamma radiation through his brain .
These beams converged on a pinpoint - accurate spot where they created a lesion that damaged a tiny area of tissue , blocking the pathway that caused the OCD symptoms .
This is modern psychosurgery , a hi-tech , experimental , descendant of the now infamous frontal lobotomy .
It could offer hope to millions suffering from OCD , and other disorders such as severe depression .
Over the past 10 years , Gamma Knife has become a highly effective treatment for brain tumours and there are now several Gamma Knife centres in the UK .
Nick Plowman , consultant clinical oncologist at St Bartholomew 's hospital , London , says that before Gamma Knife , an acoustic neuroma– a benign brain tumour – would require a major operation .
" Now you can do it in a fraction of the time , without opening the head , whilst the patient listens to music . "
Successful for nine out of 10 patients with this type of brain tumour , the radiation stops the tumour cells from reproducing , and in time they 'll die .
The surgery is also now widely used to treat certain brain conditions , such as a rare form of epilepsy and a condition called trigeminal neuralgia , where the patient experiences shooting pains in the face .
Still , it could be a while before OCD sufferers will be offered Gamma Knife surgery in the UK .
For this and other psychological problems , such as depression , Gamma Knife is still considered by many to be highly controversial .
OCD affects around 2 - 3 % of the UK population , and the usual treatments are medication or Cognitive Behavioural Therapy ( CBT ) .
But these do n't work for everyone .
Joel Rose , director of the UK charity OCD Action , is not surprised that some are prepared to try experimental brain surgery .
" People become paralysed , " he says .
" They 're in a despairing state and they 'll try anything to get out of it . "
However , many surgeons believe that we do n't know enough about the brain circuits to tamper with them .
" When it comes to treating OCD and other psychological disorders , Gamma Knife is totally unproven , " says Plowman .
It is certainly in its infancy .
Lindquist carried out the first Gamma Knife treatments for OCD at Butler / Rhode Island in 1992 .
Since then , 56 people have had the procedure .
About 60 % of the patients at Rhode Island were much improved , but many were left with residual symptoms .
" This might all sound lame , " says Lindquist , " But you have to bear in mind that these people are suffering severely .
They 've been treated for years with the most advanced drugs and CBT . "
It can take up to a year to see any improvement , and " even if neurosurgical intervention is successful , " says Richard Marsland , a psychologist at Butler who helps screen the patients , " they have to be included in an aftercare programme .
Most patients acquired their OCD at an early age , and missed at least part of their normal development . . . they have to catch up . "
Gerry Radano , a former flight attendant from New York State , is one of the most vocal supporters of Gamma Knife for OCD .
She was in three psychiatric hospitals and tried every medication available before having the surgery .
" Gamma Knife is the best thing that ever happened to my OCD life , " she writes on her website .
But there are scare stories .
One Ohio hospital stopped performing the procedure after a law suit in 2002 , when a patient was left partially paralysed .
" This should never happen , " says Lindquist .
In fact , he says " the main risks for the surgery are temporary lethargy or loss of initiative if too high a dose is given , which happens in around 10 % of cases " .
The technique certainly could not be further from the brutal lobotomies made famous by Ken Kesey 's novel , One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest .
While the frontal lobotomy essentially destroys part of the brain , Gamma Knife is highly accurate and non-invasive , damaging only a minute area - 100 millimetres square - of brain tissue .
It is usually done as an out - patient procedure .
Some might experience a mild headache afterwards , but most report no physical problems at all .
" One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest did psychosurgery no favours , " says Lindquist .
" The treatment of psychiatric disorders is still surrounded by an aura of mysticism .
We think about the psyche as something magical , and are n't willing to accept that a psychological disease could be a transmitter problem , just like Parkinson 's disease . "
However , for OCD he admits , " it 's still controversial .
We have to be extremely careful that patients have exhausted all other avenues . "
As for the 17 - year - old boy Lindquist operated on years ago ?
He is now a doctor himself .

This week is thanksgiving week in the US , so it seems fitting that we should have a list especially for our American readers .
This list looks at 10 of the great moments in the history of the US – ten of the reasons that you are giving thanks this week .
These are in reverse chronological order , but they are also ( coincidentally ) very close to being in order of importance .
10 Barack Obama elected president 2008
It was a symbolic moment in the history of the United States when the last racial barrier in American politics was overcome .
Just 143 years earlier , the man who would now hold the supreme office in U.S. government could have been a possession , another man ’s property .
President - elect Obama said , “ If there is anyone out there who still doubts that America is a place where all things are possible , who still wonders if the dream of our founders is alive in our time , who still questions the power of our democracy , tonight is your answer .
“ The road ahead will be long , our climb will be steep … I promise you that we as a people will get there . ”
9 Armstrong walks on the moon 1969
The moment seemed to generate memorable quotations .
When Apollo 11 , the first manned lunar mission , made contact with the surface of the moon , there was “ The Eagle has landed . ”
When Neil Armstrong became the first man to set foot on the moon , he said , “ That ’s one small step for a man , one giant leap for mankind . ”
But the quotations did n’t end there .
Frank Borman later was quoted by U.N. Secretary General U
Thant as saying , “ We saw the earth the size of a quarter and we recognized that there really is one world .
We are all brothers . ”
A favorite Armstrong quote is , “ I believe the good Lord gave us a finite number of heartbeats and I ’ll be damned if I ’m going to use up mine running up and down a street . ”
8 The Civil Rights Act 1964
The text of the bill was simple and straightforward : “ No person in the United States shall on grounds of race , color , or national origin , be excluded from participation in , be denied the benefits of or be subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving federal financial assistance . ”
Overnight , it became illegal to force segregation in schools , workplaces , and housing .
Racial discrimination was n’t dead , but it was dying .
The addition of “ sex ” as a protected category was added by a southern legislator in the hopes that Democrats relying heavily on support from labor unions would defeat the bill .
Unexpectedly , the bill gave women ’s rights advocates additional ammunition .
7 The Marshall Plan 1947
Considered by some to be the noblest undertaking in American history , and by others to be a waste of the $ 12,000,000,000 that was eventually spent on the plan , the European recovery program had three objectives .
George Marshall , Secretary of State under President Harry Truman , designed the program to promote European production , bolster European currency , and facilitate trade after the devastating effects of World War II .
The purpose was to help Europe recover as a healthy trading partner and ally , and to repel the Communist threat from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union .
Marshall laid the groundwork for a revitalized Europe and the establishment of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization .
He received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1953 .
6 Women ’s suffrage 1920
The right of women to vote was achieved through decades of devoted work by determined men and women .
In 1840 , Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Lucretia Mott traveled to London as delegates to the World Anti-Slavery Convention .
Because they were women , they were denied the right to speak .
They determined to form an organization to fight for women ’s equal rights .
Over the years , supporters of women ’s suffrage resorted to mass marches , hunger strikes , and denial of conjugal privileges to husbands who were opposed .
In 1893 , New Zealand became the first country to grant women the right to vote at the federal level .
Australia followed suit in 1902 , but it was not until 1920 , when President Woodrow Wilson advocated for the women ’s right as a war measure , that the 19th Amendment granted American women the right to vote .
Wilson ’s decision followed daily picketing of the White House by hundreds of women .
By the time the amendment was passed , 500 women had been arrested there for loitering , and another 168 for obstructing traffic .
5 The Emancipation Proclamation 1863
Lincoln believed that the purpose of the Civil War was to preserve the union .
He wrote to Horace Greeley , “ If I could save the union without freeing any slave , I would do it .
If I could save the union by freeing all slaves , I would do it .
If I could save the union by freeing some and leaving others alone , I would also do that . ”
The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in states loyal to the union or in states that had been reconquered .
It only freed slaves in states “ in rebellion that had not laid down arms by January 1 , 1863 . ”
Nor did it make slavery illegal .
That change came with the Thirteenth Amendment in 1865 .
It did accomplish important steps , however .
Twenty thousand slaves were freed immediately , and many more rushed to join the union advance into the South .
Moreover , the proclamation won approval in France and Great Britain , effectively ending the Confederate States ’ hope for recognition by those countries .
Ultimately , more than 4,000,000 slaves were freed .
4 Lewis and Clark arrive at the Pacific 1805
They were not the first settlers of Northern European origin .
The natives there were quite accustomed to trading with white men , and Station Camp , near where the Columbia River empties into the Pacific Ocean , had 36 houses .
Moreover , the Northwest Passage they had sought did not exist .
Hoping that the Missouri River would gently lead to the sea had been in vain .
The Missouri and the Columbia both had huge rapids and cataracts making river travel difficult and in some places impossible .
But their journey had not been without value .
Arriving at the Pacific coast exactly one year , six months , and one day after leaving St. Louis , Lewis and Clark had collected plant specimens , studied new animal species , and acquired priceless information about the geography and inhabitants of what would be the western United States .
3 Louisiana Purchase 1803
President Thomas Jefferson faced a dilemma .
Napoleon Bonaparte ’s aggression made it likely that New Orleans , which was paramount in international trade , and the Mississippi River , which was vital for national and international commerce , could be closed to U.S. trade .
He had learned in 1801 that Spain had retroceded its territory to France in a secret compact .
But the Constitution had no provision for acquiring territory .
Ultimately , Jefferson took matters into his own hands and dispatched envoys to see if Napoleon would sell .
The emperor , facing a war with Great Britain , realized that he was unlikely to be able to defend the territory .
He decided to sell for a total cost , including forgiven debts , of $ 15,000,000 .
The purchase doubled the country , including the territory of fourteen states .
Napoleon was satisfied , as well .
He said , “ I have given England a maritime rival who sooner or later will humble her pride . ”
2 Ratification of the Constitution 1789
The Federal Convention which had drafted the Constitution had no authority to impose it .
An elaborate four - step plan for ratification was adopted .
1 . The Constitution was submitted to Congress .
2 . Congress transmitted the Constitution to the state legislatures .
3 . Each state elected delegates to attend a convention and decide whether to ratify .
4 . Ratification by at least nine of the thirteen colonies was required .
This plan avoided the hostility of states ’ rights advocates and made the Constitution less vulnerable to changes of opinion .
In September of 1787 , the Congress bitterly debated the Constitution and ultimately submitted it to the states with neither an endorsement nor a condemnation .
The Constitution was validly before the people .
The first five ratifications came quickly , but Massachusetts demanded a means of amending the document as a condition of ratification .
This demand ultimately led to the passage of the first ten amendments , known as the Bill of Rights .
Final acceptance of the document by the states took place in July , 1788 .
1 Declaration of Independence 1776
Arriving at consensus was no small feat .
At the beginning of the month , only eight of the thirteen colonies were in favor of independence , with New York abstaining from the vote pending a local decision .
The American Prohibitory
Act had made all vessels and cargoes from the colonies forfeit to the Crown , and in May King George had issued an order hiring German mercenaries to fight the colonies , which he now considered to be in total rebellion .
Still , many believed the rift could be patched up .
Jefferson was dispatched by a committee to write up a declaration explaining the views of those who favored independence .
He completed the document in two weeks , starting on June 11 , 1776 .
Then Benjamin Franklin and John Adams made additions and deletions , and at last it was presented to the full congress , where redaction went on until late at night on July 3 .
Finally , on July 4 , 1776 , all thirteen colonies signed “ … the fragile object which bears so great a weight of meaning to our people . ”

Ah , the holidays .
' Tis the season to move into the relationship danger zone .
We get so stressed out about buying the right presents , staying within our holiday budget , or trying to please impossible in - laws that the tension inevitably spills over into our love lives .
" It 's naturally a time of high stress and high expectations , " says Carol J. Bruess , Ph.D. , the director of family studies at the University of St. Thomas , in St. Paul , Minnesota , and co-author of " What Happy Couples Do : Belly Button Fuzz & Bare - Chested Hugs -- The Loving Little Rituals of Romance . "
" Our culture creates images of the perfect gathering , the perfect feast , the perfect happy family gathered around the tree , the perfect couple exchanging perfectly thoughtful gifts . "
The reality , of course , is nowhere near perfect .
However , just as much as planning ahead will enable you to handle all the shopping and cookie - making , it can also help you to troubleshoot any potential relationship drama -- and nip it in the bud before you 're tempted to put coal in your guy 's stocking .
Thanks to this expert advice , the only romantic issue you 'll have this December is where to hang the mistletoe .
The problem : Having expectations that are too high
The solution :
Be honest about what you really need -- but do n't ask for the moon
The most common mistake people in relationships make around the holidays ?
Having expectations that are too high -- and not voicing them .
" People often think their significant others should be able to read their minds , " says psychiatrist Dr. Mark Goulston , the author of " Just Listen : Discover the Secret to Getting Through to Absolutely Anyone . "
But , as he points out , it 's unreasonable to expect your significant other to automatically know what you want , and that will leave you feeling resentful when he does n't live up to your unspoken hopes .
Preempt a problem by making an effort to be clear about what you 'd like him to do for you this December .
Health.com :
What to do if your sex partner refuses to wear a condom
But if it 's your partner who tends to get upset because you can't guess whether there are visions of sugarplums dancing in his head , ask him , " What can I do to make sure this is a special Christmas for you ? "
Bruess puts it this way : " If you talk with each other in a frank and honest way about what you do expect , you can help each other bring those high expectations down so the experience can be more positive . "
The problem : Your partner never feels appreciated
The solution :
Go out of your way to say thank you
On the other side of the coin , some of us are n't great at accepting gifts gracefully .
" Many people have a hard time accepting gifts , compliments , even love .
If you have negative reactions to receiving , allowing yourself to accept the things from loved ones can be a difficult task , " says Barton Goldsmith , Ph.D. , the author of " Emotional Fitness for Couples : 10 Minutes a Day to a Better Relationship . "
In fact , as he points out , sometimes we can even prevent our partners from giving us all sorts of things -- including affection -- by consistently pulling away or failing to respond with gratitude .
Talking about how you do n't deserve such a nice gift ( or a flattering compliment ) wo n't boost your partner 's ego .
" My wife has these three rules for feedback .
Ask yourself :
Is it true ?
Is it kind ?
Is it necessary ? " says John C. Friel , a licensed psychologist in Las Vegas , Reno , Nevada , and Minneapolis , Minnesota , and co-author of " The Seven Best Things ( Happy ) Couples Do . "
Health.com : 8 tips for telling your partner a secret
If you have an especially difficult time being on the receiving end of small kindnesses , make more of a conscious effort to show how thankful you are .
" A response as simple as ' Where did you find this ?!
It 's wonderful ! ' will take you a long way towards strengthening your bond with your partner , " says Friel .
So , make a mental note to tell your significant other exactly how you will use the present he or she gave you , or why you like it so much .
Also , even if you live with your partner , write a thank - you note that details how thoughtful he or she is .
Or , try the approach that works for 38 - year - old Amy Spencer , from Los Angeles , California .
" Two Christmases ago , I decided to be clear about what I wanted : a sweater .
I then dropped hints about a black cashmere V - neck at J.Crew I liked , " says Spencer , the author of the forthcoming book " Meeting Your Half - Orange : An Utterly Upbeat Guide to Using Dating Optimism to Find Your Perfect Match . "
Health.com : Top 10 myths about safe sex
" On Christmas morning , I opened up my present to find a sweater - - a pink , cable - knit cotton one .
I was disappointed , but I wanted to say thank you that morning from my heart .
Instead of lying by thanking him for the perfect sweater , I was thanking him for how excited he was about getting me what he thought I wanted , for the care he took in choosing a flattering color , for being in my life to get me a gift in the first place ! "
And the next time Spencer wants something that specific , " I 'll just tear out the catalog page and tape it to the mirror . "
The problem : Fighting with your in - laws
The solution : Being the queen of small talk
Perhaps you think your sister - in - law is crazy because she pays obsessive attention to her three dogs while ignoring her ailing grandfather .
Or maybe your boyfriend 's mother likes to pick irritating fights about politics .
Regardless of how much you dislike certain relatives , resolve to be the bigger person and put your differences aside for the season .
" From now until January 2 , remember that small talk is the glue that holds society together , " says Friel .
Tell yourself that any and all touchy subjects are off limits .
If someone tries to start an argument by asking a loaded question about the state of the economy -- or about whether you 're ever going to find a new job -- Friel has a plan of attack .
" First , acknowledge that you heard what your interlocutor said with a simple statement like , ' It 's a very difficult time right now . ' "
( Ignoring your nemesis is n't wise ; that could make her all the more angry or aggressive . )
As soon as you 've responded neutrally , promptly steer the conversation in another direction -- by talking about how delicious the potatoes au gratin she made were , for example .

To make sure you 're not the one making waves , remember your audience .
If Grandma does n't want to be reminded that you and her favorite grandson are co-habitating before marriage , or you know your take on the health - care debate wo n't go over well , avoid those topics .
Skipping touchy subjects with the relatives can save couples an argument on the way home .
The problem :
Too many parties to attend , too many relatives to see
The solution : Travel solo so you can set your own priorities without stressing
Do you and your guy always fight about how long you 're going to stay at your college roommate 's annual tree - trimming party , or his office buddy 's yearly Evening O' Eggnog ?
Make life easier by taking separate cars to any events that might cause tension ; there 's nothing wrong with setting individual schedules during such a busy time of the year .
Feeling guilty about the size of your carbon footprint ?
Then think about hitching a ride home with a friend .
Or , if you and your beau only own one car between the two of you , consider calling a taxi .
" If you know there 's a good chance of a fight or tension if you do n't take separate modes of transportation , do n't let anything stop you from doing it , " says Friel .
Two motor vehicles can also come in handy on the big day itself , particularly if you would otherwise battle over how long to stick around at all the different houses on your Christmas agenda .
" If you need to spend more time with your own family , and your boyfriend would like to spend the majority of the day at his parents ' place , splitting up makes perfect sense , " says Friel .
He points out that Christmas comes but once a year , and it 's understandable if you or your spouse feel you really need to make your parents happy on the big day .
That 's why 35 - year - old Judy , from Brooklyn , New York , rarely spends December 25 with her partner .
" His parents are each twice divorced , and my parents are divorced too -- which means there are so many people who want to see us during the holidays that we 're usually forced to spend them apart , " she says .
" Otherwise , our families are so wounded that it 's just not worth it .
So we 've become resigned to spending the actual holiday apart -- although we also have our own celebration later in the month , just the two of us . "
What 's more , Friel points out that by simply resolving to cut back on 25 percent of what you were planning to do in the next few weeks , you could eliminate a substantial amount of stress .
( And , yes , we think that Uncle Fred 's Christmas Karaoke Night is the first thing to cross off your list . )
The problem : Your emotions -- and stress levels -- are running high
The solution : Since alcohol can increase the risk of an emotional outburst , limit yourself to two drinks at a party
Though many of us think a few stiff Christmas cocktails are all we need to get through an awkward gathering , the reality is that booze often makes things worse .
Says Friel , " Even one or two drinks can affect your emotions " -- and that 's particularly true during a time that 's so intense to begin with .
" If you 're going into any situation that you think might be problematic , limit your alcohol intake . "
Instead of helping you calm down or relax , intoxication is likely to exacerbate any anxiety , hurt , or shame that might come to the surface -- for example , it could make matters worse if you go to a party where your husband 's old girlfriend is going to be in attendance .
By sipping at your wine instead of chugging Jäger shots , you could prevent a post - festivities screaming match with the person you love .

Surprise , surprise , seems like pro-life extremist Randall Terry was at the center of that incident at Speaker Pelosi ’s office where a bunch of Tea Partiers got arrested .
Somehow he did n’t get arrested though .
Video after the jump …
I had to cover my eyes to watch this video the first time I was shown it .
But then I kept peeking through my fingers .
Totally amazing .
It ’s hard for me to imagine ever having the skill required to appear to fly that badly .
It ’s awesome .
He ’s got incredible control .
The pilot is Kyle Franklin from Franklin ’s Flying Circus & Airshow .
He is married to the beautiful Amanda Younkin , who manages Franklin ’s Flying Circus and Younkin Airshows .
Kyle and Bobby Younkin are the pilots – although Amanda can fly as well .
When she was featured in the 2010 Bombshell calendar , she was the only babe to fly the planes as well as pose in front of them .
( Hey , another great gift idea !
You can buy the calendar online at My Bombshells )
A high resolution copy of film can be downloaded from their website along with a dozen other clips of the circus in action at Franklin ’s Flying Circus Video Page .
This particular clip is the one marked as “ Comedy Act Video Download ” and worth watching full - screen on the biggest monitor you can find .
The website also includes details of Jimmy Franklin and Bobby Younkin , who tragically crashed at the Saskatchewan Centennial Air Show in 2005 .
Their air show team , Masters of Disaster was one of the most sought after in the industry at the time of the accident .
I enjoyed reading the short essays but was especially entranced by the descriptions of Kyle Franklin growing up with airshows as a standard backdrop of his childhood :
Kyle grew up living in a hangar - house in Ruidoso , NM .
The hangar soon became his favorite playground as well as a place where he and his father shared quality time servicing Waco ’s , Super Cubs , and the Aerostar .
Kyle ’s first airplane ride was four weeks after his birth .
Father Jimmy taught him how to fly when he was eight years old and later taught him aerobatics .
As a toddler , Kyle seized every opportunity to wing - walk in Dad ’s Waco Mystery Ship as it taxied on about on the ground at air shows .
Kyle took his first airborne wing - walk at age 14 , and just three years later he was wing - walking professionally at age 17 .
I am definitely hoping to see more of Kyle , Bobby and Amanda and Franklin ’s Flying Circus & Airshow .

Also , do n’t miss the view from inside the cockpit which I posted here : Another Angle of Drunk Stealing Plane at Airshow

A woman from Tambov , Russia known as the “ Black Widow ” because she loves horror films and spiders , is currently on trial for drugging and raping 10 men .
The woman , known only as Valeria K. , would lure men back to her apartment where she would serve them drinks laced with a powerful sedative that would put them to sleep for about 24 hours .
She would then undress them , stimulate them and tie a rope around their penis to keep it erect while she had sex sith them .
The men would end up in hospital with symptoms of poisoning and penis trauma after they awoke .
When police were called , all the men told them about a hot brunette woman they had been fooling around with before they blacked out .
With descriptions of the woman from so many victims , police were able to arrest Valeria K. for rape .
So far , police know about 10 victims , but only 9 of them are pressing charges against her .
The 10th man is refusing to press charges , saying he remembers bits and pieces of the incident and enjoyed it .
He says “ like hot women , ” and thought the assault “ was great . ”
He does however , regret that he was drugged and could n’t remember more .
The authors find that despite the popular notions about overconsumption , a typical family spends less on clothing today , discounted for inflation , than in the early 1970's .
Similarly , it spends less on large appliances and on food , including going out to restaurants .
As for vacation homes , the data suggest that 3.2 percent of families had them in 1973 , and that 4 percent do now .
Is this affluenza ?
Rather , what families spend a lot more on , the authors calculate , is a house in a safe neighborhood with a good school -- about 70 percent more a year , discounted for inflation , for the typical family of four .
The scarcity of good schooling has created a bidding war that drives up house prices in first - rate school districts .
And these families are not buying huge new homes .
The average home size has been skewed upward by the wealthy .
The typical family 's house is , in fact , only a half room or so larger than it was 30 years ago .
The other factors driving spending are largely the costs of the two - income family .
The authors find that typical payments for day care and preschool for two children can add enormously to the household budget .
Two workers also make a second car a necessity , and often a good second car .
Also , the cost of health insurance is often up , even when spouses work , because corporate benefit plans are demanding higher employee contributions .
For the typical family of four , it is up by 60 percent .
And two incomes often mean a substantial increase in taxes because the family moves into a higher tax bracket .
The upshot is that two - income families often have even less income left over today than did an equivalent single - income family 30 years ago , even when they make almost twice as much .
And they go deeper in debt .
The authors find that it is not the free - spending young or the incapacitated elderly who are declaring bankruptcy so much as families with children .
Cynthia Stewart , a junior at Tharptown High School in northern Alabama , wanted to bring her girlfriend to prom .
Rather than let her , the school announced that it would cancel prom for everyone .
Cynthia Stewart , a 17 - year - old junior at Tharptown High School in northern Alabama , was a member of her school ’s prom planning committee , had personally raised over $ 200 for the prom , and created the theme her classmates had chosen for the dance .
She is also an out lesbian .
When Cynthia approached her principal to ask if she could bring her girlfriend with her to the prom , he said no .
He also made Cynthia remove a sticker she was wearing that said , “ I am a lesbian , ” telling her , “ You do n't have that much freedom of speech at school . ”
Cynthia ’s aunt and guardian , Kathy Baker , then appealed the principal ’s decision to the school board .
But the board let the decision to bar Cynthia from bringing her girlfriend to the prom stand .
STATUS : Victory !
Franklin County School System officials have reversed their decision and allowed Cynthia to bring her girlfriend to prom .
One of the oddest things to happen in the past year has been the fight between John Taylor and his Taylor Rule .
It started on April 27 , 2009 , when Krishna Guha wrote an article : Fed study puts ideal interest rate at - 5 % " > :
The ideal interest rate for the US economy in current conditions would be minus 5 per cent , according to internal analysis prepared for the Federal Reserve 's last policy meeting .
The analysis was based on a so - called Taylor - rule approach that estimates an appropriate interest rate based on unemployment and inflation .
A central bank cannot cut interest rates below zero .
However , the staff research suggests the Fed should maintain unconventional policies that provide stimulus roughly equivalent to an interest rate of minus 5 per cent ....
The assessment that the US central bank needs to provide stimulus equivalent to a substantially negative interest rate is unlikely to have changed ahead of this week 's policy meeting .... [ M] any Fed officials expect they may well keep rates near zero for another 18 months to two years and some might see value in making this more explicit ....
The last meeting saw the Fed buy long - term treasuries for the first time in decades .
The large initial impact of the move on markets is no longer visible , but officials think the policy was reasonably successful .
Previous staff analysis suggested the $ 300 bn purchase would reduce the yield on 10 - year treasuries by 25 - 35 basis points , and officials think the rate today is about this much lower than it would have been if they had not started buying .
Further purchases are possible , particularly if the Fed again downgrades its economic forecasts .
The staff analysis comparing unconventional operations to interest rate cuts suggests more might be needed anyway ...
I believe that Krishna Guha was reporting on a study like that of Glenn Rudebusch 's San Francisco Fed " The Fed 's Monetary Policy Response to the Current Crisis " http://www.frbsf.org/publications/economics/letter/2009/el2009-17.html with this chart :
which is in turn based on a 2006 Rudebusch paper in the International Journal of Central Banking http://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb06q4a4.htm containing Rudebusch 's estimated Taylor Rule :
Then two weeks later John Taylor , in his speech " Systemic Risk and the Role of Government " http://www.frbatlanta.org/news/CONFEREN/09fmc/taylor.pdf, fires back , saying not so :
According to a widely cited article4 appearing in the Financial Times two weeks ago , the Fed ’s Taylor rule calculations show that the interest rate should be - 5 percent .
The article was based on a leaked report from the Fed .... [ T ]he calculations are way off .
The Taylor rule specifically says that the interest rate should be one and a half times the inflation rate plus a half times the GDP gap plus one .
Whether you average a broad based GDP inflation index over the past year , as I originally suggested , or whether you use core inflation rates , the inflation rate is not less than 1 percent at this time ; it is closer to 2 percent , but let ’s suppose the Fed takes it as 1 percent .
The GDP gap seems to be around minus 4 percent .
Now , if we put those numbers into the rule , we get 11 ⁄2 times 1 , plus 1 ⁄ 2 times - 4 , plus 1 , which equals .5 percent not - 5 percent .
The Fed ’s calculation reported in the Financial Times has both the sign and the decimal point wrong .
In contrast my calculation implies that we may not have as much time before the Fed has to ... raise the [ federal funds ] rate ...
At the time it seemed to me that there were two things wrong with Taylor 's speech :
With a May unemployment rate of 9.4 % and an Okun 's Law coefficient of 2 , an output gap of 4 % would imply a NAIRU of 7.4 %-- and yet every estimated NAIRU I know of is somewhere close to 5 - 6 % , implying an output gap not of 4 % but of 7 % to 9 % .
There is a key ambiguity in what a " Taylor Rule " is : is it the original rule with the original parameters set out by John Taylor in 1993 , or is it a rule of that form that central banks happen to follow ?
When Glenn Rudebusch writes :
A rough guideline for setting the federal funds rate that captures the Fed 's behavior over the past two decades is provided by a simple equation that relates the funds rate to the inflation and unemployment rates .
This equation is obtained by a statistical regression of the funds rate on the inflation rate and on the gap between the unemployment rate and the Congressional Budget Office 's estimate of the natural , or normal , rate of unemployment .
The resulting empirical policy rule of thumb — a so - called Taylor rule — recommends lowering the funds rate by 1.3 percentage points if core inflation falls by one percentage point and by almost two percentage points if the unemployment rate rises by one percentage point ...
This is the rule :
i = 2.4 + 1.39 π + 0.92ygap
that Glenn found gives the best fit to actual Fed policy between 1987 and 2005 .
He calls this a Taylor Rule -- and it is this rule that says that the federal funds rate right now should be - 5 % .
John Taylor , by contrast , says that the Taylor Rule is the rule :
i = 1 + 1.5 π + 0.5ygap
back in 1993 that he found fitted Fed behavior from 1987 - 1992
So we have two different questions and answers .
Glenn Rudebusch asks : " If the Federal Reserve could set the Fed Funds rate negative and were following the same reaction function it follows in the late 1980s , 1990s , and early 2000s , where would it want to set the Federal Funds rate ? "
And the answer is : " - 5 % . " :
John Taylor asks : " If the Federal Reserve were to set the Fed Funds rate according to the particular reaction function that in 1993 I fittd over 1987 - 1992 , where would it want to set the Federal Funds rate ? "
And the answer is : " 0.5 % . "
Seems to me that John Taylor in the long run wants " Taylor Rule " to mean any statistically - fitted reaction function in which interest rates respond to inflation and the output gap and not to the one rule he fitted over 1987 - 1992 , Abd us seens to me that a rule fitted over 18 years should probably be preferred over one estimated over 6 years in a time span that ended more than 15 years ago .
But chacon a son gout ...
This is worth revisiting because recently John Taylor has renewed the argument that the Federal Reserve should be massively cutting back on reserves and raising interest rates , if not now then at least soon :
John Hilsenrath : Q&A : John Taylor on His Rule : Hilsenrath :
There ’s been a lot of debate about how to use the Taylor rule in this kind of environment .
What is your view of what the Taylor rule is saying given where the economy is ?

There are disagreements , but if you look at average estimates of inflation and the GDP gap you get a fed funds rate of close to zero .
That ’s not based on a forecast of inflation or an excessive GDP gap .
It is not perfect , but that is where we are .
Some people are saying it should be minus five .
Hilsenrath : Using your rule .
Taylor : Not really .
As far as I ’ve been able to tell you have to change the rule to get that .
For example , you have to have a higher coefficient for the output gap to get that .
And some people use forecasts .
They do n’t use the current level .
They stick forecasts of inflation or the output gap into their models .
They might extrapolate out what the forecast is saying .
Some of them are forecasting declining inflation .
They put that in and that will lower the rate too .
In terms of the actual Taylor rule , I do n’t see how anyone can get minus 5 from that .
Hilsenrath :
One could argue that using a forecast is right because you want policy to be forward looking .
Taylor : No I disagree .
In fact the original way the Taylor rule was formulated was specifically to say that you should get the best estimate of where you are right now and then you react to it this way .
It already builds in forecasts .
After all policy makers have to use current information , whether it ’s commodity markets or current GDP .
They ca n’t see the future .
They have to project out from current observed things .
You put the current observed things into the rule .
That ’s all you have anyway .
And then you see what the best coefficients are to get the fed funds rate .
I do n’t think it ’s correct to say you have to put forecasts in ...
It seems to me that the best way to avoid confusion is to redefine " Taylor Rule " : henceforth " Taylor Rule " should mean only i=1.5 π +0.5ygap , and we need to find some other name for reaction functions fitted to central - bank behavior .
This morning , the Senate banking committee voted 16 to 7 to reconfirm Ben Bernanke as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve .
Now the full Senate must also agree that Bernanke should keep his job .
I was watching a news show this morning that implied the Senate could balk and decide not to give the Fed chair a second term .
That 's just sensationalist banter , however .
There 's no way Bernanke 's reconfirmation will fail .
Do n't get me wrong : I think there are a fair number of Senators on both side of the aisle that do not like the job Bernanke has done .
Some wish he 'd anticipated the crisis better and taken more action sooner .
Others think he has n't done enough to help Main Street recover and reduce the very high unemployment rate .
But it would n't be Washington without politics .
Let 's look at the situation from each political party .
First , would Democrats really spurn President Obama by rejecting his nomination ?
That would weaken the President 's credibility in the eyes of the public .
It would also make the party appear to be strongly divided .
There 's no way a majority of Democrats would let that happen .
How about Republicans ?
They might love to stick one to Obama , right ?
Not under this circumstance .
If they reject Bernanke , then Obama gets to pick someone new .
Remember President George W. Bush appointed Bernanke , who identifies himself as a Republican .
Do Republicans really believe they 'll be happier with a different Obama pick than Bernanke ?
If they do , then they 're kidding themselves .
Deep down , they must believe they would be a lot better off with Bernanke than any alternative the President might suggest .
Those who vote against Bernanke will likely be fringe figures in either party who throw politics to the wind .
That 's a precious few , and certainly not enough to create a filibuster .
So the next time you hear news pundits going on and on about how there 's a chance that Bernanke might not get reappointed , you might as well turn down the volume , because they 're talking nonsense .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Doctors and psychologists the CIA employed to monitor its " enhanced interrogation " of terror suspects came close to , and may even have committed , unlawful human experimentation , a medical ethics watchdog has alleged .
Physicians for Human Rights ( PHR ) , a not - for - profit group that has investigated the role of medical personnel in alleged incidents of torture at Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib , Bagram and other US detention sites , accuses doctors of being far more involved than hitherto understood .
PHR says health professionals participated at every stage in the development , implementation and legal justification of what it calls the CIA 's secret " torture programme " .
The American Medical Association , the largest body of physicians in the US , said it was in open dialogue with the Obama administration and other government agencies over the role of doctors .
" The participation of physicians in torture and interrogation is a violation of core ethical values , " it said .
The most incendiary accusation of PHR 's latest report , Aiding Torture , is that doctors actively monitored the CIA 's interrogation techniques with a view to determining their effectiveness , using detainees as human subjects without their consent .
The report concludes that such data gathering was " a practice that approaches unlawful experimentation " .
Human experimentation without consent has been prohibited in any setting since 1947 , when the Nuremberg Code , which resulted from the prosecution of Nazi doctors , set down 10 sacrosanct principles .
The code states that voluntary consent of subjects is essential and that all unnecessary physical and mental suffering should be avoided .
The Geneva conventions also ban medical experiments on prisoners and prisoners of war , which they describe as " grave breaches " .
Under CIA guidelines , doctors and psychologists were required to be present during the use of so - called enhanced interrogation techniques on detainees .
In April , a leaked report from the International Committee of the Red Cross found that medical staff employed by the CIA had been present during waterboarding , and had even used what appeared to be a pulse oxymeter , placed on the prisoner 's finger to monitor his oxygen saturation during the procedure .
The Red Cross condemned such activities as a " gross breach of medical ethics " .
PHR has based its accusation of possible experimentation on the 2004 report of the CIA 's own inspector general into the agency 's interrogation methods , which was finally published two weeks ago after pressure from the courts .
An appendix to the report , marked " top secret " , provides guidelines to employees of the CIA 's internal Office of Medical Services " supporting the detention of terrorists turned over to the CIA for interrogation " .
Medical workers are given the task of " assessing and monitoring the health of all agency detainees " subjected to enhanced techniques .
These techniques include facial slaps , sleep deprivation , walling – where their padded heads are banged against walls – confinement in boxes , and waterboarding or simulated drowning .
The guidelines instruct doctors to carry out regular medical checks of detainees .
They must ensure that prisoners receive enough food , though diet " need not be palatable " , and monitor their body temperature when placed in " uncomfortably cool environments , ranging from hours to days " .
The most controversial guideline refers to waterboarding , the technique where prisoners are made to feel as though they are drowning by having water poured over a cloth across their face .
The guidelines stress that the method carries physical risks , particularly " by days three to five of an aggressive programme " .
PHR is calling for an official investigation into the role of doctors in the CIA 's now widely discredited programme .
It wants to know exactly how many doctors participated , what they did , what records they kept and the science that they applied .

The Guardian 's editor called for an end to most " super- injunctions "
Lawyers for the oil trading company Trafigura have ended attempts to keep secret a scientific report about toxic waste dumping in the Ivory Coast .
The legal firm Carter - Ruck has written to the Guardian saying the paper should regard itself as " released forthwith " from any reporting restrictions .
Guardian editor Alan Rusbridger welcomed the move .
Trafigura said neither they nor Carter - Ruck had " improperly sought to stifle or restrict " debate and reporting .
An MP revealed the report 's existence to parliament earlier this week after the Guardian was served with a " super- injunction " banning all mention of it .
Carter - Ruck had tried to stop the media revealing that Labour MP Paul Farrelly had tabled a question relating to oil - trading firm Trafigura and Ivory Coast toxic waste .
Any newspaper trying to report Parliament should be in no doubt that they can
Alan Rusbridger
Editor , the Guardian
The legal firm relented before the Guardian challenged it in court - but the injunction on reporting the contents of the report remained in place until the latest announcement .
Carter - Ruck 's initial decision came after the widespread publication of details of Mr Farrelly 's question on internet blogs and the micro-blogging site Twitter .
Mr Rusbridger told the BBC's Today programme that he hoped the matter of reporting Parliament had been cleared up .
" Any newspaper trying to report Parliament should be in no doubt that they can , " he said .
He called for an end to most " super- injunctions " , which ban not only the reporting of a story but also forbid the media to mention the existence of the injunction itself .
" I can see there are cases involving , say , some aspects of privacy or medical confidentiality , where the fact of the injunction remains a secret .
" But in a case when this was merely a case about embarrassment to a corporation , I really can't see why a judge should make those court proceedings secret . "
The former attorney general , Lord Goldsmith , agreed that a " super- injunction " should only be used in an " exceptional case " .
Lord Goldsmith said he welcomed the fact that the justice secretary was going to look into the issue and said it could prove an opportunity to assess whether the laws are fit for purpose in the 21st century .
He said : " The internet , blogs , Twitter , actually mean that the power of the court to stop things being said is actually very limited anyway . "
In a statement , lawyers for Trafigura said the company now " agrees that there is no longer any purpose in the injunction remaining in place " .
It added : " Despite suggestions to the contrary in certain quarters , neither Trafigura nor Carter - Ruck has at any time improperly sought to stifle or restrict debate in Parliament or the reporting thereof . "
' Unknown third party '
The statement said that Trafigura had learned in September 2009 that the draft report had been " unlawfully obtained by an unknown third party " and passed to the Guardian .
The lawyers in this case clearly reckoned without the ' blogosphere '
Nick Higham , BBC News
When is a secret not a secret ?
It continued : " As The Guardian were informed , the draft report was confidential and subject to legal privilege .
However , despite a number of requests , the Guardian refused even to confirm that it had the document , still less that it would not publish it .
" This left Trafigura with little alternative but to make a court application .
" At that point , the Guardian immediately undertook not to publish the draft report and gave undertakings , reflected in a court order .
The Guardian has never attempted to argue that it would have been justified in publishing the draft report while the document remained confidential . "
' Unfortunate area '
The affair has led to a political row , with Commons Speaker John Bercow insisting that MPs were free to choose the subject of debates .
Asked at Prime Minister 's Questions to look at what can be done about legal bids to stop journalists reporting that gagging orders were in place , Gordon Brown said he hoped to " clear up what is an unfortunate area of the law " .
Commons leader Harriet Harman has also warned the courts off gagging journalists from reporting Parliamentary proceedings .

We love rally crash compilations and this is one of the best we ’ve come across this year .
This video is set deep in the forests of Finland , where crazy drivers go all out on curvy gravel and dirt roads weaving through thick brush .
Finnish rally teams are always top contenders if not all out champions and now we see why – they have so much practice crashing that nothing scares these guy .
They go harder and choose more treacherous and faster lines because they are fearless !
In any case , here is over ten minutes of amazing rally - car wreck footage from the 1990s through the present , culled from various sources on the net .
Check out the video after the jump .

Christopher Soghoian , a graduate student at Indiana University 's School of Informatics and Computing , has made public an audio recording of Sprint / Nextel 's Electronic Surveillance Manager describing how his company has provided GPS location data about its wireless customers to law enforcement over 8 million times .
That 's potentially millions of Sprint / Nextel customers who not only were probably unaware that their wireless provider even had an Electronic Surveillance Department , but who certainly did not know that law enforcement offers could log into a special Sprint Web portal and , without ever having to demonstrate probable cause to a judge , gain access to geolocation logs detailing where they 've been and where they are .
Through a mix of documents unearthed by Freedom of Information Act requests and the aforementioned recording , Soghoian describes how " the government routinely obtains customer records from ISPs detailing the telephone numbers dialed , text messages , emails and instant messages sent , web pages browsed , the queries submitted to search engines , and geolocation data , detailing exactly where an individual was located at a particular date and time . "
The fact that federal , state , and local law enforcement can obtain communications " metadata " — URLs of sites visited , e-mail message headers , numbers dialed , GPS locations , etc. — without any real oversight or reporting requirements should be shocking , but it is n't .
The courts ruled in 2005 that law enforcement does n't need to show probable cause to obtain your physical location via the cell phone grid .
All of the aforementioned metadata can be accessed with an easy - to - obtain pen register / trap & trace order .
But given the volume of requests , it 's hard to imagine that the courts are involved in all of these .
Soghoian 's lengthy post makes at least two important points , the first of which is that there are no reliable statistics on the real volume and scope of government surveillance because such numbers are either not published ( sometimes in violation of the legally mandated reporting requirements ) or they contain huge gaps .
The second point is that the lack of reporting makes it difficult to determine just how involved the courts actually are in all of this , in terms of whether these requests are all backed by subpoenas .
Underlying both of these issues is the fact that Sprint has made it so easy for law enforcement to gain access to customer data on a 24/7 basis through the use of its Web portal and large compliance department .
Regarding the latter , here 's another quote from Paul Taylor , the aforementioned Sprint / Nextel Electronic Surveillance Manager :
" In the electronic surveillance group at Sprint , I have 3 supervisors .
30 ES techs , and 15 contractors .
On the subpoena compliance side , which is anything historical , stored content , stored records , is about 35 employees , maybe 4 - 5 supervisors , and 30 contractors .
There 's like 110 all together . "
All of those people are there solely to serve up customer data to law enforcement , and other comments by Taylor indicate that his staff will probably grow .
Sprint only recently made the GPS data available through the Web portal , and that has caused the number of requests to go through the roof .
The company apparently plans on expanding the menu of surveillance options that are accessible via the Web .
Taylor again :
" [ M ]y major concern is the volume of requests .
We have a lot of things that are automated but that 's just scratching the surface .
One of the things , like with our GPS tool .
We turned it on the web interface for law enforcement about one year ago last month , and we just passed 8 million requests .
So there is no way on earth my team could have handled 8 million requests from law enforcement , just for GPS alone .
So the tool has just really caught on fire with law enforcement .
They also love that it is extremely inexpensive to operate and easy , so , just [ because of ] the sheer volume of requests they anticipate us automating other features , and I just do n't know how we 'll handle the millions and millions of requests that are going to come in . "
I 'm sure they 'll find some way to deal with the " millions and millions " of warrantless surveillance requests , and no one will bother to even curb the practice , much less stop it .
I 've been reporting on this exact metadata / surveillance issue for years now , and it just gets worse .
The stressed , jobless , indebted public does n't care , and Congress does n't either .
If I 'm still on this beat in 5 years , I 'm sure I 'll still be rewriting this same story for the thousandth time .

An 18 - year - old man has died after being caught in a rip on the NSW central coast .
The man was swimming at Bateau Bay at about 4 pm ( AEDT ) on Thursday when he was caught in the rip , police said .
He was spotted in the water by a helicopter crew and a rescue effort involving police , ambulance officers and local surf life saving guards was launched .
The man was found in the water but rescuers were unable to revive him .
Inquiries continue and police will prepare a report for the coroner .
PNHP : A research team at Harvard Medical School estimates 2,266 U.S. military veterans under the age of 65 died last year because they lacked health insurance and thus had reduced access to care .
That figure is more than 14 times the number of deaths ( 155 ) suffered by U.S. troops in Afghanistan in 2008 , and more than twice as many as have died ( 911 as of Oct. 31 ) since the war began in 2001 .
The researchers , who released their analysis today [ Tuesday ] , pointedly say the health reform legislation pending in the House and Senate will not significantly affect this grim picture .
The Harvard group analyzed data from the U.S. Census Bureau ’s March 2009 Current Population Survey , which surveyed Americans about their insurance coverage and veteran status , and found that 1,461,615 veterans between the ages of 18 and 64 were uninsured in 2008 .
Veterans were only classified as uninsured if they neither had health insurance nor received ongoing care at Veterans Health Administration ( VA ) hospitals or clinics .
Using their recently published findings in the American Journal of Public Health that show being uninsured raises an individual ’s odds of dying by 40 percent ( causing 44,798 deaths in the United States annually among those aged 17 to 64 ) , they arrived at their estimate of 2,266 preventable deaths of non-elderly veterans in 2008 .

By By Stephanie Dearing Dec 27 , 2009 in World A pod of 63 pilot whales became stranded on mud flats in New Zealand on December 27 , and over 200 volunteers turned out to help the whales .
" Some 63 pilot whales stranded ... but it looks pretty good , we 've got 43 live ones . "
The whales were found stranded early in the day , and people worked to keep the whales wet all day long , waiting for the high tide .
Once the high tide came in , they were able to refloat the whales and the surviving whales swam out of the harbour .
Some Department of Conservation employees were to maintain a watch over the harbour overnight to ensure the whales did not return , as often happens after whales become stranded .
Department of Conservation spokeswoman Between 1978 and 2004 , there have been over 8,000 whales and dolphins
It is Activists , however , point to In March of 2008 , New Zealand 's ' famous lone dolphin , Moko , Colville Bay , Coromandel New Zealand -
By the end of the day , the heroic efforts of hundreds of people who came out to help the whales after the pod was reported stranded on the mud flats off Colville Bay , meant that most of the pod was saved .
Anywhere from 200 to 500 volunteers turned up with buckets and blankets to help the Department of Conservation in an effort to save the whales .
While 43 were eventually saved , 20 whales died , reportedly shortly after the whales became stranded .
Department of Conservation Ranger Steve Bolten told the press

Department of Conservation spokeswoman Katrina Knill expressed gratitude for the help the Department received from the community .
Between 1978 and 2004 , there have been over 8,000 whales and dolphins stranded around New Zealand , with just over 2,000 of those animals saved .
It is believed that whales and dolphins become stranded for a number of different reasons .
Illness , injury and old age are reasons used to explain individual strandings .
One theory runs along the lines that the dominant whale in a pod accidentally becomes stranded , thus endangering the entire pod as they whales follow their leader .
Another theory believes the whales are so focused on catching their dinner , they fail to notice the shallowness of the waters they are in .
Weather phenomena , particularly El Nino , is thought to influence the behaviour of whales , playing a role in beaching .
And finally , it is thought that something somehow went wrong with the whale 's navigation systems .
Activists , however , point to noise pollution as a possible factor in mass strandings .
A mass stranding is two or more whales .
In March of 2008 , New Zealand 's ' famous lone dolphin , Moko , saved a female whale and her calf by showing the whales the way out of the cove on Mahia Beach Pilot whales are actually members of the dolphin family , and are said to be intelligent animals that do well in captivity .
The Pilot whale eats mainly squid , but will also eat octopuses , cuttlefish and small fish .
They have been observed herding their intended prey into harbours , circling their dinner .
Pilot whales are found throughout the world .
It is thought that their social nature has been the key reason behind the large numbers of Pilot whales stranded over the years , as Pilot whales tend to live in groups of 60 to 90 whales .

Who says you can't celebrate Thanksgiving ?
Promila Awasthi , a Silicon Valley computer consultant , says her bosses at Infosys did .
In a lawsuit filed Monday in Alameda County Superior Court , Awasthi , an India - born American citizen , says her bosses at Infosys 's Fremont , Calif . office mocked her for observing American holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas and refused to pay her overtime according to California law .
The lawsuit is potentially explosive for Infosys , one of a host of India - based information - technology outsourcing firms which take over computing tasks from other companies .
Infosys has been pushing to expand its presence in the United States , both to blunt the political backlash from moving jobs overseas and to gain a commercial advantage by hiring local sales and marketing executives better equipped to take business from the slick sales forces of HP and IBM .
Contrast Infosys 's global ambitions with the allegations in Awasthi's lawsuit .
She hardly paints a culturally sensitive picture of her former company , where she worked from February to November 2008 , at which point she claims " intolerable " working conditions forced her to quit .
Here are highlights from the lawsuit :
Infosys management routinely disparaged Americans , including Mrs. Awasthi , as not having " family values , " and stated that layoffs in America are good because the jobs will be outsourced .
Infosys management ridiculed Mrs. Awasthi for celebrating the American holiday of Thanksgiving , telling her that she should not celebrate Thanksgiving because she is Indian , and that therefore she must work on Thanksgiving Day .
Infosys management ridiculed Mrs. Awasthi’s children for celebrating Thanksgiving , and called them " ABCD " short for " American - Born Confused Desi , " and " IBCD " short for " Indian - Born Confused Desi , " insulting terms used to criticize people of Indian ancestry who are Americanized .
Infosys management ridiculed Mrs. Awasthi for celebrating Christmas , saying that " we " do not celebrate Christmas , and that she should not celebrate Christmas .
Infosys management repeatedly discussed the quality of Mrs. Awasthi's work by explicitly commenting on their expectations for “ a woman your age . "
A spokesman for Infosys , Patrick McLaughlin , did not respond to an emailed request for comment on the lawsuit .
WASHINGTON - With a simple marketing twist , tobacco companies are avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars a year in taxes by exploiting a loophole in President Obama ’s child health law .
Obama and Congress increased taxes on tobacco products earlier this year to pay for expanded children ’s health insurance , but tobacco for roll - your - own cigarettes saw a disproportionate leap , from $ 1.10 to $ 24.78 per pound .
Some predicted the tax would kill the roll - your - own industry , which offered a cheaper alternative to packaged cigarettes .
But tobacco companies quickly adapted .
The Associated Press found that as soon as the tax was on the books , companies all but shut down their roll - your - own brands and reinvented them under a less - restricted , less - taxed category : pipe tobacco .
It ’s still destined to be rolled and smoked , but it is taxed at barely a tenth the rate , $ 2.83 per pound .
Normally , pipe tobacco is coarser and moister than cigarette tobacco .
But nothing says it has to be .
In fact , the federal government says the only distinction between the two is how it is labeled .
That effectively gives tobacco marketing executives an opportunity to shape the company ’s tax rate .
Nearly overnight , roll - your - own brands like Criss Cross and Farmers Gold came off the shelves , replaced by pipe tobacco with the same names .
The cuts may be slightly different , but they ’re suitable for rolling .
Knowing this , retailers steer customers to the new products , sometimes with a wink and a nod , sometimes with outright advertising .
“ They tried to make a product within the elements of the law that they could , in fact , market as pipe tobacco , ’’ said Scott Bendett , owner of Habana Premium Cigar Shoppe in Albany , N.Y. , which advertises the new pipe tobacco for hand - rolled cigarettes .
Tobacco companies say they are just trying to find a legal way to stay afloat after being saddled with an enormous tax increase .
Because the small , independent companies in the roll - your - own market are often overshadowed by the huge , publicly held cigarette companies , the sudden shift toward pipe tobacco caught researchers by surprise .
Daniel Morris , who tracks tobacco production data at the Oregon Department of Health , thought he had made a mistake when he saw April ’s figures .
Pipe tobacco production had more than doubled in a single month .
After years of producing about 270,000 pounds per month , companies put more than 566,000 pounds of pipe tobacco on the market in April .
Morris called the federal Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau , which collects the data .
There was no mistake .
“ It really shows how the industry is able to respond to changes in the tax environment , ’’ Morris said .

A group of German companies with expertise in parachute systems have joined forces to create the Gryphon Next Generation Parachute System .
Designed for high altitude jumps , the Gryphon has a 6 - foot wingspan and a glide ratio of 5:1 , meaning that a solider can glide up to 30 miles in the air — 60 if they go ahead with plans to add a small engine like the one used by Yves Rossy to cross the English Channel .

Gryphon would also include a guidance system and heads up display navigation , which is all well and good , but it seems that the problem of landing still has to be worked out .
Skydivers and daredevils using similar technology must deploy a traditional parachute in order to return to Earth in one piece .
In order to get the most out of the stealth capability , it would be necessary to develop a way for soldiers to return safely to the ground using the wings alone .

[ Danger Room via The Raw Feed ]
Are Dangerous Bacteria Lurking Inside Your Organic Produce Dennis T. Avery CHURCHVILLE , VA A new study finds that the most dangerous bacteria in Americas food supply , E. coli O157 : H7 , can actually get inside the tissues of such food plants as lettuce and spinach , where it cant be washed off .
This is bad news for organic food buyers .
The major reservoir of O157 bacteria is cattle manure and organic farmers use large amounts of cattle manure to provide the nitrogen fertilizer necessary for their crops to grow .
( Conventional farmers prefer to use pure nitrogen , taken from the air , on food crops , using animal manure only for feed corn and other nonfood crops . )
Dr. Ethan Solomon reports in Applied and Environmental Biology ( Jan. 2002 ) that his research team found E. coli O157:H7 entering lettuce plants through the root system ( from either manure - contaminated soil or irrigation water ) and migrating throughout the edible portion of the plant .
 Research has demonstrated the long - term survival of O157:H7 in manure held under a variety of conditions , so even a strict adherence to the [ organic ] guideline may result in the application of manure containing culturable E. coli O157:H7 to production fields ,  says Solomons new report .
 Direct contact between the leaves and contamination source is not required for the organism to become integrated into edible lettuce tissue .
Solomons team tested only lettuce .
Given the political correctness and expanding sales of organic foods , more research obviously needs to be done on other food crops to determine the extent of the danger .
Of course , few organic farmers put raw manure directly on their crops .
But composting is an erratic process , and achieving high enough temperatures long enough to kill the tough bacteria is critical .
Another study , published in the same journal in 1998 by Kudva , Blanch and Hovde , found that E. coli O157 : H survived for 21 months in a manure pile under fluctuating environmental conditions .
The bacterium survived at least 100 days in bovine manure frozen at 20 C. , and survived 21 to 40 days under a wide variety of conditions .
Dr. Dean Cliver , a professor of food safety at the University of California / Davis , told York Times columnist John Tierney , in November , 2000 ,  We know that animals are shedding bacteria that can make people sick if the manure hasnt been treated properly .
Personally , if I knew something was grown with conventional chemical fertilizers , I would feel it was extra safe .
We have two virulent new foodborne microbes ( E. coli O157 and Salmonella typhimurium ) associated with animal manure .
An increasing percentage of our food sales are organic with a logically higher risk of bacterial infection .
The Centers for Disease Control estimate that E. coli O157 sickens more than 60,000 American per year , hospitalizes nearly 2,000 , and kills 50 .
The virulent new strains of E. coli and Salmonella attack the strong as well as infants and the elderly .
O157 can inflict permanent damage on even its survivors  internal organs , especially the kidneys of children .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture , in its proposal to establish the new National Organic Program stated ,  Applications of raw manure are a hazardous , threatening pathogenic contamination of food products , notwithstanding the use of composted manure , which can carry similar hazards .
Dr. Robert V. Tauxe , then head of the CDCs Foodborne Illness Branch , stated in a 1997 letter to the Journal of the American Medical Association that . . . adequate composting of manure should in principle eliminate pathogens from manure .
Unfortunately , knowledge of the critical times and temperatures needed to make [ them ] microbiologically safe is incomplete , and the regulatory approach is . . . patchy at best .
Despite all this , a CDC spokesperson said in 1999 that it had not studied the risks of organic food , and was not planning to , because such research was not warranted .
More recently , the CDC says it has initiated a study comparing the bacterial risks of organic and conventional produce , but the results are still pending .
The USDA organic standards currently forbid raw manure from being applied to the organic food crops less than 120 days before harvest for food crops whose edible portion has direct contact with the soil surface , or less than 90 days before harvest of a product whose edible portion does not have direct contact with the soil surface or soil particles . 
But these guidelines were written before the Solomon teams research showed that E. coli O157 could travel into the plants through the root systems .
Perhaps the USDA organic standards need to be revised on the basis of the new findings .
Is it time to restrict animal manure to feed crops only ?
Many food safety professionals think the only reasonable alternative would be electronic irradiation .
Irradiation would not only kill virtually all the pathogenic bacteria , but also keep the food fresher - tasting since it kills many of the bacteria and fungi which cause food to rot .

As a child , Chris Peterson absolutely hated writing thank - you notes .
His aversion continued right into his 40s , until one day he knew he had to face it .
A psychology professor at the University of Michigan , Peterson regularly gave his students an unusual homework assignment .
He asked them to write a " letter , " a kind of belated thank - you note to someone in their lives .
Studies show such letters provide long - lasting mood boosts to the writers .
Indeed , after the exercise , Peterson says his students feel happier " 100 percent of the time . "
But what Peterson did n't tell his students was that he could n't bring himself to write his own letters .
" I just thought it would be corny to do , " he remembers .
When he finally forced himself to put pen to paper , Peterson avoided embarrassing sentiments by " cloaking it all in . "
His thanks wound up feeling insincere and did n't cheer him .
When he tried again , he says , " I spoke from the heart . "
The Snowball Effect
Gratitude is a sentiment we'd all do well to cultivate , according to positive psychologists , mental health clinicians and researchers who seek to help everyone create more joy in life .
Feeling thankful and expressing that thanks makes you happier and heartier — not hokier .
The biggest bonuses come from experiencing gratitude habitually , but natural ingrates need n't despair .
Simple exercises can give even skeptics a short - term mood boost , and " once you get started , you find more and more things to be grateful for , " says Robert Emmons , a leading gratitude researcher at the University of California at Davis .
In gratitude letters like those penned by Peterson and his students , writers detail the kindnesses of someone they 've never properly thanked .
Read this letter aloud to the person you 're thanking , Peterson says , and you 'll see measurable improvements in your mood .
Studies show that for a full month after a " gratitude visit " ( in which a person makes an appointment to read the letter to the recipient ) , levels tend to go up , while boredom and other negative feelings go down .
In fact , the gratitude visit is more effective than any other exercise in .
Your Happiness List
Gratitude need n't be directed at another person to hit its mark .
Take just a few minutes each day to jot down things that make you thankful , from the of friends to the food on your table or the right to vote .
After a few weeks , people who follow this routine " feel better about themselves , have more energy and feel more alert , " Emmons says .
Feeling thankful even brings physical changes , studies show .
List - keepers sleep better , exercise more and gain a general contentment that may counteract and contribute to overall health .
Gratitude exercises do call for a certain amount of .
Emmons remembers one woman who wrote the same gratitude list every day : " my cat , my dog and my apartment . "
In addition to slighting her dog as second - best , the woman probably did n't feel the fruits of gratitude , Emmons says , because she did n't put much thought or care into her task .
Exercises " can be done with skepticism , but not with , " Peterson notes .
At First , Fake It
For people who want to activate their gratitude , but feel slightly silly about the exercises , Peterson advises , " fake it until you can make it . "
Say " thank you " enough , he reasons , and your mind will fall in line with your words .
Think you do n't have anyone to thank ?
Gratitude " does n't depend on circumstances , " Emmons says .
You can be grateful for just about anything that you 've received in part because of someone or something else .
You may feel grateful to your neighbor for a car pool , to luck for meeting your spouse , to nature for a scenic view or to fate or a higher power for your safety .
Thankfulness helps you see that you 're an object of love and care .
Says Emmons : " Your is bolstered when you say , ' Hey , people have done things for me . ' "
A conscious focus on gratitude may also remind you of unassuming pluses that get lost in the ups and downs of a busy life .
" The most important blessings are the ones that are most consistent , " such as family , health and home , says Philip Watkins , an Eastern Washington University psychologist .
" And those are the ones we take for granted . "
Grateful reflection helps you pick out and savor the good in life , even if the good is n't flashy .
What 's more , gratitude turns your to what you do have instead of what you do n't , Watkins suggests .
Consistently ungrateful people tend to think that material goods , such as a big - screen TV , or winning the lottery will make them happy .
On the other hand , people who recognize the blessings they have tend to think they 'll get happiness from things like fulfilling relationships — which , research shows , are the real sources of satisfaction .
Because grateful people do n't fixate on money or material goods , they may cut back on and nagging comparisons with the Joneses .
Get Noticed
Gratitude may chase away thoughts far worse than a desire for a big - screen TV .
memories fade into the background for people who regularly feel grateful , Watkins 's experiments show .
Troublesome thoughts pop up less frequently and with less intensity , which suggests that gratitude may enhance emotional healing .
Thankfulness helps the brain fully process events , Watkins speculates .
Grateful people achieve closure by making sense of negative events so that they mesh with a generally positive outlook .
When individuals start a daily gratitude journal , they begin to feel a greater sense of connectedness to the world .
" The differences are noticed by others , " Emmons says .
" People who know them say they 're more helpful . "
Thankfulness may launch a happy cycle in which rich friendships bring joy , which gives you more to be grateful for , which fortifies your friendships once again .
Even a simple " thank you " spurs people to act in compassionate ways they might not otherwise consider .
People thanked for giving directions help more willingly in the future , social workers who get thank - you letters visit their clients more often , and diners whose waiters write " thanks " on the check give bigger tips .
Call it corny , but gratitude just may be the glue that holds society together .
Since the inception of the TF2 Newbs server ( a stock rotation server ) on the first day of beta one of the challenges has been to keep the server full , or at least populated enough where I do n’t have to sit there for 6 hours by myself .
Unfortunately due to things outside of my control we ’ve had to change the IP addresses of our servers a couple of times , combined with our rapid expansion in total servers ( currently we have 8 maintained by me + 2 donated to the community by others ) early in the day its common to find the servers empty , requiring people interested in playing to sit on an empty server waiting for those first few people to join .
When I have time , this would be me .
Oh how I yearned for a way to easily invite my friends who were around to come play too .
Once in a blue moon I could hit shift - tab , bring up the overlay pick a friend , and invite them to the game I ’m in .
But most of the time the option just was n’t there .
I then learned from someone very very smart , that all you need to do in order to get the invite option to come back is to change your ‘ status ’ on steam , and it ’ll magically reappear .

Editor 's note : Nicole Lapin is an anchor and reporter based at the CNN Headquarters in Atlanta .
She graduated from Northwestern University 's Medill School of Journalism .
( CNN ) --
It was two - and - a - half days before Illinois Gov. George Ryan was to leave office in 2003 .
I sat in a crowded auditorium in Northwestern University 's Law School in Chicago , where Ryan was expected to make a major announcement on capital punishment .
" Half , if you will , of the nearly 300 capital cases in Illinois have been reversed for a new trial or for some re-sentencing . " he said , his voice tired but clear .
Wrongful convictions had been all over the papers around that time -- the Anthony Porter case , the Ford Heights Four , Rolando Cruz .
" How in God 's name does that happen ?
In America , how does it happen ? " Ryan continued .
" How many more cases of wrongful conviction have to occur before we can all agree that this system in Illinois is broken ? "
On that day , the governor commuted the sentences of all death row inmates in the state and credited an unlikely source for helping him make his decision : Professor David Protess ' undergraduate Investigative Journalism class at Northwestern University 's Medill School .
In the previous decade , Medill students had uncovered some of the most high - profile wrongful convictions in the city .
The class had worked to secure the release of 11 innocent prisoners , five of whom were scheduled to be executed .
As a wide - eyed journalism student at Northwestern , I remember feeling proud of my classmates , proud of my school and proud of the profession I was entering .
Today , six years later , Protess ' class is far from the center of the same praise .
Presented with evidence in a new case , the state attorney 's office is questioning the motivations of the messenger -- the class itself .
The students have raised questions about the murder conviction of Anthony McKinney .
In response , the state attorney 's office issued a subpoena for the students ' grades , grading criteria , expense reports , syllabi and e-mail messages -- mine included .
Find out more about the Medill Innocence Project
The year after Gov. Ryan 's speech , I signed up for Protess ' class .
I was assigned to the team working on McKinney 's case , who was convicted in 1978 , when he was 18 , for shooting a security guard in Harvey , Illinois .
On the night of September 15 , 1978 , a white security guard named Donald Lundahl was killed at close range by a shotgun blast while sitting in his car .
Later that evening , a police officer noticed McKinney , an African - American , running down the street .
He was arrested .
McKinney had no violent criminal history and was not in possession of a weapon .
He was briefly released after telling police he was watching the Muhammed Ali-Leon Spinx heavyweight championship fight when the murder took place and was running from " gang - bangers " when the officer saw him .
Authorities questioned another teenager , who told police that he saw the murder , claiming he saw McKinney , from 50 yards away , say , " Your money or your life , " and shoot Lundahl .
McKinney was picked up again , and after a second lengthy interrogation , he signed a confession , typed by police .
During his trial , he recanted the confession , and said it was coerced .
But based on officers ' testimony and that of the teenager , McKinney was convicted of murder .
Prosecutors sought the death penalty , but because he had no record , McKinney was sentenced to life in prison .
Had his sentence been death , McKinney would have been executed long before the commutation of death row cases in 2003 .
He would have been dead well before Protess even took up his case .
Since Protess started the course in 1992 , his classes have investigated about 50 cases .
Although the ones that are chosen have major red flags , like lack of physical evidence , not all convictions are found to be unjustified .
Of the 50 , 11 led to exonerations .
Two indicated solid evidence of guilt .
The rest are under review by the judiciary or were inconclusive , Protess said .
Protess made clear to all of his classes that the coursework was about pavement - hitting journalism , the process behind discovering the truth -- guilt or innocence .
I went into the class to learn that process .
During the two quarters I took the course , I lived the McKinney case .
My team and I spent nights and weekends doing things I never told my family or friends because they would n't believe me .
Some times it was a matter of staking out a source 's house or going to smoky , seedy bars to fish for information on the decades - old case .
Those times , a professional private investigator and another team member would be in the car listening for the words " winter wedding " -- the " safe word " we were supposed say into the cell phones in our pockets if something dangerous ever went down .
( It never did . )
Unlike other Medill classes , this course was hands - on , gritty and raw .
I gained more practical skills in those months than in all of my other college courses combined .
The experience prepared me to do the work I have done professionally and will continue to do throughout my career .
In our investigation , we reenacted the crime scene and determined it was impossible to discern any words spoken or shouted from 50 yards away .
Later , we tracked down the then - teenage witness who said he saw McKinney that night .
The man recanted his testimony on videotape , and told us police beat him .
We also found a fire department document that indicated the paramedics were called to the police station during McKinney 's interrogation , raising the question of whether he was roughed up during his interrogation as he said he was .
We interviewed the " gang - bangers " who chased him that night .
They acknowledged they chased him after the Ali fight because they were angry he had damaged their car earlier .
Finally , we identified alternate suspects , one of whom stated on videotape that he was there when the murder was committed -- and that McKinney was n't .
After I graduated , the investigation continued .
Once Protess felt there was enough evidence , after nine teams of student reporters had worked on the case , the information was shared with the Center on Wrongful Convictions at Northwestern 's Law School and McKinney 's legal team .
The audio and videotaped interviews , affidavits and other on - the - record interview transcripts we worked on also were presented to the district attorney 's office .
Last year , the new evidence was submitted to the Cook County Circuit Court in an effort to exonerate McKinney .
I am still haunted by the case .
I am still haunted by my visit to see McKinney in prison -- the gentle face of a man who still has hope after so many years .
A spokeswoman for the prosecutor 's office , Sally Daly , told me that we , as students , were " conducting these interviews for a grade in this class . "
She went on to say the " request for the grades goes to explore any possible bias , interest or motive . "
The claim is that we , as students , were motivated to get witnesses to play into a preconceived thesis of innocence in order to get good grades .
I think I speak for my fellow alums when I say this class was never about grades .
It has always been about searching for truth and justice for people whose cases did n't get due diligence from a bogged - down system .
This was about journalism in its purest and most passionate form .
For years , the class has been a check on the work of police and other law enforcement officials .
Protess has seen and dealt with his fair share of heat for more than a decade , but never anything like this attempt to investigate the investigator .
Northwestern is not complying with the request for documents .
A court hearing on November 10 will decide if the subpoena will stand .
While we were students at the time , we " took reporting to the Nth degree , " as the dean of the school told The Chicago Tribune .
We functioned as journalists and should be protected by reporter 's privilege laws .
About 50 similar programs across the country are watching to see what precedent could be set if the state is entitled to these materials .
Will programs like Northwestern 's continue if the volunteers are worried about attorneys ' fees to handle requests for documents ?
Recently , Judge H. Lee Sarokin , the federal judge who famously freed Ruben " Hurricane " Carter on a murder conviction that proved to be unfounded , wrote in support of all former members of " Team McKinney . "
" If a reporter hopes to win a Pulitzer or an investigator for the defense hopes to obtain further business , " he wrote , " how can those motives possibly be relevant to the evidence obtained ? "
The focus should be on the evidence , not grades .
Student information is irrelevant to Anthony McKinney 's case .
Being forced to hand over private information will not only compromise the integrity of the program , but create a chilling effect on free speech and investigative reporting .
I recently went back and watched Gov. Ryan 's speech on YouTube .
I got the same chill I did watching it in person that day .
I can only hope that a new generation of students has the opportunity to feel that , too .
No one saw this coming :
The sudden demise of Editor & Publisher , the long - revered , trusted , occasionally insouciant , experienced watchdog of the newspaper industry .
The Nielsen Company said Thursday it would shutter the publication .
Some wags had thought financial considerations would kill off the monthly print edition but leave the vibrant online edition functioning .
But , no .
After a tradition of reporting on the reporters dating back to 1884 , E&P is done .
And that ’s sad , because the careful inspection of the media industries by a longtime , experienced staff led by editor Greg Mitchell has ended .
Mitchell , who took over as editor in 2002 , had revived a publication that had become moribund and almost irrelevant .
To much criticism , he killed E&P as a print weekly and reintroduced it as a monthly .
But his master stroke was diving headlong onto the Web , where E&P has prospered , at least in terms of timely analytical coverage of the industry .
I do n’t have readership or page views , but given that newspaper staffs nationwide have been cut so drastically during the years of Mitchell ’s editorship , I would n’t be surprised if circulation of the monthly had fallen .
The impending end of E&P was , as they say , all over the ‘ nets today , rising to No. 4 as Twitter topic .
For the time being , it seems , the good work of longtime E&P hands like Joe Strupp , Mark Fitzgerald and Jennifer Saba is at an end .
I will particularly miss the pairing of Fitz and Jen , whose stories and podcasts on the economics of the media business have been prescient and accurate .
I have been reading E&P since 1970 .
If you ’re in the news biz , it ’s been a trusted companion and professor .
If it has died solely because of financial considerations , we should be saddened .
Even the industry watchdog , it seems , must make budget — or was E&P just not sufficiently profitable ?
In days and weeks to come , perhaps we ’ll learn more details .
But the loss of E&P is just another bullet to the heart of journalism as a public service .
Those who love , need , or appreciate good journalism will mourn its passing .
We ’re losing , people .
E&P ’s end is just another symptom of the continued erosion of a democracy ’s ability to closely inspect and monitor itself through its adversarial relationship with the press .
E&P has been more than a mirror of the newspaper industry ; it has been a teacher of how to press for information from governments and industries ( and unions ) that would rather stay uninspected .
Perhaps an institution that believes in that public service mission ( Pew ? Poynter ? ) could offer Greg , Joe , Fitz , Jen and company a new home .
E&P still performs a valuable mission .
Find a way to retain it .
[ Disclosure : E&P has published commentaries I have written .
Greg Mitchell is a graduate of the journalism program in which I teach . ]
There ’s a list of 450 “ peer reviewed papers supporting skepticism of ‘ man- made ’ global warming ” making the rounds on the internet .
Let ’s take a closer look at it .
When peer review does n’t mean peer review
Take a glance at that list , and it just leaps out at you : so many of the papers are all from the same source , from a journal called Energy & Environment .
I counted 79 out of the 450 , all from just one journal .
Now , it is n’t the case that global warming is a small , narrowly focused field of research ; if it was , one might expect it to be served by relatively few journals , and this large number of papers from a single journal would n’t be so strange .
But global warming is a very broad field of research .
It draws on a large number of disciplines , from atmospheric physics , paleoclimatology , marine science and more .
It should , therefore , strike you as odd that fully 17 % of the skeptical papers on this list all come from the journal Energy & Environment .
And what a journal it is .
From wikipedia :
“ The journal is not listed in the ISI ’s Journal Citation Reports indexing service for academic journals , although it is included in Scopus , which lists it as a trade journal , with coverage from 1995 . “
So E&E does n’t merit a listing in JCR , and hence has no impact factor , which , for publishing scientists , can be a big deal .
The quality of the journal in which one publishes can count toward ones career .
E&E simply would not count , and Scopus just lists it as a trade journal , which is n’t worth much at all .
To pile on still further :
“ The journal ’s peer - review process has at times been criticised for publishing substandard papers .
Roger A. Pielke ( Jr ) , who published a paper on hurricane mitigation in the journal , said in a post answering a question on Nature ’s blog in May about peer - reviewed references and why he published in E&E : “ … had we known then how that outlet would evolve beyond 1999 we certainly would n’t have published there . ” ”
What good peer review provides is confidence that what you are reading has been scrutinised by relevant experts in the field .
I ca n’t begin to comprehend , then , who scrutinised and approved this E&E paper .
Perhaps it was the timecube guy .
This author wants you to know that everything we know about the sun , our “ currently fashionable model ” for it , is in fact wrong :
“ Analyses of planets , the Moon , the solar wind , solar flares , the solar photosphere , and ordinary meteorites show that our Sun is actually the violent , ill mannered remains of a supernova that once ejected all of the heavier elements on Earth and in the solar system and now selectively moves lightweight elements into a veneer of H and He that covers the Sun ’s energetic neutron core [ 18 ] .
This brings the IPCC conclusions into question and , more importantly , the draconian solutions that some policymakers advocate . ”
Fair enough , I suppose .
If we ca n’t even figure out what that big glowing thing in the sky is , then we certainly should n’t do anything about global warming .
After all , if the sun was secretly all along a neutron star , and nobody noticed , then , heck , everything we think we know about everything can be called into question .
Especially the IPCC conclusions .
Right ?
There are standards in science , and one of them is peer review .
Scientists know what it is and what it is n’t , and the review process in a sub standard vanity press journal like E&E , well , is n’t .
Let ’s just take the E&E papers out of this list .
It ’s better for it , as a lot of what remains in the list really is n’t junk .
Skepticism , or just scientists doing science ?
Here ’s how you know man made global warming science is not a religion : it keeps on trying to debunk itself .
Here ’s one way you can see it keeps on trying to debunk itself : this list of 450 papers ( well , excepting the dross from E&E ) .
It is an accepted scientific norm that research , once conducted and reported , can be challenged .
Nothing is sacred and nothing is untouchable .
Accordingly , here ’s a great example of just that from the list .
Can increasing carbon dioxide cause climate change ?
( Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , Volume 94 , pp. 8335-8342 , August 1997 ) – Richard S. Lindzen .
That ’s the Richard Lindzen , climate contrarian , Professor of Meteorology at MIT , lead author of Chapter 3 of the IPCC ’s Third Assessment Report .
He went to a symposium organised by the Charles D. Keeling , the man who first recorded the progressive atmospheric accumulation of CO2 , and pretty much a rock star in climatological terms ; and he presented a paper challenging the most fundamental aspect of man made global warming , that increasing carbon dioxide causes climate change .
And what did the prestigious National Academy of Sciences do with that highly skeptical paper ?
They published it .
And that , people , is how scientists do science .
A question of context
So here we are , 2009 , 12 years later , and the idea that increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will cause climate change is still the accepted consensus .
What Lindzen wrote in 1997 did n’t overturn that consensus .
It challenged it , but that was n’t enough .
The reason is that there exists a preponderance of evidence for man made global warming .
This list of 450 disparate papers , many of which are from just one junk journal , does not make for a coherent scientific argument against man made global warming .
In fact , the creators of the list do n’t bother to explain why each paper is “ skeptical of man made global warming ” ; and I find myself skeptical that many of these papers even come close to doing any such thing .
If there is a coherent case to be made against “ man made global warming ” , it is n’t being made by this list .
Picking only the papers that appear to be skeptical of a topic , without considering the totality of the research published on that topic , is called cherry picking .
Compare and contrast with the IPCC .
It is n’t as though the IPCC does n’t consider contrary research findings in its reviews : it does .
The following example ( from the TAR ) shows this review process in action :
“ 5.1 Observed changes in terrestrial ( including freshwater ) species distributions , population sizes , and community composition .
The IPCC evaluated the effect of climate change on biological systems by assessing 2,500 published studies .
Of these , 44 studies , which included about 500 taxa , met the following criteria : 20 or more years of data ; measuring temperature as one of the variables ; the authors of the study finding a statistically significant change in both a biological / physical parameter and the measured temperature ; and a statistical correlation between the temperature and the change in the biological / physical parameter .
Some of these studies investigated different taxa ( e.g. bird and insect ) in the same paper .
Of a total of 59 plants , 47 invertebrates , 29 amphibians and reptiles , 388 birds , and 10 mammal species , approximately 80 % showed change in the biological parameter measured ( e.g. start and end of breeding season , shifts in migration patterns , shifts in animal and plant distributions , and changes in body size ) in the manner expected with global warming , while 20 % showed change in the opposite direction .
Most of these studies have been carried out in the temperate and high - latitude areas and in some high altitude areas .
These studies show that some ecosystems that are particularly sensitive to changes in regional climate ( e.g. high - altitude and high - latitude ecosystems ) have already been affected by changes in climate . ”
Now think what would happen if the IPCC worked the same way as the creator of this “ 450 papers ” list .
We would have a list of papers showing changes in the biological parameter that were only consistent with global warming .
By not considering the totality of the evidence , for and against , and putting it in context , we would get a quite false impression of the state of research .
If the creator of the “ 450 papers ” list had been given the same job , we would have a list of papers that only showed changes in biological parameters that were not consistent with global warming .
Either way , it would be cherry picking , and therefore misleading .
What we get from the IPCC review instead is the honestly reported finding that 20 % of their datasets did not support global warming .
They were n’t ignored or suppressed , but put into context , we can see that the preponderance of the datasets rather did support global warming .
It is possible for hundreds of research papers to exist that are “ skeptical of man made global warming ” , and at the same time , for the existence of such papers to be insufficient to overturn the consensus on man made global warming .
It ’s a question of putting research into context , and considering the totality of the evidence .
“ The test of a first - rate intelligence is the ability to hold two opposed ideas in mind at the same time and still retain the ability to function . ”
- F. Scott Fitzgerald
What should have been done
What this topic needs is a fair review .
Some group to take a look at all the evidence relating to man made global warming , for and against , weigh it up , pull out the main themes and the most well supported research findings , and report all this in a transparent and open manner .
Put these “ skeptical ” papers in context , and provide an overview of the level of scientific certainty on the topic of “ man made global warming . ”
Come to think of it , the IPCC reports do just that .
This list of 450 papers does n’t really prove anything .
It scores a cheap rhetorical point , perhaps , by showing – albeit incompetently – that skepticism exists in the peer reviewed climate science literature , but really that just demonstrates that climate science is , well , science , rather than being a religion that silences all its heretics .
So please do n’t be fooled by silly junk like this list .
Consider the totality of the evidence , and do n’t fall for the temptation of cherry picking only the research that supports your point of view .

One can hardly read any poker forum without running across individuals claiming that this or that site is rigged .
Usually they are humiliated with the forum “ experts ” rudely telling them that the reason they ’re losing is because they are n’t good poker players .
I ’m sad to say that I used to be one of those “ experts . ”
I was one of the doubters until I actually caught one site cheating .
If you view the image below it looks like a normal hand being played ( certain information has been redacted to protect the innocent ) .
Normal Table
It looks normal unless you really examine the photo .
Using some highly classified vector digital imaging software from the CIA I picked up on eBay for $ 50 , I caught the dealer dealing off the bottom of the deck .
I was as shocked as anyone but it all made sense once I thought about it .
Notice in the picture above how they put that little box in front of the players sitting to the right and left of the dealer so as to obstruct their view .
Players sitting that close would normally catch a dishonest dealer but “ conveniently ” the software blocks their view .
Coincidence ?
Hardly !
Dealing from the bottom of the deck !
But that was n’t the only cheating I caught .
Notice the player to the right of the dealer in Seat 1 .
Notice anything out of place ?
Neither did I at first .
But again , I used my imaging software to get a close up and guess what I see ?
Cards up the sleeve
He ’s got a card hidden up his sleeve !
I guess it should have been obvious after his fourth pocket aces in a row .
Conclusion : Online Poker is Rigged !
So now I have proof that online poker is rigged and if anybody tries to tell you differently , they ’re in on it !
If you feel you ’ve been cheated then you may want to check out a tool developed by Bill ’s Poker Blog called the RT Hand History Analyzer for Rigged Poker Games .
It can tell you if there are any statistical abnormalities with any of the hands you feed it .
Really a great tool to help you gather evidence about online poker being rigged .

On a more serious note :
I spoke recently with a young woman who was raped two years ago and had been told that her case had been closed , without the physical evidence that might have led to prosecution of her rapist ever being tested .
She said she still woke up most days hoping the police would change their minds .
" But , " she said , " it 's so stupid for me to hope for justice , is n't it ? "
The news in recent weeks has been filled with reports about rape , all of it pointed to one truth :
Even officials who are supposed to investigate and prosecute rape would rather not deal with it .
We read about the 11 women 's bodies found at the home of a convicted sex offender in Cleveland - found years after the reports started coming in of frightening events taking place there .
" CBS Evening News " reported finding at least 20,000 sets of physical evidence in rape cases sitting untested in police storage facilities throughout the country .
Then the National Institute of Justice released a report that found evidence from rape cases is less likely than evidence from other violent crimes to be sent forward for crime - lab testing .
Testing the physical evidence in a rape case , known as a rape kit , is very important .
It can identify an unknown rapist , confirm the presence of a known suspect , affirm the victim 's version of events or exonerate an innocent defendant .
The prosecution and conviction rates for rape cases have risen considerably in jurisdictions that have made a commitment to test every kit .
Every year , nearly 200,000 people report to the police that they have been raped .
Almost all are asked to submit to the invasive and sometimes traumatic process of having DNA evidence collected from their bodies .
They assume this will help catch their rapist .
They are often wrong .
Thousands of kits throughout the United States remain untested , and the arrest rate for rape is less than 25 percent of reported case .
The hopeful news is that even in the midst of all the activity around health care and Afghanistan , Congress is turning its attention to the problem .
Sens. Al Franken , Minnesota Democrat ; Charles E. Grassley , Iowa Republican ; Dianne Feinstein , California Democrat ; and Orrin G. Hatch , Utah Republican , recently introduced the Justice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act of 2009 .
The bipartisan legislation would require the federal government to collect data on untested rape kits in police and crime - lab storage facilities and require jurisdictions that get funds from federal DNA funding programs to make testing the rape kits a priority .
A companion bill was introduced in the House of Representatives on Nov. 20 by Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney , New York Democrat , and Rep. Dean Heller , Nevada Republican .
We hope the House Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the bill to focus on the need for action on this issue .
In 2004 , Congress passed the Debbie Smith Act , named after a rape victim whose case was adversely affected by the rape - kit backlog , to provide money to states for rape - kit testing .
But because the bill allows jurisdictions to use the money for any DNA testing , it often is not used to test rape kits .
In fact , some grantees have not even used their funding even though they have large backlogs .
In March 2009 , reporting from Human Rights Watch revealed a backlog of more than 12,500 untested rape kits in Los Angeles Police and Sheriff department facilities , though those agencies had received nearly $ 8 million in Debbie Smith Act funds from 2005 to 2008 .
In October , the Detroit Police Department reported it had as many as 10,000 untested rape kits ; it has never applied for Debbie Smith Act funds .
" CBS Evening News " found 5,100 untested kits in San Antonio and 1,100 in Albuquerque , N.M.
A dozen major cities told CBS they have no idea how many untested rape kits they have .
Without federal or state laws requiring law enforcement agencies to account for untested rape kits , there are no current comprehensive data on the number of untested kits in the United States .
The rape - kit backlog is clearly a national problem that requires a strong federal response .
Untested rape kits represent lost justice for rape victims .
The proposed new law would require states receiving Debbie Smith Act funds to develop and carry out a plan to eliminate their rape - kit backlogs , including reducing any backlog by 50 percent within two years .
The bill would use financial incentives to encourage state and local governments to take aggressive steps to eliminate backlogs and require every jurisdiction receiving certain grants to report annually on its untested rape kits .
No victim should be made to feel that hoping for justice is stupid or in vain .
The Justice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act of 2009 would go a long way toward ensuring that law enforcement agencies use all the tools at their disposal to investigate rape .
The evidence in thousands and thousands of cases sits untested in police storage facilities while victims wait for justice .

Picture yourself standing on the mossy banks of a clear Cascade stream far from civilization , a fishing pole in your hand .
Pulling a wriggling fish onto the bank would be the highlight of a lazy summer day and provide a tasty dinner over the campfire .
It might also kill you .
A study released by the U.S. Geological Survey on Aug. 19 found mercury contamination in fish living in every one of the 291 streams it sampled across the country .
Mercury is a neurotoxin poisonous to both humans and other animals .
About a quarter of the fish the USGS sampled had mercury levels that made them too dangerous for humans to eat .
But people commonly eat the fish they catch , and those who eat more fish than the statistical average -- such as Native Americans and individuals from various ethnic groups for whom subsistence fishing is common -- are at far greater risk .
Most mercury contamination literally falls from the sky after it goes up into the atmosphere as pollution from a factory or power plant smokestack .
As a result , even wilderness lakes and streams can have high levels of the toxin .
The biggest mercury polluter in the entire United States is a cement factory in eastern Oregon .
This fact has not escaped notice of the state 's environmental watchdog , the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality .
The very day the federal government released its disturbing report on mercury 's widespread threat , DEQ officials announced that the agency would work hard to make sure that the cement company could continue to release mercury at a level 60 times greater than new federal emissions limits .
Huh ?
While it may be hard to believe , the agency that describes its job as " to protect the quality of Oregon 's environment " has decided that the cold cash from one cement plant should trump pollution caps set by the federal government to protect humans and wildlife across the country .
But even in a deep recession , DEQ should not be willing to trade off clear threats to health and safety for economic benefit .
Mercury exposure can prevent normal brain development , so it is especially dangerous to pregnant women and children .
DEQ's air quality manager for eastern Oregon was quoted as saying that " every Oregonian supports industry , " but it 's a safe bet they support their kids more .
And protecting kids from environmental hazards such as mercury poisoning is supposed to be DEQ 's mission .
Gov .
Ted Kulongoski has the final say on whether to seek an exemption from the new federal limits on mercury pollution for the cement plant .
And this one is an easy call :
The governor should overrule DEQ .
If he does n't , the federal Environmental Protection Agency should say " no " to special treatment for the country 's worst mercury polluter .
On its Web site , DEQ touts its " 40 years of leading environmental change in Oregon . "
Unfortunately , the agency is leading efforts to change federal mercury regulations in a way that will leave the environment in much worse shape and put people 's health at risk in Oregon and beyond .

The Public Committee Against Torture in Israel ( PCATI ) released today [ 2 December 2009 ] a new report which exposes the shifts in Israel ’s combat doctrine as evidenced in the prosecution of operation “ Cast Lead ” and from numerous public oral and written statements made by high ranking military officers and senior Israeli government officials .
The report , “ No Second Thoughts : Changes in the IDF ’s Combat Doctrine In Light Of Operation ‘ Cast Lead ’ , ” demonstrates Israel ’s application of a new combat doctrine during the hostilities in Gaza , which is based on two principles :
“ Zero Casualties ” :
The complete prioritization of avoiding IDF [ Israeli army ] casualties while disregarding the increased risk to Palestinian civilians .
The implementation of this policy is evident in the massive use of fire power , the use of white phosphorous weapons in densely populated areas , and in firing at Palestinians in the streets , with no discrimination between combatants and civilians , this even after the IDF would order the evacuation of residents from civilian homes .
“ Dahiyah Doctrine ” : named after the residential Dahiyah district in Beirut , where Hizballah enjoyed support and also had its headquarters .
The district was massively bombed by the IDF during the Second Lebanon War .
The doctrine promotes targeting civilian infrastructure in order to cause widespread destruction and suffering among the civilian population so as to foment popular opposition to Israel ’s opponents ( namely Hamas and Hizballah ) .
As a result of the implementation of these principles , the fighting in the Gaza Strip caused intentional and large - scale damage to civilian infrastructure as well as the killing of hundreds of non-combatant civilians ( despite the absence of an official policy to intentionally kill civilians ) .
Israel ’s actions directly contradict official statements claiming that the IDF acted in accordance with international humanitarian law and took every possible measure to avoid harming non-militant civilians .
This combat doctrine morally stains the citizens of Israel .
It may lead to increased international isolation of Israel and to a situation where Israeli soldiers , officers and leaders will face arrest outside of Israel and be charged with war crimes .
The writers of the report summarize : “ So fundamental a shift in the IDF ’s combat doctrine , which has such a far - reaching impact , should n’t be considered only in the closed forums of the General Headquarters and the Security Cabinet , but demands substantial public discussion . ”

Hulk Hogan Comes to TNA !
| By
The wrestling industry is used to shakeups , but few are bigger than Hulk Hogan coming to TNA Wrestling .
This has been a long time coming for TNA and it ’s something I ’ve been calling for quite a while .
TNA has finally gotten the deal together and Hulk is signed .
Expect Ric Flair and others to come soon as well .

" Ruby is about to gain thousands of gems " , Charles Nutter twittered a few days ago .
What has happened ?
Last year , Charles started the maven_gem project , " a RubyGems plugin ( and a utility ) to install Maven artifacts as RubyGems " , and he now apparently succeeded in making maven artifacts installable as RubyGems , as this shell session shows .
This really would make a slew of libraries available to be used in JRuby projects .
Contrary to what 's written in the maven_gem Readme file , it seems to be possible to just create a Gem without installing it .
A related new project is JavaGems .
It 's goal is to be a simpler alternative to Maven for JVM languages , not a replacement , as noted in their FAQ :
Maven is fine .
It 's an incredibly powerful tool with a lot more features than JavaGems will probably ever have .
If Maven is working for you , keep using Maven .
The problem is , some of us have smaller needs and do n't need all the power of Maven , but rather , need something more simple .
JavaGems aims to fill that gap .
It 's not trying to replace Maven , but rather , complement it .
JavaGems is essentially a Gemcutter instance providing , at the moment , artifacts such as JRuby , Clojure and several Scala libraries .
It uses RubyGems and Bundler for dependency management .
To see JavaGems in action , this blog post shows how to install Clojure , Compojure ( a Clojure web framework ) and get a " Hello World " example running in a few easy steps .
In other JRuby related news , JRuby 's Java integration will soon be able to generate classes that implement Java interfaces and extend Java classes , as shown in this JRuby example .
For more information on the interaction between Clojure and JRuby , see JRuby and Clojure - A Good Match ? on InfoQ .
The news that a leaked set of emails appeared to show senior climate scientists had manipulated data was shocking enough .
Now the story has become more remarkable still .
The computer hack , said a senior member of the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change , was not an amateur job , but a highly sophisticated , politically motivated operation .
And others went further .
The guiding hand behind the leaks , the allegation went , was that of the Russian secret services .
The leaked emails , which claimed to provide evidence that the unit 's head , Professor Phil Jones , colluded with colleagues to manipulate data and hide " unhelpful " research from critics of climate change science , were originally posted on a server in the Siberian city of Tomsk , at a firm called Tomcity , an internet security business .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The FSB security services , descendants of the KGB , are believed to invest significant resources in hackers , and the Tomsk office has a record of issuing statements congratulating local students on hacks aimed at anti-Russian voices , deeming them " an expression of their position as citizens , and one worthy of respect " .
The Kremlin has also been accused of running co-ordinated cyber attacks against websites in neighbouring countries such as Estonia , with which the Kremlin has frosty relations , although the allegations were never proved .
" It 's very common for hackers in Russia to be paid for their services , " Professor Jean - Pascal van Ypersele , the vice chairman of the Inter - governmental Panel on Climate Change , said in Copenhagen at the weekend .
" It 's a carefully made selection of emails and documents that 's not random .
This is 13 years of data , and it's not a job of amateurs . "
The leaked emails , Professor van Ypersele said , will fuel scepticism about climate change and may make agreement harder at Copenhagen .
So the mutterings have prompted the question : why would Russia have an interest in scuppering the Copenhagen talks ?
This time , if it was indeed the FSB behind the leak , it could be part of a ploy to delay negotiations or win further concessions for Moscow .
Russia , along with the United States , was accused of delaying Kyoto , and the signals coming from Moscow recently have continued to dismay environmental activists .
When Ed Miliband , the Secreatary of State for Climate Change , visited Moscow this year , he had meetings with high - level Russian officials and pronounced them constructive .
But others doubt that Russia has much desire to go green .
Up in the far northern reaches of Russia , there are stretches of hundreds of miles of boggy tundra ; human settlements are few and far between .
Often , the only inhabitants are indigenous reindeer herders , who in recent years have reported that their cyclical lifestyle is being affected by the climate : they have to wait until later in the year to migrate to winter camps , because the rivers do not freeze as early as they used to .
In spring , the snow melts quickly and it becomes harder for reindeer to pull sleds .
Much of Russia 's vast oil and gas reserves lie in difficult - to - access areas of the far North .
One school of thought is that Russia , unlike most countries , would have little to fear from global warming , because these deposits would suddenly become much easier and cheaper to access .
It is this , goes the theory , that underlies the Kremlin 's ambivalent attitudes towards global warming ; they remain lukewarm on the science underpinning climate change , knowing full well that if global warming does change the world 's climate , billions of dollars of natural resources will become accessible .
Another motivating factor could be that Russia simply does not want to spend the vast sums of money that would be required to modernise and " greenify " Russia 's ageing factories .
But global warming also brings with it a terrifying threat for Russia , the melting of permafrost , which covers so much of the country 's territory .
Cities in the Siberian north such as Yakutsk are built entirely on permafrost , and if this melts , are in danger of collapsing , along with railways and all other infrastructure .
But many in Russia 's scientific community are deeply sceptical of the threat from global warming .
And only 40 per cent of Russians believe climate change is a serious threat , a survey shows
Russia 's commitments ahead of Copenhagen have been modest .
In June , the President , Dmitry Medvedev , said Russia would reduce emission levels by 10 to 15 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 .
But what this actually means is a whopping 30 per cent rise from the present levels .
Using the 1990 figures as a benchmark is a way to gain extra leeway , because emissions in Russia have tumbled since the Soviet Union collapsed and much of its polluting industrial complex went down with it .
Of course , Russia is not alone in falling short on climate commitments .
But nor does it have a track record for openness for dismissal of the claims against the FSB to be straightforward .
The Tomsk hackers in the message along with their leak , wrote of their hopes that the release would " give some insight into the science and the people behind it " .
Similar insights into the hackers themselves look extremely unlikely .
Have you ever wondered why we use the symbol " lb " for the " pounds " unit ?
The word " pound " is short for " pound weight , " which was libra pondo in Latin .
The libra part of the phrase meant both weight or balance scales .
The Latin usage was shortened to libra , which naturally was abbreviated " lb . "
We adopted the pound part from pondo , yet kept the abbreviation for libra .
There are different definitions for the mass of a pound , depending on the country .
In the United States , the modern pound unit is defined to be 2.20462234 pounds per metric kilogram .
There are 16 ounces in 1 pound .
However , in Roman times , the libra ( pound ) was about 0.3289 kilograms and was divided into 12 uncia or ounces .
In Britain , there has been more than one type of " pound , " including the avoirdupois point and Troy pound .
A pound sterling was a tower pound of silver , but the standard was changed to the Troy pound in 1528 .
The tower pound , merchant 's pound , and London pound are all obsolete units .
The Imperial Standard Pound is defined as having a mass equal to 0.45359237 kilograms , which matches the definition of the international pound , as agreed upon ( although not adopted by the U.S. ) in 1959 .

It appears that even after thoroughly dominating the US legislative , judicial and executive branches , the long tentacles of the squid have been no better than the Mongolian hordes at overcoming the Chinese Wall ( which is ironic seeking how easy it is to ignore the same construct internally between the firm 's prop and flow traders ... and yes , we will be posting our response to Goldman shortly , we have not forgotten ) .
In the meantime , half a world away , a small Chinese power generator , Shenzhen Nanshan Power , is blatantly refusing to honor contracts with Goldman Subsidiary J. Aron for $ 80 million in derivative losses , and it appears that China itself has decided to stand behind the small company .
Reuters reports :
Shenzhen Nanshan Power ( 000037.SZ ) ( 200037.SZ ) said in a statement that it received several notices from J. Aron & Company , a trading subsidiary of Goldman Sachs ( GS.N ) , for at least $ 79.96 million as compensation for terminating oil option contracts .
" We will not accept the demand by J. Aron for all the losses and related interests , " said Nanshan , in line with the stance it took last December .
" We will try our best to negotiate with J. Aron and resolve the dispute peacefully ... but the possibility of using a lawsuit can not be ruled out when talks fail , " it added .
" J. Aron told us in one notice that if we do not pay the money , they will reserve the right to launch a lawsuit and will not send us any further notice . "
The State Assets Supervision and Administration Commission said in September that it would back state - owned companies in any legal action against the foreign banks that sold them oil derivatives , which resulted in losses when oil prices dived late last year .
[ ID : nPEK14474 ]
A Beijing - based Goldman Sachs corporate communication official declined to comment .
Not sure what Hank Paulson 's former firm would comment : alas the Chinese communist party still has to be filled with Goldman alumni .
That being said , this is precisely the track that Goldman has been focusing on for the past few years .
At this point , the firm realizes all too well that dominating power politics in China in the near futures is far more critical than complete control over D.C. , as there is little the world 's most important company can do domestically in the context of taxpayer capital transfer without a full fledged revolution .

The United Nations climate summit hit major turbulence on Monday when developing nations walked out of key negotiations and China accused the West of trickery , as the spectre of failure loomed heavily over Copenhagen .
As campaigners warned that negotiators had five days to avert climate chaos , ministers acknowledged they had to start making progress before the arrival of 120 heads of state for the summit ’s climax on Friday .
Sources said the developing countries walked out of working groups at the start of the second week of negotiations here , angered that the conference was weakening in support for the Kyoto Protocol , the core emissions - curbing treaty .
“ They have walked out , I am advised , of the working groups , ” one Western minister told Agence France - Presse on condition of anonymity .
“ This is salvageable .
It depends if people want to be constructive . ”
The move was unleashed by African countries , with the support of the G77 group of developing countries .
They refused to continue negotiations unless talks on a second commitment period to the Kyoto Protocol were given priority over broader discussions on a “ long - term vision ” for cooperative action on climate change .
The Kyoto Protocol ties the rich countries — but not developing countries — that have ratified it to binding emissions curbs .
It does not include the US , which says the protocol is unfair as the binding targets do not apply to developing giants that are already huge emitters of greenhouse gases .
“ Africa has pulled the emergency cord to avoid a train crash at the end of the week , ” said Jeremy Hobbs , executive director of Oxfam International .
The walkout delivered another blow to the summit which has already been marred by spats between China and the United States .
A top Western negotiator , speaking on condition of anonymity , said a round - table session of about 50 environment ministers on Sunday had been soured by “ growing tensions between the Americans and Chinese , ” saying delegates had merely repeated their previous stances rather than giving ground .
“ At the back of everyone ’s mind is the fear of a repeat of the awful scenario in The Hague , ” she told Agence France - Presse , referring to a climate conference in 2000 on completing the rulebook for the Kyoto Protocol that broke up angrily without agreement .
In an apparent concession , China said it might not take a share of any Western funding for emerging nations to fight climate change .
But in a pointer to the tensions backstage , Vice Foreign Minister He Yafei said China would not be the fall guy if there were a fiasco .
“ I know people will say if there is no deal that China is to blame .
This is a trick played by the developed countries .
They have to look at their own position and ca n’t use China as an excuse , ” he told the Financial Times .
Britain ’s climate minister , Ed Miliband , urged negotiators to work faster to break the deadlock .
“ Leaders are practically on their way … Leaders always have a very important role in this .
But frankly it ’s also up to negotiators and ministers not to leave everything up to the leaders , but to get our act together , ” he said .
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd , whose country is the industrialised world ’s biggest per-capita polluter , fretted at the possibility of failure without compromise all round .
“ There ’s a big risk that we will have conflicting views between developed and developing countries , ” Rudd said in Australia .
“ And there is always a risk of failure here . ”
Campaigners were even blunter , with Greenpeace saying the summit had five days “ to avert climate chaos ” and that emissions targets so far offered by Western leaders such as US President Barack Obama amounted to “ peanuts ” .
The gathering ’s daunting goal is to tame greenhouse gases — the invisible by - product derived mainly from the burning of coal , oil and gas that traps the sun ’s heat and warms the atmosphere .
Scientists say that without dramatic action within the next decade , Earth will be on course for warming that will inflict drought , flood , storms and rising sea levels , translating into hunger and misery for many millions .
The stakes were underlined when a new UN report said that about 58 - million people have been affected by 245 natural calamities so far this year , more than 90 % of them weather events amplified by climate change .
And a study from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , an intergovernmental group , said climate change threatens the survival of dozens of animal species from the emperor penguin to Australian koalas .
If all goes well , the conference will agree an outline deal of national pledges to curb carbon emissions and set up a mechanism to provide billions of dollars in help for poor countries in the firing line of climate change .

The scam is difficult for police and other agencies to target Online criminals are making millions of pounds by convincing computer users to download fake anti-virus software , internet security experts claim .
Symantec says more than 40 million people have fallen victim to the " scareware " scam in the past 12 months .
The download is usually harmful and criminals can sometimes use it to get the victim 's credit card details .
The firm has identified 250 versions of scareware , and criminals are thought to earn more than £ 750,000 each a year .
Franchised out Scareware sellers use pop-up adverts deliberately designed to look legitimate , for example , using the same typefaces as Microsoft and other well - known software providers .
They appear , often when the user is switching between websites , and falsely warn that a computer 's security has been compromised .
If the user then clicks on the message they are directed towards another site where they can download the fake anti-virus software they supposedly need to clean up their computer - for a fee of up to £ 60 .
Con Mallon , from Symantec , told the BBC the apparent fix could have a double impact on victims .
It is very prevalent and it's growing very quickly out there on the internet
Con Mallon , Symantec
Read your stories " Obviously , you 're losing your own hard - earned cash up front , but at the back end of that , if you 're transacting with these guys online you 're offering them credit card details , debit card details and other personal information , " he said .
" That 's obviously very valuable because these cyber criminals can try to raid those accounts themselves or they can then pass them on or sell them to others who ultimately will try to use that information to their benefit not yours . "
The findings were revealed in a report written following Symantec analysis of data collected from July 2008 to June 2009 .
Symantec said 43 million people fell for such scams during that period .
It has become so popular that the rogue software has been franchised out .
Fake reviews help build the credibility of bogus anti-virus software .
Mr Mallon said some scareware took the scam a step further .
" [ They ] could hold your computer to ransom where they will stop your computer working or lock up some of your personal information , your photographs or some of your Word documents .
" They will extort money from you at that point .
They will ask you to pay some additional money and they will then release your machine back to you . "
The scam is hard for police or other agencies to investigate because the individual sums of money involved are very small .
Therefore , experts say users must protect themselves with common sense and legitimate security software .
' Steal your identity ' Tony Neate , from Get Safe Online , told the BBC the threats presented by the internet had changed in recent years .
" Where we used to say protect your PC ... we 've now got to look at ourselves , making sure we 're protected against the con men who are out there , " he said .
" They want you to help them infect your machine .
When they 've infected your machine it 's possibly no longer your machine - you 've got no control over it .
" Then what they 're looking to do is take away your identity , steal bits of your identity , or even get some financial information from you . "
He added : " They used to be 16 - year - olds in their bedrooms causing damage with viruses .
Now those 16 - year - olds have grown up [ and ] they 're looking for money , they 're looking for information . "

Are incandescent headlights on their last flicker ?
They lit the road ahead for almost a century , but interest in incandescence , or light made with heat by pushing current through a thin filament , is going cold .
Light - emitting diodes , or LEDs , promise greater light for less power and waste heat .
Already used in taillights and turn signals , the LEDs ’ steadily improving efficiency means this technology is moving up to the big job .
They ’ll be the standard - equipment headlights on the 2010 Audi R8 V - 10 and optional on the V - 8 R8 .
U.S. prices are n’t finalized , but ­Europeans will pay about $ 5000 for the set .
Why is Audi pursuing this technology ?
Simple : LEDs make more light than heat and take up less space .
There is another benefit , too : LEDs can be arranged into whatever shapes designers and engineers demand — especially important to a style - leading brand such as Audi .
The common incandescent halogen bulb shines by electrifying and superheating a tungsten filament sealed in halogen gas .
Less than five percent of the power consumed results in light , the rest is heat that is wasted .
The ratio is somewhat better with high - intensity - discharge , or HID , headlights , where instead of passing over a solid filament , the current arcs between two filaments through a cloud of light - amplifying xenon gas .
__________________________________________________________________________________
__________________________________________________________________________________
Instead of incandescent , an LED is electroluminescent .
Light is produced by electrifying a material , in this case a silicon chip , which is treated to be a diode , or a conductor through which electrons flow only one way .
Varying the voltage to both sides of the diode excites the electrons , and their movement creates photons , or light .
Thanks to chip improvements , LED output is whiter and also brighter , from 15 lumens per watt in 2001 , when Audi started its research , to 60 today , says Audi ’s light engineering director , Stephan Berlitz .
In the R8 , the LEDs are clustered — 14 for the low beam , eight for the high beam — and cooled by fans to keep internal temps below a diode - killing 300 degrees F .
The fans also circulate warm air to defrost the lenses on cold mornings .
Berlitz says costs will remain high until more automakers adopt LED technology .
Until then , LED hype will generate more heat than light .

Keeping Your Financial New Year ’s Resolutions
It ’s easy to be cynical about New Year ’s resolutions .
After all , how many of us keep them ?
I did n’t achieve all of my resolutions for 2009 , even though I made a rather short list to help me improve the odds of success .
But , I did check a couple things off the list , and I made headway on a couple more .
And that gives me encouragement to re-commit to the resolutions I did n’t keep in 2009 and try again in 2010 .
I ’m not alone in this attitude .
According to a study done by a psychology professor at the University of Scranton , John Norcross , people who make New Year ’s resolutions are 10 times more likely to accomplish the changes they want than those who do n’t formally resolve .
So even though only one in five people manage to keep their New Year ’s resolutions , those who at least make them are on the right track to eventually accomplish lasting changes .
So , go ahead .
Make those grand promises to yourself to save more and pay down debt .
But have a financial plan as well , performing a financial checkup and resolving to fix some of your problems .
Here are some things that can help you increase the chances of actually keeping your financial New Year ’s resolutions :
Break it down :
You ’ve heard this before .
Do n’t just resolve to save more money .
Break it down .
Make it a little more specific .
Look at your budget .
Can you save $ 100 more per month ?
Make that your goal .
Figure out what you need to do to make it happen .
Open a high yield savings account .
Arrange to have the money automatically deducted from your paycheck and deposited into the account .
The same goes for paying down debt .
Or refinancing your home ( one of my financial resolutions ) .
Look at the small steps you need to accomplish your goal , and then map out a plan .
Look for support : A good support system can go a long way .
If you have a life partner , make goals together , and then encourage each other .
Ask for help from other friends and relatives .
If you are trying to get out of debt , let your friends know and ask them to help you avoid temptation .
Find others with similar goals so that you can encourage each other to make better progress .
Reward yourself :
Since you are breaking your financial New Year ’s resolutions into small , doable steps , you can actually reward yourself .
You do n’t have to make the reward expensive , either .
Do something small , but fun .
I like to reward myself with an ice cream , or with a new book .
I might also take a few extra minutes to relax or sleep in as a reward .
Whatever it is , mark the occasion when you accomplish one of your small goals .
Do n’t get to bent out of shape about slip - ups :
Do n’t assume that your goal is completely scuttled if you break down one month and raid your emergency fund , or if you pull out the credit card for a grocery shopping trip .
Instead , look at the circumstances that led to the lapse , and see how you can rectify the problem going forward .
Do n’t dwell on the mistakes ; learn from them and move forward .
Remember that your resolutions do n’t have to be made just once a year .
You can start fresh in March if you have to .
The idea is to be making sustainable financial changes that will eventually become second nature to you .
The bottom line is that even though we concentrate on making financial New Year ’s resolutions at this time of year , we really should be focusing on improvement throughout the year .
This is really a time of reflection so that you can get an idea of what you want to do , and make a plan for better finances .
This year , I hope to refinance my home , open a Health Savings Account , and start a retirement account for my husband ( we already have one for me ) .
What are your financial New Year ’s resolutions ?
The original Infectonator was for a game jam ?
Honestly I should have seen it coming .
A unique twist on the classic Pandemic 2 game , focusing on fast - paced gameplay rather than slow , world - wide domination .
The focus is more on the RPG - style of progression , going into a level , collecting money and spending it on various upgrades to spread faster , rather than a resource - management game typical of the infection - style genre .
The gameplay is fairly straight - forward : go into a level , infect as many as possible , upgrade , repeat .
However , despite the repetitive nature of the game it is still very much addictive .
The timer is simply annoying , preventing players from enjoying the game as fully as they could .
The limit is understandable considering it was for the 60seconds - to - fame challenge , and has the bonus of making the player play the game multiple times to find the best route for their progression , but the timer is , in the end , not necessary for the game to work .
As for the music and sound design , it is simplistic yet effective .
The main theme is slow and methodical , with a bit of insanity thrown into the mix , giving the feeling of a mad scientist at work with all the time in the world .
The music before the infection starts is peaceful and plodding , giving the impression of a perfect day .
The music after the infection starts is the complete opposite , quick and manic , with a feeling of speed , matching the frenetic pace of the gameplay very well .
As for the sound effects , they are few yet work well .
There are sounds of panic , bullets going off , and explosions .
Mixed with the music this makes the scene chaotic , but not overly so .
Infectonator is an instant classic .
The gameplay , music , and unique design would likely not last long on their own , but together pull into a nice , cohesive whole , offering an experience like no other .
I recently started working on another new project here at Imaginary Landscape , and this one looked rather enticing as it threw some stuff my way that I have n't had a chance to play with much recently .
First on that chopping block was a multi-page registration form application .
Immediately I remembered reading about Django 's Form Wizard module and thought it'd be a great way to handle this small application .
At least I thought so until I finished reading the specifications for the project and realized that the user must be able to move both backwards and forwards through the form .
Oh , and as a bonus , I was dealing with sensitive information , so I had to be careful about what I stashed in sessions .
So unfortunately Form Wizard was n't going to be able to handle my needs , as it does n't really support going backwards in the forms .
Also , it 's built for use with django .
forms .
Form , not django.forms.ModelForm like I wanted to use since I have to store all this information in a database anyway .
In the end I went with storing object IDs in the user 's session .
This would allow me to grab the data that was submitted based off the ID , avoid storing sensitive information in sessions , and provide me with all the functionality that I was looking to achieve .
This actually ended up being more straightforward than I had initially expected .
First you need some forms :
class UserInfoForm( forms.ModelForm ) : class Meta : model = models .
UserInfo class AddressForm( forms.ModelForm ) : class Meta : model = models .
Address
Let 's just pretend these are connected to very basic models that fit their namesake .
Now we 'll need to create some views :
def user_information ( request ) : if request . method == " POST " : form = forms .
UserInfoForm ( request .
POST ) if form.is_valid( ) : user_info = form.save( ) request.session['user_info_id ' ] = user_info.id return HttpResponseRedirect( reverse ( " address_form " ) ) else : if ' user_info_id ' in request.session : try : user_info_obj = models .
UserInfo.objects.get ( id=request.session['user_info_id ' ] ) form = forms .
UserInfoForm( instance=user_info_obj ) except ObjectDoesNotExist : del request.session ['user_info_id '] form = forms .
UserInfoForm ( ) else : form = forms .
UserInfoForm ( ) return render_to_response( " app/user_info.html " , locals ( ) , context_instance=RequestContext( request ) )
As you can see this is fairly straightforward .
It 's just how you 'd handle a normal form , but after we save our form we 're injecting the " user_info.id " into the session .
We 'll be needing this if we decide to go backwards from our next form .
If we 're not posting , we check to see if that ID is in the session .
If it is , we load that object , and initialize the form it .
If that object does n't exist , we clear the session item and create a blank form for the user to fill out .
Now we have our second form :
def address ( request ) : if ' user_info_id ' not in request.session : return HttpResponseRedirect ( reverse ( " user_info_form " ) ) if request .
method == " POST " : user_info_obj = models .UserInfo.objects.get ( id=request.session['user_info_id ' ] ) new_address = models .
Address( patient=user_info_obj ) form = forms .
AddressForm ( request .
POST , instance=new_address ) if form.is_valid( ) : address_info = form.save( ) request.session [' address_info_id ' ] = address_info.id ##
Send them to a thank you page else : if ' address_info_id ' in request.session : try : user_info_obj = models .
UserInfo.objects.get ( id=request.session['user_info_id ' ] ) except ObjectDoesNotExist : return HttpResponseRedirect ( reverse ( " user_info_form " ) ) try : address_obj = models .
Address.objects.get ( id=request.session ['address_info_id ' ] ) form = forms .
AddressForm( instance=address_obj ) except ObjectDoesNotExist : user_info_obj = models .UserInfo.objects.get ( id=request.session['user_info_id ' ] ) form = forms .
AddressForm ( initial={'user ' : user_info_obj.id} ) else : user_info_obj = models .UserInfo.objects.get ( id=request.session['user_info_id ' ] ) form = forms .
AddressForm ( initial={'user ' : user_info_obj.id} ) return render_to_response( " app/address.html " , locals ( ) , context_instance=RequestContext ( request ) )
This follows the same basic principle as the first form .
As an added treat , it also uses some data from the first form .
If we do n't have that data , that means the user did n't fill out the first form .
In that case , we send them back to the first form to properly fill it out .
We also stash the ID of the address object in the sessions as well , which if this is the last form ( which it is in this example ) is n't totally necessary .
You can choose to clear all the items from the session that you put in there if you prefer .
However , if the user uses their browser 's back button to go back to the first form and submit it , then the second form will still be initialized with the data they previously put in there .
Surprisingly , that pretty much sums up creating a multi-page form in Django .
Naturally there are many ways to accomplish a multi-page form .
If you 're using simple forms and do n't need to enable users to browse backwards , then I highly recommend FormWizard for ease of use .
It 's really easy to use , and handles most use cases .
If you need something a bit more complex , the code above should work out for you .
Though I must warn you , this code was adapted to this blog post from an existing project .
As such , there might be some minor issues I missed in adaptation .
Please let me know in the comments if you see any such issues .
* NY Senate votes down gay marriage bill 38 - 24
* Anti-gay marriage activists praise “ enormous victory ”
* Gay rights activists say vote is against equality ( Adds comment from New York governor )
NEW YORK , Dec 2 ( Reuters ) - New York state lawmakers voted on Wednesday against legalizing gay marriage , dashing gay rights activists ’ hopes it would become the sixth U.S. state to allow same - sex couples to wed .
The New York state Senate voted down the legislation by 38 - 24 .
Governor David Paterson , a Democrat who supports gay marriage , had said he would have signed the bill into law if it had passed .
“ This is an enormous victory , ” said Maggie Gallagher , the leader of the National Organization for Marriage , which opposed the law .
“ What you saw was the will of the people .
....
The culture really has n’t shifted on gay marriage . ”
Iowa , Connecticut , Massachusetts , New Hampshire and Vermont have legalized gay marriage , while 40 U.S. states have specific laws that ban gay marriage .
Last month , voters in Maine chose to repeal a law that had legalized gay marriage .
“ This is a civil rights issue .
Marriage equality is as important as the emancipation of any group from oppression and the granting of equal rights to any community , ” Paterson said .
“ As disappointed as we are today , let ’s get up tomorrow and redouble our efforts . ”
New York is one of the most politically liberal states in the country .
Recent polls showed a majority of New York voters favored allowing same - sex couples to marry , but one poll showed the public evenly split .
New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said he was “ deeply disappointed ” the Senate had not legalized gay marriage .
“ Historic change does not come easily , but this vote was a crucial step that , I believe , will ultimately lead the state to extend full marriage rights to all couples , ” he said .
New York ’s Democratic - controlled state Assembly has easily passed the bill legalizing same - sex marriage three times , but the legislation had not been voted on in the Senate until now .
The Democrats hold a Senate majority of 32 - 30 , but several Democratic senators opposed legalizing gay marriage .
“ Put the issue to a referendum and let the people vote , ” said Ruben Diaz , a Democratic state senator and Pentecostal minister who opposed bringing the bill to a vote .
“ Where you give the people the opportunity to vote for it , the people will reject it , ” he said .
‘ PAINFUL LOSS ’
“ We will not accept defeat and we will not stop fighting until all New Yorkers are treated equally , ” said New York City Council Speaker Christine Quinn , who is gay .
Gay rights lobby group the Empire State Pride Agenda , said marriage would entitle gay couples to 1,324 rights -- from tax to adoption benefits -- that otherwise would be denied .
“ This is a painful loss for loving and committed same - sex couples in New York who want the same things all Americans do : to take care of each other and their families , ” said Jarrett Barrios , president of national gay advocacy and anti-defamation group Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation .
The result in New York has worried gay marriage activists in New Jersey , where the Democratic - controlled state Legislature is considering taking up the issue before Democratic Governor Jon Corzine leaves office in January .
Corzine has said he would sign a bill legalizing gay marriage .
He was defeated in November by Republican Chris Christie , who has said he would veto such a bill .
New Jersey already permits same - sex civil unions .
“ What happened in New York ca n’t be good , ” said Steven Goldstein , the head of the New Jersey gay rights group Garden State Equality .

How did La Sécurité Sociale come about ?
The underlying principle of the French welfare system was originally instituted by the Conseil National de la Résistance or CNR .
The CNR , which represented both the communist and the gaullist resistance was the coordinating organ of the French Resistance during the war , and played a major role in shaping post - war institutions and promoting social justice .
La Sécurité sociale was not created by one single piece of legislation .
It was a very protracted process .
Initially it concerned only employees in the private sector ( 1945 ) ) , civil servants ( 1947 ) , agricultural workers ( 1961 ) , other workers ( 1966 ) .
It became universal only in 1999 ( until then part of the population and notably the homeless were not covered ) .
There was a gradual shift as initially , the aim was to protect ' workers and their families ' , whereas today healthcare is considered as a human right rather than a worker 's right .
How is it organized and managed
La Sécurité Sociale is what you people call a single - payer system .
It covers 4 ' branches ' namely - Health Insurance ( l'Assurance Maladie - we always seem to favor the pessimistic point of view ) - Insurance against work accidents and illnesses - Pensions - Subsidies for families with >= 2 children
[ Insurance for workers who lose their jobs belongs with a separate but similar entity called ASSEDIC ] .
La Sécurité Social is not government - run .
It has its own budget and is managed jointly ( on a 50 - 50 basis ) by trade unions and employer 's organizations .
In fact the employers are united and the trade unions are divided so that for all practical purposes the employers prevail , but they can't do exactly what they would like to do .
[ This is a personal appreciation based on facts ] .
How is it paid for ?
It 's not free !
It is not paid for by taxes ( or should not be ) !
So how does it work ?
Let me give first my personal example .
Each month I get about 4200 euros on my bank account from my employer .
But my employer
pays 9500 for my salary .
The difference , that is 5300 , goes almost entirely to la Sécu ( that 's the social contribution ) .
About half of that serves for Health insurance .
On the 4200 I get , I still have to pay the tax on the revenue ( about 450 in my case ) and local taxes ( about 450 as well - I live in a city where local taxes are very high ) .
I think I have convinced you that it 's not for free .
The algorithm for computing social contributions is complicated but roughly speaking , half of what an employer pays goes to the employee and the other half is the social contribution .
That is , the social contribution is hardly progressive ( meaning the ratio contribution / salary is roughly constant , unlike the ratio revenue tax / revenue ) .
Are there problems ?
The system works well in the sense that if you are seriously ill you do not have to worry too much about money ; essentially all is paid for .
Still everything is not paid for ( especially in the case of everyday ailments ) and there are more and more exceptions , more and more cases when you have to pay something - or even everything .
But , if this trend is alarming to many people , right now we pay on average a tiny proportion of the costs .
It has drawbacks .
The social contributions are public money ( in a sense ) which goes essentially to private pockets : most physicians , pharmacists and other medical professionals work in the private system , some hospitals are private , others are public .
The fees are in principle negociated with La Sécurite Sociale but very often physicians ask for much more than what will be refunded to their patients .
And of course the Pharma industry profits vastly .
La Sécurité Sociale is not in a strong position to negociate as it is basically run by employers and governments are submitted to constant lobbying from the industry and physicians ' organizations .
Moreover employers complain that the cotisations sociales are too much of a burden for them and since around 1970 all governements have granted them rebates ( recall that basically employers also manage la Sécu ) .
In principle those rebates are complensated by government money ( that is taxes ! ) but in fact the government owes a huge amount to la Sécu .
What with that and the increase in costs , la Sécu has a big deficit [ in fact it 's not that clear - according to some it is made up ] which is constantly invoked to reduce payments .
Also , part of the population say that La Sécu is ill - managed , that many people cheat etc .
In my opinion this is only marginally true and is mostly used as a political weapon against La Sécu .
How is it perceived ?
All in all the French are deeply attached to their healthcare system .
Some politicians and a small part of the population advocate a private insurance system like in the US .
But I believe ( hope ? ) that so far public opinion would absolutely oppose that .
My personal point of view is that in a sense the French system is crazy since public money goes to the private sector .
I am often pissed off when I see industrial interests prevailing or when physicians get an huge increase in their fees when salaries are frozen .
But it works , in that people are effectively protected , and there is a strong consensus around it .
That , in my opinion , is a good reason for keeping it going and protecting it .
In fact all people involved have an interest in keeping the system as it is .
I suspect that if we had an entirely public system , it would be much easier to attack it , less people would defend it , and ultimately it would be privatized which would be a disaster .
What do I think about the situation in the US ?
Before WWII , there were private insurances in France ( some non-profit , others profit oriented ) .
After WWII France was in shambles , and in a near - revolutionary context , the Conseil National de la Résistance , using its quasi- divine prestige , initiated the French Welfare State .
It took nonetheless more than 50 years to arrive at universal health care .
The situation in the US is less favourable so it would not be realistic to hope to achieve everything at one single stroke .
The French system is robust because it blends public and private interests into a notion of public service .
I think that , considering what US culture is , and where you are coming from , aiming at a 100 % public system is not reasonable ( even if I understand that such a system is preferable ; but it seems the British system is having difficulties too ) .
You see , it would be all right to have a system which satisfies perfectly liberals : but , apart from the fact that I 'm not sure all liberals can be perfectly satisfied at once , such a system would not live long .
In order for the system to be long lasting it has to be accepted by the most part of the population .
In the current debate on Daily Kos , I note that ' bill - killers ' denounce mostly what the bill does not do .
There is also a lot of distraction about who did what with whom .
In this diary I 'm not interested in that ; I
try to assess what the bill does , and what further evolutions it makes possible .
The French experience convinces me that a single bill cannot do everyting at once .
This is a multi dimensional problem , or a war on several battlefields .
The present bill has many flaws ; most of these flaws can be corrected by subsequent bills ; but it has also , in my opinion , the following merits ( I 'll make it short - 4 items only ) :
It establishes healthcare as a universal right - and that means , also , a universal duty !
Healthcare has a cost , and everybody must pay for it othewise it does n't work .
This means a complete change of perspective .
Once people have accepted that , the landscape will be completely different .
I think this is the key point and even liberals find it hard to swallow .
Many oppose mandates because they are pissed off by such and such flaw in the bill ( notably the fact that their money will be going to private insurance ) .
I understand that but if you believe in universal healthcare
you must accept that you will be forced to pay even when you 're in good health and your money will be going to private interests , notably the pharma industry and you will be pissed off .
This happens in all the countries which have good health care ( at least , it happens in France ) but we have health care and that is what matters foremost .
It 's up to us to try and fight the lobbies when necessary and to elect politicians who will protect health care against private interests .
There is no miracle here .
In the short term it makes healthcare more affordable and it will save many people from horrible situations .
Sounds trite but there is no denying that .
You can't imagine how these stories about people going bankrupt because of health problems sound barbaric .
This is a humanitarian crisis , not a political game .
Even if it does n't create a public option ( not to mention single payer ) , the bill creates a new paradigm where private insurances provide a public service .
By which I mean that they become accountable to the people ( being providers of something which is no longer a marchandize but a right ) and to the government which subsidizes .
That may seem a bit theoretical and far - fetched but I really think it makes thinks completely different .
It applies a new sort of pressure on the insurance industry .
They are the instruments of law ; they can be taken ot task if they do not implement the rights of people .
The insured are no longer just customers , they are human beings who have a right to healthcare .
And , since the government subsidizes , it has a strong interest in people being happy about the system and in getting its money 's worth .
Tis bill is by essence a step which will be followed by other steps .
It creates a dynamic situation .
As I see things , private insurance won the ability to survive .
If their profits had been limited to 10 % , that would have killed them ultimately .
At 15 % they can survive but with the pressure and the new obligations they will be facing , life will be harder for them and there will be room for non profit insurance .
A public option will become possible .
Legislation will follow .
Of course you people know the situation in the US much better that I do , still I 've been following these discussions for quite some time and I think I understand what it is all about , to a certain extent .
As I said previously , I 've been an obamaniac from the start .
During the ' primary wars ' there was only one point on which I thought Hillary was right and Barack wrong : mandates .
I think that mandates are a very positive part of this bill .
I expect many critics , but I would require only one thing : that in comments , you should discuss what the bill does , its pros and cons , what may come to pass .
I beg you not to discuss individual people 's actions or strategies .
That is not what is at stake now and it only obscures this very important question .
And there are many diaries on the rec list for that .
Thank you for your attention !
Update [ 2009-12-26 13:57:16 by French Imp ] : Wow !
Thank you very much for the rec ' list and especially for your positive reactions .
Thank you also for granting me my wish and discussing the issues and avoiding the various distractions .
My primary aim was to provide some perspective .
The French system is often considered as one of the best ; however it is not perfect and I think that dreaming about the ideal system is good but it is also useful to have actual working examples in mind .
The second part of my diary is of less interest , as you know better than me what is good for you !
As to my ignorance of the US situation , many thanks to those of you who were kind enough to deny it , and to those who agreed with me that it is considerable ( and who turn out to be also those who disagree on my conclusions ) .
However I would like to insist that , while I think this bill should pass , I also agree that it has many flaws .
Killing this bill would be a huge mistake , but if it can still be improved even marginally that 's fine .
And once it is passed , it must be followed by better legislation until you reach a reasonable form of universal health care .
I will try to answer your questions as soon as possible .

LONDON — Never before has Europe ’s monetary union seemed so fragile .
Day by day , fears are growing that Greece or another weak country may default on its sovereign debt obligations , forcing the richer countries in Europe to ride to the rescue or risk having one or more of its most vulnerable members leave the 16 - nation euro zone .
Many European economists discount such a fracture as a remote possibility .
But that does n’t mean Europe has safely emerged from crisis .
Instead , it faces a longer - term challenge to restore the fiscal credibility of at least half the countries that use the euro .
The true test for the world ’s largest common currency zone , analysts say , will be whether it can withstand the economic , political and social strains once the European Central Bank begins to raise interest rates in response to economic improvements in Germany , France and other Northern European countries .
At that point , the laggards on the union ’s fringe — Portugal , Ireland , Italy , Greece and Spain ( the so - called Piigs ) — will face even tougher choices to cope with what looks like several more years of stagnant economies , high unemployment and gaping budget deficits .
For everyone who seems to constantly mention the horrible and dire effects of coming in contact with a bit of mercury , do any of you remember that we used to PLAY with balls of mercury in our science classes and we are , all things considered , JUST FINE .
Though mercury poisoning is real and the threat may be worth considering , it 's way , way exaggerated .
I think it 's ridiculous that every mention of a fluorescent bulb is followed by a thousand comments treating mercury as if it's the single deadliest and most dangerous product in existence .
I used to bounce it around a lab table .
It was good fun .
I may be a little crazy , but I do not have autism , my hair is not falling out , and my kidneys are in perfect working order , etc .
I know there are plenty of clinical / scientific studies demonstrating the dangers of mercury .
Those same studies exist for numerous other things we deal with in day to day life .
The majority of people that have had mercury absorbed through the skin , ingested it via fish , or inhaled it 's vapors are fine .
Fear and sensationalism is blowing the impending doom that is mercury out of proportion .
Unicode is great because it supports multiple languages simultaneously , bringing international understanding , universal peace , and planetary love .

KDE was created with the goal of building a desktop environment for the Linux platform .
The modern KDE ecosystem , which spans multiple operating systems and includes a wide range of applications and development frameworks , has a broader mandate and loftier aspirations .
In an effort to improve the way that KDE stakeholders communicate about the technology , the developers recently announced plans to overhaul KDE 's branding .
The assortment of applications and software infrastructure that has traditionally been referred to as the KDE desktop environment will now be known as the KDE Software Compilation ( SC ) , and the new 4.4 beta , which was made available on Friday , is the first release to use the new branding .
The beta introduces several excellent window management features that have been highly anticipated by KDE enthusiasts .
I installed KDE 4.4 SC beta 1 on openSUSE 11.2 using VirtualBox for some hands - on testing .
I used the binary packages that are hosted in the openSUSE build service 's unstable KDE repository .
Plasma has continued to mature and offers a number of compelling enhancements in 4.4 .
The dialog for selecting plasmoids to add to the desktop is gone .
Its replacement is a horizontal strip that appears above the panel that runs along the bottom of the screen .
That displays the available plasmoids as blocks with large icons ; users can drag plasmoids from the strip and drop them on panels or on the desktop .
It looks very similar to the widget selection interface from Apple 's Dashboard .
Some of the most impressive new features in KDE SC 4.4 can be found in KWin , the KDE window manager .
It has finally gained support for tabbed window management .
Users can join multiple windows into groups that can be moved around and managed together .
KWin's
Oxygen theme has been enhanced so that any windows in a group will appear as titlebar tabs .
You can switch which window is active by clicking on one of the tabs in the titlebar .
Window grouping features can be accessed by right - clicking on the titlebar of a window .
You can set keyboard shortcuts for rotating among windows in a group , but there does n't yet appear to be a way to create a group directly from the keyboard .
Window grouping was mostly developed by Jorge Mata as a Google Summer of Code project .
The implementation is impressive — although it's not quite as slick as the equivalent feature in Compiz , the integration with the Oxygen window decoration is really good .
Another nifty new KWin feature in KDE SC 4.4 is edge snapping .
When you drag a window to the left or right edge of the screen , it will snap into place and fill that side .
When you drag it away from the edge , it will snap back to its original size .
You can also drag a window to the top edge of the screen to maximize it .
This feature , which is a lot like Aero Snap , makes it easy to set up windows side by side .
There are a number of more sophisticated KWin changes that are under active development but probably wo n't arrive in KDE SC 4.4 .
I 'm particularly enthusiastic about a project that was undertaken by developer Nikhil Marathe which will ultimately add dynamic window tiling , so that KWin can be used like Ion and other keyboard - oriented tiling window managers .
It 's still at an early stage of development , but it shows considerable promise .
Several new applications will debut in 4.4 , including a new blogging tool called Blogilo .
The tool , formerly known as Bilbo , is designed to give users a way to manage and post content to blogs that use the Metaweblog API , including WordPress , MovableType , and Blogger .
Its built - in content editor has optional WYSIWYG support and spellchecking .
Due to its broad assortment of capabilities , Blogilo is arguably the most feature - rich native blogging tool on the Linux platform .
It 's a particularly useful tool for users who write multiple blogs and want to manage them through a single interface .
The official release of KDE SC 4.4 is scheduled for early February .
You can learn more about the roadmap and planned features by looking at the 4.4 release goals page at the KDE wiki .

SANDUSKY , Ohio -
So much for the value menu .
A Taco Bell manager in Ohio says a man who appeared drunk walked into the restaurant earlier this week and handed him $ 72 for just one taco .
The manager tells police near the northern Ohio town of Sandusky that the customer who seemed to be in his early 20s refused to take back the money and told workers " Merry Christmas . "
Manager Aaron
Ohm says he thought for sure the man would return for his money , but he so far he has n't shown up .
Police are holding on to the money as evidence and say if it's not claimed in 60 days , the store manager will get a late Christmas gift .

Two studies published this month in the Journal of Clinical Investigation provide a significant advance in understanding how some species of monkeys such as sooty mangabeys and African green monkeys avoid AIDS when infected with SIV , the simian equivalent of HIV .
Using comparative genomics of SIV infection , researchers at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine , with collaborators from University of Minnesota , the University of Toronto , and Emory University , looked at sooty mangabeys , and a second group at the Pasteur Institute in France , looked at African green monkeys to identify possible genes related to disease progression or resistance .
" Sooty mangabeys are able to rapidly shut down the immune response after the initial SIV infection , and remain healthy .
The mangabeys respond to SIV in a manner similar to rhesus macaques , which get sick , or to humans infected with HIV , but the mangabeys do not get sick , " says first author Steven E. Bosinger , PhD , a postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine .
" The Penn study is a step forward in understanding why some African monkeys do not get sick when they are infected with SIV , which is a key question in contemporary AIDS research , " says senior author Guido Silvestri , MD , associate professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine and Director of Clinical Virology .
The Penn study compared changes induced by SIV infection on the overall profile of gene expression in two species of monkeys : rhesus macaques , which undergo an AIDS - like disease when infected with SIV , and sooty mangabeys , which , in stark contrast , remain AIDS - free despite life - long infection .
Sooty mangabeys , which are native to Western Africa and infected naturally in the wild , were previously believed by some to remain asymptomatic because of a genetic inability to mount innate immune responses to SIV , and in particular , to produce type I interferons .
However , the current studies change the way AIDS researchers think about human versus simian AIDS infection .
The sooty mangabeys ' robust antiviral immune response upon SIV infection , including a massive up - regulation of interferon response genes , or ISGs , indicates production of type I interferons in the mangabeys .
Of note , this antiviral response is transient , as seen in sooty mangabeys , lasting for about four weeks , but remains constant over time in rhesus macaques , which may contribute to the immunodeficiency seen in this species .
SIV induces a massive activation of immune molecules in both species , but only sooty mangabeys are able to bring the response under control .
In addition , by comparing the changes induced by SIV infection on the overall profile of gene expression of rhesus macaques versus sooty mangabeys , the research teams identified genes whose expression may be responsible for disease progression or , alternatively , disease resistance .
These genes may provide novel targets for AIDS therapy .
The research was funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases .
Paul Greengrass 's Matt Damon - starring film of the award - winning book by Rajiv Chandrasekaran may well be a subtle , nuanced examination of the US occupation of Iraq .
But that 's not what the trailer is selling
The world needs a hero .
The world often does .
And when Matt Damon hears that , he 's always willing to step up .
And that is why we find Damon , returning to his buff Bourne action mould after a tubby , ' tasched turn in The Informant , in the very second frame of the trailer .
He 's in uniform , with the name " Miller " on his chest ( showing that this is probably not another Bourne instalment ) .

Unless Bourne is undercover , of course .
But maybe I 'm being unfair .
Comparing everything Damon does to Bourne seems mean .
And , after all , this is a trailer for a totally different film , with no relation whatsoever to those previous , very successful films .
Green Zone titles : Bourne again Photograph : Public Domain
Oh .
Apart from those relationships , of course .
And the Matt Damon factor .
But everything else must be very different , surely .
After all , Green Zone is based on the award - winning book , Imperial Life in the Emerald City , a complex examination of US - occupied Iraq .
And if you have read it , or glanced through any of the reviews , you could only imagine the big - screen version would be a multilayered , highly - nuanced portrait of a deeply complicated situation .
And that might well be the story the film itself does tell .
But that is n't the story this trailer is telling .
This is the story of a tough , taut , bottom - kicking military man sent into a severely dangerous world .
He 's a man , on a mission .
Brendan Gleeson in Green Zone Photograph : Public Domain
Until , that is , ponderous CIA man Brendan Gleeson gives him a mission within that mission .
Somehow , this goes wrong .
Thus begins a mission within a mission within a mission , involving a million dollars , hidden truths , a dreaded cover - up and dubious higher powers .
And then it would appear Damon 's character is suddenly forced to defend himself against the very people he thought were on the same side as him .
He goes on the run .
You can see him on the run here :
Green screen in Green Zone Photograph : Public Domain
He 's the blob in the middle of the green area .
Running .
And the more times you watch this trailer , I 'm sorry to report , the more it starts to seem reminiscent of … well , that film they reminded you of within the first 10 seconds of the trailer by presenting the star , the director and the names of the films in big , bold letters to jog your memory .
And lots of footage of Matt Damon running .
And shooting guns .

Sure , it might be the most un-Bourneish film in the world once you 're in the cinema .
But from this set of clippings , you imagine the marketing people would have been much happier if they could have persuaded Paul Greengrass to tweak the title to The Bourne Resuscitation : Bourne Again .
Or maybe something subtler , such as The Green Zonepremacy .
And just for those people who are saying , " Well that 's all very well , but who cares how like the source material or derivative of past successes it is , as long as there are exploding helicopters .
Will there be exploding helicopters ? " , the last moments of the trailer confirm that yes , there WILL be exploding helicopters .

Admittedly in that shot it looks a little more like a flambéed carp , but trust me , it 's an exploding helicopter .
OLEDs are like a new type of magical material , self - illuminating and eco-friendly .
They are organic and work in a way similar to the bioluminescence that makes a firefly and certain deep sea fish glow .
OLEDs can be extremely thin , flexible , varying in shapes , colors and sizes , some are even transparent while providing a lovely ambient glow .
The function and creative possibilities of OLEDs in clothing , furniture , jewelry , and art are only as limited as the creator ’s imagination .
Here are 33 excellent OLED eco-friendly and energy efficient designs , from the super - sly spy to the interactive .
The Future of OLED Lighting
Organic light - emitting diodes ( OLEDs ) are a new type of LED where a thin film of organic compounds is used to produce electroluminescence .
This means that OLEDs can produce paper - thin lights and displays — even fold - able ones .
Can you imagine rolling down your blinds to brighten your room ?
How about wallpaper with transparent OLED lighting ?
These are in the early stages of development as well as illuminated outwear such as for firefighters , portable and flexible lamps , and reflectors for bicyclist .
These super thin , stretchable and bendable OLEDs are in development to become a part of everyday settings .
Advancing Leaps and Bounds
In 2008 , roll - to - roll processed OLEDs became a reality .
Shortly after that , the first ever OLED Christmas tree was displayed by GE .
Recently however , there has been yet another leap forward in design , new efficient OLEDs cavities .
These new OLEDs are five times as efficient as standard OLEDs and use five times as much light per watt consumed .
They are ready to make white light by mixing green , red and blue OLEDs .
This new tech could arrive as soon as 2010 .
Super Thin TVs
OLED technology delivers a more energy efficient means of utilizing light .
It generates by the organic material in the OLED itself instead of a backlight that is always “ on ” , meaning when they are “ off ” , they consume no power whatsoever .
Over a year ago , Sony sold 11 - inch OLED TVs .
It was the first time in the world for such a feat where the super skinny TVs had OLEDs that measured 3 mm at the thinnest part !
The remote control from the XEL - 1 was only 10 mm thick .
More companies continue to follow suit .
OLED in the Now
Some cool products have recently been released that incorporate OLEDs .
The Murakami chair is attached to an OLED light source that is powered by rocking back and forth .
But what if you rock during the daytime when it ’s light ?
The OLED lamp senses light or dark and will store the energy you create by rocking in the day , so you will have light at night .
Another cool product is from Ennova Direct Corporation who created the world ’s first USB flash drive which comes equipped with an OLED display .
The retractable USB device has an integrated biometric fingerprint scanner on the interactive OLED display that changes color upon of the success or failure of each finger swipe .
Lastly , Visionox has come up with wall art that has decorative OLED - lighting built into the designs .
OLED Lighting Goes Mainstream in 2011
OLED technology has mainly been used in display applications like TVs , handset products and lighting applications .
But OLEDs have a bright future , since the thickness of OLED panels are reaching less than 1 mm thick and the flexibility has become more and more limitless .
Now their eye - catching illumination and design elements may start to show up in more than products with tight spaces for lighting .
The above photos were snapped at in Frankfurt , Germany .
These are new lighting and lamp designs .
Tranparent OLEDs
Transparent OLEDs are coming .
Scientists from Philips Research are currently advancing towards the development of transparent OLEDs like the ones pictured above .
Philips shared these images of see - through OLEDs as new lighting applications .
OLED Prototypes
Philips showed off their latest efforts in OLED lighting at the “ 100 % Design Fair ” in London .
The prototype hanging lights have an appealing design and OLED illumination .
They are made with the consumer in mind , but also promise lower power consumption .
Also in the motion - sensitive product range , they have “ pebble ” decorative lamps .
The left bottom two images are more than prototypes and can be purchased in varying shapes and colors from their Lumiblade shop .
lumiblade glow
This Reflections mirror automatically dims and brightens squares of OLED light around your refection .
Philips has many interesting lighting concepts in their Lumiblade shop where you can purchase an “ experience kit ” , but this mirror is not yet available .
Read , Wear , Play
E-readers are dropping in prices and incorporate OLEDs in the reading screen .
Marvel promises super - fast E-readers and a substantially lower cost to the consumer , so the products in the CES shows will no doubt continue to get cooler and more energy efficient .
In the middle , that is OLEDs used as jewelry , a bracelet , a watchband , and a light all - in - one .
Leave it to Japan to keep coming up with new OLED uses .
Philips unveiled their OLED interactive lighting experience during a Milan Design show .
This cool Interactive Light reacts to simple gestures as people move in front of it .
OLED Data Glasses
Ah , using OLEDs like you are a super - secret spy is not science fiction anymore .
These interactive data eyeglasses are being developed by students at the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany .
They project an image onto the retina from an OLED micro-display , making the image appear as if it ’s a meter in front of the wearer .
Unlike other glasses that throw up a static image , these will allow eye - tracking technology so the movement of the eyeball will scroll through information , menus , or move elements about .
The glasses are designed to provide information to people wearing them who do n’t have their hands free to operate a keyboard or mouse .
Coming in the near future ?
In a recent OLED design contest , these a but a few of the winning ideas .
On the left is an interactive game for kids that provides multi-sensorial feedbacks stimulating vision , hearing and touch .
The middle image is a table lighting application featuring an interesting tri-dimensional representation of the light source .
That is more than art pictured on the right .
It is a non-conventional solution for time measurement with a clear functional link to traditional hourglass .
OLEDs will only continue to become more energy efficient , cheaper , and the usage of OLEDs is only as limited as the creator ’s imagination .

The first attempt to send a rocket to the Moon via balloon hit a snag on Monday .
The first test of the Aeronautics and Cosmonautics Romanian Association ’s ( ARCA ) balloon - launched rocket ( or “ rockoon ” ) ended in failure when the “ inflation arms ” used to fill the balloon became entangled in the balloon itself .
The arms had to be cut , and the operation – which required the use of a large naval frigate — was curtailed .
ARCA hopes to compete in the Google Lunar X PRIZE , and intends on using their unusual rocket system to send an equally unique spherical lunar lander to win a $ 30 million prize .
Rockoons were tried and then abandoned by the US in the 1950s because they blew off course in windy conditions .
ARCA ’s European Lunar Explorer ( ELE ) is a simple design .
The super - huge balloon carrying a system of three rockets will soar to about 11 miles ( 18 km ) up .
Then the first two rocket stages will fire and boost the system into low Earth orbit , and use the final stage to boost it to the Moon .
The ELE will then travel to the moon and deploy its Lunar Lander , which resembles a knobby rubber ball that uses its own rocket engine to ensure a soft landing .
Watch their video of how it all will work below : ( If nothing else , watch it for the great music ! )
On Monday , the Romanians loaded their prototype moon - balloon rocket onto the a large Romanian naval frigate , the Constanta , which took the entire crew out to the launch site in the Black Sea .
But as the balloon started to inflate , the inflation mechanism arms got tangled , and the entire operation had to be abandoned .
The giant black balloon collects heat from the sun instead of using burners like hot - air balloons normally use , so it needs to launch during the day .
The Google Lunar X PRIZE challenges participants to construct a delivery system that will get a rover to the Moon , where the robot has to drive for about 500 meters , take high - resolution pictures of its surroundings , and then send them back home .
Undoubtedly , the ARCA team will try again .
See the images from Monday ’s launch attempt .

We had a really good comment on our trails and signage blog this morning that raised some questions I thought we should address in a more prominent way than in the comments section .
Here are Andrea ’s questions and our answers .
Is the WPA Bridge restoration project the reason why a bunch of PDPW workers were out installing a construction trailer next to Anderson Playground in Schenley Park this morning ?
None of the crew were able to even hazard a guess what the trailer was for , they were just following orders to park it there .
Seems a bit early to be installing there for work that is n’t supposed to begin til Spring … ?
Yes , the trailer near Anderson Playground is the contractors ’ construction trailer for the entirety of the trails restoration project .
It was deemed the most suitable and efficient location for the contractors to set up because it ’s pretty centrally located to all four parks where the work will take place , and there was no need to tear up or clear anything out to make room for it here .
Plus , it ’s likely to be there only until around June , and the Anderson Playground is less frequently used in winter than when it ’s nice out .
Work is actually set to begin in early December , so you ’ll be seeing the contractors and their crews sooner rather than later !
Also – why was the WPA Bridge restoration considered of greater urgency than the re-design / dredging / repair of the Panther Hollow Lake ( and perhaps also the destroyed boathouse ) ?
The bridges all seem to be among the most solid pieces of construction that the parks have to offer .
Whereas , of course , runoff from the Golf Course still makes huge algae blooms in the pond after every heavy rain , etc .
I had also heard somewhere that the Parks Conservancy had an interest in restoring the Panther Hollow Boathouse as part of a larger effort to create another “ entrance ” and attraction on the south end of Schenley Park – ?
The short answer is that the bridges are considered part of the trail system , so they are included in the scope of the trails project .
Our federal funding is for transportation and wayfinding , and the bridges fit nicely into that .
Plus , they ’re a part of the park ’s history that is rapidly deteriorating , so we want to prevent further damage and welcome people back into that section of the park .
The bigger picture is that Panther Hollow Lake is the last piece of the puzzle in a complete restoration of the Panther Hollow Watershed .
The bridges and trails are a piece that has to be completed first .
The lake is silted to a third of its original depth , partly due to sediment that is flowing from the hillsides and trails because of their poor condition .
If we do n’t fix these problems first , we would be dredging the lake only to have it refill with sediment all over again .
The Parks Conservancy been working for the better part of the last decade along with City crews and volunteers to do things like cross - slope trenching , which places fallen trees in positions that help to stabilize hillsides and slow down erosion .
As Andrea mentioned , another problem with the lake is pollution .
The algae blooms are caused not just by the golf course but by everyone living in the watershed ( which includes Oakland and Squirrel Hill ) .
( Here ’s a great article City Paper wrote on the subject this summer . )
Whenever we do things like failing to pick up after our dogs or over - fertilizing soil without testing it to see how much it actually needs , we ’re contributing to the problem .
Panther Hollow Lake is at the bottom of a deep valley , and it ’s the point to which all the water in this watershed flows , so figuring out what all the sources of pollution are –much less how to stop them –is a lengthy task .
Fortunately , Panther Hollow Lake has attracted the attention of the scientific community in Pittsburgh , and the problems are actively being studied .
The monitoring committee includes professors , students , and researchers from Carnegie Mellon , Pitt , Duquesne , Chatham , and ALCOSAN , among others .
As they continue to watch levels of E.Coli in Panther Hollow Lake to determine the major source of pollutants , we ’ll be able to know when those levels have dropped low enough that the lake meets fishable - swimmable standards set by the EPA .
Then the lake can be dredged , the area around it can be restored , and we can finally work on rebuilding the boathouse and turning Panther Hollow Lake into a safe and fun place for recreation .
The effect itself .
" The problem is the war ! "
No , the problem is the cause of the war , which may be economic , political , biological , religious , etc .
The messenger .
" That kid is starting a riot by spreading propaganda against our discipline ! "
Possibly -- but equally possible is that the discipline is at fault .
More information needed .
The taboo .
" He 's a Satanist / racist / Muslim / Jew / Scientologist who believes in biological determinism / eternal life / nothing / money is n't everything .
Therefore , he 's going to destroy us . "
Not necessarily , unless you can show that his beliefs include a doctrine that embraces a practice that will cause destruction -- and that is your actual cause .
The sacred cow .
" He 's suggesting we do away with prayer in schools , so he must be bad ! "
What is his reason for doing away with prayer in schools ?
Are we sure it is connected to a desire to do evil ?
The catch - all .
" If God wanted us to fly , he would have given us wings ! "
Ascribing intent to Gods , nature or the founding fathers that " catch all " arguments makes them impossible dichotomies .
Regrettably [ Chavez 's ] speech soon deteriorated into a laughable anti-capitalist rallying cry for the socialist model that he espouses .
The only golden nugget from his speech was :
" If the climate was a bank they would have saved it by now . "
Time to Market
" If the climate was an imperiled minority group , we would have saved it by now . "
" If the climate was a lost puppy , we would have saved it by now . "
" If the climate was gay marriage , we would have saved it by now . "
" If the climate was baby Jesus , we would have saved it by now . "
If you 're a realist , you 've gotten over thinking about how it looks to others that you think what you do .
You 've even gotten over whether you like it or not .
You just make conclusions : this cause appears to create this effect , so if it happens again , we 'll get some variation on that effect .
You then analyze everything that comes to your way to figure out its cause / effect structure and , if you 've seen it before , apply a winning ( or loss minimization ) strategy .
Not rocket science , eh ?
Well , there are many things we can mistake for causes :
You can see some of that in practice here , where someone is pointing out that we 've confused a sacred cow with an actual issue -- and in doing so , makes the same mistake himself :
What he 's saying is that we have confused sacred cows for actual issues .
What he has missed is that claiming banking is our sacred cow is wrong ; our sacred cow is anything popular with our egalitarian masses .
Try these , Chavez : What do all of these have in common ?
They 're tangible symbols by which we as individuals gained social status .
" See , I 'm good ; I help the poor / minorities / Jesus / gays / women with 1 % of my salary after taxes !
" The real problem , the real cause , is that we 're looking to gain popularity by our choices , not thinking rationality .
It 's a mental laziness that will punish us .

A federal lawsuit has been filed against pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca for its role in paying Chicago psychiatrist Dr. Michael Reinstein nearly $ 500,000 over the course of a decade to conduct research and to promote its anti-psychotic drug , Seroquel .
Reinstein is being accused of wrongfully preying on thousands of mentally - ill patients in order to rake in profits for AstraZeneca .
Reinstein has a long history of working with AstraZeneca , receiving regular payments for speeches he would make across the country promoting the drug .
AstraZeneca was also paying a for - profit research company , Uptown Research Institute , who in turn was paying Reinstein consulting fees for his services .
Cited in the lawsuit was the fact that Reinstein would continually prescribe roughly double the amount of drugs other psychiatrists would prescribe for the same conditions .
When patients would report their pain and suffering due to the tremendous side effects of such drugs and their abnormally high dosages , Reinstein would largely ignore their concerns .
Other accusations include illegitimately prescribing Seroquel for various other conditions , including losing weight , despite the fact that studies show the drug actually causes weight gain .
Reinstein was found to have made numerous false claims about Seroquel in promotional material , claims that would result in the destruction of people 's lives and health .
When all was said and done , more than 1,000 patients a year received Seroquel prescriptions from Reinstein at a cost of $ 7.6 million to taxpayers .
It is unknown how many billions of dollars AstraZeneca has made from the widespread efforts of Reinstein in promoting the drug nationwide for all those years .
Despite all of his wrongdoings , Reinstein is not even a defendant in the case .
AstraZeneca , the perpetrator which funded Reinstein , is the defendant in the lawsuit .
While both Reinstein and AstraZeneca appear guilty of unethical and illegal behavior , AstraZeneca is rightfully bearing the brunt as it knowingly continued to fund Reinstein and rake in the profits of his misconduct .
The case brings up an important issue that plagues the pharmaceutical industry .
The pharmaceutical money trail is never transparent , leading to questionable study results and improper marketing tactics .
There is no accountability in the drug sector and this entire segment of the economy seems to be driven by deception and greed .
Until people begin to demand restitution , the corruption will continue .
Yesterday , scrappy Presbyterian College from Clinton , South Carolina waddled into the Dean Dome to get predictably stomped by the Tar Heels .
That still did n't stop coach Roy Williams from tossing a Blue Hose fan for ... yelling at his team during free - throws .

During the post - game press conference , Williams puts on his best shit - kicker car salesman smile and explains to reporters that he had the fan removed because he does n't think that " anybody should yell anything negative at our players .
Period . "
One reporter continued to probe about what the fan said — " was it vulgar ? " — but Roy just summarily disposed of the question and threatened to end the presser if there were anymore questions about it .
According to one reader , the disruptive Presbyterian fan yelled — brace yourselves — " Do n't miss , Deon ! " when Deon Thompson was at the free - throw line .
As you can tell from the video , the fan was n't pantsless or anything like that and appears rightfully confused when two smokeys start yanking him out of the aisle .

The 40,000 ' eco-tourists ' who visit the South Pole every year cause enormous greenhouse gas emissions .
The visitors to the snow - covered landmass are endangering not just the Antarctic region by their actions , but also the rest of the world .
Dutch researcher Machiel Lamers has investigated the impacts of increased tourism on Antarctica and how this impact could be curbed .
Tourism is a ' boom industry ' in Antarctica .
Where , a mere 20 years or so ago , just a few hundred tourists would set off towards the South Pole , more than 40,000 inquisitive souls journeyed to the southernmost point on Earth last winter .
Then it was still summertime in Antarctica and the temperatures were bearable .
While tourism has many advantages to offer the South Pole , the increasing influx causes horrendous pollution : the long trips made by many of the tourists produce shocking amounts of CO 2 emission .
Machiel Lamers visited the South Pole and discussed the fragile future of the continent with other interested parties .
Tour operators hold the reins
Lamers spoke to scientists , policy makers , environmental groups and tour operators .
Antarctica appears to be facing major challenges .
The local environment is under pressure , more and larger ships are going there , tourists are perpetually looking for ' tougher , faster , more ' and there 's actually no - one to keep this all on the right tracks : the South Pole is managed by an international consortium of countries , but no - one is really in charge on the ground .
There is no policy setting out any limits for tourism .
The nearest to anyone holding the reins are the tour operators .
It is in their own interests not to have too many tourists coming at the same time : no - one goes to Antarctica to find six other shiploads of tourists there .
Self - regulation is working well enough just now among the tour operators , but Lamers feels that the situation could easily change .
The future is only likely to see even more people trying to get in on the action , and there 's a chance that not everyone will be prepared to make concessions .
Many scientists who have spent a long time at the Pole are already seeing the consequences of increased numbers of tourists .
Poorly prepared tour operators can end up getting a nasty surprise and , in the absence of breakdown services or the police , it 's often the scientists -- and better - prepared tour operators -- who have to come to the rescue of tourists in distress , with all the consequences this has on their own work .
Long - term planning
Lamers believes that clear steps must be taken soon .
The countries involved , including the Netherlands , must move rapidly to prepare a long - term plan .
Lamers outlines a number of detailed future scenarios that might support this .
For instance , what should happen if someone wants to build on a commercial basis in Antarctica ?
And who is responsible for stranded tourists ?
The research done by Lamers shows that it is time for clear rules ; vague agreements are not enough any more .
Why , for example , do the same rules apply to the Antarctic Peninsula as to the Ross Sea ?
And how many tourists can Antarctica actually cope with ?
The research by Machiel Lamers was funded by NWO and formed part of the Netherlands Polar Programme , an initiative to encourage outstanding scientific research in the polar regions .

Networking is stupid .
You'd think it'd be real darn easy to share stuff between PCs and Macs , but it 's not as nearly simple as it should be .
So , here 's how to make 'em talk and share stuff like best friends .
Advertisement
What You Need
• A Windows PC ( Linux dudes , you already know how to do this , right ? )
• A Mac
• A router to connect them
Advertisement
Before we get into sharing between computers directly , are you sure you do n't just want a NAS ?

Talk to Me , Girl
So , assuming that your PC and Mac are both sitting comfortably on your network , wirelessly or otherwise ( if you have n't gotten that far , you need more help than I 'll be providing right here ) , there are a couple of different ways for the various machines on your network to talk to each other and share files .
Think of 'em sorta like languages .
Advertisement
• SMB ( Server Message Block ) aka CIFS ( Common Internet File System ) is Windows ' preferred network file sharing protocol , and luckily , Macs speak it , so this how your computers will most likely be talking and sharing stuff .
Vista and Windows 7 use SMB 2.0 , which is mo ' faster for file transfers .
• FTP ( File Transfer Protocol ) is one you know and love , if you 've ever spent any time on the internet .
It 's one option for sharing stuff between your Mac and PC .
Advertisement
• NFS ( Network File System ) is the protocol Unix - based systems like to use for sharing files , which both Windows and Macs can understand .
A lot of NASes use it .
• AFP ( Apple Filing Protocol ) is like a secret language for Macs , ' cause Windows sure as crap do n't speak it .
But from Mac - to - Mac , it 's what makes sharing just work ( when it does ) .

Things That Will Help
My goal here is to show you how to share files between your PC and Mac easily , and for the most part , without worrying about things like IP addresses or diddling with your router 's settings .
But !
If you want to make troubleshooting easier — this kind of networking is more voodoo than science — there are a few things you could stand to know and do beforehand .
Advertisement
1. Know your router .
Or really , know how to get into it .
For most routers , punching the number soup 192.168.1.1 ( Linksys , for instance ) or 192.168.0.1 ( D - Link , for example ) into your web browser will take you to the router 's settings , where you can fiddle with things ( which you hopefully already did to protect your network ) .
2 . Make everything static .
If you take your computer on and off the network a lot , odds are , your router is n't going give it the same IP address every the computer jumps back on , because it hands those addresses out dynamically ( you might recognize this as DHCP in action , if you 're wondering what that acronym refers to ) .
For consistency 's sake , it 's not a bad idea to assign your computers static IP addresses on the network , so they 'll always have the same address — I at least give my desktop PC and Xbox static IP addresses — just in case something else is broken .
Advertisement
Look in the router settings for a reference to DHCP reservations or static DHCP , which is most likely under the general settings tab .
Hit that up , like so , and you should see a list of computers on your network , along with their MAC addresses ( an ID tied to the actual networking card in your computer ) and currently assigned IP address ( something like 192.168.1.102 ) .
If your computer 's already connected to the network and listed here , it 's real easy to give it an unwavering address on your network , a matter of a couple checkboxes .
Advertisement
If , for some reason , your computer 's not on the network and you wanna give it a static address , like 192.168.0.104 , you 're gonna need to know its MAC address .
On a Mac , just open the Network Utility app and select AirPort — it 's the " hardware address . "
In Windows Vista and 7 , go to Network & Sharing Center , and tap view status link next to your connection .
Hit " details " in the pop up box and note the " physical address . "
On XP , bring your network connections , double click the one you want , flip to the " support " tab , and hit details .
It 's the physical address .
Now that you have the MAC address for your computers , you can assign a set IP address to each one , that it 'll have every single time it's on the network , which is a handy list to have .
Getting Ready
Okay , let 's get our machines ready .
We 'll start with the Mac , ' cause it 's a little easier .

Mac
1. Setup a user account for sharing , either under Accounts or Sharing -> File Sharing in System Preferences .
( Unless you just wanna log in from Windows using your regular Mac login , then you can skip creating a sharing account . )
Click the little plus sign under users , and then you pull can a name out of your address book to use for the account , or setup a whole new one .

2 . Open system preferences , go to sharing if you have n't already , and check the box for file sharing .
Click options , and enable AFP ( if you 've got other Macs you wanna share with ) and SMB .
Crucially , make sure the account you 're gonna be logging in from Windows with has SMB enabled .
3 . To pick the folders you wanna share with other users , click the little plus sign and browse to the folder you wanna give access to .
Maybe it 's your pictures , maybe it 's your whole Home folder .
You 'll need to add each folder individually , especially if you wanna give different people access to different folders .
( If you 're logging in from Windows with your standard Mac account , you 'll have access to your whole hard drive anyway . )

After you 've picked the folder you wanna share , then you just pick the user you want to share with , and how much access you want them to have .
Read - only , write - only or read and write .

4 . Note your computer 's name on the local network .
It 's sitting on top of the main file sharing setting page .
And , if you 've got AFP turned off , you 'll get this dialog , noting the IP address Windows users can access your stuff .
Advertisement
5 . Go back to the main system preferences page , then click on Network .
Go to the main connection you 'll be using , like AirPort , and click advanced .
Go to WINS , and set your Workgroup to the same one as your Windows PCs ( probably either WORKGROUP , on newer Windows machines or MSHOME on XP ) .
Windows 7 and Windows Vista
In Windows 7 and Vista , the Network and Sharing Center is where we 'll be spending our time .
( Here 's Microsoft 's own guide , if you wanna check it out . )

1. First , make sure in your little path to the internet up top , you 've got a picture of a house sitting between your computer the internet globe at the top .
That means you 've got it set to private network , so stuff 's a little more exposed to other computers on the network .
If not , click customize to the right of the network name , and set it to private network .
Advertisement
2. In Vista , you 'll notice the big ol ' Sharing and Discovery section up front and center .
In Windows 7 , it 's under advanced sharing settings .
Go in there , and you 'll want to enable network discovery , and make note of your Workgroup ( so you can make sure your Mac is on the same one ) which is listed here .
Also , you have the option to turn off password - protected sharing , so that you do n't need an account on the machine set up for sharing .
Obviously , it 's less secure , but if you prefer convenience , that 's up to you .
3 . Now for some voodoo that 's not required , but it 'll make life easier and might be something you need to come back to if stuff is n't working , because OS X and Windows shake hands like goons ( really it 's about tweaking the LAN Manager Authentication Level , so OS X has an easier time connecting to Windows ) .
If you have Windows 7 or Vista Ultimate , go to the Control Panel , then Administration Tools , then local security policy .
Hit local policies , then security options , and look for Network Security LAN Manager Authentication Level .
There , you want to switch it to " send LM & NTLM , use NTLM v2 session if negotiated . "

If you 're in Windows 7 or Vista Home Premium , you do n't have access to that , so you 'll need to registry hack it up .
Open up regedit , and look for this :
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\LSA\
Double click on LmCompatibility Level , and set the value to 1 .
For more on this , just Google " vista mac NTVLM2 . "
( Sans period . )
4 . Now , we 'll need to set up an account to share with .
( Again , you can skip this if you 're just going to use your regular Windows login from your Mac , though you 'll need to have a password on the account for it to work best in Vista . )
Go to User Accounts in Control Panel , then to Manage Accounts .
Create a new account .
Advertisement
5 . If you 're going to be logging in with your main administrator account , you can skip this step , since you 'll have access to everything anyway .
For all other accounts , go to the folder you want to share , right - click on it and hit properties .
Click the sharing tab , hit " share , " and then you can add users to the share list , along with their permissions .
Windows will share it , and give you the network path where you can access it .
Alternatively , go to Computer , right - click , and check out the system properties and note your computer 's name on the network and its Workgroup ( make sure the Workgroup is the same as your other computers , it makes life easier ) .

Windows XP
XP 's interface feels pretty damn ancient when it comes to Networking .
Anyways , it 's mostly the same stuff , just with a slightly uglier interface .
I found this guide helpful when I was trying to remember where everything was .
1 . Like before , you 'll need a user account and password setup .
Go to control panel , user accounts and create a new one , if you need to .
Advertisement
2 . Make sure you 're on the same workgroup as everything else — XP
Home defaults to MSHOME , so if you need to change it , right - click on My Computer , hit properties , then go to Computer Name , and go to " Change " if you need to switch up the Workgroup .
3 . Go to the folder you wanna share , right - click , hit properties , and switch over to sharing .
Allow it to be shared over the network , and allow users to change files .

Sharing Stuff
Advertisement
Okay , if you 've done everything correctly , and the gods are pleased , what you should see on your Mac in your Finder Sidebar under the Shared tab is your Windows computer .
( Make sure Shared is enabled in your Finder sidebar preferences , or you wo n't see it . )
Then , you should be able to just click on it , enter your user account and password , and voila , you can get right at everything just like you hoped .
Advertisement
On your Windows 7 or Vista machine , you should be able to click Network , and see all of your connected computers , including your Macs .
To login , as Ross McKillop points out , your username is the name of the Mac followed by the OS X username , like this , minus the quotes and period : " MATTBOOK - PRO / matt . "
In XP , you 'll go to My Network Places or Workgroup , and it should be the same deal , though you can just stick to the actual Mac username and password .
Life 's good .
Update : BTW , if you have Apple 's Bonjour — Apple 's zero configuration networking dealio , which powers music sharing in iTunes — installed on your Windows machines ( it comes with iTunes ) , the discovery part of the guide above — the parts pertaining to locating the other machines on your network , should just work .
That is , your Windows machines should just show up in your Finder sidebar and your Mac in your PC's Networking page , though you still need the accounts setup properly to actually share stuff .
Advertisement
Sometimes , things do n't work like that .
PCs do n't show up in the Finder automagically , you can't login easily from your PC .
Network discovery just is n't always that reliable .
In that case we go all manual mode .
Remember earlier , when I had you note your computer 's name on the network and setup a static IP ?
That 's where this comes in handy .
So , know either your computers names , or their IP addresses on your network .
Advertisement
On a Mac , it 's pretty simple .
Go to Finder , tap command+k and punch in :
smb://computername or smb://192.168.X.XXX
The latter is the PC's IP address , which should be something like 192.168.0.105 — unless you have a weird setup — though the last two numbers of it will obviously vary .
The computer name is easier and usually better , especially if you do n't have a static IP address set up .
Advertisement
It 'll ask you what volume to mount ( what folder you want stuck on your Finder Sidebar under shared , essentially ) , and a login , and then you 're good to go .
If prefer the cmd+k approach , you can add computers you tap a lot as a favorite , so you do n't have to type it in every time .
Advertisement
It 's pretty simple in Windows too , actually .
Either in the Windows Explorer address bar , or the Run command type :
\\MACNAME \Folder or \\192.168.X.XXX\Folder
And it should give you the option to login there , giving you access to all of your stuff .
Using the full address of the folder you 're trying to get to will help with making sure the authentication pop-up appears — otherwise you might just see automatically what 's publicly shared and not the stuff you 're trying to log into .
Advertisement
Shortcuts
Logging in every single time would be a pain in the dick , but luckily you can make shortcuts to this stuff .
On a Mac , as Gina points out here , under Accounts , you can add a network share to login items , so it 'll connect every time you start up your computer .
In Windows , you can either create a shortcut by right - clicking on the share , or you can add your Mac 's shared folder as a mapped network drive , so it 'll connect to the folder every time you fire up your computer .

CENTENNIAL , Colo .
— A marijuana lawsuit going to court this week could answer the question of whether Colorado towns can ban pot shops .
A medical marijuana dispensary called CannaMart is suing the city of Centennial for shutting it down earlier this fall .
CannaMart says it wrongly lost its business license after the city learned it was selling medical marijuana .
Several towns have banned marijuana dispensaries , but the Centennial case may answer the question of whether cities can shutter pot shops after they open .
Lawyers for CannaMart say they have constitutional protection because medical marijuana is legal , but Centennial will argue it is free to close businesses that violate federal law .
Arguments in the lawsuit are scheduled for Friday .
Vitamin C could play an essential role in the manufacture of stem cells for treating human diseases , new research suggests .
The vitamin boosts the reprogramming of adult cells to give them the properties of embryonic stem cells .
Scientists who made the discovery believe it may help them overcome long - standing hurdles in the way of creating the reprogrammed cells , called induced pluripotent stem cells ( iPSCs ) .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
IPSCs offer a solution to the ethical problems involved in producing embryonic stem cells with the potential to become any kind of human tissue , from bone to brain .
Embryonic stem cells have to be extracted by cannibalising early stage embryos obtained from fertility clinics .
IPSCs , on the other hand , are made in the laboratory from ordinary adult cells by altering their genes .
Many experts believe iPSCs are the future of stem cell medicine , since they behave in a similar way to embryonic stem cells and are also capable of developing into a wide range of tissues .
The conversion of ordinary cells into iPSCs is highly inefficient and difficult to achieve .
Often the cells age prematurely and stop dividing or may die , a process known as senescence .
Adding vitamin C to the cell cultures was found to hold back senescence and make reprogramming much more efficient .
Experiments with both mouse and human cells showed that the vitamin accelerated genetic changes and boosted the transition to a reprogrammed state .
Dr Duanqing Pei , from the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Guangzhou , who led the research , said : " The low efficiency of the reprogramming process has hampered progress with this technology and is indicative of how little we understand it .

" Further , this process is most challenging in human cells , raising a significant barrier for producing iPSCs and serious concerns about the quality of the cells that are generated .
" Our results highlight a simple way to improve iPSC generation and provide additional insight into the mechanistic basis of reprogramming .
" It is also of interest that a vitamin with long - suspected anti-ageing effects has such a potent influence on reprogramming , which can be considered a reversal of the ageing process at the cellular level .
It is likely that our work may stimulate further research in this area as well . "
The research is published online in the journal Cell Stem Cell .
Vitamin C's powerful antioxidant properties may be the reason why it assists cell programming , the scientists believe .
The vitamin neutralises damaging molecules called reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) that are believed to hamper the generation of iPSCs .
But this cannot be the whole story , since other antioxidants do not appear to have the same effect .

Information on the Argo Ocean Monitoring Network
Comment On EPA Response To Reviewer Comments On Ocean Heat Content
Further Comments on The Inadequate EPA Response To Reviewer Comments On Ocean Heat Content
I am providing further information as to why the upper ocean heat content has been adequately sampled particularly since 2005 [ and thanks to Leonard Ornstein for encouraging me to do this ! ] .
The direct sampling of vertical profiles in the ocean is completed by the Argo network ;
The ocean data is less uncertain also because it does not have the larger spatial variations that the land part of the surface temperature .
It also does not have much larger diurnal range that occurs on land ; e.g. see the spatial distribution of the surface temperature portion of the upper ocean temperature anomalies for December 24 2009 ;
and for the land for November 2009 from the NOAA Terra satellite ( see ; this website also animates the anomalies for each month back to 2005 ) ;
The MODIS - TERRA sample , of course , is a snapshot of land at a particular time in the diurnal cycle , while the Argo network samples a climate component ( the ocean ) in which a large daily cycle of temperature does not occur .
In addition , the upper ocean data is mass weighted with heat content expressed in Joules , while the surface temperatures are not .
There is no lags or “ heat in the pipeline ” when Joules are used as the currency to diagnose the Earth ’s radiative imbalance ; e.g. see
Is There Climate Heating In “ The Pipeline ” ?
Further Comments Regarding The Concept “ Heating In The Pipeline ”
Thus the Argo network , along with other observational platforms including GRACE and satellite altimetry ; e.g. see provides a much more robust methodology to monitor global warming than the NCDC , GISS and CRU surface temperature data analyses .
At the French Laundry , we use an awful lot of butter without serving a lot of butter because of a method and substance called beurre monté — a way of infusing meats and fish with the flavor of butter .
We cook in it , rest meats in it , make sauces with it .
It 's an extraordinary vehicle for both heat and flavor .
Here 's what beurre monté is : a few drops of water and chunks of butter whisked over a moderate heat to melt the butter and keep it emulsified , in one piece and creamy .
Solid butter is an emulsification of butter fat , water , and milk solids ; beurre monté is a way to manipulate the emulsification into liquid form .
Thomas Keller : Salt and Seasoning Delicious , Quick Side Dishes
An interesting article has been posted by the UK ’s newspaper The Guardian hypothesizes that Microsoft could abandon their Mobile OS platform , Windows Mobile , all together and call it quits .
They cite that the 3.1 percent drop of their share of the Mobile OS Pie ( down from 11 to 7.9 % ) , the increasing support for Android from previous WM - heavy players ( HTC , Motorola ) , and the increasing competition that Android poises ( 0 to 3.9 % market share in 1 year ) .
I call shenanigans on this happening .
Here ’s why -
1 ) Windows Mobile 7
The OS that Microsoft should have released instead of WM 6.5 looks very promising and will come with enhanced touchscreen support .
The days of needing a stylus to click on some miniature icon will be gone , instead replaced by a Zune - influenced interface that looks to be equal to or even surpass the iPhone and Android .
Why spend hundreds of millions of dollars on creating a new mobile OS and then ditch it a year later ?
2 ) HTC and hardware partners
Yes , 7.9 % is but a small sliver of the overall market .
However , when that sliver includes millions of devices being sold , then it is a lot .
There are 14 OEM licensees of Windows Mobile compared to the second place Symbian operating system at 10 .
Why would HTC spend millions developing the Sense UI if they were not committed to the Windows Mobile platform for the conceivable future ?
3 ) 3 Screens and a Cloud
3 Screens ( PC , the television , and the mobile phone ) and a Cloud .
This is the basic strategy behind what Microsoft envisions as the future of computing .
The Mobile phone is one of the key tenets in their plan .
Ditching their own Mobile OS does not mesh well with this strategy .
The company plans to deliver a set of services that are common across devices , PCs and TVs .
One example is the Zune Video service that will work across Zune HD players , Xbox consoles , Windows PCs and Windows Phones .
If they are to follow their own self - envisioned plan for the future , why would Microsoft ditch their own Mobile OS ?¹

By the middle of this century , white Americans will no longer be in the majority .
Yet even as the country grows more diverse , nearly all - white enclaves are on the rise .
Richard Benjamin , a senior fellow at Demos , a think tank , spotted this trend several years ago and began venturing into these suburban and rural “ Whitopias ” to find out what makes them tick .
His resulting book , Searching for Whitopia : An Improbably Journey to the Heart of America , is a lively and perceptive foray into communities that are trying to bail out of the melting pot .
Benjamin , who is African American , profiles several Whitopias — defined as rapidly growing areas at least 90 percent white — from southern Utah to Manhattan ’s tony Carnegie Hill neighborhood .
He embeds in gated communities where garish homes are protected from nonexistent crime by elaborate security systems .
He plays a lot of golf and poker and becomes a regular at a Baptist megachurch in Georgia .
He also becomes the first black journalist to attend a three - day retreat for white separatists in northern Idaho ( where he ’s welcomed with brisket and strawberry lemonade ) .
“ I was surprised by what a pleasant time I had , ” he says .
But he ’s disturbed by how these bastions of whiteness are often animated by racist attitudes , particularly toward Latinos , and a divisive belief that we ca n’t all get along .
“ America has delightful people who are perfectly comfortable with widening segregation and yawning socioeconomic inequality that often breaks along racial lines , ” he writes .
“ Let ’s call that a problem . ”
Mother Jones :
What inspired you to go live in these white communities ?
Richard Benjamin : I had been hearing on - the - ground buzz that white folks were moving to places like Bend , Oregon , and Coeur d’Alene , Idaho , and St. George , Utah .
That led me to discover through census data that these towns were already extremely white and they were becoming , in most cases , even whiter .
Statistics could only tell me so much ; in order to get to the spirit and essence of it , I had to immerse myself .
MJ : What surprised you the most ?
RB : I was surprised by what a pleasant time I had .
I was surprised by how forces in the community could mobilize against a community changing .
There were many examples of this .
In St. George , members of the Latino community proposed having a “ Dixie Fiesta . ”
The resistance to that surprised me .
One Latina woman described receiving death threats on her voicemail .
I was surprised by the hostility to immigration in many of the communities , or the extent of the hostility to immigration in many of the communities .
MJ : At one point a white Idaho grandmother asks you , “ Do n’t you want to stick to your own kind ? ”
What did you say to her ?
RB : I said , “ Absolutely not . ” I do n’t want to live in a monoculture of any kind .
I do n’t want to live in a wealthy monoculture , a black monoculture .
I do n’t want to live in an elitist , progressive monoculture .
People would say , “ You know , Rich , it ’s nature .
Birds of a feather flock together . ”
I have to point out to them that , no , that ’s not the case .
The reason our country looks the way it does is through social engineering that distinctly benefits suburban communities , exurban communities , and often white residents .
And we are socially engineered in such a way as to , often unconsciously and unintentionally , but sometimes intentionally , perpetuate this divisive inequality .
MJ : How are Whitopias of the Deep South , where there ’s such a history of racial tension , different from the Whitopias in communities where residents feel like they ’re starting fresh , racially and culturally ?
RB : In the pioneer West Whitopias , immigration tended to be the dominant social and racial issue .
In Forsyth County , Georgia , immigration is still an issue , but because you have that complicated history of the Trail of Tears and slavery and Jim Crow , the Whitopia has a different flavor .
The interesting thing about Georgia is , Atlanta is teeming with middle - class black people and black people with money — and yet there is still segregation .
So you have a type of segregation that has nothing to do with class .
And , of course , there is n’t really a black population in Idaho or Utah .
MJ : Who ’s mowing the lawns , working retail , and nannying the kids in these Whitopias where they complain that immigrants take away jobs ?
RB : It depends .
In St. George or Coeur d’Alene , I would say that the intimate manual labor — i.e. house cleaning , child care , elderly care , and medical care — is done by working - class white folks .
The construction and agricultural labor and lawn service labor is done generally by Latino immigrants who do not live in the county .
So the county is extremely white , but you will see some Latinos doing the labor I just described .
MJ : So when people tell you , “ I want to live among my own kind , ” they really are talking exclusively about race ?
RB : Not always .
Sometimes they do mean class .
The wealthier whites may not realize that the working - class whites live there .
I do believe that “ my own kind ” really has a strong class dimension and not just a racial dimension in some cases .
MJ : You talk about the transition of acceptable racism from blacks to brown - skinned people .
Could you have written this book if you were Latino ?
RB : If I were an immigrant Latino not born in the US , I could not have written this book .
And that is because many of the Whitopians would not have been comfortable talking about their views on immigration , talking about their views on taxes .
And they would n’t have spilled to me the new script on race and poverty as they did .
MJ : Do you still think people were totally honest with you ?
Would they talk about immigration but not about black - white relations ?
RB : I do n’t believe so , because there were such shocking things said about black people .
It did n’t feel like anyone was holding anything back .
For example , one person said , “ I just do n’t know what to call you people this year , so when I ’m in all - white company I just use the N - word . ”
Another person frankly shared with me his opinions on Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton .
Another person told me how they did n’t want public transportation because that just brings in “ low - income blacks and crime ” to Forsyth County , which is an hour north of Atlanta .
So I got some pretty frank discussions of black - white race relations , although my focus and their focus tended to be on immigration and on brown - white .
MJ : Do you think the Whitopians would ask you to play golf and become part of their community if you were really moving there ?
RB : There were several things to my hospitable treatment .
One thing was genuine — there was a genuine warmth .
Another thing was class .
In other words , I ’m perceived to be a certain class .
I would forget that I had my golf cleats on and I would go on a home search or I ’d go to a dinner party , and that would be an opening to a conversation .
But another thing that really speaks to the spirit of your question is the question of volume .
One black man is fine and will be treated very well , but what if I brought 50 of my black friends from New York City ?
We have the answer to this question :
When well - qualified , upper middle - class blacks or Latinos or Asians move to predominantly white neighborhoods , there ’s what ’s called the tipping point .
That tipping point is generally 15 percent ; at 15 percent you begin to see white flight .
MJ : You say the majority of Whitopians are quite nice , but there is still harm in how they choose to live .
RB : Absolutely .
There is tremendous long - term harm when Americans accept ethnic and class balkanization as a de facto fixture of American life .
I think that impoverishes our understanding of each other .
I concede that segregation can allay social tensions immediately , but it further debilitates us in the long run .
By 2042 , whites will no longer be the American majority .
Therefore , with growing and intermixed minority populations , our democracy can not work optimally unless all people are integrated as full and equal members , and I think our collective freedom requires that .
Another problem with segregation is n’t that people can’t live in peaceful harmony singing “ Kumbaya ” — although that would n’t be bad .
The problem is that many of these Whitopian communities are taking state , local , and federal resources with them .
MJ : Are we on our way to seeing more Whitopias ?
RB : It remains to be seen what will happen with the economic recovery and the housing market .
We ’ll have to see how this plays out in the next three years .
I do see pockets of Whitopia that are not affected by the downturn .
For example , Louisville , Colorado , which was just voted by CNN and Money magazine as the best place to live , is a veritable Whitopia that is unaffected by the housing crisis and even the severe recession .
You look at the best places to live , according to Money ‘s 2009 list , and 9 of the 10 are Whitopias .
MJ : Is there a future scenario where there will actually be Blacktopias and Browntopias , too ?
RB : Oh goodness , I hope not .
I hope we have American - topias .
In an interview with The Hill , Conyers said his opinions of Obama ’s policies on healthcare reform and the war in Afghanistan have not sat well with the president .
ADVERTISEMENT
According to the lawmaker , the president picked up the phone several weeks ago to find out why Conyers was “ demeaning ” him .
Obama ’s decision to challenge Conyers highlights a sensitivity to criticism the president has taken on the left .
Conyers ’s critical remarks , many of which have been reported on the liberal - leaning Huffington Post , appear to have irritated the president , known for his calm demeanor .
Conyers , the second - longest - serving member of the House , said , “ [ Obama ] called me and told me that he heard that I was demeaning him and I had to explain to him that it was n’t anything personal , it was an honest difference on the issues .
And he said , ‘ Well , let ’s talk about it . ’ ”
Sitting in the Judiciary Committee ’s conference room two days after Obama delivered his speech on Afghanistan , the 23 - term lawmaker said he was n’t in the mood to “ chat . ”
Obama ’s move to send in 30,000 troops to Afghanistan by the summer of 2010 has clearly disappointed Conyers .
He said he intends to press his case in writing soon .
“ I want something so serious that he has to respond in writing , like I am responding in writing to him , ” he said .
“ Calling in generals and admirals to discuss troop strength is like me taking my youngest to McDonald ’s to ask if he likes french fries , ” Conyers said .
Many on the left have argued that military leaders routinely respond to crises by calling for more troops .
“ I ’ve been saying I do n’t agree with him on Afghanistan , I think he screwed up on healthcare reform , on Guantánamo and kicking Greg off , ” Conyers said , referring to the departure of former White House counsel Greg Craig .
Craig was a leading proponent in the White House of closing the terrorist detention center at Guantánamo Bay and releasing photos of detainees undergoing torture .
Closing the military prison has proven to be politically difficult , and Obama reversed field on the photos , opting not to make them publicly available .
The White House did not respond to requests for comment for this article .
The liberal Conyers has been an outspoken proponent of a single - payer healthcare system and a critic of U.S. involvement in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq .
He has also been at odds with White House policy on extending expiring provisions of the Patriot Act , crafting legislation that is to the left of the Senate ’s version .
Obama and Conyers have a complicated and nuanced relationship .
Conyers was the first member of the Congressional Black Caucus to endorse Obama over then - Sen .
Hillary Clinton Hillary Diane Rodham ClintonHillary Clinton after debate : ' Everyone better vote ' Hillary Clinton : ' Black Lives Matter ' is 'very profoundly a theological statement '
House in near - unanimous vote affirms peaceful transfer of power MORE ( D - N.Y. ) for the 2008 Democratic nomination for president .
Conyers earlier this year noted that he spent most weekends in 2007 and 2008 on the campaign trail trying to get Obama elected .
“ I did whatever was necessary to be done to win .
I met with ministers , I met with unions , I met with lawyers , I met with community activists , I met with healthcare people , ” Conyers explained in early April .
The 80 - year - old lawmaker , who participated in the civil rights movement alongside Martin Luther King Jr. , does not shy away from saying what is on his mind .
ADVERTISEMENT
In mid-November , Conyers said on the Bill Press radio show that Obama and White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel have been “ bowing down ” to “ nutty right - wing ” healthcare proposals in a desperate effort to get legislation passed .
The Michigan Democrat , a friend of liberal filmmaker Michael Moore , said he was “ getting tired of saving Obama ’s can in the White House , ” after progressive Democrats were forced to vote for a healthcare bill that did not call for a “ robust public option ” and includes language opposed by abortion - rights supporters .
Since the House narrowly passed its healthcare bill , Conyers has grown increasingly frustrated with what he sees as the White House ’s willingness to weaken the role of the government in administering the proposed new benefits .
Conyers also said last month that Obama was “ getting bad advice from … clowns ” on Afghanistan , according to a report in the Detroit Free Press .
At times , Conyers has shown his pragmatic side .
For example , he has abandoned hope of moving his legislation calling for a commission to review whether the U.S. government should pay reparations to descendants of slaves .
He has called his measure too controversial .
On the morning following Obama ’s landmark speech on the war in Afghanistan , Conyers sent around a “ Dear Colleague ” letter to Democratic and GOP lawmakers interested in joining his newly formed “ Peace and Progress in Afghanistan Caucus . ”
In the letter , Conyers explained that the caucus “ will serve as an informal bipartisan group of members dedicated to reorienting the United States ’ commitment to the Afghan government and people by emphasizing indigenous reconciliation and reconstruction strategies , rigorous regional diplomacy , and swift redeployment of the U.S. military . ”

Success is sometimes your own worst enemy .
Just ask the management and stockholders at Crocs .
A hot brand ends up in one of two different ways .
It burns bright too fast and fizzles .
Brands like this are known as fads .
Or a brand burns hot then continues at a steady simmer .
Brands like this are known as iconic .
Believe it or not , whether your brand will become a fad or an icon depends on your strategy more than you think .
The good news is the fate of your brand is very much in your control .
The bad news is it may be too late for Crocs .
While it ’s true that no strategy could have turned the “ Pet Rock ” into an icon , many brands could have been saved from the fate of faddom .
Brands like Crocs and Cabbage Patch could have been saved by better strategic decisions .
Let ’s start with the story of how Crocs took off .
Then we can cover how Crocs crashed and burned .
The Rise of Crocs
In the Western Rockies of Boulder , Colorado , in 2002 three longtime friends and created a lightweight antimicrobial foam they called Croslite using a technology created by a Canadian laboratory in 1999 .
They molded it into a boating and water - sports shoe they named “ Beach . ”
Thank goodness , they abandoned the Beach name and the shoes became known as Crocs .
The shoes quickly caught on and developed a loyal and vociferous following .
By 2005 , revenues were $ 108.6 million , net income was $ 16.7 million for a net profit margin of 15.4 percent .
By 2006 , revenues jumped to $ 354.7 million , net income was $ 64.4 million for a net profit margin of 18.2 percent .
That same year , the company riding a wave of success sold shares to the public raising more than $ 200 million making it the biggest stock offering in shoe history .
The company used the money to ramp up manufacturing , diversify the line and acquire new businesses .
Things were looking fantastic , or so management thought .
In 2007 , Crocs hit a high - water mark of $ 847.3 million in sales with a net profit margin of an astounding 19.9 percent .
In 2008 , the wave came crashing down .
Sales dropped slightly to $ 721.6 million , but the company lost $ 185.1 million .
Crocs had to slash 2,000 jobs and its stock price has plummeted 76 percent .
Today Crocs has millions of dollars of debt and a huge surplus of shoes .
What caused the collapse of Crocs ?
Many articles have blamed the economic slowdown .
But could the recession really be the reason for the fall of $ 30 Crocs ?
I think there is a far more likely answer .
When a brand is hot , it is hard to predict anything but a bright future ahead .
It seems anything and everything you do is a good move .
But nothing could be further from the truth .
A hot brand must be managed very carefully .
Here are the keys to keeping a hot brand “ hot . ”
1. Dampen Demand .
Suddenly everybody wants to wear Crocs , buy a Cabbage Patch doll or stay warm with a Snuggie .
There are lines of prospective customers and mass hysteria .
Every company 's dream right ?
But what to do next ?
The worst thing to do is over - produce .
If you flood the market with your product , it can lose its appeal .
Some people will buy it who do n’t really want it .
While you may rack up some amazing short - term sales , long term you will undermine your brand ’s specialness and exclusiveness .
Crocs did just that .
The company rapidly ramped up production in 2006 which led sales doubling in 2007 but also created a fad not an icon .
Instead of patiently fanning the flames , Crocs added fuel to the fire .
Overnight everybody was wearing them and then nobody wanted to be wearing them .
2. Resist Line Extension .
Crocs did n’t just flood the market with a wide variety of its classic Crocs in a rainbow of colors , it quickly added many other styles .
Flip - flops , sandals and an assortment of other types of Crocs were developed .
Especially troublesome was the fact that many of the expanded styles were meant to be attractive .
The idea of Crocs is not to look beautiful but to be functional .
If people want fashion , there are many other brands to look at .
In addition , Crocs spent millions buying up other companies in order to line - extend .
They bought Jibbitz which makes the do - dads used to decorate Crocs for $ 10 million .
Buying Jibbitz was probably a smart purchase especially they kept the unique brand name .
But Crocs made other horrible purchases like buying EXO Italia which made vinyl shoes like Teva and Fury Hockey which made sports - protection items like sticks , gloves , pants and elbow pads .
There was even talk of launching Crocs clothing .
Not surprisingly the expansion efforts fell flat .
The Fury business was liquidated last year .
The expanded line turned Crocs into just another brand .
At first , Crocs had an enormous advantage because it owned an idea and an image in the mind .
The multitude of styles undermined that image and destroyed the power of the brand .
3. Control Distribution .
Crocs went from being available in just a few retail outlets to being available in every imaginable retail outlet .
While that fueled sales , it also hurt the brand ’s power with the distribution .
Retailers no longer saw it special being able to stock Crocs .
We normally recommend that new brands start with exclusive distribution deals .
That way the retailer has an incentive to promote the brand .
4. Focus on Core Consumers .
Crocs went from a sports enthusiast shoe to a shoe for everyone .
A brand that tries to appeal to everyone ends up appealing to nobody .
Croc loyalists saw Crocs on everyone and said Geez , they do n’t make me stand out and look different anymore .
The key to making a brand an icon is having a base of loyal consumers .
Instead of chasing everyone , Crocs should have resisted that temptation and stayed focused .
This is the key to keep a brand becoming a fad .
What are the core consumers for Crocs ?
Kids , athletes , workers .
Forget the soccer moms / dads , grandmas / grandpas , fashionistas and everybody else .
Kids in particular were a big part of Crocs ’ success .
Kids are also great customers because they have feet that grow .
Sure , Crocs may be indestructible , but when your feet keep growing you need a new pair every six months anyway .
Kids also love the Jibbitz which allowed each pair to be personalized .
Athletes are the customers Crocs started with .
Athletes gave Crocs a natural distribution strategy of sporting - goods stores like Sports Authority .
The shoe is not just trendy but functional .
The anti-Sex in the City shoes .
Workers on their feet .
Nurses , doctors , chefs and workers of all sorts are the perfect target consumer for Crocs and could have been a long - term steady market .
5. Expand Globally .
Crocs did understand the power of going global .
But you should not try to go global all at once .
Crocs used its stock - market cash to build manufacturing plants in Mexico and China as well as distribution centers in the Netherlands and Japan .
That was way too much , too soon .
Going global is important , but should be done carefully , strategically and slowly .
Instead , Crocs flooded the global market with its shoes .
Too bad .
Crocs is a great brand with a great name built around a great idea .
The missing ingredient was great marketing .
Erin Andrews of ESPN will appear on Oprah on September 11th according to Richard Deitsch at Sports Illustrated .
In a Tweet just moments ago , he stated :
Just learned that ESPN ’s Erin Andrews will appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show on Sept. 11 .
Show was taped last week .
Erin will no doubt be discussing her ordeal related to the peephole video which was released on the internet , and the subsequent pressure she has been under from the media .
She recently appeared in GQ magazine , in a photo shoot which took place before the peephole video scandal broke , however after that video first appeared online .
In Deitsch ’s follow - up article , he states :
The segment was taped last week and will be the only in - depth interview Andrews gives on the subject .
Deadspin had previously predicted that this would happen , stating on August 6th that :
Oprah .
Larry King .
Diane Sawyer .
Katie Couric .
According to one snitch / source , these are some of the heavy - hitters jockeying for the exclusive EA post - peephole heart - to - heart sit - down .
and then the follow - up comments from her lawyer :
“ Erin Andrews has not committed to any on - air interviews .
She has received and declined all invitations to do so .
She is not in negotiations with any media to do so . mg ”
I guess Oprah had to bid higher .
So we created the image below as a start to a Photoshop contest , but then the AP went and released a photo of the actual appearance , thus making the contest even more silly than it originally was :
** UPDATE ** The Chicago Tribune has additional information and quotes :
Home testing kits can check for high cholesterol , but not Lp( a ) specifically Scientists say they have found proof that another " bad " type of cholesterol contributes to heart disease .
Unlike the well - known LDL cholesterol , lipoprotein ( a ) or Lp( a ) cannot be controlled by cutting down on dietary fats or taking a statin drug .
But researchers say high levels do not carry the same risk as LDL .
And other drugs might work to minimise its effects , they told the New England Journal of Medicine .
LDL is considered the aggressive tiger of the cholesterol world , furring the arteries and greatly increasing heart risk .
Scientist believe Lp( a ) , which is inherited , is more of a pussycat , although it does appear to upset blood clotting .
Inherent risk
The researchers used gene - chip technology to scan DNA that they knew from previous studies were potential " hotspots " for heart disease risk .
This analysis revealed the two genetic culprits .
Professor Martin Farrall , lead author of the study carried out at Oxford University , said one in six people carries one or more of the genes for Lp( a ) .
The hope now is that by targeting both we could get even better risk reduction
Lead researcher Professor Martin Farrall
He said : " The increase in risk to people from high Lp( a ) levels is significantly less severe than the risk from high LDL cholesterol levels .
" So Lp( a ) does n't trump LDL , which has a larger impact and which we can already control pretty effectively .
" The hope now is that by targeting both we could get even better risk reduction . "
Some existing drugs , such as Niacin , and others coming on to the market , such as CETP - inhibitors , lower Lp( a ) as well as LDL cholesterol .
Professor Peter Weissberg of the British Heart Foundation , which funded the study , said the findings were useful but urged people not to be alarmed by them .
" They highlight the importance of trying to lower Lp( a ) , which will spark new efforts to design a medicine to achieve this effectively .
" And they reveal clues that open a new avenue for research to decipher how heart disease develops .
" But LDL is still the type of cholesterol to be more concerned about . "
Fats from food are turned into cholesterol by the liver .
There are different types but some , such as LDL , are known as " bad " cholesterol .
They can lead to a build - up in the body 's cells .
Prof Weissberg said everyone could reduce their risk of heart disease by eating a healthy balanced diet , being physically active and avoiding smoking .

I 'm not going to make a best of the 00's list mostly because everyone has the same shows , and I think they all belong .
A general rundown of what everyone has : The Wire , The Sopranos , Mad Men , The Shield , West Wing , Lost , Battlestar Galactica , Friday Night Lights , and a random spattering of comedies .
Other than Lost and Battlestar Galactica , there is a lack of sci - fi shows which is understandable .
The award shows and critics regularly pass over the genre entirely , but I love the genre , so here 's a list of sci - fi shows of the decade that I liked that made few or no lists .
I know Firefly made it onto several lists , but for the most part , the show gets much more credit from the fans than the critics .
Seamlessly blending humor , science fiction , and Westerns , Joss Whedon came up with another hit that viewers did n't care about .
I know there are lots of excuses made the the show and Whedon shows in general , but in the end , there is one valid excuse .
Joss Whedon belongs on cable .
The potential for FIrefly was endless and the 14 episodes only scraped the surface of what it could have been .
But even still , the 14 episodes by themselves represent an untouchable level of science fiction .
The casting , settings , and writing is as close to perfect as I can imagine .
The last two seasons and most of the third were difficult to watch , but the first two seasons are my favorite two consecutive seasons of television ever .
Whenever someone praises Fringe and its relationships , I always think back to Alias .
There is no competition .
Sydney , Jack , Dixon , Vaughn , Marshall , etc made the show and the acting was fantastic .
Jennifer Garner may never been a hit on the big screen , but she is the greatest television ass - kicker of all time .
The WB / CW may have low budgets , but that does n't mean they can't make an occasional gem .
The show evolved from two brothers chasing down the creepy crawlies and branched out into an epic struggle of heavenly proportions .
The relationship between the Winchesters rivals the best of cable , but the award shows continue to ignore it .
Underrated by the critics and overrated by the fans , Farscape took big leaps and never turned back , giving those still watching an exhilarating ride .
The writers were never afraid to take risks and significantly shake things up .
Sometimes it did n't work , but I have to commend them for bold choices few shows take .
The range of the series was incredible , and I 'm not sure there are any series out there that matches it .
What show could have a Farscape version of Looney Tunes ( Revenging Angel ) and in the very next episode have a gut wrenching episode focusing on Aeryn ( The Choice ) ?
Unlike Buffy and The X - Files which aired bad episodes in the 2000s that make me consider them solely shows of the 90s , I consider SG - 1 as much a show of the 00s as the 90s .
The writers never made the characters too complex ( which is why I think SGU does n't work ) , but Stargate was always a fun show .
The dialogue and humor worked well , and the action speaks for itself .

The Ten Worst Countries for Women Most Women Still Oppressed
The image of the 21st century woman is confident , prosperous , glowing with health and beauty .
But for many of the 3.3 billion female occupants of our planet , the perks of the cyber age never arrived .
As International Women 's Day is celebrated today , they continue to feel the age - old lash of violence , repression , isolation , enforced ignorance and discrimination .
" These things are universal , " says Taina Bien - Aime , executive director of New York - based Equality Now .
" There is not one single country where women can feel absolutely safe . "
In spite of real progress in women 's rights around the globe – better laws , political participation , education and income – the bedrock problems that have dogged women for centuries remain .
Even in wealthy countries , there are pockets of private pain where women are unprotected and under attack .
Some countries , often the poorest and most conflict - ridden , have a level of violence that makes life unbearable for women .
Richer ones may burden them with repressive laws , or sweep the problems of the least advantaged under the carpet .
In any country , refugee women are among the most vulnerable .
So widespread are the disadvantages that it's hard to pinpoint the worst places in the world for women .
Some surveys rate their problems by quality of life , others by health indicators .
Human rights groups point to countries where violations are so severe that even murder is routine .
Literacy is one of the best indicators of women 's status in their countries .
But Amnesty International Canada 's women 's rights campaigner Cheryl Hotchkiss says building schools alone does n't solve the problem of equal education .
" There 's a huge range of barriers women face to getting an education , " she says .
" It may be free and available , but parents wo n't send their daughters out to school if they can be kidnapped and raped . "
Health is another key indicator , including the care of pregnant women , who are sometimes forced into disastrous early marriage and childbearing , as well as infection with HIV / AIDS .
But again , statistics fail to show the whole , complex story .
" On a rural lake in Zambia , I met a woman who had not told her husband she was HIV - positive , " says David Morley , CEO of Save the Children Canada .
" She was already living on the edge because she had no children .
If she told him , she would be kicked off the island and sent alone to the mainland .
She felt she had no choice , because she had no power at all . "
Putting power in women 's hands is the biggest challenge for improving their lives in every country , advocates agree .
Whether in the poorest countries of Africa , or the most repressive of the Middle East or Asia , lack of control over their own destinies blights women 's lives from early childhood .
The Ten Worst Countries for Women Today Afghanistan :
The average Afghan girl will live to only 45 – one year less than an Afghan male .
After three decades of war and religion - based repression , an overwhelming number of women are illiterate .
More than half of all brides are under 16 , and one woman dies in childbirth every half hour .
Domestic violence is so common that 87 per cent of women admit to experiencing it .
But more than one million widows are on the streets , often forced into prostitution .
Afghanistan is the only country in which the female suicide rate is higher than that of males .
Democratic Republic of Congo :
In the eastern DRC , a war that claimed more than 3 million lives has ignited again , with women on the front line .
Rapes are so brutal and systematic that UN investigators have called them unprecedented .
Many victims die ; others are infected with HIV and left to look after children alone .
Foraging for food and water exposes women to yet more violence .
Without money , transport or connections , they have no way of escape .
Iraq : The U.S. - led invasion to " liberate " Iraq from Saddam Hussein has imprisoned women in an inferno of sectarian violence that targets women and girls .
The literacy rate , once the highest in the Arab world , is now among the lowest as families fear risking kidnapping and rape by sending girls to school .
Women who once went out to work stay home .
Meanwhile , more than 1 million women have been displaced from their homes , and millions more are unable to earn enough to eat .
Nepal : Early marriage and childbirth exhaust the country 's malnourished women , and one in 24 will die in pregnancy or childbirth .
Daughters who are n't married off may be sold to traffickers before they reach their teens .
Widows face extreme abuse and discrimination if they 're labelled bokshi , meaning witches .
A low - level civil war between government and Maoist rebels has forced rural women into guerrilla groups .
Sudan : While Sudanese women have made strides under reformed laws , the plight of those in Darfur , in western Sudan , has worsened .
Abduction , rape or forced displacement have destroyed more than 1 million women 's lives since 2003 .
The janjaweed militias have used systematic rape as a demographic weapon , but access to justice is almost impossible for the female victims of violence .
Guatemala :
The impoverished female underclass of Guatemala faces domestic violence , rape and the second - highest rate of HIV / AIDS after sub-Saharan Africa .
An epidemic of gruesome unsolved murders has left hundreds of women dead , some of their bodies left with hate messages .
Mali :
One of the world 's poorest countries , few women escape the torture of genital mutilation , many are forced into early marriages , and one in 10 dies in pregnancy or childbirth .
Pakistan :
In the tribal border areas of Pakistan women are gang - raped as punishment for men's crimes .
But honour killing is more widespread , and a renewed wave of religious extremism is targeting female politicians , human rights workers and lawyers .
Saudi Arabia : Women in Saudi Arabia are treated as lifelong dependents , under the guardianship of a male relative .
Deprived of the right to drive a car or mix with men publicly , they are confined to strictly segregated lives on pain of severe punishment .
Somalia :
In the Somali capital , Mogadishu , a vicious civil war has put women , who were the traditional mainstay of the family , under attack .
In a society that has broken down , women are exposed daily to rape , dangerously poor health care for pregnancy , and attack by armed gangs .
" While the potential of women is recognized at the international level , " says World Health Organization director - general Margaret Chan , " this potential will not be realized until conditions improve – often dramatically – in countries and communities .
Too many complex factors , often rooted in social and cultural norms , continue to hinder the ability of women and girls to achieve their potential and benefit from social advances . "
BEST COUNTRIES TO BE A WOMAN Measures of well - being include life expectancy , education , purchasing power and standard of living .
Not surprisingly , the top 10 countries are among the world 's wealthiest .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The U.S. Supreme Court said on Monday that it rejected an appeal by four former Guantanamo Bay prisoners arguing that they should be able to proceed with their lawsuit against top Pentagon officials for torture and religious abuse .
Ruhal Ahmed and Shafiq Rasul ( R ) , British citizens who were detained at the U.S. Guantanamo naval base as terror suspects , answer questions at a news conference to promote the film " The Road to Guantanamo " in Tokyo January 11 , 2007 .
REUTERS / Kim Kyung - Hoon
The justices refused to review a U.S. appeals court ruling that dismissed the lawsuit by the four British citizens over their treatment at the U.S. military base at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba on the grounds the officials enjoyed immunity .
The four men -- Shafiq Rasul , Asif Iqbal , Rhuhel Ahmed and Jamal al - Harith -- were captured in late 2001 in Afghanistan and were transferred to Guantanamo in early 2002 .
Released in March of 2004 , they were returned to Britain .
Their lawsuit named then - Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and 10 military commanders .
They claimed they were subjected to various forms of torture , harassed as they practiced their religion and forced to shave their religious beards .
In one instance , a guard threw a Koran in a toilet bucket , according to the lawsuit .
They claimed violations of a U.S. religious rights law and the U.S. Constitution .
A year ago , the Supreme Court sent the case back to the appeals court for further consideration in view of the high court ’s landmark ruling that Guantanamo prisoners have legal rights .
But the appeals court for a second time dismissed the lawsuit , ruling that the detainees had no legal basis for their claims at the time they were at Guantanamo , that Pentagon officials were entitled to immunity and that the religious right law did not apply to the prisoners .
Attorneys for the detainees appealed to the Supreme Court .
“ This case presents a unique and compelling opportunity for this court to affirm that torture at Guantanamo was a violation of fundamental rights , ” they said in the appeal .
“ Left in place , the court of appeals ’ decision will be a final assertion of judicial indifference in the face of calculated torture and humiliation of Muslims in their religion .
The decision cannot stand , ” they said .
The Obama administration urged the Supreme Court to reject the appeal .
It said the appeals court ’s decision was correct and that further review of the case was unwarranted .
Solicitor General Elena Kagan of the Justice Department said the questions involved in the case were “ narrow and fact - specific ” and that they do not conflict with any holdings by the Supreme Court or any appeals court .
The Supreme Court sided with the government in an order issued on Monday without any comment .
The decision to turn down the appeal was made at a closed conference on Friday .
My top choice for this year is the same as my top choice from last year .
While not as dramatic as last year 's action when oil prices ran from $ 100 to $ 147 and then collapsed back to $ 30 , oil prices still more than doubled from where they began 2009 .
That happened without the benefit of an economic recovery , so I continue to wonder how long it will take to come out of recession when oil prices are at recession - inducing levels .
Further , coming out of recession will spur demand , which will keep upward pressure on oil prices .
That 's why I say we may be in The Long Recession .
Here are my choices for the Top 10 energy related stories of 2009 .
Previously I listed how I voted in Platt 's Top 10 poll , but my list is a bit different from theirs .
I have a couple of stories here that they did n't list , and I combined some topics .
And do n't get too hung up on the relative rankings .
You can make arguments that some stories should be higher than others , but I gave less consideration of whether 6 should be ahead of 7 ( for example ) than just making sure the important stories were listed .
2 . The year of natural gas
This could have easily been my top story , because there were so many natural gas - related stories this year .
There were stories of shale gas in such abundance that it would make peak oil irrelevant , stories of shale gas skeptics , and stories of big companies making major investments into converting their fleets to natural gas .
Whether the abundance ultimately pans out , the appearance of abundance is certainly helping to keep a lid on natural gas prices .
By failing to keep up with rising oil prices , an unprecedented oil price / natural gas price ratio developed .
If you look at prices on the NYMEX in the years ahead , the markets are anticipating that this ratio will continue to be high .
And as I write this , you can pick up a natural gas contract in 2019 for under $ 5 / MMBtu .
3. U.S. demand for oil continues to decline
As crude oil prices skyrocketed in 2008 , demand for crude oil and petroleum products fell from 20.7 million barrels per day in 2007 to 19.5 million bpd in 2008 ( Source : EIA ) .
Through September 2009 , year - to - date demand is averaging 18.6 million bpd - the lowest level since 1997 .
Globally , demand was on a downward trend as well , but at a less dramatic pace partially due to demand growth in both China and India .
4. Shifting fortunes for refiners
The Jamnagar Refinery Complex in India became the biggest in the world , China brought several new refineries online , and several U.S. refiners shut down facilities .
This is a trend that I expect to continue as refining moves closer to the source of the crude oil and to cheap labor .
This does not bode well for a U.S. refining industry with a capacity to refine 17.7 million barrels per day when total North American production is only 10.5 million bpd ( crude plus condensate ) .
5. China
China was everywhere in 2009 .
They were making deals to develop oil fields in Iraq , signing contracts with Hugo Chavez , and they got into a bidding war with ExxonMobil in Ghana .
My own opinion is that China will be the single - biggest driver of oil prices over at least the next 5 - 10 years .
6. U.S. oil companies losing access to reserves
As China increases their global presence in the oil markets , one casualty has been U.S. access to reserves .
Shut out of Iraq during the recent oil field auctions there , U.S. oil companies continue to lose ground against the major national oil companies .
But no worries .
Many of my friends e-mailed to tell me that the Bakken has enough crude to fuel the U.S. for the next 41 years ...
7. EU slaps tariffs on U.S. biodiesel
With the aid of generous government subsidies , U.S. biodiesel producers had been able to put their product into the EU for cheaper than local producers could make it .
In a big blow to U.S. biodiesel producers , the EU put the brakes on this practice by imposing five - year tariffs on U.S. biodiesel .
8. Big Oil buys Big Ethanol
I find it amusing when people suggest that the ethanol industry is a threat to the oil industry .
I do n't think those people appreciate the difference in the scale of the two industries .
As I have argued many times before , the oil industry could easily buy up all of the assets of ethanol producers if they thought the business outlook for ethanol was good .
It would make sense that the first to take an interest would be the pure refiners , because they are the ones with the most to lose from ethanol mandates .
They already have to buy their feedstock ( oil ) , so if they make ethanol they just buy a different feedstock , corn , and they get to sell a mandated product .
In February , Valero became the first major refiner to buy up assets of an ethanol company ; bankrupt ethanol producer Verasun .
Following the Valero purchase , Sunoco picked up the assets of another bankrupt ethanol company .
If ExxonMobil ever decides to get involved , they could buy out the entire industry .
9 . The climate wars heat up
There were several big climate - related stories in the news this year , so I decided to lump them all into a single category .
First was the EPA decision to declare CO2 a pollutant that endangers public health , opening the door for regulation of CO2 for the first time in the U.S .
Then came Climategate , which gave the skeptics even more reason to be skeptical .
A number of people have suggested to me that this story will just fade away , but I do n't think so .
This is one that the skeptics can rally around for years to come .
The number of Americans who believe that humans are causing climate change was already on the decline , and the injection of Climategate into the issue will make it that much harder to get any meaningful legislation passed .
Closing out the year was the United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen .
All I can say is that I expected a circus , and we got a circus .
It just goes to show the difficulty of getting countries to agree on issues when the stakes are high and the issues complex .
Just wait until they try to get together to figure out a plan for peak oil mitigation .
10 . Exxon buys XTO for $ 41 billion
In a move that signaled ExxonMobil 's expectation that the future for shale gas is promising , XOM shelled out $ 41 billion for shale gas specialist XTO .
The deal means XOM is picking up XTO 's proved reserves for around $ 3 per thousand cubic feet , which is less than half of what ConocoPhillips paid for the reserves of Burlington Resources in 2005 .
Honorable Mention
There were a number of stories that I considered putting in my Top 10 , and some of these stories will likely end up on other Top 10 lists .
A few of the stories that almost made the final cut :
The IEA puts a date on peak oil production
The statement they made was that barring any major new discoveries " the output of conventional oil will peak in 2020 if oil demand grows on a business - as - usual basis . "
AltaRock Energy Shuts Down
Turns out that deep geothermal , which the Obama administration had hoped " could be quickly tapped as a clean and almost limitless energy source " - triggers earthquakes .
Who knew ?
I thought these were interesting comments from the story : “ Some of these startup companies got out in front and convinced some venture capitalists that they were very close to commercial deployment ” and “ What we ’ve discovered is that it ’s harder to make those improvements than some people believed . "
I am still waiting to see a bonafide success story from some of these VCs .
The biggest energy bill in history was passed
In total , $ 80 billion in the stimulus bill earmarked for energy was a big story , but I do n't know how much of that money was actually utilized .
The Pickens Plan derails
The website is still there , but the hype of 2008 turned into a big disappointment in 2009 after oil prices failed to remain high enough to make the project economical .
Pickens lost about 2 /3rds of his net worth as oil prices unwound , he took a beating in the press , and he announced in July that we would probably abandon the plan .
So what did I miss ?
And what are early predictions for 2010 's top stories ?
I think China 's moves are going to continue to make waves , there will be more delays ( and excuses ) from those attempting to produce fuel from algae and cellulose , and there will be little relief from oil prices .
Has proof of the existence of Dark Matter been found ?
And , more strangely , has it been found in a mine in the middle of Minnesota , instead of deep space ?
The answer to both questions may turn out to be yes ...

New Scientist reports that researchers involved in something called the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search may have found dark matter particles in an abandoned iron mine in Northern Minnesota .
Emphasis on the " may " :
When the CDMS - II team looked at the analysis of their latest run – after accounting for all possible background particles and any faulty detectors in their stacks – they were in for a surprise .
Their statistical models predicted that they would see 0.8 events during a run between 2007 and 2008 , but instead they saw two .
The team is not claiming discovery of dark matter , because the result is not statistically significant .
There is a 1 - in - 4 chance that it is merely due to fluctuations in the background noise .
Had the experiment seen five events above the expected background , the claim for having detected dark matter would have been a lot stronger .

Unable to prove that it is or is n't evidence of dark matter , the team are working on creating equipment three times as sensitive to use in the same area next year .
Clearest sign yet of dark matter detected [ New Scientist ]

The following is a statement issued by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ( D - NV ) :
This has been a long journey .
We have confronted many hurdles , and tonight I believe we have overcome yet another one .
I asked Senators Schumer and Pryor to work with some of the most moderate and most progressive members of our diverse caucus , and tonight they have come to a consensus .
It is a consensus that includes a public option and will help ensure the American people win in two ways : one , insurance companies will face more competition , and two , the American people will have more choices .
I know not all 10 Senators in the room agree on every single detail of this , nor will all 60 members of my caucus .
But I know we all appreciate the hard work that these progressives and moderates have done to move this historic debate forward .
I want to thank Senators Schumer , Pryor , Brown , Carper , Feingold , Harkin , Landrieu , Lincoln , Nelson and Rockefeller for working together for the greater good and never losing sight of our shared goal : making it possible for every American to afford to live a healthy life .
As is long - standing practice , we do not disclose details of any proposal before the Congressional Budget Office has a chance to evaluate it .
We will wait for that to happen , but in the meantime , tonight we are confident .

Since space exploration rose much higher than the sky last decade , every country set itself a goal to keep it going not to be on the back foot .
Most probably , every one of you has already heard about commonly known Baikonur spaceport , so today we are going to tell you a bit about the other one , less known spaceport as well as about launching of a space vehicle .
The spaceport itself is located much more faraway from any signs of civilizations than its counterpart , Baikonur cosmodrome , and nowadays is believed to be the northernmost spaceport in the world .
Decision about construction of the spaceport was put forward in 1957 .
An aim of top secret project was not a complicated one , nuclear device was supposed to reach the territory of a would - be aggressor as soon as possible .
From these very considerations , the location area nearby Arkhangelsk city was chosen just right .
Only in 1963 , on account of expansion of space activities the issue of launching space vehicles from the spaceport was brought about .
At first missile and space vehicle are being delivered to the spaceport by rail .
Space hardware is fragile one , so all the train cars are stuffed all over with machinery that maintains climate control inside .
Prior to moving to the spaceport , all the hardware should pass lots of different tests .
The main thing for machinery is to run hot and not to consume much power .
Altogether , the whole apparatus consumes not much than usual electric kettle .
Then , ready - for - use space vehicle is loaded into special container to deliver it to joining area .
The whole vehicle weighs a bit less than 2 tonnes , 540 kilos of which is scientific equipment set .
In comparison with missile the apparatus looks really tiny .
The vehicle is ready for the launch .
1 minute till the launch .
And as it always happens , something went wrong .
The automatic equipment found some system malfunction .
The next day everything was already fixed and the vehicle was successfully launched .
By the picture in the beginning of the article you can see that the activity of the space vehicle was quite a fruitful one .

Introduction
My local chapter of Libertarians for Peace , co-founded by local libertarian activist Lawrence Samuels and me in 2005 , joined the Peace Coalition of Monterey County ( PCMC ) about three years ago .
I think we are the only non-Left group in the 20 - plus member coalition .
The PCMC includes two religious organizations ( Unitarians and Quakers ) , a labor union organization , the Monterey County Democratic Central Committee , the Progressive Democrats of America , the Green Party , and various other organizations whose members believe in peace .
Back in July , at our bimonthly meeting of the Peace Coalition ’s Steering Committee , I proposed that we have an antiwar demonstration in the fall to oppose the wars in Iraq , Afghanistan , and Pakistan , and to oppose going to war against Iran .
My goal in doing so was twofold : ( 1 ) Because the antiwar movement had been relatively quiescent since George W. Bush had left office , I thought it important to make a statement that the wars , including the expanded wars in Afghanistan and Pakistan , are still a bad idea ; and ( 2 ) closely related to ( 1 ) , Lawrence and I wanted to test the coalition :
Was it really pro-peace , or had it gone soft because many of the members liked Obama on other grounds ?
I ’ll save you the suspense .
The Peace Coalition of Monterey County passed the test .
We had the demonstration , but we focused it against the war in Afghanistan .
The demonstration was a success .
Many of the participants were from left - wing organizations that are part of the PCMC .
And we got a lot of young people involved .
The ratio of thumbs up and friendly honks to middle fingers from drivers who passed by was about 9 to 1 .
Various people bonded .
We made signs that one does n’t normally see at antiwar demonstrations , and people whom one might not expect to carry them did so .
All of the signs were about the topic at hand – the war – and not about unrelated issues .
We had some good discussions , especially with the younger people at the demonstration .
Why did the demonstration focus on the Afghan war ?
When I proposed the demonstration at the Coalition ’s July meeting , someone said that it should n’t be directed against all the wars , but should be focused instead .
I disagreed , but everyone who spoke up leaned the other way and the particular war they wanted to go after was the war in Afghanistan .
That surprised me because Afghanistan was the one war that candidate Obama , and later President Obama , favored expanding .
Thus , we had achieved goal ( 2 ) even before the demonstration occurred .
Who Will Bell the Cat ?
Along with the classic blunder mentioned by Vizzini in The Princess Bride – " Never get involved in a land war in Asia " – another classic blunder is to propose an activity when few of the group ’s members are present .
If the organization says " yes , " the natural next step is to assume that the person who proposed it will also organize it .
We had an unusually small turnout that July , and it was clear to me that if I did n’t volunteer to organize the demonstration , it would n’t happen .
So I volunteered .
How hard could it be ?
Well , it turns out , not that hard .
The major tasks were to get a permit from the police to use the Windows on the Bay Park , put out a generic press release to the local media , make signs , and talk up the demonstration with others , mainly via e-mail .
The most time - consuming task was making the signs – getting the marker pens , buying out Target ’s stock of poster board at its two local outlets , lining up some volunteers and a place , and actually getting together on a Saturday afternoon to do it .
But that was fun , especially the three 50 - something men with graying hair kneeling on the floor writing out pithy slogans as if we were idealistic young college students instead of what we really are : idealistic middle - aged men .
The hardest part psychologically was going to the police station and filling out the form to get a permit to have the demonstration .
Part of why that was hard is that I ’m a libertarian and I hate asking permission to exercise my freedom of speech .
If you need permission , it ’s not quite freedom of speech .
The other part , if truth be told , is that I still have issues with authority , issues that I have had since a very early age .
But the police officer who mailed me the signed approval form , Lt. Leslie Sonne of the Monterey Police Department , seemed like a consummate professional .
Moreover , when , on the morning of the demonstration , I looked around for the form she had sent and could n’t find it , I e-mailed her and asked if I could pick up a duplicate .
I had it in my hand an hour later .
In organizing the demonstration , my first , I called my friend , managing editor of Antiwar.com Eric Garris , early in the game to get his thoughts .
The main thing I learned from him is that if you want to get across a consistent message , make signs with your message and hand them out .
To save on costs , I took some existing signs that were on message and that were stored at the Monterey Peace and Justice Center .
We made up , in addition , about 20 signs .
They had slogans such as :
8 Years is Enough .
( This was the theme for the press releases . )
Support the Troops : Bring them Home .
Fire General McChrystal .
Honk if You Want Peace .
And my favorite , partly because of my economics training and partly because this has never been emphasized but is absolutely true :
War Destroys Wealth .
In an interview I did with Scott Horton shortly before the demonstration , I told Scott about my " War Destroys Wealth " idea .
Scott saw it as a way to appeal to the Right on his assumption that people on the Right do n’t care about human lives but do care about property .
Indeed , in his write - up on the link above , Scott writes about my winning over conservatives by showing the economic consequences of war .
But that ’s not how I saw it at all .
I do n’t know anyone , left - wing , right - wing , or middle of the bird , who thinks that purposely destroying wealth is a good idea .
The slogan is also suitably general : War destroys the wealth of the taxpayers , current and future , who pay for it , and it also destroys the wealth of those who are attacked .
My instinct was right .
Two people whom no one would think of as right - wing picked up the signs and carried them at the demonstration .
Bumps in the Road
At the September bimonthly meeting of the PCMC Steering Committee , when I reported on how the organizing for the demonstration was going , one member stated that she strongly objected to anything that identified the Afghan war as " Obama ’s war . "
I reassured her that none of the signs I anticipated would do that and that I thought it more effective to leave out the names of the war - makers in order to focus on the issue .
One of the other people present said , " But it is Obama ’s war . "
I told him that I agreed but that I was willing to go along with the apparent consensus .
As we got closer to the date , I did get some flack from the person who wanted it not to be identified as Obama ’s war .
She objected to the following statement in the press release : " Peace Coalition spokesman David Henderson stated , ‘ Eight years is enough : in fact , it ’s too much .
The war should have ended on President Bush ’s watch .
Now it ’s up to President Obama to correct Bush ’s mistake . ’ "
But because that statement did not violate any agreement I had made , I kept it in .
The Event
On Friday , Oct. 5 , we held the demonstration from 5:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m .
We chose those hours to catch the traffic on busy Del Monte Avenue .
We had no speakers .
People rarely listen to speakers anyway , and , in my experience , few speakers respect their audiences enough to give coherent , thoughtful speeches .
When I got there , at about 4:45 p.m. , 10 or so people were already there with their own signs .
I handed out signs to comers and by about 5:15 p.m. , we had a group of about 40 to 50 people lining the street carrying their and our signs .
Four positives about the event stand out .
First , the reaction from people driving by was almost entirely positive : People honked their horns and then waved or gave thumbs up .
I got suckered by one young driver who smiled at me and pointed to his military sticker on the driver ’s side of his car .
I smiled back and then , when he had my attention , he gave me the middle finger .
But it was funny and so I laughed .
The reason it was funny brings me to my second positive : I was having a good time because there was a lot of bonding and camaraderie .
Holding the signs and standing beside others who probably shared very few of my political views felt fulfilling .
It reminded me that we could build bridges across political divides .
The third positive was the number of young people there , about 10 or so from California State University at Monterey Bay .
I talked to a number of them , and then Lawrence and I were invited to go with them for pizza afterward .
It ’s fun to bond .
There ’s one fourth positive .
A week earlier , when I was hauling the signs into the downtown office I rent , a woman who runs a small business in the same building saw me with the signs and said , " Oh , you ’re one of those . "
" Yes , " I said proudly , " I ’m one of those . "
Later I heard her talking to her two business partners about it and they came up and asked me about it .
After I told them about the upcoming event , they told me they would like to come and asked me to remind them as the date got closer .
I have become so used to people saying they will show up and then not show up , but I ’m fond of these women and I kept my word to remind them that same day .
Sure enough , they showed up .
And at the end , they asked to be told about future events .
The Press
This was a small positive .
The only publication that covered us was the local left - wing Monterey County Weekly .
Although their reporter Robin Urevich interviewed many people at the demonstration and , as far as I can tell , reported accurately , she gave prominence in her story to a Naval Postgraduate School colleague of mine named Thomas Johnson .
Johnson is an adviser to Stanley McChrystal who wants to use taxpayers ’ funds to rebuild Afghanistan .
Fresh from interviewing Johnson , Urevich quoted to me what he had said and asked if I thought " we " owed it to the Afghans to help rebuild their country .
I answered : " No , ‘ we ’ do n’t .
If somehow you could legally attach George W. Bush ’s wealth , then I think it would be legitimate to turn it over to individual Afghans .
But you did n’t attack Afghanistan and neither did I .
So we should n’t be forced to support them . "
Urevich asked , " But is n’t this like the Marshall Plan that rebuilt Europe ? "
I answered : " It is like the Marshall Plan , and the Marshall Plan was a failure .
Trivia question : Which country received the most aid under the Marshall Plan ? "
She said she did n’t know .
I replied : " England .
And they had a fairly unsuccessful economy all through the Marshall Plan era .
Tyler Cowen has written [ . pdf ] about this .
The country in Europe that thrived was West Germany , and that was because they removed Hitler ’s price controls that the Allies had taken over enforcing .
If you want to read more , I wrote about it in The Concise Encyclopedia of Economics . "
When I started telling her about Germany ’s experience , Urevich actually rolled her eyes .
You might think this is just good reporter skepticism .
But she does n’t bring skepticism to some other topics .
In a piece she did for NPR on the " living wage , " she measured its success by how it improved the lives of people who got the higher wage , with nary a mention of the unseen : the people who lost their jobs because the " living wage " priced them out of a job .
Moreover , Urevich then said , " I do n’t have the time to read up on the Marshall Plan .
It ’s generally accepted that it was successful . "
I replied : " I do n’t think that ’s good reporting , just to go with what ’s generally accepted when someone has cited specific evidence that you can check . "
Thus ended the interview .
And of course she reported none of my responses to Thomas Johnson ’s utopian proposal .
It ’s possible that we would have gotten better coverage if I had n’t been at a meeting with Urevich and the editorial staff at the Monterey County Weekly a few days earlier in which the staff made clear its displeasure at an ally ’s and my opposition to a property tax increase in Pacific Grove .
But we ’ll probably never know .
Coda
Although the least successful part of the demonstration was the press coverage , everything succeeded .
We bonded , we got out a good message , and we connected with young and non -young people .
You might wonder at the lighthearted tone of this article and of me at the demonstration .
After all , we were talking about issues of life and death .
But would we have been more successful with scowls on our faces ?
I doubt it .
One of the first rules of volunteer activity , whatever the activity , is to make it fun for the people involved .
After all , no one is paying us .
Did we end the war ?
Of course not .
But we got a good read on how much antiwar feeling there is in our area , learned how to run a successful demonstration , and strengthened the coalition .
And there will be more demonstrations , because , by the way , it is Obama ’s war .

Singer Billy Joel 's daughter , Alexa Ray Joel , lit up the blogosphere today after reportedly swallowing eight pills of Traumeel , " distraught over the ending of a recent relationship , " according to Us Magazine .
Traumeel , marketed as anti-inflammatory medication , contains a mix of herbs and other ingredients in low doses , and can come as a pill or an ointment .
The 23 - year - old , who allegedly called 911 in a panic , need n't have worried -- there 's no overwhelming proof that the homeopathic alternative to ibuprofen does much of anything .
" If it is a homeopathic preparation , that means it is given in very low dose , " said Paul Lofholm , a pharmacist based in Marin County .
" It ’s pretty hard to overdose on any homeopathic drug , because it has such a low potency . "
Those of you eyeing your medicine cabinets can breathe easier -- Traumeel probably wo n't hurt .
But it 's probably wasting your valuable shelf space .

Changing its tactics in the health - care debate , the White House has begun stressing the moral imperative to provide health insurance to all Americans .
“ I am my brother ’s keeper , I am my sister ’s keeper , ” President Obama now argues .
“ And in the wealthiest nation on earth right now , we are neglecting to live up to that call . ”
But Obama is just plain wrong that America is neglecting its obligations to the most vulnerable .
The real health - care problem is not moral but structural and systemic .
We already spend hundreds of billions of dollars every year providing health care to the elderly , through Medicare , and to the poor , through Medicaid .
The first of these programs — which , experts estimate , may squander up to $ 60 billion every year in waste , fraud , and abuse — is running a staggering , and unsustainable , long - term deficit of $ 38 trillion .
The second is in even worse shape , with a 2006 survey finding that as many as half of all physicians have either stopped accepting new Medicaid patients or limited the number they ’ll see because reimbursements are so low .
On paper , poor patients have great government insurance ; their only problem is that they can’t find a doctor .
Further , the bureaucrats who manage both the Medicare and Medicaid programs issue thousands of price controls every year , telling hospitals and doctors what services they must cover and what payments they must accept — regardless of whether the payments actually cover costs .
In 2008 , the consulting firm Milliman estimated that low reimbursements for doctors and hospital services shifted nearly $ 90 billion in costs annually from public to commercial payers .
This cost - shifting represents a hidden tax that effectively robs Peter to pay Paul , while allowing the public programs ’ defenders to claim that they are more efficient because they have lower costs than private insurers .
The White House is correct when it says that millions of Americans can’t afford private health insurance .
But what it does n’t mention is that government regulations reduce access to affordable private insurance , strangle competition , and make insurance more expensive .
State insurance regulators frequently require insurers to offer certain services — fertility drugs , alcohol - abuse treatment , and chiropractor services , for example — that consumers might not choose if they had a say in the matter .
The Council for Affordable Health Insurance notes that these mandates may push up the cost of basic health insurance by 20 to 50 percent , depending on the state .
Such mandates are part of a long history in which bureaucrats and policymakers have , with the best of intentions , distorted markets .
In fact , what health - law scholar David Hyman calls the “ original sin ” of American health care was the World War II–era decision to offer employers , rather than individuals , a tax deduction for health insurance .
There ’s no good reason why insurance should be tied to employment , especially since losing your job often means losing insurance coverage , along with access to your regular doctor .
The way the deduction works is also unfair : it is n’t capped , giving higher - wage workers more of a benefit than lower - income workers .
Further , employees at small firms that do n’t offer health insurance have to purchase it out of their own pockets .
And adding insult to injury , the tax preference for health insurance over wages — a dollar ’s worth of wages is taxed , but employees get to keep a whole dollar in health benefits — drives health - care inflation , because employees opt for insurance policies with high ( pretax ) premiums and low ( taxed ) out - of - pocket payments .
Over the long run , this health - care inflation saps middle - class incomes as insurance premiums rise much faster than take - home pay .
The American system of health insurance is unquestionably in need of serious reform .
Mounting costs threaten to suffocate future prosperity as taxes skyrocket to pay for entitlements .
But President Obama has let Congress craft legislation that does nothing to make the system any more sustainable and , moreover , would cost $ 1 trillion or more over the next decade .
The president ’s moral calls ignore the nuts - and - bolts economic causes of the system ’s problems , promising to make “ reform ” nothing but a fiscal shell game with a few biblical allusions thrown in .
The most striking feature of the H1N1 flu vaccine manufacturing process is the 1,200,000,000 chicken eggs required to make the 3 billion doses of vaccine that may be required worldwide .
There are entire chicken farms in the US and around the world dedicated to producing eggs for the purpose of incubating influenza viruses for use in vaccines .
No wonder it takes six months from start to finish .
But we ’ll get to that in a minute .
The most commonly used process for manufacturing an influenza vaccine was developed in the 1940s — one of its co-inventors was Jonas Salk , who would go on to develop the polio vaccine — and has remained basically unchanged since then .
The process is coordinated by the World Health Organization and begins with the detection of a new virus ( or rather one that differs significantly from those already going around ) ; in this instance , the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus .
Once the pandemic strain has been identified and isolated , it is mixed with a standard laboratory virus through a technique called genetic reassortment , the purpose of which is to create a hybrid virus ( also called the “ reference virus strain ” ) with the pandemic strain ’s surface antigens and the lab strain ’s core components ( which allows the virus to grow really well in chicken eggs ) .
Then the hybrid is tested to make sure that it grows well , is safe , and produces the proper antigen response .
This takes about six to nine weeks .
[ Quick definitional pause .
Antigen : “ An antigen is any substance that causes your immune system to produce antibodies against it .
An antigen may be a foreign substance from the environment such as chemicals , bacteria , viruses , or pollen .
An antigen may also be formed within the body , as with bacterial toxins or tissue cells . ”
So , when the H1N1 vaccine gets inside your body , the pandemic strain ’s surface antigens will produce antibodies against it . ]
At roughly the same time , a parallel effort to produce what are referred to as reference reagents is undertaken .
The deliverable here is a standardized kit provided to vaccine manufacturers so that they can test how much virus they are making and how effective it is .
This process serves to standardize vaccine doses across manufacturers and takes four months to complete .
WHO notes that this part of the process is “ often a bottleneck to the overall timeline for manufacturers to generate the vaccine ” .
Once the reference virus strain is produced , it is sent to pharmaceutical companies ( Novartis , Sanofi Pasteur , etc. ) for large - scale production of the vaccine .
The companies fine - tune the virus to increase yields and produce seed virus banks that will be used in the bulk production .
And this is where the 1.2 billion chicken eggs come in .
A portion of the seed virus is injected into each 9 - to 12 - day old fertilized egg .
The virus incubates in the egg white for two to three days and is then separated from the egg .
For the shot vaccine , the virus is sterilized so that it wo n’t make anyone sick .
This is the magic part of the vaccine : it ’s got the pandemic virus antigens that make your body produce the antibodies to fight the virus but the virus is inactive so it wo n’t make you ill .
For the nasal spray vaccine , the virus is left alive and attenuated to survive only in the nose and not the warmer lungs ; it ’ll infect you enough to produce antibodies but not enough to make you sick .
Either way , the surface antigens are separated out and purified to produce the active ingredient in the vaccine .
Each batch of antigen takes about two weeks to produce .
With enough laboratory space and chicken eggs , the companies can crank out an infinite amount of purified antigens , but those resources are limited in practice .
[ Side note .
You may have noticed that the H1N1 vaccine has been difficult to find in some places around the US .
The vaccine manufacturers have said that the Pandemic H1N1/09 virus when combined with the standard laboratory virus does not grow as fast in the eggs as they anticipated .
The batches of antigens from each egg have been smaller than expected , up to five or even ten times smaller in some cases .
Hence the slow rollout of the vaccine . ]
The purified antigen is then tested against the aforementioned reference reagents once they are ready .
The antigen is diluted to the required concentration and placed into properly labelled vials or syringes .
Further testing is performed to make sure the vaccine wo n’t make anyone ill , to confirm the correct concentration , and for general safety .
At this point clinical testing in humans is required in western Europe but not in the United States .
Finally , each company ’s vaccine has to be approved by the appropriate regulatory body in each country — that ’s the FDA in the case of the US — and then the vaccine is distributed to medical facilities around the country .

The initial network launch has been just the first step in our multi-year roadmap .
Once the network code is sufficiently stable , we plan to fully open - source the relevant codebases , continue the work on the Proof - of - Compute consensus algorithm that will supplement and eventually replace the Proof - of - Work currently used by Sentient .
This way the compute resources available by the participant nodes will not only be used to find the next block 's hash , but to run code that powers the next - generation decentralized applications , including training machine learning models and other AI - related software .
The next thing we need to look at are symbols , keywords and namespaces .
Symbols and keywords are used to name things , and the Clojure versions are a bit different from how they work in Common Lisp .
In Common Lisp , there is a notion of a package , which is a lot like a Clojure namespace , and there are symbols which have a name and are maybe affiliated with a package .
The Clojure version of a symbol has a name and may have a namespace , but the namespace may not exist even if it is present in the symbol .
We can make symbols using the symbol function
user= > ( symbol " foo " " bar " )
foo / bar
user= > ( symbol " bar " )
bar
And use the namespace and name functions to deconstruct them
user= > ( namespace ( symbol " foo " " bar " ) )
" foo "
user= > ( name ( symbol " foo " " bar " ) )
" bar "
user= > ( namespace ( symbol " bar " ) )
nil
user= > ( name ( symbol " bar " ) )
" bar "
Rather than using the function symbol to make the symbol , the reader automatically makes the symbol when it reads it .
user= > ( name ‘ bar )
" bar "
user= > ( namespace ‘ bar )
nil
user= > ( name ‘ foo / bar )
" bar "
user= > ( namespace ‘ foo / bar )
" foo "
In Common Lisp , Keywords are symbol with a particular home package – the package that owns the symbol is the package named Keyword .
In Clojure , a Keyword is an instance of a class which contains a symbol .
user= > ( keyword " foo " " bar " )
: foo / bar
user= > ( namespace : foo/ bar )
" foo "
user= > ( name : foo / bat )
" bat "
user= > ( keyword " bar " )
: bar
user= > ( namespace : bar )
nil
user= > ( name : bar )
" bar "
Keywords are useful because they evaluate to themselves , whereas symbols are evaluated by looking them up and evaluating the result of this lookup .
user= > :boo
: boo
user= > boo
java.lang .
Exception : Unable to resolve symbol : boo in this context ( NO_SOURCE_FILE:0 )
Just before we look at any more code , remember than the String class in java has an intern method that converts a string to a canonical instance of the same string .
user= > (. ( new String " a " ) ( intern ) )
" a "
user= > ( new String " a " )
" a "
user= > ( identical ? * 1 * 2 )
false
user= > ( new String " a " )
" a "
user= > ( new String " a " )
" a "
user= > ( identical ? ( new String " a " ) " a " )
false
user= > (. ( new String " a " ) ( intern ) )
" a "
user= > (. ( new String " a " ) ( intern ) )
" a "
user= > ( identical ? * 1 * 2 )
true
The Symbol class always interns the strings used for the namespace and the name to make later comparison identity comparison instead of equality comparison .
static public Symbol intern( String ns , String name ) {
return new Symbol ( ns == null ? null : ns.intern( ) , name.intern ( ) ) ;
}
static public Symbol intern( String nsname ) {
int i = nsname.lastIndexOf (‘/’ ) ;
if ( i == - 1 )
return new Symbol ( null , nsname.intern ( ) ) ;
else
return new Symbol( nsname.substring(0 , i ).intern ( ) , nsname.substring( i + 1).intern ( ) ) ;
}
Symbols have metadata .
user= > ( def x ‘ a )
# ’user / x
user= > x
a
user= > ( meta x )
nil
user= > ( with - meta ‘ a {:a 2} )
a
user= > ( def y * 1 )
# ’user /y
user= > ( meta y )
{:a 2}
And compare equal if their name and namespace components are the same .
user= > ( = ‘ a ‘ a )
true
user= > ( identical ? ‘ a ‘ a)
false
In this example , the reader is making a new symbol every time it reads one of the “ a ” characters .
When the Clojure reader reads something from a file , perhaps prior to compiling it , the forms are read as lists of symbols .
user= > ( def form ‘( defn foo [ x y ] ( + x y ) ) )
# ’user / form
user= > ( first form )
defn
user= > ( namespace ( first form ) )
nil
user= > ( name ( first form ) )
" defn "
user= > ( namespace ( second form ) )
nil
user= > ( name ( second form ) )
" foo "
Namespaces are the next thing we need to understand in order to see how the system evaluates the form contained in the Var named form .
The first symbol , “ defn ” will be resolved in the current namespace to see if it denotes a Var .
user= >
* ns *
#< Namespace user >
user= > ( first form )
defn
user= > ( resolve ( first form ) )
#’clojure.core/defn
user= > ( ns-resolve * ns* ( first form ) )
#’clojure.core/defn
The Java class for Namespace contains the following fields .
public class Namespace extends AReference {
final public Symbol name ;
final AtomicReference<IPersistentMap > mappings = new AtomicReference < IPersistentMap >( ) ;
final AtomicReference<IPersistentMap > aliases = new AtomicReference < IPersistentMap >( ) ;
final static ConcurrentHashMap < Symbol , Namespace > namespaces = new ConcurrentHashMap < Symbol , Namespace >( ) ;
The namespace is named by a Symbol and there is a global map of symbols to namespaces .
Each namespace has a group of mappings and some aliases .
When a namespace is constructed in the java code , the constructor deals with metadata , sets the name of the namespace , sets the aliases to an empty map and initializes the mappings to a default set .
Namespace ( Symbol name ) {
super(name.meta( ) ) ;
this .name = name ;
mappings.set( RT.DEFAULT_IMPORTS ) ;
aliases.set ( RT.map ( ) ) ;
}
The mappings of a namespace .
accessed by the Clojure function ns - map , maps from symbols to Var or Class instances .
user= > ( ns-map ( find - ns ‘ user ) )
{sorted - map #’clojure.core/sorted-map , read - line #’clojure.core/read-line , re-pattern #’clojure .core / re-pattern , keyword ?
#’clojure.core/ keyword ? , val #’clojure
.core/val , ProcessBuilder java.lang.ProcessBuilder , Enum java.lang .Enum , SuppressWarnings java.lang.SuppressWarnings , * compile - path * #’clojure.core /*compile-path*, par # ’user / par , max - key #’clojure.core / max-key , list * #’clojure.core/list* , ns-aliases #’clojure.core/ns-aliases , the -ns #’clojure.core / the-ns , == #’clojure.core/== , longs #’clojure.core/longs , special-form-anchor #’clojure.core/special-form-anchor , Throwable java.lang .
Throwable , InterruptedException java.lang.InterruptedException , instance ?
#’clojure.core/ instance ? , syntax - symbol - anchor #’clojure.core/syntax-symbol-anchor , Thread $UncaughtExceptionHandler java.lang.Thread$UncaughtExceptionHandler , RuntimeException java.lang.RuntimeException , …..}
RT.DEFAULT_IMPORTS
is a mappings consisting of a large number of predefined Java classes .
final static IPersistentMap DEFAULT_IMPORTS
= map (
Symbol.create ( " Boolean " ) , Boolean.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Byte " ) , Byte.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Character " ) , Character.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Class " ) , Class.class ,
Symbol.create ( " ClassLoader " ) , ClassLoader.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Compiler " ) , Compiler.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Double " ) , Double.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Enum " ) , Enum.class ,
Symbol.create ( " Float " ) , Float.class ,
………… }
Hence , all newly created namespaces start with these mappings .
user= > ( find -ns ‘ myNamespace )
nil
user= > ( create - ns ‘ myNamespace )
#< Namespace myNamespace >
user= > ( find -ns ‘ myNamespace )
#< Namespace myNamespace >
user= > ( ns-resolve ( find - ns ‘ myNamespace ) ‘ Boolean )
java.lang.Boolean
user= > ( ns-resolve ( find - ns ‘ myNamespace ) ‘ boolean )
nil
The Namespace class supports methods all , remove , find , findOrCreate for accessing a sequence of all known namespaces and for adding and removing from this set .
user= > ( all - ns )
(#< Namespace clojure.set > #< Namespace user > #< Namespace clojure.main > #< Namespace clojure.core > #< Namespace clojure.zip > #< Namespace clojure.xml >)
user= > ( create -ns ‘ foo )
#< Namespace foo >
user= > ( all - ns )
(#< Namespace clojure.set > #< Namespace user > #< Namespace clojure.main > #< Namespace clojure.core > #< Namespace clojure.zip > #< Namespace foo > #< Namespace clojure.xml >)
user= > ( remove -ns ‘ foo )
#< Namespace foo >
user= > ( all - ns )
(#< Namespace clojure.set > #< Namespace user > #< Namespace clojure.main > #< Namespace clojure.core > #< Namespace clojure.zip > #< Namespace clojure.xml >)
user= > ( find-ns ‘ clojure.core )
#< Namespace clojure.core >
user= > ( find -ns ‘ foo )
nil
Symbols can be interned into a namespace in order to make a named Var binding .
user= > ( create -ns ‘ foo )
#< Namespace foo >
user= > ( intern ( find - ns ‘ foo ) ‘ bar )
#’foo/ bar
This uses one of the intern methods on Var
public static Var intern( Symbol nsName , Symbol sym ) {
Namespace ns = Namespace.findOrCreate(nsName ) ;
return intern ( ns , sym ) ;
}
which calls back into the intern method on the Namespace
public static Var intern( Namespace ns , Symbol sym ) {
return ns.intern(sym ) ;
}
which does the actual work
public Var intern( Symbol sym ) {
if(sym.ns != null )
{
throw new IllegalArgumentException ( " Ca n’t intern namespace - qualified symbol " ) ;
}
IPersistentMap map = getMappings ( ) ;
Object o ;
Var v = null ;
while ( ( o = map.valAt(sym ) ) == null )
{
if (v == null )
v = new Var ( this , sym ) ;
IPersistentMap newMap = map.assoc(sym , v ) ;
mappings.compareAndSet(map , newMap ) ;
map = getMappings ( ) ;
}
if (o instanceof Var && ( ( Var ) o ) . ns == this )
return ( Var ) o ;
throw new IllegalStateException ( sym + " already refers to : " + o + " in namespace : " + name ) ;
}
Lookup of a symbol in a namespace is via the resolve function ( which will use the current namespace , that in the * ns* Var )
user= > ( resolve ‘ foo / bar )
#’foo/ bar
The functions implementing this are in core.clj
( defn resolve
" same as ( ns-resolve * ns* symbol ) "
[ sym ] ( ns-resolve * ns* sym ) )
( defn ns - resolve
" Returns the var or Class to which a symbol will be resolved in the
namespace , else nil .
Note that if the symbol is fully qualified ,
the var / Class to which it resolves need not be present in the
namespace . "
[ ns sym ]
( clojure.lang.Compiler/maybeResolveIn ( the - ns ns ) sym ) )
Symbols from one namespace can be made visible in another .
user= > ( ns-resolve ‘ foo ‘ mySym )
nil
user= > ( create - ns ‘ other )
#< Namespace other >
user= > ( intern ‘ other ‘ mySym )
# ’other / mySym
user= > ( binding [ * ns* ( find - ns ‘ foo ) ] ( refer ‘ other ) )
nil
user= > ( ns-resolve ‘ foo ‘ mySym )
# ’other / mySym
user= > ( ns-resolve ‘ foo ‘ other / mySym )
# ’other / mySym
Internally this calls the refer method of the Namespace object
public Var refer( Symbol sym , Var var ) {
return ( Var ) reference ( sym , var ) ;
}
which calls the reference method
Object reference ( Symbol sym , Object val ) {
if(sym.ns != null )
{
throw new IllegalArgumentException ( " Ca n’t intern namespace - qualified symbol " ) ;
}
IPersistentMap map = getMappings ( ) ;
Object o ;
while ( ( o = map.valAt(sym ) ) == null )
{
IPersistentMap newMap = map.assoc(sym , val ) ;
mappings.compareAndSet(map , newMap ) ;
map = getMappings ( ) ;
}
if (o == val )
return o ;
throw new IllegalStateException ( sym + " already refers to : " + o + " in namespace : " + name ) ;
}
Import can be used to map java classes into a namespace .
ns - unmap can be used to remove any existing mapping .

One can also set up aliases for a given namespace to allow it to be accessed via another symbol when that symbol is used as the namespace part of the lookup symbol .
There are also function ns - publics and ns-imports for getting subsets of the main namespace map .
Europe and US should also be responsible for millions who will be displaced by climate change , says Abul Maal Abdul Muhith
Up to 20 million Bangladeshis may be forced to leave the country in the next 40 years because of climate change , one of the country 's most senior politicians has said .
Abul Maal Abdul Muhith , Bangladesh 's finance minister , called on Britain and other wealthy countries to accept millions of displaced people .
In a clear signal to the US and Europe that developing countries are not prepared to accept a weak deal at next week 's Copenhagen climate summit , Abdul Muhith said Bangladesh wanted hosts for managed migration as people began to abandon flooded and storm - damaged coastal areas .
" Twenty million people could be displaced [ in Bangladesh ] by the middle of the century , " Abdul Muhith told the Guardian .
" We are asking all our development partners to honour the natural right of persons to migrate .
We can't accommodate all these people – this is already the densest [ populated ] country in the world , " he said .
He called on the UN to redefine international law to give climate refugees the same protection as people fleeing political repression .
" The convention on refugees could be revised to protect people .
It 's been through other revisions , so this should be possible , " he said .
Tens of thousands of people in Bangladesh and other low - lying areas of Asia are leaving their communities as their homes and land become inundated .
But this is the first time that a senior politician from a developing country has openly proposed that those countries considered responsible for climate change should take physical responsibility for the refugees created .
Bangladesh , India , and many small island states such as the Maldives face having to relocate large populations over the next 50 years as sea levels rise up to one metre .
This would have profound effects on the 1.5 billion people who presently live in coastal areas .
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , the scientific body that assesses the impact of climate change , has said there could be 200 million climate change migrants by 2050 .
There is mounting evidence in India and Bangladesh and other low - lying countries that sea levels are rising faster than the global average of 1.2 mm a year .
Islands and coastal communities in the Ganges delta and the Bay of Bengal have recorded rises of up to 5 mm a year .
In Bangladesh hundreds of coastal villagers are forced to drink salty water as tides continue to rise and the sea intrudes on fresh water aquifers .
Abdul Muhith said managed migration could be positive for Bangladesh and the west : " We can help in the sense of giving the migrants some training , making them fit for existence in some other country .
Managed migration is always better – we can then send people who can attune to life more easily . "
But he added , in another warning before Copenhagen where money will be a critical issue , that current levels of aid were inadequate .
" Total aid in Bangladesh today is less than 2 % of GDP .
It is almost the same in China and in India .
So we , the most populated , least developed country , gets peanuts .
This inequity is terribly intolerable . "
Rajendra Pachauri , chairman of the IPCC , said the Bangladeshi migration proposal should be taken seriously .
" This is clearly a warning signal from Bangladesh and similar countries to the developed countries .
And I think it has to be taken very seriously .
If you accept that those countries that have really not been responsible for causing the problem , and have a legitimate basis for help from the developed countries , then one form of help would certainly be facilitation of immigration from these countries to the developed world , " he said .
" If you had 30 or 40 million migrating to other parts of the world , that 's a sizable problem for which we have to prepare .
And if it requires changes to immigration laws and facilitating people settling down and working in the developed countries , then I suppose this will require legislative action in the developed world , " he said .
Douglas Alexander , the international development secretary , said : " As the largest international donor to Bangladesh , Britain has been urging the international community to provide extra money for climate change adaptation . "
But Jean - Francois Durieux , who is in charge of climate migration at the UN refugee agency , cautioned against reworking the UN convention on refugees .
" The risk of mass migration needs to be managed .
It 's absolutely legitimate for Bangladesh and the Maldives to make a lot of noise about the very real risk of climate migration – they hope it will make us come to their rescue .
But reopening the 1951 convention would certainly result in a tightening of its protections . "
He said there was a danger of a backlash in rich countries .
" The climate in Europe , North America and Australia is not conducive to a relaxed debate about increasing migration .
There is a worry doors will shut if we start that discussion , " he said .
There is extreme sensitivity about adapting the UN convention on refugees .
A UNHCR report in August warned : " In the current political environment , it could result in a lowering of protection standards for refugees and even undermine the international refugee protection regime altogether . "

On removing GPL code
Last week , Diego Iastrubni asked removing GPL code , prompted by MonoDevelop ’s announcement that it had removed all the GPL code in its codebase , thus opening the road to proprietary plugins .
Well Diego , there ’s an app organization for that .
Depending on your jurisdiction , you could ask the Free Software Foundation in the United States , the Free Software Foundation Europe in Europe , the Free Software Foundation Latin America in Latin America ( are you seeing a pattern here ? ) .
The FSF in the United States is the steward of the GPL ( all versions ) and the organization in charge of interpreting the intent of the GPL .
Of course , certain matters on interpretation will end up in courts — because it is not only about the intent of the license , but also what it actually says .
There are also national centres of competence regarding licensing issues and the use of Free Software .
In Finland you might want to ask COSS ; in Spain , CENATIC or ASOLIF ; in the Netherlands , NOiV ; in the United States , the Linux Foundation .
Any of those might be able to help out with this kind of question .
I wo n’t pretend that they definitely will : it depends on the context and workload and whether the question makes sense in their context .
Fortunately , an organization like FSFE has education and information provision written into its constitution ( but not its budget : support the FSFE to help it continue to help you and the rest of the Free Software world ) .
So here ’s an attempt at an answer — which does not constitute legal advice and which does not constitute an interpretation of the GPL .
So let ’s follow through Diego ’s question :
I have this application which I license under the terms of BSD , and I saw a GPL library ( lets call it libbar ) which might help me .
I incorporate the library by dinamic linking .
Now my application is effectly a GPL binary , sweet .
It is vitally important to distinguish between source and object forms of the software here , as well as keeping track of mechanisms of linking .
Let ’s try to strip this down to a bare minimum number of components .
A program A written entirely by you using no external ( third - party ) components and released by you under the terms of the 2 - clause BSD license .
That ’s fine .
Now suppose you modify your application to use an interface provided by a GPL library ( like libbar , in Diego ’s example ) .
Does that make your program a work that must be licensed under the GPL ?
Maybe .
Does that make the object form of the program linked to GNU readline a work that can only be distributed under the terms of the GPL ?
Yes .
So you must ship the object with the text of the GPL , with a source code offer ( either the complete source or a written offer , as usual ) .
Still , the sources retain the license that you originally put on them ( BSD 2 - clause , which is GPL - compatible , so this is possible ) .
Now you replace libbar ( the GPL library ) with a newly written , 2 - clause BSD - licensed , libbar_bsd .
It might implement the same API as libbar , or it might implement a slightly different one and you modify your application A accordingly .
Does that change the licensing possibilities that you have ?
Yes .
you can release A under the 2 - clause BSD license — again , keeping in mind other obligations you might have .
If you were forced to re-license the source under the GPL ( see Maybe , above ) , then there may be issues .
If you are the sole copyright holder , then of course you can re-license .
But you need to double - check any contributions you may have received to the codebase .
With the new A , you can release object versions including libbar_bsd , under the 2 - clause BSD license .
Lets assume , my application uses ( derives classes , whatever ) code from libbar .
If I remove the GPL code and change it by BSD code – my work even though it does not contain GPL code – it ’s a derived work , due to compile time constrains .
Am I correct ?
I think this scenario has two different interpretations : if A uses functions from the library then — like I said previously — the object is definitely GPL licensed and the source might need to be .
But if you actually have derived classes and modified code from libbar , then it ’s going to be a great deal more difficult , because your source is in itself a derived work .
I ’m not sure how to understand the “ remove the GPL code ” here : if there is no GPL source code in the application and it does n’t link to any GPL libraries in object form then there ’s no reason that the GPL need apply .
Let ’s look at Diego ’s other scenario :
Lets assume that libbar , uses abstract classes / methods from libfoo ( which is BSD ) .
Lets assume that my application uses the interfaces exposed in libfoo , then libbar extends those interfaces , and I am not directly using libbar .
When I use my new BSD library , my application is not compiled against any GPL code ( just linked to ) and it never used it directly .
My old code was GPL by run-time constrains and , and the new one is BSD .
Am I correct ?
In this scenario , application A uses libfoo ( presumably unrelated , although it apparently provides functionality to libbar ) , so there ’s no GPL code involved at all .
The parenthetical comment “ ( just linked to ) ” I do n’t understand : why would the application A link to libbar at all if it does n’t use it and libbar is en independent development ?
So that leaves us with that dreaded “ Maybe ” from earlier .
Paul Pacheco commented on Diego ’s blog with exactly the right bits of the GPL — the trailer to clause 2 of the GPLv2 ; GPL v3 does n’t have the same language .
But perhaps even more important , the GPL v2 says :
Thus , it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by you ; rather , the intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program .
In other words , distributing your work which is both an identifiable part of the whole work and which is not derived from the GPL library ( and I ’ll claim that using an interface is not in itself sufficient to create a derivative work ) , then the source continues to be licensable however you like , but the object must be distributed under the GPL .
The sources you provide that correspond to that object form must be distributed under the terms of the GPL — strange but true .

Apple plans to unveil a long - awaited tablet computer this month which may begin to ship in March , The Wall Street Journal reports .
Citing " people briefed by the company , " the newspaper said the color screen tablet is expected to be a multimedia device that will let people watch movies and television shows , play games , surf the Web and read electronic books and newspapers .
The Journal said the device , which has been the subject of speculation for years , will come with a 10 - to 11 - inch ( 25.4 - to 27.9 - centimeter ) touchscreen .
The newspaper said the tablet would be unveiled later this month but did not say exactly when .
All Things Digital , however , a technology blog owned by Dow Jones , publisher of the Journal , said Apple had rented a San Francisco venue for January 27 to hold a media event and announce a " major new product . "
Britain 's Financial Times also reported last month that Apple had rented the Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco , a space Apple has used in the past , but for January 26 not January 27 .
Apple , the Cupertino , California , company behind the Macintosh computer , iPhone and iPod , routinely refuses to comment on products ahead of their release .
The Journal said Apple does not plan on shipping the tablet until March although " the shipping time has n't been finalized and could change . "
The newspaper quoted analysts as saying they believed an Apple tablet would be priced at around $ US1000 ( $ 1096 ) .
Apple is notoriously secretive about product launches and has declined to address the rumors concerning an " iSlate , " " iPad " or " iTablet , " which analysts have said may resemble an oversized iPod Touch or a low - cost netbook computer .

The main focus of my research so far has been on the integration of optimization techniques .
Although I have used Integer Programming theory , I had n’t ( until recently ) done research on creating new IP theory .
Perhaps as a result of that , I spent many years unaware of Optima , the newsletter of the Mathematical Programming Society .
Thanks to my recent trip to the ISMP , however , I was able to get a hold of issues 76 through 79 of Optima ( they ’re also available online ) .
A quick browse through the pages left me with a very good impression .
Every single issue had a discussion or short paper on a topic that interested me , and I ca n’t wait to sit down to read them more carefully ( see for instance Javier Peña ‘s article on Nash Equilibria Computation via Smoothing Techniques ( Nov 2008 issue ) ; Texas Hold ’em poker anyone ? ) .
I particularly like the fact that the short papers are written at a more accessible level ( at least to me ) , when compared to papers published in Mathematical Programming ; it ’s a great way to get introduced to a new topic .
Another great feature are the Discussion Columns , which give expert opinions and historical perspectives about a variety of topics .
I ’m glad I came across Optima and did not shy away from grabbing some of the free issues available at ISMP .
I strongly recommend it to anyone interested in the field of mathematical programming .

( do n't breathe too quickly ) do n't bring your passion ( do n't believe your hype ) your indoctrination is endangered ( my intoxication is imminent )
Let ’s face it , we all forget wrapping paper or do n’t want to go the expense of purchasing yet another roll of ugly paper with a Bizarro world view of Santa and his reindeer .
Here at FiscalGeek labs we ’ve been working on some inventive ideas for covering your gifts .
Notice I said covering , those may appeal especially to those who ’ve never mastered the ancient art of paper folding .
So whip out the spray glue and the duct tape we ’re covering our presents .
Shredded Awesomeness
Alright you are diligent about shredding those nasty credit card offers and now you ’ve got a can full of shredded paper what do you do ?
Cover your presents with it of course .
Whip out your can of spray glue .
I used Elmer ’s Spray glue , but you could also use almost any of the 3 M varieties or for a slightly more time consuming method you can brush on some Elmer ’s
White glue that you ’ve diluted with water .
Heck you could even dip the box in maple syrup pretty much anything that ’s sticky will work .
For the purposes of the instructions we ’ll assume you ’re using spray glue .
Amass your shredded paper and put it in a garbage sack or box larger than your present .
Spray one side of your present with the glue and let set , typically about 15 seconds to tacky .
Dip or cover the glued side in the shredded paper .
Depending on your glue and coverage you may need to respray and do 2 coats .
Repeat for all of the sides
It ’s Shredtastic !
If you want to kick it up a notch you can shred some colored paper in there to give it some flare .
If you are concerned about ruining the box that your present came in consider going the route of the Enigma Box and cover that .
Sawdust Extravaganza
What better way to encase your heirloom quality breadboard you just built for your Mom than in the very wood shavings that gave their life for the present ?
The technique is identical to Shredded Awesomeness replacing your sawdust or chips with the shredded paper .
This is a versatile technique that you can use with most anything around the house , corn flakes , dryer lint , dog hair , fireplace ash , the sky is the limit .
This technique is also especially useful if you have to cover some odd shaped presents .
The paper , sawdust or sand will stick all over .
You could even use it to attach your traditional wrapping paper if you just ca n’t stand the hassle of using paper AND tape .
There ’s got to be an easier way !
How about just tape ?
Duct Tape Gift Wrap
Are you tired of the unwrapping of Christmas morning lasting approximately 42 seconds as everyone unwraps their presents in a cavalcade of ripping and shredding ?
If you have covered their present in duct tape it will take them a minimum of five minutes to get that sucker unwrapped and that ’s if they ’ve got a pocket knife on them .
As an added benefit their present will be air and water tight in case Uncle Eddy spills his glass of egg nog on the presents Christmas Eve .
The technique is simple .
Take your present and covered the longest sides first overlapping the ends by about 1/4 . ”
Continue to cover the side placing one piece of tape over the next overlapping about 1 / 4 ″ each time .
Once you have the sides done move to the top .
Cut strips long enough to go around the entire box as you ’ll be covering the top , bottom and ends with one wrap .
Continue wrapping around the box again overlapping 1/ 4 ″ each time .
Marvel at the beauty that is your duct taped present .
Now good old fashioned gray duct tape looks very nice , especially if you cut out some holly or reindeer out of a different color tape to stick on there .
Or if you want to go full bore alternate green and red tape like I ’ve done .
Now that ’s a gift that MacGyver would love .
The Enigma Box
What ’s that I see under the tree ?
Fifty pounds of Alaskan king crab legs ?
Aunt Fern knows I ca n’t eat shellfish .
Oh but Aunt Fern is a trickster , she ’s cleverly thrown you off the trail by placing her actual present inside a “ donor ” box .
This works especially well if you want to hide some jewelry or other distinctive packaging that might give the identity of your gift away .
You ’ll note that I ’ve hidden the present inside a Heelys box .
No I do n’t expect my grandmother wants wheeled skate shoes , but she ’ll be beside herself when she open ’s it up to reveal the book light I ’ve purchased for her .
Find a “ donor ” box larger than your present ’s current packaging .
Place your present inside the “ donor ” box .
Tape the box closed .
( Optional ) attach a bow or some ribbon to give it that extra special touch Laugh inside at your devilish cleverness .
This technique is a good precursor to many of the other techniques if you are worried at all about damaging the packaging .
Gunny Sacking
This is a classic method that you might not have seen recently .
I learned this technique from my grandparents as a child .
If you do n’t have enough paper , time or motivation this is the method for you .
This is also a fantastic way to cover those items that are way to large for traditional wrapping methods and as a way to provide a convenient holder for all of the Christmas morning refuse .
Get a garbage sack larger then the item you need to cover .
Black or white are always nice choices .
Put your present in the garbage sack .
Tie the garbage bag closed with some string or for a real personalized holiday touch put some ribbon of a contrasting color on their with some nice ribbon curls .
Throw the present over your back Santa you ’re off to deliver the goods .
Aluminum Foil
This method is simple and not even worth detailing the steps .
Get your present and some aluminum foil .
Now wrap it as you would a regular present with traditional wrapping paper .
As an added bonus you can choose either the shiny or matte silver finish depending on your mood .
If you have a larger present you may want to choose an alternate method as taping several pieces of foil together can become tedious .
What better way to wrap your baked goods then in an insulated package and you ’ve killed two birds with one stone .
Be forewarned if you put the present right next to some lights they get warm .
Bow optional .
The Old Favorite
My brother used to always wrap his presents using the Sunday Morning Comics .
This is a classic method if you love to wrap .
Why not tailor it to the person receiving the gift .
Bob loves golf so cover his with a section of the sports pages .
Or maybe you could cover it with the Best Buy ad so they can look at all the electronics they wish they had gotten for Christmas .
Any way you look at it , your loved ones are going to love the fact that you ’ve done something different and cared enough to come up with your own method .
Got some of your own methods to share we are always on the lookout for new and innovative ideas .

Remember that great Cold War movie , “ WarGames “ ?
It portrays a young computer nerd who makes his way into a government computer and sets it on a course convincing top government officials that the end of the world is imminent .
Based on the computer simulation playing out on their screens , which they believe reflects reality , the top brass cranks up the danger alarm to DefCon1 and sets out to unleash deadly global countermeasures .
Finally , at the 11th hour , a scientist who had turned his back on the whole concept of such computer gaming convinces the government not to act — to wait and see that the end of the world is not reality ; it is a computer simulation — and all is saved .
The plot is eerily similar to that coming to light from the Climate Research Unit ’s hacked emails : advocates of global warming fed data into computers to model catastrophic events unfolding right before our eyes that demand immediate and draconian countermeasures .
Except , they ’re just computer models .
Here is one such example of how actual temperature readings have been “ enhanced ” :
“ Before ” — raw temperature data from New Zealand :
“ After ” — the same data , adjusted for undisclosed reasons :
The accompanying story explains :
About half the adjustments actually created a warming trend where none existed ; the other half greatly exaggerated existing warming .
All the adjustments increased or even created a warming trend , with only one ( Dunedin ) going the other way and slightly reducing the original trend .
The shocking truth is that the oldest readings have been cranked way down and later readings artificially lifted to give a false impression of warming , as documented below .
There is nothing in the station histories to warrant these adjustments and to date Dr. Salinger [ the lead scientist ] and NIWA [ New Zealand ’s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research ] have not revealed why they did this .
Michael Mann ’s famous “ hockey stick , ” used to great effect by well - known former politicians and other alarmists , employs similar “ tricks , ” as does the work of his colleagues — now all trying desperately to get us to believe that the term “ trick ” really means “ scientific method . ”
Now that it has been revealed that all of the raw data upon which all of these doomsaying models have been built have been thrown away , with our supposing to just “ trust ” that the manipulated data remaining has been manipulated correctly ; and now that we ’ve seen a dozen years of no warming that the scientists have admitted among themselves flies in the face of their models ( “ Hide the decline ” ) , how about we finally stop playing ClimateGames , step down from DefCon1 / Kyoto / Copenhagen , and play a nice game of chess ?

These Stradivari violins may have a mundane varnish , but their sound is spectacular .
Text Size A A
For decades , scientists scrutinizing violins made by the famous instrument maker Antonio Stradivari have proposed that the instruments ' extraordinary sound may have come from special chemicals used in the varnish or as a base layer .
But now a five - year study on five Stradivari violins at the Museum of Music in Paris — the largest Stradivari study to date — finds that the varnish used by the instrument maker was composed of widely available mundane oils , pigments , and resins .
The work challenges established ideas that Stradivari violin varnishes held unusual music - making additives and reopens the mystery of how exactly the Stradivari instruments achieve such a superior sound .
A 12 - person team led by Jean - Philippe Echard , a conservation chemist at the Museum of Music , used a combination of micro-Raman , micro-Fourier transform infrared , and X - ray spectroscopies to tease out the microchemical composition of five violins that span 30 years of Stradivari 's career in the late 1600s and early 1700s ( Angew .
Chem .
Int. Ed. , DOI : 10.1002/anie.200905131 ) .
The team found that Stradivari laid down a layer of linseed oil , similar to that used by artists of the time , to seal the wood , followed by an oil resin that contained red iron oxide and other common crimson pigments , also used by artists of that era .
Joseph Nagyvary , a professor emeritus at Texas A&M University who has studied Stradivari violins , calls the new report " startling " because it disagrees with well - established research from the 1970s , which concluded that " all Stradivari violins have a solid mineral ground layer . "
If the varnish is really just linseed oil , as the new research suggests , then Nagyvary wonders how the violins achieved their exceptional sound .
" If Echard is right , the minimum one can say is that the varnish is not important , and the secret was in the wood , " Nagyvary adds .

One of the books on the list was “ Heaven and Earth : Global Warming — the Missing Science , ” a skeptical take on climate change .
Mackey told me that he agrees with the book ’s assertion that , as he put it , “ no scientific consensus exists ” regarding the causes of climate change ; he added , with a candor you could call bold or reckless , that it would be a pity to allow “ hysteria about global warming ” to cause us “ to raise taxes and increase regulation , and in turn lower our standard of living and lead to an increase in poverty . ”
One would imagine that , on this score , many of his customers , to say nothing of most climate scientists , might disagree .
He also said , “ Historically , prosperity tends to correlate to warmer temperatures . ”
CHEAP oil has been the driving force behind the phenomenal economic growth of the past century , at least in the west .
Oil is the lifeblood of the modern world .

But the days of abundant , easy - to - extract oil are numbered .
It ’s a mantra we ’ve all heard before .
Oil production is poised to enter terminal decline : if “ peak oil ” has n’t already arrived , it is imminent .
Make no mistake , peak oil is a threat to our way of life .

Tea Party protest sign compares health reform to Holocaust
UPDATE : In a scene Roll Call described as “ pandemonium , ” police arrested a dozen Tea Party protesters outside House Speaker Nancy Pelosi ’s office Thursday , in the midst of a Capitol Hill protest against the Democrats ’ health care reform .
The arrests took place outside Pelosi ’s office for district business , not her main congressional office .
Christina Bellantoni at TalkingPointsMemo reports that protesters heckled the police vans as they pulled away with the arrested protesters , who were charged with unlawful entry and disorderly conduct .

Protesters shouted “ Let them go ! ” and one woman reportedly said , “ This is America , this is not the Soviet Union . ”
Bellantoni reported that rumors spread that the protesters were arrested for praying , or for tearing up pages of the proposed health care bill .
“ The speaker ’s staff said those arrested were objecting to language in the health care overhaul that they said would allow federally subsidized abortions , ” the Associated Press reported .
CLIFF CLAVIN : HEALTH REFORM IS IMPORTED SOCIALISM
Among the protesters at Thursday ’s rally was John Ratzenberger , the actor who played Cliff Clavin on the sitcom Cheers .

“ These are Woodstock Democrats , ” CNN quoted Ratzenberger as saying at the rally .
“ We have to remember where their philosophy comes from .
It does n’t come from America .
It comes from overseas .
It comes from socialism .
And socialism is a philosophy of failure . ”
Matthew DeLong at the Washington Independent reported that Americans for Prosperity , a corporate - funded group that opposes the proposed health care reforms , arranged for 40 buses to ship people to the protests .

A “ Tea Party ” rally against health care reform on Capitol Hill Thursday featured a sign that compared health care reform efforts to the Nazi Holocaust .

Numerous Republican congresspeople attended the event that was principally organized by Minnesota Republican Rep. Michele Bachmann , among them House Minority Leader John Boehner ( R - OH ) and Minority Whip Eric Cantor ( R - VA ) , according to Eric Kleefeld at TalkingPointsMemo .
“ National Socialist Health Care : Dachau , Germany — 1945 , ” read a sign that ThinkProgress ’ Lee Fang captured on camera .
The image appears to show dead bodies from the Nazi holocaust piled one on top of another .

Blogger Matthew Yglesias commented : “ There are all kinds of nutty people in the world , but these kinds of things are the wages of a conservative leadership and media that ’s consistently tried to drum up opposition to health care reform not by opposing things that are actually in the bill , but with demagogic opposition to completely fabricated provisions . ”
Progressive bloggers and watchdogs are linking the sign to conservative media voices who in the past have made comparisons between President Barack Obama ’s health care reform agenda to “ fascism ” or Nazi Germany .

“ Fox News owns this sign , ” trumpeted Matt Gertz at the media watchdog site MediaMatters .
“ If Republicans wonder why most Americans view them as part of the fringe extreme , they need not look beyond this event , ” quipped Jed Lewison at DailyKos .
MediaMatters has filed a series of reports suggesting that Fox News worked overtime to promote the protest .
The group counted nine cases of Fox personalities “ promoting ” the protest since October 30 .
The group also noted that Fox News streamed the protest live on its Web site .

When it comes to movies , it may be that sex does n't sell .
A recent study concluded that nudity and explicit sex scenes do n't translate to success for major motion pictures .
" Sex Does n't Sell -- nor Impress !
Content , Box Office , Critics , and Awards in Mainstream Cinema " examined more than 900 films released between 2001 and 2005 .
The study found that , contrary to popular belief , sex and nudity failed to positively affect a film 's popularity among viewers or critics and did not guarantee big box office receipts .
One of the study 's co-authors , Dean Keith Simonton , said theirs was the largest sample of its kind used for film research .
The results surprised him , he said .
" Sex did not sell , whether in the domestic or international box office , and even after controlling for MPAA rating , " said Simonton , who is a professor of psychology at the University of California , Davis .
" In other words , even among R movies , less graphic sex is better . "
The top - grossing films in the study included movies like " Shrek 2 ; " " Spider - Man ; " " Star Wars Episode III : Revenge of the Sith " and " The Lord of the Rings : The Return of the King , " all of which contained mostly minor to mild sex and / or nudity .
Simonton said the research went beyond others in that it also examined other forms of " objectionable " material that might earn a film an R rating including violence .
The study was prompted by an experience almost a decade ago of its co-author , Anemone Cerridwen .
Cerridwen had been taking acting classes and increasingly became uncomfortable with some of the sexualized content she was encountering .
That led her to consider the work experiences of film actresses and the pursuit of data about the lucrativeness of sex in movies .
" I assumed sex sold , and wanted to know by how much , " Cerridwen said .
" I braced myself for the worst , and got quite the surprise . "
Craig Detweiler , director of the Center for Entertainment , Media and Culture at Pepperdine University , said the study 's findings reflect the culture 's post - sexual revolution sensibilities .
" Nothing is as shocking anymore , " Detweiler said .
" You can see it in Britney Spears ' kiss with Madonna and Janet Jackson 's Super Bowl performance .
Things that were a big controversy among some , the next generation kind of yawned at it . "
Rather , Detweiler said , he has seen among his students that the new form of rebellion against the older generation includes " not doing drugs , not sleeping around and not getting divorced . "
That might explain the popularity of some of the Jane Austen films and movies like the " Twilight " series , he said .
" Those stories are really about sexual separation , " he said .
" They are all about wooing , not winning . "
Tom Jacobs , staff writer for the research - driven consumer magazine Miller - McCune , wrote about the study and said there has long been the belief that the many young males who make up movie audiences are enthralled by female nudity .
" These researchers really put that belief to the test and crunched the numbers , " Jacobs said .
" What I took from the study is that a hint of sex is perhaps more enticing than out - and - out nudity . "
The study 's authors are hopeful that their findings will have some impact on moviemaking .
Simonton said he has had one inquiry from a researcher at a major studio that he declined to name , though he has no idea if the studio plans on acting on the data .
Cerridwen said she thinks movies continue to be influential on the public and believes their study could also have an influence , especially if other academics pick up the torch and continue the research .
Until then , she hopes Hollywood takes notice .
" I do believe that there are a fair number of people in the film industry who want to make better films , and this study may give them some ammunition , " she said .
" I know that Hollywood has been trying to make more family - friendly films for a while ( since the ' 90s ) and it seems to be helping ticket sales , so my guess is that this research would complement that . "
British train fares are the highest in Europe The UK's first £ 1,000 rail ticket has been described as " scandalous " and " appalling value " by opposition MPs .
The first - class return walk - up fare is from Newquay , in Cornwall to Kyle of Lochalsh , in the Scottish Highlands .
The Conservatives blamed " Labour 's micromanagement of the railways " , while the Lib Dems called the record fare " a very unwelcome landmark " .
Cross Country Trains , which sells the ticket , said an advance fare was available for £ 561 .
Price doubled
The fare was unearthed in a survey by rail expert Barry Doe , who said that the price of long - distance journeys had risen by up the three times the level of inflation since privatisation in the mid-1990s .
Mr Doe told the Evening Standard newspaper that even the £ 1,002 ticket had been available for £ 486 as recently as September 2008 .
Three train companies share the 1,700 mile ( 2,736 km ) return trip - First Great Western , Cross Country and Scotrail .
The £ 1,000 journey is from Cornwall to the Scottish Highlands Mr Doe pointed out that on the first leg of the journey ( Newquay to Par ) and the last ( Inverness to Kyle of Lochalsh ) there were not even any first - class carriages for the ticketholder to sit in .
A spokesman for Cross Country said : " No - one has actually bought this £ 1,000 fare but it does exist .
" Someone wanting a first - class return would be likely to book a saver return in advance and pay £ 561 . "
' Takes the biscuit ' Cat Hobbs , from the Campaign for Better Transport , claimed the £ 1,000 journey showed " just how pricey and complicated the fare structure is " .
And while regulated fares will actually fall slightly from January because of retail price deflation , she said she feared train companies would raise their unregulated fares to make up for the drop in their income .
" We think the government should step in and review how they regulate fares , " she said .
" The government should not let the train companies take all the flak for this .
It 's up to the government to change the system . "
Farepayers have become all too used to appalling value for money
Stephen Hammond , shadow rail minister Lib Dem transport spokesman Norman Baker said high fares were encouraging people to abandon the trains in favour of their cars .
And he added : " When you can fly halfway across Europe for £ 30 , the idea that you can end up paying £ 1,000 for a train journey in Britain is absolutely scandalous . "
Shadow rail minister Stephen Hammond said : " Due to Labour 's micromanagement of the railway , farepayers have become all too used to appalling value for money .
" Today 's revelation of a £ 1,000 fare really takes the biscuit . "

The Humbling by Philip Roth ( Jonathan Cape , £ 12.99 )
Philip Roth , The Humbling
" He had let Pegeen appoint herself ringmaster and would not participate until summoned .
He would watch without interfering .
First Pegeen stepped into the contraption , adjusted and secured the leather straps , and affixed the dildo so that it jutted straight out .
Then she crouched above Tracy , brushing Tracy 's lips and nipples with her mouth and fondling her breasts , and then she slid down a ways and gently penetrated Tracy with the dildo .
Pegeen did not have to force her open .
She did not have to say a word – he imagined that if either one of them did begin to speak , it would be in a language unrecognizable to him .
The green cock plunged in and out of the abundant naked body sprawled beneath it , slow at first , then faster and harder , then harder still , and all of Tracy 's curves and hollows moved in unison with it .
This was not soft porn .
This was no longer two unclothed women caressing and kissing on a bed .
There was something primitive about it now , this woman - on - woman violence , as though , in the room filled with shadows , Pegeen were a magical composite of shaman , acrobat , and animal .
It was as if she were wearing a mask on her genitals , a weird totem mask , that made her into what she was not and was not supposed to be .
She could as well have been a crow or a coyote , while simultaneously Pegeen Mike .
There was something dangerous about it .
His heart thumped with excitement – the god Pan looking on from a distance with his spying , lascivious gaze .
" It was English that Pegeen spoke when she looked over from where she was , now resting on her back beside Tracy , combing the little black cat - o'- nine - tails through Tracy 's long hair , and , with that kid - like smile that showed her two front teeth , said to him softly , " Your turn .
Defile her . "
She took Tracy by one shoulder , whispered " Time to change masters , " and gently rolled the stranger 's large , warm body toward his .
" Three children got together , " he said , " and decided to put on a play , " whereupon his performance began . "
The Infinities by John Banville ( Picador , £ 14.99 )
John Banville , The Infinities
" Alba has stepped out of her dress in one flowing , stylised movement , like a torero , the object of all eyes , trailing his cape in the dust before the baffled bull ; underneath , she is naked .
She looks to the side , downwards ; her eyelids are so shinily pale and fine that Adam can see clearly all the tiny veins in them , blue as lapis .
He takes a floating step forward until his chest is barely touching the tips of her nipples , behind which he senses all the gravid tremulousness of her breasts .
She puts her hands flat against his chest and leans into him in a simulacrum of a swoon , making a mewling sound .
Her hips are goosefleshed and he can feel all the tiny hairs erect on her forearms .
When he kisses her hot , soft mouth , which is bruised a little at one corner , he knows at once that she has been with another man , and recently – faint as it is there is no mistaking that tang of fish - slime and sawdust – for he has no doubt that this is the mouth of a busy working girl .
He does not mind .
" They conduct there , on that white bed , under the rubied iron cross , a fair imitation of a passionate dalliance , a repeated toing and froing on the edge of a precipice beyond which can be glimpsed a dark - green distance in a reeking mist and something shining out at them , a pulsing point of light , peremptory and intense .
His heart rattles in its cage , a vein beats at his temple like a slow tom - tom .
When they are spent at last , and that beacon in the jungle has been turned low again , they lie together contentedly in a tangle of arms and legs and talk of this and that , in their own languages , each understanding hardly a word of what the other says . "
Rhyming Life and Death by Amos Oz ( Chatto & Windus , £ 12.99 )
" Almost in an instant his desire rises to a level where the pressure to reach a climax stalls and gives way to a sort of sensitive physical alertness , pleased with its own sexual generosity , that gets a kick out of giving her thrill after thrill and postponing his own satisfaction , feeling to see how he can give her more and more pleasure , until she can not take any more .
And so , in complete self - denial – in every sense – with his fingers , now experienced and even inspired , he starts to steer her enjoyment like a ship towards its home port , to the deepest anchorage , right to the core of her pleasure .
" Attentive to the very faintest of signals , like some piece of sonar equipment that can detect sounds in the deep imperceptible to the human ear , he registers the flow of tiny moans that rise from inside her as he continues to excite her , receiving and unconsciously classifying the fine nuances that differentiate one moan from another , in his skin rather than in his ears he feels the minute variations in her breathing , he feels the ripples in her skin , as though he has been transformed into a delicate seismograph that intercepts and instantly deciphers her body 's reactions , translating what he has discovered into skilful , precise navigation , anticipating and cautiously avoiding every sandbank , steering clear of each underwater reef , smoothing any roughness except that slow roughness that comes and goes and comes and turns and goes and comes and strokes and goes and makes her whole body quiver .
Meanwhile her moaning has turned into little sobs and sighs and cries of surprise , and suddenly his lips tell him that her cheeks are covered in tears .
Every sound , every breath or shudder , every wave passing over her skin , helps his fingers on their artful way to steer her home . "
The Naked Name of Love by Sanjida O'Connell ( John Murray , £ 12.99 )
Sanjida O'Connell , The Naked Name of Love
" This time her body felt real to him , not fragments from a dream , or a surreal hallucination , but there was a certain clumsiness , an awkwardness on his part as if it were the first time for him now that he was bereft of the herb that made him feel how she felt .
They were not in tune and it was as if he were splashing about helplessly on the shore of some great ocean , waiting for a current , or the right swimming stroke to sweep him effortlessly out to sea .
He felt they were lacking some vital ingredient ; she was only partly engaged , the building explosion of sensation that had made her unfurl like a flower , a morning glory greeting the sun , was missing .
He stopped .
" What is it ? she asked .
" You , he said .
I 've lost you , he whispered .
" She smiled , wide - eyed , lithe as a cat , she twisted her body , took his hand and showed him what to do ; he felt her breath hot against his throat , her pulse quicken , limbs grow taut .
He was hanging in deep green water , waves breaking against him , the clean sweep of the shore attainable in a few slow strokes . "
A Dead Hand : A Crime in Calcutta by Paul Theroux ( Hamish Hamilton , £ 18.99 )
Paul Theroux , A Dead Hand : A Crime in Calcutta
" ' Baby . '
She took my head in both hands and guided it downward , between her fragrant thighs .
' Yoni puja – pray , pray at my portal . '
" She was holding my head , murmuring ' Pray , ' and I did so , beseeching her with my mouth and tongue , my licking a primitive form of language in a simple prayer .
It had always worked before , a language she had taught me herself , the warm muffled tongue . "
The Death of Bunny Munro by Nick Cave ( Canongate , £ 16.99 )
Nick Cave , The Death of Bunny Munro
" He slips his hands under her cotton vest and her body spasms and slackens and he cups her small , cold breasts in his hands and feels the hard pearls of her nipples , like tiny secrets , against the barked palms of his hands .
He feels the gradual winding down of her dying heart and can see a bluish tinge blossoming on the skin of her skull through her thin , ironed hair .
" ' Oh , my dear Avril , ' he says .
" He puts his hands under her knees and manoeuvres her carefully so that her bottom rests on the edge of the settee .
He slips his fingers underneath the worn elastic of her panties that are strung across the points of her hips , slips them to her ankles and softly draws apart her knees and feels again a watery ardour in his eyes as he negotiates a button and a zipper .
It is exactly as he imagined it – the hair , the lips , the hole – and he slips his hands under her wasted buttocks and enters her like a fucking pile driver . "
The Kindly Ones by Jonathan Littell ( Chatto & Windus , £ 20 )
" Una had stretched out on the bed of the guillotine ; I lifted the lunette , made her put her head through it , and closed it on her long neck , after carefully lifting her heavy hair .
She was panting .
I tied her hands behind her back with my belt , then raised her skirt .
I did n't even bother to lower her panties , just pushed the lace to one side and spread her buttocks with both hands : in the slit , nestling in hair , her anus gently contracted .
I spit on it .
' No , ' she protested .
I took out my penis , lay on top of her , and thrust it in .
She gave a long stifled cry .
I was crushing her with all my weight ; because of the awkward position – my trousers were hindering my legs – I could only move in little jerks .
Leaning over the lunette , my own neck beneath the blade , I whispered to her : ' I 'm going to pull the lever , I 'm going to let the blade drop . '
She begged me : ' Please , fuck my pussy . ' – ' No . '
I came suddenly , a jolt that emptied my head like a spoon scraping the inside of a soft - boiled egg .
The Rescue Man by Anthony Quinn ( Jonathan Cape , £ 12.99 )
Anthony Quinn , The Rescue Man
" ' What are you thinking ? '
" 'I 'm thinking … of all the things I 'd like to do to you . '
" Pressing her down so that she lay lengthways on the sofa , he unbuttoned her coat , but did n't remove it .
He felt her body 's warmth through the layers of clothes ; slowly , he unbuttoned the woollen cardigan she was wearing ; he kissed her stomach through the silk blouse underneath , and the sweet embroidered vest beneath that .
Then he pushed these back too so that he could taste the pale skin , and felt her trembling against his mouth .
His hands caressed the sharp jut of her hip bones , and fingered the buttons at the side of her skirt which he anticipated trouble with , unless …
He had the sensation of journeying through veils , of a headlong descent towards disclosure , and the prospect of pausing to fiddle with more buttons was not to be borne .
Her breathing had become shallower , and her face was turned distractedly to one side .
His head had drawn level with her lap , and as he lifted up her skirt he recalled an image of Bella at Slater Street casually flipping back the dark hood from her camera and removing the plate .
Feeling the snaps and entanglements of her underclothes as a delay to his progress , he placed a kiss , quite reverently , on the ivory - coloured sheath of her pants ; through the material he traced smooth skin , then the wiry tussock below .
The thin silk felt like water purling through his fingers .
His hands squirmed beneath the cool curve of her buttocks and stroked the dimple at the base of her spine .
Then he dipped his head lower until his mouth grazed the tip of the inverted white triangle that ended between her legs ; he brought a hand around and , parting her legs slightly wider , allowed his finger to draw back the pouched silk .
It felt to him as if he were tending a delicate weeping wound , and as he probed it with his tongue he heard her moan quietly .
Excited by the oysterish intricacy of her he sucked and licked the salty folds until they became sweet , and slowly she arched her back to heighten the angle of provocation .
As her gasps grew more urgent he glanced upwards and saw her face almost angrily flushed and straining , his mouth now breathing in the wetness of her until , with an agonised cry , she stiffened and shuddered down the length of her torso . "
Love Begins in Winter by Simon Van Booy ( Beautiful Books , £ 7.99 )
Simon van Booy , Love Begins in Winter
" My mouth lingered on hers ; I tasted her .
I felt for her tongue with mine .
I felt the blood surging through my body .
We pressed against one another .
" Impossibly close .
" She gripped my arms .
Her nails tore into me .
Soon we both were burning .
" Sweat pooled in the ridge of my back as I moved like a tide determined to crash against those ancient rocks .
" Then – a moment before – inside , I kept very still .
Our bodies moved of their own accord .
Hannah 's body was swallowing , digesting all that was mine to give .
For those final moments , we existed seamlessly – all memory negated by a desire that both belonged to us and controlled us .
After , we kept very still , like the only two roots of the forest . "
Ten Storey Love Song by Richard Milward ( Faber & Faber , £ 10.99 )
" Let 's have sex , they think simultaneously , couples having strange mind - reading powers after months and months of trying to figure each other out .
Panting , Georgie starts rubbing her hands round Bobby 's biological erogenous zones , turning his trousers into a tent with lots of rude organs camping underneath .
Bobby sucks all the freckles and moles off her chest , pulling the GD bib wheeeeeeeeeee over her head and flicking Georgie 's turquoise bra off her shoulders then kissing her tits , and he's got so much energy – plus he 's very impatient – Bobby tugs off his sweaty sweater himself and gives Georgie a helping hand with his zip .
Then comes the enormous anticipation of someone putting their mitts on your cock and balls .
Georgie smiles to herself and keeps him hanging on for a bit , which in a way is even better though it makes the Artist want to explode and after one or two tugs he moans ' whoah ' then screams ' whoah ! ' and Georgie lets go giggling , then suddenly her face is all serious and Bobby pulls her polished pine legs apart and slithers a hand up her skirt where her fanny 's got a bit of five o'clock shadow like a pin cushion but her lips are nice and slippy , and he slides some lubricunt round and round , mixing clockwise with anticlockwise with figure 8 until Georgie 's shagging the air with pleasure bashing her feet about .
Then , Bobby starts scrabbling frantically across the carpet for Mr Condom , sending five or six multicolour Durexes flying through the air , and he struggles getting the packet open and Georgie has to roll Mr Condom down Mr Penis for him and she has to help insert him into Mrs Vagina . "

Comments on Go Here are my preliminary thoughts on the Go programming language .
The most interesting feature for me personally is the built - in threading .
Aside from its superb support for multi-core , it 's just plain a good set of ways of doing networking .
The lack of a decent built - in networking library ( and generally coordination library ) in Python has been a thorn in my side just about forever .
In particular the promotion of queues to being one of the few built - in primitives with their own special syntax encourages good threading practice and is clearly warranted .
Even such a simple command as ' wait until either the UI thread or the networking thread comes up with something ' is a source of ongoing pain in most languages , but is built into Go as a core concept using select .
Go seems to finally get the static typing problem solved .
Its := operator is a reasonable middle point between C++'s ludicrous verbosity and ML 's excessive magic .
Types being structural is also a huge win .
There 's no end of stupid architectural haggling over what module a base type sits in and who owns it , and the answer ' nowhere ' completely gets rid of that problem .
It seems to me that there are deep subtle problems with such declarations - for example , how does it statically check that the parameters accepted by methods of a type you 're receiving are compatible with what you want to pass them ?
But maybe I just have n't thought about it enough .
It 's too bad that Go does n't currently have generics .
I for one wo n't start any new project in it until it reaches that level of maturity .
Go 's lack of exception handling is a real problem , and another thing I 'm blocking on to do real development in it .
My own preferred method for adding it would be that if you call a function which has multiple return values and you do n't handle one of them , it defaults to shorting to the same return of the caller , although some people might complain about that being too much like Java 's ' throws ' .
That said , I 've gotten so used to debugging by stack trace that I 'd be loathe to not have stack building built into the language in some form , and in fact I 've gotten really attached to a tricked out logging tool I wrote which can decorate any object and automatically logs a full stack trace of every assignment which is made to the object and allows you to print them all out at once .
But perhaps such trickery is really the domain of highly dynamic languages , and not appropriate for something as low level and performance oriented as Go .
The primitives in Go are quite good .
All languages should have special maps and lists built in .
I think it actually does n't go far enough with giving them special status , and should have Python - style special syntax for maps .
The curly brackets could be freed up by simply eliminating their current usage and making formatting have syntax .
It 's more than a little bit absurd that the language designers themselves have a setup where a utility standardizes the formatting of their own code every time they commit , but they still maintain the nominal free - form nature of the language .
Really guys , I know you were traumatized by Fortran 's original awful enforced formatting , but that was a long time ago and it 's time to let go .
That said , the primitives are given too much special status in other ways - they 're the only things which have type parameterization , making it impossible to even implement their interfaces yourself , and worse , they 're the only things which are call by reference .
The call by reference thing worries me a lot .
I really , really do n't want Go to become the reference / pointer mix hell which C++ has become , but it 's already headed in that direction .
It really should n't matter that much - things which are passed are either an address or a copy , and the reference / pointer distinction really just has to do with what 's the default ( okay , so typically references do n't let you overwrite either , but that 's not a fundamental property ) .
I for one strongly prefer the default be an address , and clearly when push comes to shove Go 's designers do too , but more important than which way it is is that it should be consistent .
Already transitioning to something consistent might require rewriting huge amounts of code , and it 's getting worse , so fixing this problem might have to happen soon or never , and I 'm afraid that it might already be never .
Go 's speed of compilation is very nice , although I 'm afraid I view that not so much as a strength of Go but as an awfulness of C ++.
Why C++ continues to take forever to compile even on machines many orders of magnitude faster than the first ones I ever used it on has long been a mystery to me .
I hope the answer is simply that it 's a language which was n't designed with ease of parsing in mind , and has a whole layer of preprocessing on top of it which is horribly abused .
It 's interesting that Go is going the garbage - collected route .
If such a low - level language as Go can get away with that ( and , truth be known , their preferred garbage collector is n't really integrated yet , so it 's a little early to call it ) then we may never see another non-garbage - collected language ever again .
I despise the use of initial capital letters to specify that something is public .
Maybe if I used it for a while I 'd learn to not hate it , but for now I hate it .
Does chinese even have uppercase ?
It 's entirely possible that after using
Go for a while something else would really start to gnaw at me about it , but it generally has a good smell , so hopefully not .

toddmarshall what does
Go compile into byte codes or machine code ?
You 're complaining about C++ taking time to compile and link ?
That 's hard to believe .
It 's all file processing ( and re processing and linking ) so use ' precompiled headers ' and a fast disk .
It does alot of optimization AND compile time correctness checking to get to machine code .
Also , was n't it Dijkstra who said you should n't even need a debugger , you should write your code such that it 's obvious what the bug is when it runs .
A good goal if nearly impossible in practice .
like attaining infinity , always worthwhile the effort .

misterajc Didn't Dijkstra suggest in " A Discipline of Programming " that each program should come with a mathematical proof of it's correctness so that it was by definition bug free ?
Of course , one would need a meta proof ( or at least publication in a peer reviewed journal ) to prove the correctness of the proof .
One of my standard interview questions is , " What is your approach to debugging ? "
I 'm expecting something like , " First I reproduce the problem in a test environment , and then I run the debugger or add debugging code to identify the exact place where the error is introduced . "
Extra points if the person says , " First I log it in a bug tracking system . "
No points at all if the candidates claims to write bug free code .

darius Agreed about initial capitals .
Oberon did it by prepending a * to the name in the declaration instead .
Not sure what you mean by ML 's excessive magic .
Is n't := just like let in ML , except for meaning an assignment instead of a new binding if there happens to be one in scope already for the same variable -- which is more magic than ' let ' ?
( I wonder if := might need the value restriction like ' let ' does since
Go has a few parameterized types built in .
I have n't really looked into Go yet . )
I guess you just mean they do n't also have type inference for func definitions -- fair enough .

The reason that C++ takes so long to compile is because it allows you to instantiate classes on the stack ( as against instantiating a mere pointer to the class ) - the size of the class must be known at compile time , so you must give the compiler the classes ' definition , as well as any class definitions on which the class is dependent on in turn , and so on .
C++ programmers endevaour to minimise compilation dependencies , by the use of declarations when a full definition is unneeded ( such as when you just have a pointer to the class , or are just passing it as a parameter to a function that is defined elsewhere ) .
There is actually an idiom called " pimpl " or " chesire cat " which entails creating a facade , forwarding class that just has the public interface of the implementation , to which it is the only client - this is something I 'd only use in extreme cases though .
Slow compile times are a weakness of C++ , to be sure .
Have you developed in C++ ( as against just compiling a C++ program ) ?
Typically , you have a debug build without compiler optimisations , which tends to speed things up considerably , especially if you 're using GCC .
I do n't know about Chinese , but Hebrew does n't have uppercase or lowercase .
I 'm not sure why the whole reference / pointer thing causes confusion / annoyance ; references are just safer alternatives to pointers , in that they must be initialised ( cannot be NULL or wild ) , and cannot change that which they refer to - they 're an " alternative name " for the variable , not a distinct thing - they have the same memory address as the original , referenced variable ( at least ostensibly ) .
They exist to facilitate easy passing by reference to functions ( no need to use pointer semantics ) , and to faciliate operator overloading ( no need to de-reference a pointer returned by an operator , defeating the point of overloading - exploiting client 's intuition about what the operator ought to mean ) .
