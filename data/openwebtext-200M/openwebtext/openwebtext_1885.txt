Although by then the universe will be mostly dark energy , Dr. Krauss said , it will be undetectable unless astronomers want to follow the course of the occasional star that gets thrown out of the galaxy and is caught up in the dark cosmic current .
But it would have to be followed for 10 billion years , he said — an experiment the National Science Foundation would be unlikely to finance .
“ This is even weirder , ” Dr. Krauss said .
“ Five billion years ago dark energy was unobservable ; 100 billion years from now it will become invisible again . ”
It turns out that you do n’t actually need dark energy to be this pessimistic about the future , as Dr. Krauss and Dr. Scherrer point out .
In 1987 , George Ellis , a mathematician and astronomer at the University of Cape Town , in South Africa , and Tony Rothman , currently lecturing at Princeton , wrote a paper showing how even ordinary expansion would gradually carry most galaxies too far away to be seen , setting the stage for cosmic ignorance .
Dark energy speeds up the picture , Dr. Ellis said in an e-mail message , adding that he was glad to see the new paper , which adds many astrophysical details .
“ It ’s an interesting gloss on the far future , ” he said .
James Peebles , a Princeton cosmologist , said there were more pressing worries .
We might be headed toward a universe that is “ asymptotically empty , ” he said , “ But I have the uneasy feeling that the U.S.A. is headed into asymptotic futility well before that . ”
You might object that the inhabitants of the far future will be far more advanced than we are .
Maybe they will be able to detect dark energy — or the extra dimensions of string theory , for that matter — in the laboratory .
Maybe they will even be us , in some form or other , if the human race manages to get out of the solar system before the Sun blows up in five billion years .
But if relativity is right , they wo n’t be able to build telescopes that can see past the edge of the universe .
It ’s not too late to start thinking about sending out the robot probes that could drift down through alien skies eons from now with , if not us or our DNA , at least a few nuggets of wisdom — that the world is made of atoms and that it started with a bang .
In Sebastian Thrun ’s vision of the future , freeways will be blissful havens from the everyday stresses of life .
We will unwind during swift , smooth commutes free of aggressive lane changes , defensive brake - tapping and road rage .
The SigAlert will be a distant memory .
What will make this utopian autobahn possible ?
Robots .
Robots do n’t get mad ; they do n’t flip you the bird ; they do n’t cut you off out of spite ; and they definitely do n’t crash into one another .
At least they ’re not supposed to .
“ There is no other way out of the current disaster that happens on U.S. highways , ” says Thrun , an associate professor of computer science and electrical engineering at Stanford University and leader of the Stanford Racing Team .
“ There are so many aspects of society you could change if you just make cars drive themselves . ”
A robotic automotive vehicle -- which , Thrun says , would “ combine the convenience of a train with the convenience of a car ” -- is a long way from commercial viability .
But the Stanford Racing Team will put a driverless Volkswagen Passat wagon named Junior to the test in November in the 2007 Urban Challenge , sponsored by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the Pentagon ’s research arm .

Junior ’s predecessor , a modified VW Touareg sport utility vehicle called Stanley , won the 2005 Grand Challenge race in the Nevada desert .
This year , Junior and 52 competitors must master far more than pure speed .
The Urban Challenge will be a 60 - mile test of city driving , replete with intersections , rights - of - way , stop signs , lane changes and that most annoying variable : traffic .
Thrun and Mike Montemerlo , a senior researcher at the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Lab , have equipped Junior ( dubbed so in honor of Leland Stanford Jr. , for whom the university is named ) with an array of sensors , global positioning system devices , video cameras and laser range finders .
These will tell the car where it is in relation to other cars , curbs and the myriad dangers that lurk in metropolitan streets .
State - of - the - art computers embedded in the rear of the wagon will use this information to instantaneously command Junior to brake , throttle , shift or turn .

At stake is more than the $ 2 million in prize money .
The defense agency says its goal is to encourage “ the development of robotic - vehicle technology that will someday save the lives of American men and women on the battlefield . ”
But civilian researchers see unlimited applications in everyday life .
“ This is the point in time where cars are really ready to become robotic , ” says Montemerlo , who unveiled Junior this year with Thrun at the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science meeting in San Francisco .
“ We ’re excited about the potential this might have for reducing the number of fatalities on the road .
We ’re adding more drivers all the time but we ’re not adding new highways . ”
Advertisement
Montemerlo and Thrun foresee high - occupancy vehicle lanes and eventually entire highways filled bumper - to - bumper with fast - moving robotic cars carrying commuters reading e-mails and newspapers , working on their laptops or snoozing .
The driver / passenger would have the option of sliding behind the wheel after exiting the robot - only zone .
The main problem with today ’s highways and byways is n’t that they are overcrowded , the Stanford engineers say , but that they ’re not properly utilized .
While some are blighted with clogged knots of cars lunging in spurts , others are totally empty .
The U.S. “ has paved an amazing amount of surface and is not operating it very efficiently , ” Thrun says .
By some estimates , only 8 % of the U.S. highway surface is used at peak hours , he says .
“ What has n’t been done is to make cars drive closer together in a safe way .
It is absolutely feasible . ”

Story Highlights • High Court considers students '
First Amendment rights
• Case involves student 's " Bong hits 4 Jesus " banner at event
• School argues principal had right to punish student for drug message
• Student , now 24 , said he was not promoting drugs
Adjust font size :
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The Supreme Court ruled against a former high school student Monday in the " Bong Hits 4 Jesus " banner case -- a split decision that limits students ' free speech rights .
Joseph Frederick was 18 when he unveiled the 14 - foot paper sign on a public sidewalk outside his Juneau , Alaska , high school in 2002 .
Principal Deborah Morse confiscated it and suspended Frederick .
He sued , taking his case all the way to the nation 's highest court .
The justices ruled that Frederick 's free speech rights were not violated by his suspension over what the majority 's written opinion called a " sophomoric " banner .
( Watch the banner unfurl and launch a legal battle )
" It was reasonable for ( the principal ) to conclude that the banner promoted illegal drug use -- and that failing to act would send a powerful message to the students in her charge , " Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the court 's 6 - 3 majority .
Breyer noted separately he would give Morse qualified immunity from the lawsuit , but did not sign onto the majority 's broader free speech limits on students .
( Opinion )
Roberts added that while the court has limited student free speech rights in the past , young people do not give up all their First Amendment rights when they enter a school .
Roberts was supported by Justices Antonin Scalia , Anthony Kennedy , Clarence Thomas , Stephen Breyer , and Samuel Alito .
Breyer noted separately he would give Morse qualified immunity from the lawsuit , but did not sign onto the majority 's broader free speech limits on students .
In dissent , Justice John Paul Stevens said , " This case began with a silly nonsensical banner , ( and ) ends with the court inventing out of whole cloth a special First Amendment rule permitting the censorship of any student speech that mentions drugs , so long as someone could perceive that speech to contain a latent pro-drug message . "
He was backed by Justices David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg .
At issue was the discretion schools should be allowed to limit messages that appear to advocate illegal drug use .
" Bong , " as noted in the appeal filed with the justices , " is a slang term for drug paraphernalia . "
The incident occurred in January 2002 just outside school grounds when the Olympic torch relay was moving through the Alaska capital on its way to the Salt Lake City , Utah , Winter Games .
Though he was standing on a public sidewalk , the school argued Frederick was part of a school - sanctioned event , because students were let out of classes and accompanied by their teachers .
Morse ordered the senior to take down the sign , but he refused .
That led to a 10 - day suspension for violating a school policy on promoting illegal drug use .
Frederick filed suit , saying his First Amendment rights were infringed .
A federal appeals court in San Francisco agreed , concluding the school could not show Frederick had disrupted the school 's educational mission by showing a banner off campus .
Former independent counsel Kenneth Starr argued for the principal that a school " must be able to fashion its educational mission " without undue hindsight from the courts .
Morse , who attended arguments in March , told CNN at the time : " I was empowered to enforce the school board 's written policies at that time aimed at keeping illegal substances out of the school environment . "
As for Frederick , he is halfway across the globe , teaching English to students in China .
Now 24 , he told reporters in March that he displayed the banner in a deliberate attempt to provoke a response from principal Morse , by whom he had been disciplined previously .
But Frederick claimed his message of free speech is very important to him , even if the wording of the infamous banner itself was not .
" I find it absurdly funny , " he said .
" I was not promoting drugs .
... I assumed most people would take it as a joke . "
Our editors have compiled a list of seven iPod accessories you ca n’t buy , or at least anytime soon .
If we happened to miss any , please leave us a comment .
“ Continue reading ” for the entire list .
i Pod Nano MAME Cabinet
Scott , creator of the original iPod Nano MAME Cabinet , has followed up on that device with a Ms. Pac Man version , complete with artwork .
A mysterious geek known only as “ Scott ” has created a meticulously wee foamboard Ms. Pacman cabinet to house his MAME - enabled iPod Nano .

Bulletproof iPod Case
A Japanese modder created this custom 5 mm Aluminum A5052 shell for his iPod — which can stop a 0.22 bullet — to prevent it from being crushed by the handrail on those busy subway trains .
The two halves of the case are held together with chunky M3 hex bolts .
You ’d certainly need some muscle to carry it : at 446 gram , it is 2.5 times the weight of a new iPod Photo

The iBrella
The iBrella is “ is a special umbrella that acts as an iPod interface . ”
Actually , you can ‘ emulate ’ all iPod commands solely by physical interactions with the iBrella e.g. opening and closing the iBrella refers to starting and pausing the iPod .
Furthermore , you can select a random song by wildly shaking the iBrella in the air .
Mode switching for different control modes is done by simply ’ stabbing ’ the iBrella in the air

iCapOpener
Sergio Trujillo designed this interesting “ iCapOpener ” accessory for the iPod Shuffle .
It basically slips right onto one end of the player and acts as a bottle opener — great for parties .
We praise him for the time it took to make this movie , but the practicality of the thing leaves something to be desired .
Plus , we think the iPod Shuffle is getting replaced by a lower - end iPod Nano come WWDC anyway

The iPod iPod Dock
Andrew Monks has created a strange iPod dock made from a 3rd- generation player .
Unfortunately , no other information was provided on how to build your own .
More pictures here .
… tearing open his existing iPod dock , jamming it through the top end of his 3G iPod ( which we really hope was n’t still functional ) , pushing it through a slot he fashioned in the glass of his defunct screen …

i Pod DJ Mixer
So you ’ve seen the Numark iDJ2 , now check out this custom built “ iPod DJ Mixer ” .
The click wheel is smaller than a 12 - inch analog .
Actions on discs are almost same , but the size makes a big difference on usability .
To be an iPod DJ , you gotta think about a new interactive controller to operate the players — combining the iPod ’s interface as a module for a new DJ system .

Windows Vista gets criticized a lot in the press , mostly for not being OS X .
Some of the criticisms are valid .
It is terribly late .
And the feature list has grown less and less impressive as the development process has worn on over the years .
But Vista has one killer feature up its sleeve .
A feature that , as far as I 'm concerned , makes it a must - have upgrade on day one of availability .
Vista 's Start Menu lets you type what you want instead of pointing at it .
Here 's what happens when I press the Windows key , then type " studio " .
As I type , Vista 's start menu displays real time , full - text search matches across multiple locations : the start menu , my user folder , my favorites and browser history , my email history , and so on .
I had ways of doing this in Windows XP , but with Vista , typing to navigate is now quite literally the cornerstone of the operating system .
I 've gone from tedious , manually defined hotkeys and shortcuts in Windows XP to simply typing what I want and letting the computer find it for me .
It also utterly obsoletes the Start , Run ( or Windows + R ) menu because it works for file paths , too :
Best of all , I never have to take my hand off the keyboard .
The first match is always selected ; I can press Enter to launch it immediately .
Alternately , I could use the up and down arrows to highlight the item I want , and press Enter to launch that .
Or I could continue typing to further refine my match in real time .
The start menu has been a usability trainwreck since its introduction in 1995 .
I had no idea Microsoft would so completely and thoroughly reinvent the Start Menu in Vista .
It has completely changed the way I work with my computer .
And it 's standard out of the box .
There 's nothing to install , nothing to configure , nothing to think about .
It just works .
Like so :
To launch Notepad
Windows key , type " not " , then Enter .
Windows key , type " not " , then Enter .
To set my Mouse options
Windows key , type " mou " , then Enter .
Windows key , type " mou " , then Enter .
To launch Word
Windows key , type " word " , down arrow , then Enter .
( unfortunately , WordPad is still the first match ) .
Windows key , type " word " , down arrow , then Enter .
( unfortunately , WordPad is still the first match ) .
To navigate to my WinAmp folder
Windows key , type " c:p " , down arrow , type " w " , down arrow , Enter .
Windows key , type " c:p " , down arrow , type " w " , down arrow , Enter .
To set the date and time
Windows key , type " dat " , then Enter .
Windows key , type " dat " , then Enter .
To play Rainbow 6 : Vegas
Windows key , type " veg " , then Enter .
Windows key , type " veg " , then Enter .
To visit codinghorror.com
Windows key , type " cod " , then Enter .
This new all - in - one keyboard style of navigation is unbelievably , amazingly efficient .
It is by far the single best new feature of Vista in my book .
I cannot , I will not , go back to Windows XP , with its horrific mouse - centric cascading start menu , and the utilitarian but unhelpful Windows + R Start Run dialog .
Ironically , Microsoft 's revamped Start Menu may be the final sign that we 've fully entered the Google era of computing .
As Bill de hra noted :
Perhaps the hunt and peck approach of searching is becoming the dominant computing metaphor , replacing nearly 3 decades of user interfaces based on the metaphor of an office desktop .
No more hunting for the right bunch of pixels to click ; it 's faster and easier to type to get to what you want instead .
It 's a tacit acknowledgement that Google was right all along .
It 's not quite a command line renaissance , but it is an implied victory of textual search over traditional point - and - click desktop GUI metaphors .
Typing trumps pointing .
There 's far too much content in the world -- and even on your local computer -- for browsing and pointing to work reliably as a navigation scheme today .
Keyboard , text and search are the new bedrock navigation schemes for the 21st century .

Winnyの通信を特定する方法には，「流れるパケットのパターン（トラフィック・パターン）を調べる方法」と，「パケットの中身を調べてWinnyのパケットであることを確認する方法」の2通りがある。前者は，直接中身のデータをのぞいているわけではないため，通信の秘密を守るという大前提があるプロバイダがWinnyを規制する際に使っている。しかし，Winnyの通信を確実に特定するなら，後者の方法がベストである。実際にWinnyの通信を解読できるのか，Winny作者の金子勇氏の著書『Winnyの技術』やインターネットで得られた情報などを参考に挑戦してみた。
Winny（ウイニー）同士の通信はすべて暗号化されている。このため，流れるパケットをのぞいても，内容がどんなものなのかだけでなく，Winnyの通信なのかどうかも，ひと目ではわからない。Winnyが採用している暗号アルゴリズムRC4は，Webアクセスや無線LANの暗号化でも使われているように，正しく使えば簡単には解読できない。
ただし ，Winnyは不特定多数の相手と共通鍵暗号を使って通信するので，通信を始める前に暗号鍵を直接やりとりするか，事前に暗号鍵をソフトに組み込んでおく必要がある。このため，パケットをキャプチャしたり，クライアント・ソフトを解析すれば暗号鍵を探し出して通信データの内容を解読できるはずだ。そこで，実際に簡単なツールを使ってWinny通信の解読に挑んだ。
■準備編 解読に必要なツールは，
（1）パケット・キャプチャ・ツール，（2）RC4の暗号化/復号ソフト，（3）16進数-ASCII文字列変換ツール，（4）バイナリ・エディタ，（5）電卓ソフト，（6）テキスト・エディタだ（図1）。いずれもフリーソフトとしてインターネットからダウンロードできる。意外と簡単に手に入るソフトばかりである。
ツールをそろえたら，自分のパソコンにパケット・キャプチャ・ツールとWinnyをインストールする（図2）。Winnyは最新バージョンであるWinny2.0b7.1を使った。
図 2 Winny通信の解読に使った実験環境
自分から相手へ接続するときのパケットを解析
図 3 パケットをキャプチャしてみると ...
[ 画面クリックで拡大表 示 ]
図2のように環境も整えたところで，自分のパソコン上のパケット・キャプチャ・ツールを起動してから，Winnyを実行する。そうすると，実行されたWinnyは外部のWinnyパソコン（相手ノード）へ接続しようとして，いくつかのパケットを送出する。このパケットをその前に起動しておいたパケット・キャプチャ・ツールで捕捉して内容を解析したわけだ。
パケットをキャプチャした結果を見ると，最初にTCPの3WAYハンドシェーク（キーワード解説）のパケットがやりとりされているのがわかる（図3）。Winnyは通信プロトコルに必ずTCPを使うが，TCPでは最初に通信相手と接続する（TCPコネクションを確立する）ために3WAYハンドシェークという手順を踏む。そしてTCPコネクションが確立したあと，Winnyの実際の通信が始まる。
Winny通信の始まりでは，接続元（自ノード）が最初に決まった形式のパケット2個を相手ノードに必ず送る。第1パケットは長さが11バイトのデータが入っていて，暗号鍵のやりとりとバージョン確認に使われている。そして第2パケットで，リンクの種類や自分のノード・タイプ，待ち受けポート番号などの情報を伝えるコマンドが送られる。
では，これら2個のパケットの内容を解読していこう。これらの内容が解読できれば，そのあとのWinnyパケットも同じ要領で解読できる。

Appearing via video link from Baghdad yesterday , Ryan Crocker , the U.S. Ambassador to Iraq , provided testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee amidst eroding support for the war among the committee ’s Republican members .
Chuck Hagel ( R - NE ) has long been a critic of the Bush administration ’s handling of Iraq , but in recent months he has been joined by Norm Coleman ( R - MN ) and John Sununu ( R- NH ) , who are facing tough reelection races in 2008 .
The latest GOP defectors are two of the Senate ’s most influential Republicans , George Voinovich ( R - OH ) and Dick Lugar ( R - IN ) , the committee ’s ranking member .
It was Lugar who pointedly asked Crocker if there is currently any preparation for “ Plan B , ” the Republicans ’ euphemism for withdrawal .
Lugar added that such preparation will prove vital if the decision to withdraw is made , and that he suspects high - level figures in the Bush administration have been stymieing efforts to plan for this outcome .
Crocker gave no indication that any serious consideration is being given to a withdrawal strategy , saying , “ My whole focus is involved in the implementation of ‘ Plan A . ' ”
Voinovich told Crocker that disengagement is “ inevitable . ”
“ We must start to face reality … .
Our commitment is not open - ended . ”
While Crocker may have seemed a likely target for the ire of war - weary members of Congress , it was the administration ’s policy , not Crocker himself , that came under attack .
A former envoy to Afghanistan and Pakistan who has a reputation as a straight - shooter , Crocker recently sent a memo to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice complaining that the Baghdad embassy he oversees is not receiving top - notch talent .
The very public missive was an embarrassment for the administration and made clear Crocker is more than a White House mouthpiece .
Still , when Crocker was called to testify on the political progress made by the Iraqi government , on the heels of a recent National Security Council report noting a lack of progress in this department , Crocker responded by downplaying the importance of the benchmarks for progress set out by Congress .
“ The longer I am here , the more I am persuaded that progress in Iraq cannot be analyzed solely in terms of these discrete , precisely defined benchmarks , ” he said .
“ These benchmarks do not serve as reliable measures of everything that is important — Iraqi attitudes toward each other and their willingness to work toward political reconciliation . ”
Perhaps it was a ploy to lower expectations —
Senator John Kerry accused him of “ moving the goalposts ” — but if so , it is Crocker ’s ploy alone .
The White House in recent days has reaffirmed the importance of benchmarks .
While criticizing the benchmarks , Crocker could point to little that would serve as a better measure of progress .
In a TV appearance from Iraq a week earlier , Crocker said that electricity was probably more important to everyday Iraqis than “ all 18 benchmarks rolled up into one . ”
The comment came back to haunt him yesterday .
Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) pointed out that electricity output is actually below 2006 levels , and that citizens of Baghdad sometimes only have an hour or two of electricity a day .
Senator Joe Biden , chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations committee , added that if political reconciliation were achieved , sectarian operatives would stop blowing up the power grids .
Crocker did argue yesterday that there were signs of progress in Iraq , though his examples were weak .
He noted , for example , that the president of Iraq , a Kurd , is holding meetings with the prime minister of Iraq , a Shiite .
This failed to impress the assembled senators .
Crocker also said that Iraqi citizens generally have a positive feeling about the country ’s security forces , a claim that is widely contradicted in the media and by experts on Iraq .
Still , he was candid about the deteriorating security situation : “ If there is one word , I would use to sum up the atmosphere in Iraq — on the streets , in the countryside , in the neighborhoods , and at the national level , ” he said , “ that word would be ‘ fear ’ . ”

I passed this on to a friend who edits scientific articles , and this is her response :
Q : How many copyeditors does is take to screw in a lightbulb ?
A : That sentence is n't clear .
Does it mean to have sex in a lightbulb , or to place a lightbulb in its socket ?
Please clarify .
Suggest :
(1) Sentence as written is ambiguous .
Does it mean to have sexual intercourse inside of a lightbulb ( in which case , pls clarify size of bulb ) , or to place a lightbulb in its socket ?
(2) The phrase " does it take " is messy .
The anticipatory pronoun has no reference .
Who or what is doing the taking ?
Pls recast .
(3) The term " copy editor " is a not complex noun , and thus has no excuse for being set as a single word .
It is an adjective ( copy ) and a noun ( editor ) .
A dress the color of mammalian blood is not a " reddress " ; it is a " red dress . "
Note also that , when set as two words , " copy editor " does not take a hyphen , unless the phrase is being used as a complex ( non-predicate ) adjective , as , for example , " a copy - editor hissy fit . "
(4) There is an obvious typographical error .
Suggest you proofread manuscripts before submitting them as final .

Hi all ,
When considering on - line , community - published Linux newsletters what comes to my mind is , of course , The Linux Gazette .
http://linuxgazette.net/index.html
Several of the Gazette 's authors are local to Silicon Valley and also members of SVLUG .
But the Gazette 's contributors and readers are from all over our globe .
Collaboration with the Gazette might be useful to all and there is a existing body of knowledge in the Gazette about how to produce newsletters .
They are an excellent outfit .

Some patent absurdities
Kapil Hari Paranjape [ kapil at imsc.res.in ]
Hello ,
One friend ( Rahul Basu ) forwarded a link to the Alcatel - Lucent MP3 patent story and I found a blog that seems to have figured out whats going on : http://www.edn.com/blog/1690000169/post/1200007120.html
Now it 's clear to most of us that software patents are absurd and this story is a consequence of that absurdity .
... but ( in the USA ) you seem to have got an ever expanding patent regime .
Another friend ( Rahul Siddharthan ) forwarded this blog :

Today the USA , tomorrow the rest of the world . [*]
Einstein in the patent office was not a mistake .
We will need Einsteins in the patent office soon .
Q : Do you think Bekham and Roberto Carlos can patent their free - kick techniques ?
They do make money based on these techniques and they can probably teach these techniques to others ( for a fee ! ) .
Regards ,
Kapil .

For example , there have been repeated attempts to change the patent law in India at the behest of the multi-national pharma companies .

I 'm breaking out in bikes all over these days .
Here 's my newest toy :
http://okopnik.freeshell.org/img/1995_GSX750F.jpg
( Mine does n't have all the graphics , but everything else including the color is right . )
Yep , I 've sold the Triumph - too much of a cruiser for my blood , and [ cough ] I can only stand so much British engineering .
Seriously - when the manual starts out with cleaning instructions , and has lots of BOLD letters and exclamation points telling you how crucial that part is and how it must be done every single time ... well , that 's the very definition of " not a bike for the Benster " .
[ shrug ]
I made money in trading in my old bike , I made more in selling this one , and I got a damn good deal on the new one .
And I got to play with a bike that was completely different from anything I 've had before .
I call that a win all around .
I rode the Katana home today and got off with a huge smile .
Hellllo , higher insurance premiums ...

In an interesting bit of synchronicity , I got one of those emails that Kapil was talking about - no spam content , just ... stuff .
This one , however , seems to have hit it's mark ( Mike Orr would be choking from laughter by now . )
The subject , in Russian , means " ALL for the purchase of penguins " - and the content is just " penguin " .
Silly spammers ... why would we want to buy one after they 've already sent us a perfectly good one ???

Need to sort ?
SortedTable allows you to make any valid table a sortable one .
Tables can be sorted automatically or manually by moving rows .
Instructions
To start using SortedTable all you need is :
have a valid XHTML document ,
document , have a valid table * in this document
download the following javascripts to a folder on your server : Event.js and SortedTable.js
add a class= " sorted " to the table
include the javascripts in the html ( < script type = " text / javascript " src= " Event.js " ></ script > and < script type =" text / javascript " src=" SortedTable.js " ></ script >)
add the following code to the html < script type = " text / javascript " > onload = function ( ) {var myTable = new SortedTable ( ) ;}</ script >
if you 're using XML Data Islands add class regroup ( you should have class= " sorted regroup " )
This is not the only thing you can do to use this code .
If you 're an advanced JavaScript developer the following examples might give you some more ideas .
Since SortedTable does all it's operations on live DOM lists you can do anything with the tables and it should not break ( as many other widgets do ) .
* You need to learn about cell attributes headers ( they need to match the header cell ids ) and axis ( to set the compare methods ) .
Examples

In my experience , dired is one of the most underused modes of Emacs .
Just C - xC -f to any directory in your hard disk and you ’ll be presented with a list of its files and directories .
One can browse this list , and execute all kinds of commands and transformations on them .
If you ’ve never done that before , just give it a try , and look at the menubar for a list of nifty things you can do inside dired .
There ’re several ways to mark files and operate on them afterwards : for instance , just type A to find inside the selected files any regexp , or Q to search and substitute .
One of my favorites dired functionalities is wdired - change - to - wdired - mode .
When you invoke this interactive function ( using M- x wdired - change - to - wdired - mode ) , the dired buffer becomes editable .
That is , you can go around and edit directly the filenames as you would edit any other emacs text buffer .
And that means you have all the regular editing commands at your disposal .
For instance , if i enter wdired - mode in my emacs configuration directory :
and want to change the name of all those jao -*.el files to , say , jao - config -*.el , all i have to do is to search and replace as i would do in any other text file ( i.e. , using M - % ) .
Or maybe put the cursor on the first file name , mark ( C - SPC ) , got to the end of the jao - files list , put my cursor after the last dash ( as shown in the figure ) , and use C-xrt to replace the text in the marked rectangle .
When you ’re happy editing the buffer , just press C - cC-c and all your changes will be reflected in the underlying files .
Nifty .
But there is so much distrust of the United States at the bank that some saw these and other comments as a feint designed to keep Mr. Wolfowitz in office .
“ The odds of this flying are very , very low , ” said a senior bank official , speaking anonymously about sensitive internal discussions .
“ It is too little , too late .
It might have been possible a day or two ago , but not after he was found guilty as charged of a whole slew of violations . ”
A senior European official , speaking anonymously , said European and Canadian ministries found the American approach outlined in the conference call to be a tough sell .
“ The general view from capitals , with the exception of the Japanese , ” he said , “ is that it is impossible to disentangle the charges of misconduct and corruption from the credibility of the bank , which is going around the world lecturing countries not to engage in misconduct and corruption . ”
Nevertheless , the administration held out some hope this evening that it could get its point of view across .
There was a fear , some administration officials said , that the two - track approach would entail a long investigative process examining Mr. Wolfowitz ’s leadership abilities , when in fact such an inquiry could be finished quickly .
It appeared that the best the administration could hope for was the possibility of President Bush appealing personally to Prime Minister Tony Blair , with whom he is scheduled to meet at the White House on Wednesday , and other elected leaders .
A factor that kept emotions high was today ’s disclosure of documents that seemed to buttress the bank committee ’s conclusion that Mr. Wolfowitz had tried to keep the pay and promotion arrangement for Ms. Riza a secret .

Делаем ... блинчики
Существует способ отпраздновать Масленицу , пусть не совсем легально , но хотя бы относительно безопасно для себя .
Нам понадобится уединенное место , немного времени и небольшая предварительная подготовка .
Носить с собой блинную муку или тесто - глупейшая ошибка .
Мука должна быть обыкновенной , легально приобретённой .
Нелишним будет иметь при себе кассовый чек , особенно если вы неопытны и выдаёте себя поведением .
Воду , молоко , соль , сахар и яйца нужно носить скрытно , не на виду и обязательно прятать в разных местах на теле .
Никому не придёт в голову подозревать вас , если у вас в кармане обычный сахар , а за ухом одноразовый шприц с молоком , улавливаете идею ?
Где взять чистую ёмкость ?
Проявите смекалку !
Обычное зеркало , протёртое лосьоном или вымытое с мылом годится для теста , если делать его правильно .
А вот догадаться , что у вас с собой миниатюрный аналог миски или кастрюли никто не сможет , умишка не хватит .
Чтобы ингредиенты не утекли , вначале делаем мучную горку или пирамидку .
Не пользуйтесь ложкой , она понадобится для другой цели !
Об этом - чуть позже .
Уголком кредитной или дисконтной карточки делаем углубление для жидкостей .
Многие делают это неправильно .
Если вам скажут , что такова традиция - гоните горе - знатока прочь .
Не исключено , что перед вами наркоман или какой - нибудь извращенец .
Соль и сахар мы насыпали рядом с мукой , это сделано исключительно ради наглядности , для демонстрации пропорций .
Вода ...
...и молоко добавляются в равных долях .
Кокосовое молоко использовать не стоит , несмотря на его доступность и длительный срок хранения .
Растительное масло , и мы снова промахнулись ради наглядности .
Не пользуйтесь маслами сомнительного качества , особенно синтетическим и касторовым .
У нас на носу Масленица , а не финансовый кризис !
Теперь понимаете , чем хороша пластиковая карточка ?
Она не размокнет и не сломается в самый ответственный момент .
Яйцо разбивать не нужно !
Сделайте аккуратный прокол в скорлупе .
Через него не выльется ничего лишнего , проверьте сами .
Маленькие яйца , это для нас не недостаток , а большое удобство .
Мы же не собираемся накормить целую толпу ?
Помните , мы упоминали чистую ложку ?
Та-да-а!
А вот и сковорода !
Непохоже ?
Очень хорошо , что непохоже .
Если бы мы отмеряли ей муку и мешали тесто , сейчас стало бы полным - полно дыма от подгоревшей на дне грязи .
Перевернуть блинчик можно иглой или зубочисткой .
Можете подбросить и поймать ложкой , рискуя утопить своё творение в унитазе , кто рискует - пусть отправляется пить свое шампанское , а мы будем праздновать !
С Масленицей , друзья !

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - Alex Gaffikin was just 22 when she boarded a ship destined for the Halley research station on the Brunt Ice Shelf in Antarctica .

“ In the depths of winter waking up was a struggle .
With 24 hours of darkness my body clock had gone haywire and I ’d usually wake up feeling quite lethargic , ” she said .
As part of an experiment , she sat in front of a bright light for half an hour every morning which was designed to affect her melatonin levels and make her feel more awake .
Next up , a shower , which Gaffikin soon learned was far from a luxury .
“ I ’d probably been on the research station a matter of minutes before the plumber Cuz warned me against long ‘ Hollywood showers ’ .
The usual procedure was tap on , tap off , soap up , rinse off .
He was right because later on I ’d join a team to dig ice for over half an hour to melt down for water . ”
Staff at the base all fix their own breakfast .
The person on night shift usually makes fresh bread , but when Gaffikin worked nights she made doughnuts , “ which made me megapopular , ” she said .
Gaffikin ’s official job was as a meteorologist .
“ A typical day would start with me putting on my doo suit which is like being swaddled in a duvet and trudging across the snow to the meteorology building .
My first task would be the nine o’clock weather observation and I would continue doing them every three hours until three in the afternoon , ” she said .
Her favorite job was launching the weather balloon .
“ I ’d fill a large balloon full of helium and then release it .
Sometimes it was quite a battle against the wind to get it out of the shed .
But once it was up I ’d track it up into the sky as it measured temperature , wind and pressure . ”
The average temperature in winter is about minus 35 Celsius , but the coldest day Gaffikin remembers was minus 53 degrees .
She said the chef was the most popular person on the base as food is so important in the cold .
Though the station ’s chef does have to get inventive with rations of dried meat and vegetables , Gaffikin said it is weird eating lunch while it ’s pitch black outside .
Boredom is kept at bay with a range of extra-curricular activities .
“ Monday evenings we listened to audio books in the library , Tuesdays I taught Spanish , Wednesdays was video nights .
In the depths of winter there ’s not a lot to do so we all got inventive .
“ I used to spend my evenings knitting presents or making cards .
My favorite fancy - dress party was the beach party .
Matt came in his waterproofs because , as he bemoaned , it would always rain when he went to the seaside , ” she said .
Often , scientists and explorers at the research base went to sleep exhausted , but Gaffikin said there are certain things worth getting up for .
“ Sometimes the person on the night shift would wake us at two in the morning .
This was a magical moment .
We ’d wrap up warm , grab our cameras and head outside to see the aurora .
The Southern Lights are amazing but eerie .
White , green and orange lights would flicker across the sky .
And with no light pollution the Milky Way was stretched out in a white band . ”
When Gaffikin came back from Antarctica she realized that the thing she loved most was telling other people about the continent .
Her dream is to open an Antarctica Museum .
“ I love Antarctica because it is such an alien and magical place .
You can see things in Antarctica that you ca n’t see anywhere else like emperor penguin colonies , enormous glaciers and gigantic sea creatures , ” she said .
Currently working on Ice Station Antarctica -- a new exhibition at London ’s Natural History Museum -- she is concerned about the future of her second home .
“ I am worried that Antarctica will be harmed by the effects of climate change and over - fishing .
I hope that visitors will grow to love Antarctica as much as I do .
I hope they will be inspired to help minimize human impact so that Antarctica is n’t lost forever , ” she said .
Via Daily Caller :
Donors have raised over $ 500,000 on a Christian fundraising website for Kyle Rittenhouse who was arrested and charged with killing two rioters and injuring one during unrest in Kenosha , Wisconsin in late August .
The webpage , called GiveSendGo , has collected over $ 526,000 at the time of publishing with nearly 12,400 individual donations to support the 17 - year - old ’s legal defense .
The page surpassed its $ 500,000 goal on Monday , according to the New York Post .
“ Kyle Rittenhouse just defended himself from a brutal attack by multiple members of the far - leftist group ANTIFA – the experience was undoubtedly a brutal one , as he was forced to take two lives to defend his own , ” the fundraiser ’s description says .

Four years ago this week , as American troops made their first , triumphant entrance into Baghdad , joyous Iraqis pulled down a giant statue of Saddam Hussein .
It was powerful symbolism — a murderous dictator toppled , Baghdadis taking to the streets without fear , American soldiers hailed as liberators .
After four years of occupation , untold numbers killed by death squads and suicide bombers , and searing experiences like Abu Ghraib , few Iraqis still look on American soldiers as liberators .
Instead , thousands marked this week ’s anniversary by burning American flags and marching through the streets of Najaf chanting , “ Death to America . ”
Once again , tens of thousands of American troops are pouring into Baghdad .
Yesterday the Pentagon announced that battle - weary Army units in Iraq would have to stay on for an additional three months past their scheduled return dates .
Mr. Bush is desperately gambling that by stretching the Army to the absolute limits of its deployable strength , he may be able to impose some relative calm in the capital .
And he seems to imagine that should that gamble succeed , the Shiite - dominated government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al - Maliki will , without any serious pressure from Washington , take the steps toward sharing political power and economic resources it has tenaciously resisted since the day it took office a year ago .

He saunters out onstage , and the first thing you think is , man , Steve Jobs looks old .
The second thing you think is , no , not old :
He finally looks his age .
Well into his forties , Jobs appeared to have pulled off some kind of unholy Dorian Gray maneuver .
But now , at 52 , his hair is seriously thinning , his frame frail - seeming , his gait halting and labored .
His striking facial features — the aquiline nose , the razor - gash dimples — are speckled with ash - gray stubble .
A caricaturist would draw him as a hybrid of Andre Agassi and Salman Rushdie .
The senescence on display is jarring , but it ’s also fitting .
After three decades as Silicon Valley ’s regnant enfant terrible , Jobs has suddenly , improbably , morphed into its presiding éminence grise .
The stage in question is at the Four Seasons in Carlsbad , California , where Jobs has come this afternoon in May for The Wall Street Journal conference “ D : All Things Digital . ”
Dressed in his customary uniform — black mock turtleneck , faded 501s , running shoes — Jobs sits across from Journal technology columnist Walt Mossberg , who commences with a simple question : Having recently changed its named from Apple Computer to Apple Inc. , exactly what business is the company in ?
“ We ’ll very shortly be in three businesses and a hobby , ” Jobs replies , projecting the mildest affect he can muster — yet still the crowd is goggle - eyed , as if Bono were in the house .
The cliché of Jobs as rock star is , of course , hoary to the point of enfeeblement .
From the start of his career — which is to say , for his entire adult life — he has radiated a mesmeric presence , his “ reality - distortion field . ”
But as Jobs makes clear today , Apple ’s reality is no longer in need of much distortion .
On the back of the first two businesses he names , the Mac and the iPod - iTunes tandem , Apple racked up $ 21.6 billion in sales in the last twelve months , and $ 2.8 billion in profits .
Its stock price has doubled in the past year ; last month , AAPL was named to the S&P 100 , making it a bona fide blue chip .
With what Jobs dubs a “ hobby , ” Apple TV , the company has invaded the sanctum sanctorum of living - room entertainment .
Then there ’s that third , impending business , which revolves around a gorgeous sliver of palmtop gee - whizzery that you may have heard about : the iPhone .
Ten years ago , when Jobs retook the reins at Apple , the suggestion that the company would be where it is today would have seemed a fantasy — or a joke .
Apple was bleeding cash , bleeding talent , bleeding credibility .
Its laptops were literally bursting into flames .
Its war with Microsoft had devolved into a self - lacerating pathology .
Today the Mac is , albeit slowly , gaining ground on Windows .
And the iPod , which in less than six years has sold north of 100 million units , has Microsoft choking on its dust .
Mossberg notes this astonishing achievement and inquires of Jobs how many copies of iTunes software are in circulation .
At least 300 million , Jobs answers , prompting Mossberg to follow up : “ Does the scale of this surprise you ? ”
Nodding sagely , Jobs responds , “ The scale of a lot of things we ’re doing surprises me . ”
The Steve Jobs story is one of the classic narratives — maybe the classic narrative — of American business life .
Its structure has been rigorous , traditional , and symmetrical : three acts of ten years each .
Act One ( 1975 –1985 ) is “ The Rise , ” in which Jobs goes into business with his pal , Steve Wozniak ; starts Apple in his parents ’
Silicon Valley garage ; essentially invents the personal - computer industry with the Apple II ; takes Apple public , making himself a multimillionaire at age 25 ; and changes the face of technology with the Macintosh .
Act Two ( 1985 –1996 ) is “ The Fall ” : the expulsion from Apple , the wilderness years battling depression and struggling to keep afloat two floundering new businesses , NeXT and Pixar .
Act Three ( 1997 –2007 ) is “ The Resurrection ” : the return to Apple and its restoration , the efflorescence of Pixar and its sale to Disney , the megabillionairehood , the sanctification as god of design and seer of the digital - media future .
The consistent thread running through all three acts is Jobs ’s singular persona .
His messianism has been present from the start : “ He always believed , ” says Wozniak , “ he was going to be a leader of mankind . ”
Yet the most common descriptor applied to him , by friends and foes and even Jobs himself , is “ asshole . ”
( Running neck - and - neck for second are “ genius ” and “ sociopath . ” )
His abrasiveness is legendary and omnidirectional .
Asked by a writer from Wired , “ If you could go back and give advice to your 25 - year - old self , what would you say ? , ” Jobs erupted , “ Not to deal with stupid interviews — I have no time for this philosophical bullshit ! ”
Given an early glimpse of the Segway high - tech people - mover , he bellowed , “ I think it sucks , ” then later called the company ’s founder , trashed his CEO as a “ butthead , ” and said his marketing chief “ should be selling Kleenex at a discount store in Idaho . ”
Implored by the government to take part in the federal antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft , he snapped at the United States assistant attorney general , Joel Klein , “ Are you going to do something serious ?
Or is it going to be dickless ? ”

And yet the respect accorded Jobs is nearly universal .
The employees he ’s flagrantly abused later concede that he inspired their best work .
The fellow bigwigs he ’s derided later admit that he was right .
His obnoxiousness , Robert Metcalfe , the founder of 3Com , has said , “ comes from his high standards …
He has no patience with people who do n’t either share those standards or perform to them . ”
What ’s maddening about his mammoth self - regard is that , all too often in Acts One , Two , and Three , it has been justified .
Now , however , Jobs is departing from classical structure and undertaking an Act Four .
With the iPhone , in particular , he is hurling Apple into foreign waters .
His motivations for doing so are n’t difficult to discern .
Somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion cell phones are sold worldwide every year ; in terms of scale , ubiquity , and relevance , it ’s the mother of all consumer - electronics markets .
The chance to upend this sprawling industry , bend it to his will , is one that Jobs , being Jobs , finds irresistible .
Apple ’s competitors , by contrast , find the prospect of the iPhone terrifying .
“ The entire fucking Western world hopes that it ’s a case of imperial overstretch , ” says the CEO of one of the planet ’s largest communications companies .
“ But everybody is quietly saying , er , what if people want to buy a $ 500 phone ?
What if , er , people have been waiting for a device that does all these things ?
What if this thing works as advertised ?
I mean , my God , what then ? ”
The emerging consensus , in fact , is that the incumbents ’ dread is warranted .
That Jobs is about to do it again — to unleash another object of overwhelming , consciousness - drenching , culture - shifting desire .
That Apple ’s past is merely preface to a period of increasing and metastasizing dominance .
But what if that consensus is wrong ?
What if Jobs and Apple have peaked ?
What if , in terms of power and influence , it ’s all downhill from here ?
These suggestions might seem incredible , but half a century of high - tech history indicates otherwise .
What that history imparts is that it ’s precisely when the mighty seem invincible that their humbling is close at hand .
For proof , just ask the folks at Sony .
Or ask Bill Gates .
Or , for that matter , ask Jobs himself — although his memory , at this moment , may be a bit cloudy on the subject .
Ten years ago , on an August morning in 1997 , I boarded a plane in San Francisco for Boston , where , at the summer MacWorld trade show , Jobs would make it apparent that he was , in effect , running Apple again .
I was doing a piece about him and had been laboring mightily , futilely , for weeks to get him to agree to see me .
I trundled onto the plane , took my seat , and , whoa , discovered Jobs sitting directly in front of me — being interviewed for six hours straight by a journalist for Time .
When the plane touched down at Logan , I introduced myself and asked if he might have time to chat in the next few days .
Jobs : “ Sorry , man , I ’m not doing any press right now . ”
I do n’t imagine he much cared for the story that I eventually produced , not because it was especially harsh toward him — it was n’t — but because of its pessimistic view of his prospects for rescuing Apple .
“ Years of gross mismanagement , infighting , and mounting losses have gone a long way toward erasing what was left of the Apple myth , ” I opined .
“ In all probability , Apple is destined to become , at best , a break - even company . ”
This view , it should be noted , was far from unique , even among Jobs ’s admirers .
Jean - Louis Gassée , a raffish Frenchman whom Jobs had enticed to Apple and who rose to be its chief of product development , informed me that Jobs was “ the most powerful person I ’ve ever met .
The word charisma — in the true , Greek sense — applies .
He has the power to open up your chest and put his fingers inside you . ”
( Gassée also related a story about going shopping with Jobs years earlier at Hermès in Paris for a gift for Brooke Shields : “ He asked if I could tell him how to keep his hair from falling out . ” )
But when I pressed Gassée on whether he believed that Jobs could save Apple , he answered glumly , “ No . ”
With the benefit of hindsight , it ’s clear that the mistake we skeptics made was n’t overestimating the depths of Apple ’s problems ; Jobs told friends the company was 90 days away from bankruptcy .
Our error was underestimating him .
But it ’s worth pointing out that Jobs ’s genius , his handle on the warp and weft of American consumer culture , had n’t been much in evidence the previous ten years .
His post - Apple computer venture , NeXT , had built a high - end machine , the design of which was pure Jobs : a stone - smooth ebony cube .
But the NeXT box was astronomically expensive and sold in numbers so small they could be tallied on an abacus .
( I exaggerate , but only slightly . )

The truth is , we were right to doubt him .
The truth is , he was lost .
With NeXT , Jobs was extending a stiff middle finger to his myriad critics .
They said that he was just a salesman , a slick - talking marketeer — so the NeXT cube would be the most technically advanced computer anyone had ever seen .
The critics said that Jobs ’s pride , the Mac , had n’t conquered the world because big business rejected it — so NeXT would target corporations .
He abandoned his consumer instincts in favor of a strategy that amounted to , I ’ll show you .
Recipe for disaster .
But in coming back to Apple , Jobs also returned to his instincts .
The first thing he did was launch the Think Different ad campaign , featuring an array of iconic faces : John Lennon , Gandhi , Picasso , Muhammad Ali .
The campaign was infinitely narcissistic — the main criterion for the selection of the subjects was that they were Jobs ’s heroes — but no less brilliant for it .
And , in orchestrating this marketing blitz , Jobs displayed a degree of chutzpa that was astonishing even by his standards .
One night at a fund - raising dinner for Bill Clinton in San Francisco in 1997 , I was told by an attendee , Jobs pulled the president aside and asked him for a favor : Would Clinton phone his friend Tom Hanks to persuade him to do voice - overs for the ads ?
( That Richard Dreyfuss ended up with the gig suggests that Clinton , this once , exercised a modicum of judgment . )
But Jobs ’s instincts extended far beyond the realm of marketing .
His penchant for simplicity caused him immediately to pare down Apple ’s product offerings — the roster of which had swollen to include nearly a dozen computers , plus such devices as the handheld Newton .
“ I met with him shortly after he came back , and he went to the white board and said , ‘ Look , our company ’s too complicated , ’ ” recalls Sky Dayton , the founder of EarthLink .
“ He said , ‘ We ’re going to do just four things , ’ and then he drew this grid : laptop , desktop , consumer , business .
That was it .
And I was , like , ‘ Beautiful ! ’ ”
When Jobs prepared to launch the first iMac , he was confronted by underlings who told him he was crazy :
Every shred of market research had concluded that consumers would n’t buy an all - in - one computer .
Jobs shot back , “ I know what I want , and I know what they want . ”
He was right about that , and also in his hunch that , for a growing number of customers , computers that looked as if they ’d been hatched with MoMA in mind would be a tantalizing prospect .
With the rise of the Web , the computer revolution was , for the first time , becoming genuinely personal .
No longer were people using their machines just for serious stuff — documents , spreadsheets .
They were using them for purposes that were purely recreational .
E-mailing .
IM -ing .
Downloading purloined music .
Devouring online porn .
And once the PC entered the realm of fun , it became a province of fashion .
The Mac ’s survival depended on more than design and innovation , however .
It required something counterinstinctual from Jobs : the putting of old enmities aside .
The most glaring example of his corporate statesmanship was the peace pact he signed with Microsoft , but equally important was the mending of fences with microprocessor giant Intel .
The embitterment here ran back to a meeting between Jobs and Intel ’s Andy Grove in 1977 .
In a negotiation , Jobs demanded that Grove give Apple , then just one year old , the same price that Intel reserved for its largest customers .
Grove indignantly refused .
“ I thought they were going to be a niche player — I was condescending to him , ” Grove tells me .
“ From then on , in his view , Intel was a piece of shit and nothing we did could change his mind . ”
Until 2005 , that is — when Apple announced that henceforth all of its computers would run on Intel chips .
Today , Mac sales are growing three times faster than the PC market as a whole , a spurt that Jobs puts down primarily to Apple ’s switch to Intel .
That a dispute so petty , so personal , could fester inside of Jobs ’s head for nearly 30 years says a great deal about him .
But that he finally let it go says something , too .
The nascent rejuvenation of the Mac naturally brings joy to the hearts of Apple cultists ( of which , let me state for the record , I am one ) .
But any cultist claiming that the Mac ’s revival is what ’s behind the stratospheric ascent of Jobs and the company must be on drugs .
The rocket fuel propelling that development has plainly been the iPod .
Launched in October 2001 , the iPod was obviously , from the get - go , a wicked piece of gear .
At the launch at Apple ’s headquarters in Cupertino , California — for which the invitations teased “ Hint : It ’s not a Mac ” — Jobs deployed his best P.T. Barnum juju .
“ This amazing little device holds a thousand songs and fits in my pocket , ” he said .
“ This is a major , major breakthrough . ”
Not everyone was so wowed .
In the wake of the collapse of the tech bubble and 9/11 , the economy was reeling .
Every prior digital - music player — and there had been a bunch — had been pathetic .
Apple ’s previous dabblings with diminutive devices had all been flops .
Expressing a view held by many industry pontificators , an analyst at Technology Business Research declared , “ What kind of money is to be made in these products ? …
[ R ] ight now it ’s a tricky time to be introducing new hardware . ”
Even inside Apple , the initial hopes for the iPod were modest .
It was conceived as simply another part of the company ’s “ digital hub ” initiative : an assortment of features ( iMovie , iDVD , iPhoto , etc. ) intended to make the Mac as mediacentric as possible .
At the launch , Jobs touted the iPod ’s functionality as a spare disk drive .
The notion that it would transform Apple from an also - ran computer outfit into a consumer - electronics powerhouse never occurred to anyone .
That “ anyone ” included Jobs was clear from one decision : his refusal , at first , to make the iPod compatible with Windows - based PCs .
By doing so , Jobs was limiting its potential market to 15 million Mac owners — and blowing off the 500 million–strong PC universe .
According to Steven Levy , author of the iPod history The Perfect Thing , some members of the iPod team disagreed .
But when they argued the point , Jobs exploded .
“ I remember that day , ” an Apple executive told Levy .
“ He said , ‘ I ’m never taking this to the PC ! ’ ”
But as the iPod attained escape velocity , Jobs relented ; by mid-2002 , it could be coupled with Windows .
The about - face signaled not only that Jobs grokked its implications for Apple ’s business .
It hinted that his ambitions were in flower — that he saw an opportunity to reshape the entire music business .
Since the advent of the pioneering start - up Napster , the record industry had been waging a fierce rearguard action against the burgeoning file - sharing insurrection .
But Jobs , with his cred in Hollywood , thanks to Pixar , believed he could bring the record labels around to online music sales .
He approached them one by one , shucking , jiving , promising that Apple would implement technology — digital - rights management ( DRM ) software — restricting the ability to copy tracks willy - nilly .
But the resistance of the labels was intense .
“ They were concerned about letting tracks out into the wild based on their experience with peer - to - peer [ file - sharing ] , ” explains Alan McGlade , CEO of the online software firm MusicNet .
“ It took them a while to get over it . ”
But get over it they did — in no small part , ironically , because of Apple ’s piddling computer - market share .
“ We only convinced them to let us do it on the Mac at first , ” Jobs told Levy .
“ We said , ‘ Well , if , you know , if the virus gets out , it ’s only going to pollute 5 percent of the garden . ’ ”
The iTunes music store went live in April 2003 , hawking 200,000 tracks for 99 cents apiece .
Six months later , Jobs persuaded the labels to let him sell songs to Windows - connected iPods .
The labels were jubilant that people were actually paying for music on the Web .
Sweeter still , they were getting two thirds of the revenues from every iTunes download .
The iTunes store has now sold over 2.5 billion songs — and directly contributed next to nothing to Apple ’s bottom line .
But Jobs never intended to make a bundle by retailing music .
The purpose of the iTunes store was strictly to sell more iPods .
To that end , the DRM on iTunes songs keeps them from being played on any rival music devices , such as Microsoft ’s Zune or Sony ’s digital Walkman .
And tracks downloaded from rival services such as Rhapsody or Sony Connect cannot be played on iPods .
Jobs is unrepentant .
“ If you look at the total number of iPods we ’ve sold and you look at the total number of songs we ’ve sold on iTunes , it ’s less than 25 per iPod , ” Jobs argued at the D conference .
“ And the average iPod user has hundreds of songs on their iPod .
So they ’re clearly not getting the majority of their songs from iTunes ; it turns out they ’re not even getting a medium - sized minority from iTunes .
And so this whole notion that somehow … iTunes is locking people into buying iPods is ridiculous . ”
Is it ridiculous ?
Certainly , Jobs is correct when he says that the reason people buy the iPod is that it ’s the best portable music player out there .
But the link between the iPod and iTunes is also a barrier to entry for competitors .
It ’s designed to limit consumer choice , to foster reluctance among consumers who own iTunes tracks to switch to other devices .
It has prompted complaints by European governments to the European Commission — which so far have come to naught .
More broadly , though , the resentment over the DRM on iTunes is only growing .
In certain quarters of the music industry , Apple is coming to be seen less as an enabler than a gatekeeper .
And among some consumers , including this one , the fact that iTunes tracks can be copied to only a limited number of computers , and are of sub - CD quality , is a deal killer .
Together with myriad other factors , some economic and some technological , these cavils are stirring up a second online music revolution — one portending nothing good for iTunes or the iPod .
‘ Apple turned the tide , ” Shawn Fanning was saying as we consumed a copious lunch at my favorite taqueria in Austin , Texas .
This was two years ago , at the South by Southwest music festival , where I ’d come to talk to Fanning , the renegade progenitor of Napster , about his next venture , a start - up called Snocap .
“ What Jobs showed the labels was that people were willing to pay for music , even though they could get it other places for free .
It changed the environment from where the industry was hostile to where people saw the opportunity . ”
Fanning leaned backed and adjusted his Red Sox cap .
“ But the music business does n’t want just one or two retailers to control the entire market .
And the à la carte , 99 - cent model is n’t the only way to go . ”
Two years later , Snocap is handling the technology for one of the key players in the online music world : MySpace , the social - networking colossus owned by Rupert Murdoch ’s News Corp .
The system the companies have concocted allows bands to sell their music directly from MySpace pages .
Unlike with iTunes , the songs are sold at whatever price the bands decide .
And they ’re delivered in the MP3 format , which has no DRM , letting consumers stick them on any music player , including the iPod .
MySpace and Snocap are not alone .
Last month , Amazon.com announced it would , at long last , dive into music retailing and open up a download store by the end of the year that will offer DRM - free MP3s .
At the outset , the Amazon storefront will be stocked only with tracks from independent labels and one major , EMI .
But the widespread expectation is that other majors will soon hop on the bandwagon .
Universal , for one , is already experimenting with unprotected files in Europe .
And the company is reportedly talking with Google about a deal to sell MP3s .
Any movement this conspicuous would never escape Jobs ’s attention .
Seeing a parade about to pass him by , he raced out it front of it and promptly declared himself grand marshal — first penning an open letter to the music industry calling for an end to DRM and then , last month , launching a DRM - free service called iTunes Plus , selling unprotected tracks for $ 1.29 each .
But DRM - free is only one cannon shot in a fusillade of digital - music developments .
There ’s the proliferation of Internet - based subscription services such as Rhapsody , Yahoo Music , and the reincarnated Napster , all of which let users stream millions of songs for a monthly fee .
( They can download , too , just not to iPods . )
Then there ’s the wave of music - discovery Websites , including Pandora ( personalized Internet radio ) , the Hype Machine ( music - blog search and listening ) , and Last.fm ( social networking ) , which was just purchased by CBS for $ 280 million .
“ All this stuff is Apple ’s blind spot , ” says Fred Wilson , the New York venture capitalist and rabid music buff .
“ Right now , the download model is necessary because I want to take music in the car or to the gym .
But once we have true mobile broadband , the streaming model is going to take off .
Then there ’s never really going to be a need to own files at all .
It ’ll all just be there in the cloud . ”
As for music discovery , Wilson says , “ I ’ve never found one single artist or song on iTunes …
It ’s an online version of Tower Records , only worse . ”
MusicNet ’s McGlade , whose products compete with iTunes , agrees .
“ The issue with download purchases is that every time you want to hear a track , you ’ve got to make a buying decision , ” he says .
“ I gotta tell you , once you put people on a subscription service , they ca n’t go back . ”
What does all this mean for iTunes ?
The impending end of its hegemony .
The success of iTunes has been built on being a stupid - simple , aesthetically pleasing way to buy music online — and the carefully cultivated perception that it ’s unique in providing that experience .
But iTunes is rapidly being eclipsed , rendered ordinary , even antediluvian .
As Martin Stiksel , a founder of Last.fm , told me last month in London , “ Apple served their purpose already .
They validated the space .
Thank you very much , Steve , for that , but now we do n’t really need you anymore . ”
The ramifications for the iPod are less dire , but still grim .
In a world of abundant , unprotected MP3s , in which the leverage from iTunes is diminishing , the iPod is likely to confront a more competitive landscape .
“ They ’ll still be the biggest fish in the pond , but their margins will get squeezed , ” says a Silicon Valley pooh - bah who counts Jobs as a friend .
“ It ’s Economics 101 : When there are no barriers to entry , prices fall to equilibrium .
But that level wo n’t be interesting to Steve .
MP3 players will be like CD players — cheap commodities . ”
This person adds , “ I think that we passed the high - water mark for iPod profitability about six months ago .
I do n’t see it going anywhere but down .
All of which is why the iPhone is so important for Apple . ”
It took half an hour , no more than that , after Jobs unveiled his gleaming new toy for the bloggers to dub it the Jesus Phone .
Here was the gizmo we ’d all been pining for lo these many years : a music player , camera , e-mail tool , Web browser , and cell phone , all rolled into one impossibly seductive package .
After watching Jobs enact the ta - da moment with typical brio —
“ I did n’t sleep a wink last night ” — even cynical observers were smitten .
“ What a weird fucking day Tuesday was , ” Josh Quittner , the editor of Business 2.0 , remarked .
“ It was as if we were all participating in a shared consensual hallucination …
All these supposedly hard - bitten tech reporters wandering around like they were getting laid for the first time . ”
The panting over the Jesus Phone must have satisfied Jobs no end : Every product he crafts he regards as a sacred object , the primary aspiration of which is to incite naked lust .
And in the months since then , the breathing has only gotten heavier .
At the launch , the sales goals Jobs set forth were demure : 1 percent of the world market , about 10 million units , by the end of 2008 .
But industry analysts are less bashful .
Piper Jaffray ’s Gene Munster forecasts sales of 15.6 million units in that time — and 45 million in 2009 .
“ Apple has been so good at executing these different multimedia elements with the Mac and iPod that they might be able to take over with their phone , ” says a London - based telecom investor .
“ Nokia and the rest of those guys are absolutely shitting themselves . ”
Jobs has done little to dampen either the giddiness or the panic .
“ It ’s the best iPod we ’ve ever made , ” he says of the iPhone .
“ It ’s an incredibly great cell phone … And it ’s the Internet in your pocket for really the first time .
If it was any one of those three , it would be successful … but it ’s all three ! ”
Rarely has Jobs ’s reality - distortion field emanated such potent vibes , obscuring the gaping potholes into which the iPhone could tumble .
The first is price : $ 499 or $ 599 , depending on storage capacity .
“ Five hundred bucks for a phone ? ” Microsoft CEO
Steve Ballmer recently said to an audience of high - school students .
“ I would n’t want my kids carrying it around .
Anybody here ever lose a cell phone besides me ? ”
Next on the list is one of the iPhone ’s ostensibly slickest features : its touch - screen virtual keypad .
When Jobs was asked in Carlsbad how much debate there was inside of Apple about eschewing an actual keyboard , he replied , “ Uh , none . ” None ?
“ We actually think we have a better keyboard , ” he said .
“ It takes a few days to get used to … Once you learn how to trust it , you will fly . ”
But for serious e-mailers — the sort of businesspeople likeliest not to blanch at the iPhone ’s price — the absence of a keyboard is hugely problematic .
Sky Dayton , whose latest start - up , Helio , sells a rival smart phone called the Ocean , points out that touch - screens on electronic gadgets have a pretty miserable history .
Helio considered and rejected using one for the Ocean , Dayton says , because of “ the fundamental need for tactile feedback when you ’re typing — it ’s like , ‘ I ’ve got thumbs and I want to use them . ’ ”
Dayton goes on to enumerate what he sees as the iPhone ’s other shortcomings : “ No removable battery .
No removable memory .
No GPS , ” he says .
“ It has a bigger screen , so watching a movie on it will be better — but with no removable battery , you ’re not really going to want to do that and make phone calls .
So you ’ve got the houseboat problem :
It ’s neither a house nor a boat , it ’s both , and it ’s not particularly great at either . ”
It ’s only fair to note that many of the doubts about the iPhone are being conjured by Apple ’s adversaries .
But that does n’t mean that their contentions should be discounted automatically as bogus — though Jobs , no doubt , would argue vigorously to the contrary .
Indeed , the scorn he heaps on his foes is scathing and total .
“ The usual suspects will try to copy the [ iPhone ] hardware , and it will take them some time , and maybe they will and maybe they wo n’t be able to , ” he maintains .
“ But the software is at least five years ahead of anything we ’ve seen out there .
And it ’s really hard to do . ”
Nobody sensible would deny that Jobs is right that the software on cell phones and wireless e-mail devices is almost comically bad .
But maybe not forever .
For the past two weeks , after meeting Dayton at Helio ’s offices in Los Angeles , I ’ve been demo’ing an Ocean .
Its design is n’t as quite as snazzy as the iPhone ’s , but it ’s pretty cool — and maybe more functional .
The device is what ’s called a dual slider :
Push the face of it upward , there ’s a phone keypad ; push it sideways , there ’s a keyboard .
And its software is smart , intuitive , and impishly graphical , with an aesthetic that nods toward anime .
The point here is n’t that the Ocean is a serious threat to the iPhone ; Dayton ’s start - up has fewer than 100,000 customers so far .
The point is that Apple is entering a crowded and quickly changing sector — one populated not only by massive companies such as Nokia , Motorola , and Samsung but also with scrappy , innovative upstarts .
And all these companies have one distinct advantage over Apple , which is that they already understand and are accustomed to coping with the biggest albatross around the neck of the cell - phone business : the carriers .
Making matters worse for the iPhone , the carrier Jobs chose to deal with exclusively — for the next five years , no less — is the “ new ” AT&T , formerly Cingular , which is widely seen as having the slowest network and the worst technology of the major players .
( It ’s safe to assume the terms of the deal were the most favorable on offer . )
Some critics have wondered why Apple did n’t release the iPhone as an “ unlocked ” device that could be used with any carrier .
“ No way , ” says a venture capitalist who knows the cell - phone market inside out .
“ The mobile business is the best business in the world , and the operators are not going to be willing to let any device manufacturer take on their subscribers .
Nokia has been trying to establish a direct relationship with the customer for twenty years , and they have n’t been able to do it .
You have no choice but to do a deal with the devil .
And you know it kills Jobs to have to do that deal . ”
Undoubtedly .
For 30 years , Jobs has hewn to the conviction that Apple ’s strength is that , as he puts it , the company makes “ the whole banana ” — hardware , software , and everything in between .
This approach is no small part of the reason that the Mac was trounced in the PC market by Windows .
On the other hand , it explains why Apple thumped everyone with the iPod .
Whatever its virtues and demerits , however , the whole banana has been Jobs ’s ideological touchstone .
And now he is entering a business where success or failure will depend on the efficiency and savvy of not just another company , but of AT&T .
Oy vey .
Yet the whole banana is n’t the only shibboleth that Jobs is jettisoning with the iPhone .
Another is the company ’s laserlike focus , which is being sacrificed at the altar of both the iPhone and Apple TV — Jobs ’s attempt to put the company at the intersection of the Web and television .
At the D conference , Jobs announced a deal to deliver YouTube via Apple TV .
He also said that , though initially he thought of the product as a next - generation set - top box , his strategy had changed : “ One day we realized , wait a minute , there ’s a lot more DVD players out there than there are set - top boxes …
We just want to be a DVD player for this new Internet age . ”
Some hobby .
The risks for Apple of being stretched too thin by wading into two gargantuan markets simultaneously are already becoming apparent .
For years , one of the company ’s greatest strengths has been its ability to improve the Mac operating system at a staggering pace .
But , in April , Apple was forced to delay its next OS upgrade from June until October — because it needed to shift engineers over to the iPhone project .
“ He has no idea of the difficulties he ’s bringing on himself , trying to do so much , so fast , ” says the CEO of a conglomerate for which overstretch has always been a problem .
So what advice would he offer Jobs ?
“ I would n’t give him any advice , ” comes the reply .
“ Because he ’d never take it . ”
A few hours after Jobs ’s conversation with Walt Mossberg at D , the crowd started lining up for what was billed as a historic reunion :
For the first time in eons , Jobs and Bill Gates would be appearing together on the same stage .
Naturally , the hope was that they would pound furiously on each other — verbally , that is ; actual fisticuffs seemed a dream too far — and there was reason to believed that such prayers might be answered .
Earlier in the day , Jobs had quipped , in answer to a question about the popularity of iTunes on Windows , “ It ’s like giving a glass of ice water to someone in hell . ”
Gates was apparently furious about the crack .
And not surprisingly , for it touched a nerve that had been raw since 1996 , when Jobs had uncocked a scorching and widely noted critique of Gates ’s company in the PBS documentary series Triumph of the Nerds .
“ The only problem with Microsoft is that they have no taste , ” Jobs said .
“ They have absolutely no taste , and I do n’t mean that in a small way .
I mean it in a big way — in the sense that they do n’t think of original ideas and they do n’t bring much culture into their products . ”
The Jobs - Gates onstage duet lasted nearly 90 minutes and was mostly sweetness and light .
But then , at the end , a question from the audience elicited an outpouring of sublimated rage :
What had each man learned from the other ?
Gates stroked his chin for a long moment , then smiled a mischievous smile .
“ Oh , ” he said , “ I ’d give a lot to have Steve ’s taste . ”
Jobs stared down , shooting daggers at the floor .
Then , when it came his time to answer , he said wanly , “ Because Woz and I started the company based on doing the whole banana , we were n’t so good at partnering with people … Bill and Microsoft were really good at it . ”
The joint interview was revealing on other levels , too .
Whereas Gates came across as entirely at ease , almost avuncular , Jobs was coiled as tight as a spring .
Whereas Gates spoke happily about the marks , technological and philanthropic , he would leave on the world , Jobs squirmed at the notion of bequeathal , with its intimations of mortality .
“ I do n’t think about legacy much , ” he said .
“ I just think about being able to get up every day , and go in and hang around these great people , and hopefully create something other people will love as much as we do . ”
Maybe Jobs ’s queasiness with thinking about legacy comes from the pancreatic - cancer scare he received , and eluded , a few years ago .
Or perhaps it comes from another sort of brush with death — the Apple stock - option backdating scandal that embroiled him recently — which he also has managed to survive .
Some of his friends say these close calls have mellowed him .
“ I see him around the neighborhood , ” says one .
“ He looks different than he did a few years ago .
I think he may want to do something else . ”
Say what ?
“ I think that Google is going to buy Apple , ” this person says .
“ It would be a victory for Apple ; they ’d get major - league partners , money , and engineers .
And it would be a victory for Steve — a huge win that lets him leave the stage . ”
The speculation about Google has a ring of plausibility .
Google CEO Eric Schmidt is now on the Apple board ; engineers at the two companies are collaborating on Google Maps for the iPhone ; and then there ’s the YouTube deal for Apple TV .
But is there any reason to think that in such a merger Jobs would n’t wind up as CEO — or , at least , chairman of the board ?
No , there is n’t .
If anything , it seems to me , Jobs ’s vaulting ambition , his sense of omnipotence , have only been enhanced by his recent triumphs — and traumas .
He has beaten back death , literally and metaphorically .
He has returned to his first love , repaired the broken marriage , and made the bond more intimate than ever : Jobs and Apple are one , indivisible .
Now , with Gates soon retiring from Microsoft , and with Grove and so many other Valley potentates of his generation having left the scene , Jobs stands alone atop the high - tech heap .
This is the position he has longed for all his life .
The likelihood of his surrendering it voluntarily is vanishingly close to nil .
Of course , if the iPhone is a runaway success , Jobs wo n’t have to surrender anything — and it very well may be .
Less than two weeks from now , when the phone hits the streets , the consumerist pandemonium will likely be hysterical .
Once again , Jobs may have fashioned a totemic object that will capture the culture — and cause rival CEOs to have coronary events .
No one else in history has pulled of this kind of coup , as Jobs has , with four different products .
The Apple II .
The Mac . The iPod .
The computer - animated feature film .
Betting against a track record like that would be a dangerous wager .
Especially when you know , deep down , that you want an iPhone .
Bad .
But Jobs has been wrong before .
And if the iPhone proves a disappointment , his reputation will take a precipitous tumble : from unerring visionary to just another overreaching mogul .
What ’s at stake for Jobs , then , is n’t money or power — for no matter how the iPhone fares , he ’ll still have both in abundance .
What ’s at stake is the thing that now must matter to him above all : the ending of his story .
Google Maps on the Nokia N800
I finally got my Nokia N800 today .
I was amazed at how easily it connected to the internet with WiFi and with my mobile phone .
One thing I found useful so far was being able to access Google Maps on the run .
It ’s a little small on the screen , but I found it useable , and it sure would be nice if you were lost somewhere ( because I know you would n’t stop and ask for directions ) .
I captured this short screencast of the N800 in action using Google Maps .
The video was captured using VNC on the N800 along with Chicken of the VNC and iShowU on my Mac , so there was some overhead in both processing power and network speed that caused the video to be slightly jerkier than it usually is .
The AJAX maps also rendered slower when running VNC and you see a funny looking cursor instead of the regular N800 cursor … but as far as I know , using VNC is the only way to capture video from the N800 .

If you want more than just google maps on your N800 , you could try the new Nokia Navigation Kit for the N800 .
It ’s a serious plan , one that resembles the law signed in Massachusetts by Mr. Romney , the former governor there .
But lack of insurance is only one of the two big problems with health care in this country , and it may well be the smaller problem .
Even among the insured , there is an enormous amount of inefficiency today .
Some patients get expensive treatments that bring little benefit , while millions of others miss out on basic care , like cholesterol - lowering drugs , that would make a huge difference to them .
Solving that problem will require changing the system so that it rewards good care not just any care .
It will mean that Medicare and insurance companies must get tougher about saying no to $ 10,000 operations that have n’t been proven effective .
Mr. Edwards ’s white paper on health care includes some of these ideas , but he does n’t emphasize them on the stump .
And this is the sort of change that will require political leadership .
Will Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Obama try to provide it ?
For that matter , will one of the Republicans ?
At this point , they are focused on taxes , a make - or - break issue for many Republican primary voters .
“ We ’re facing a gigantic tax increase , ” said Michael Boskin , a top Giuliani adviser who , as an aide to George H. W. Bush , unsuccessfully tried to persuade his colleagues to take the 1990 - 91 recession more seriously .
It ’s conceivable that Mr. Romney may go even further than extending the recent tax cuts and propose new ones .
His top economic advisers are Mr. Hubbard ; Gregory Mankiw , a Harvard professor and former aide to the current President Bush ; and John F. Cogan , a Reagan budget official now at Stanford .
They like tax cuts .
Mr. McCain , for his part , voted against both of the big Bush tax cuts .
He said the first was too big and did n’t do enough to help the middle class , while the second was too expensive in a time of war .
But because letting them expire would feel like a tax increase — and because Mr. McCain knows how his primary voters feel about tax increases — he supports them now .
Eventually , though , the Republican candidates will talk about issues besides taxes .
To deal with the budget deficit , they will have to come up with ideas for spending cuts .
Nothing is a bigger long - term expense than Medicare , which will bring the debate right back to health care .
The truth is that if you put the economic advisers , from both parties , in a room and told them to hammer out solutions to the country ’s big economic problems , they would find a lot of common ground .
They could agree that doctors and patients need better incentives to choose effective medical care .
They would probably hit upon education policies along similar lines , requiring that schools be held more accountable for what their students are , and are not , learning .
They might suggest a carbon tax — a favorite idea of Mr. Mankiw — to deal with global warming .
And they would shore up Social Security by reducing benefits for high earners , as Mr. Hubbard has suggested .
Not all of these ideas are politically feasible at this point , but presidential campaigns can change what ’s feasible .
Here ’s hoping that this year ’s crop of economic advisers has the courage of their convictions .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Republican 2008 presidential hopeful John McCain crooned the words “ Bomb Iran ” to a Beach Boys ’ tune in joking response to a question about any possible U.S. attack over Tehran ’s suspected nuclear weapons program .
“ That old Beach Boys song , Bomb Iran ... bomb , bomb , bomb , bomb , ” the Vietnam War veteran warbled softly to the band ’s “ Barbara Ann ” when he was asked when the United States would send an “ airmail message ” to Iran .
The singing performance during a campaign stop on Wednesday in South Carolina drew chuckles from the audience and has already been viewed almost 11,000 times on the Internet video sharing site YouTube after being posted on Thursday .
Campaign spokesman Matt David said the question was asked somewhat in jest and that the Arizona senator was adding some levity to the discussion .
The United States and others have accused Tehran of seeking nuclear weapons , a charge Tehran denies .
While U.S. officials have refused to take the military option off the table , they have said there were no plans to attack Iran and they would pursue a diplomatic solution .
McCain also gave a serious answer focusing on Iran ’s nuclear ambitions and desire to destroy Israel .
“ It bothers me a great deal that they ( Iran ) might have a nuclear weapon or a missile , but it bothers me also to have a nuclear weapon knowing their relationship with various terrorist organizations , that they would give it to a terrorist organization , ” McCain said .
McCain ’s run for the White House , his second , has experienced some difficulties .
He was third among Republicans in raising money during the first quarter , $ 12.5 million , and has been spending it as a faster clip than many candidates .

India Is Colonising Itself
By Arundhati Roy & Shoma Chaudhuri
26 March , 2007
Tehelka
There is an atmosphere of growing violence across the country .
How do you read the signs ?
Do you think it will grow more in the days to come ?
What are its causes ?
In what context should all this be read ?
You do n’t have to be a genius to read the signs .
We have a growing middle class , being reared on a diet of radical consumerism and aggressive greed .
Unlike industrializing western countries which had colonies from which to plunder resources and generate slave labour to feed this process , we have to colonize ourselves , our own nether parts .
We ’ve begun to eat our own limbs .
The greed that is being generated ( and marketed as a value interchangeable with nationalism ) can only be sated by grabbing land , water and resources from the vulnerable .
What we ’re witnessing is the most successful secessionist struggle ever waged in Independent India .
The secession of the middle and upper classes from the rest of the country .
It ’s a vertical secession , not a lateral one .
They ’re fighting for the right to merge with the world ’s elite somewhere up there in the stratosphere .
They ’ve managed to commandeer the resources , the coal , the minerals , the bauxite , the water and electricity .
Now they want the land to make more cars , more bombs , more mines – super toys for the new super citizens of the new superpower .
So it ’s outright war , and people on both sides are choosing their weapons .
The government and the corporations reach for Structural Adjustment , the World Bank , the ADB , FDI , friendly court orders , friendly policy makers , help from the ‘ friendly ’ corporate media and a police force that will ram all this down peoples ’ throats .
Those who want to resist this process have , until now , reached for dharnas , hunger - strikes , satyagraha , the courts , and what they thought was friendly media .
But now , more and more are reaching for guns .
Will the violence grow ?
If the ‘ growth rate ’ and the sensex are going to be the only barometres the government uses to measure progress and the well - being of people , then of course it will .
How do I read the signs ?
It is n’t hard to read sky - writing .
What it says up there , in big letters is this :
The shit has hit the fan , folks .
You once remarked that though you may not resort to violence yourself , you think it has become immoral to condemn it , given the circumstances in the country .
Can you elaborate on this view ?
I ’d be a liability as a guerilla !
I doubt I used the word ‘ immoral ’- morality is an elusive business , as changeable as the weather .
What I feel is this : Non-violent movements have , for decades knocked on the door of every democratic institution in this country and have been spurned and humiliated .
Look at the Bhopal Gas victims , the Narmada Bachao Andolan .
The NBA for example , had a lot going for it , high profile leadership , media coverage , more resources than any other mass movement .
What went wrong ?
People are bound to want to re-think strategy .
When Sonia Gandhi begins to promote Satyagraha at the World Economic Forum in Davos it ’s time for us to sit up and think .
For example , is mass civil disobedience possible within the structure of a democratic nation - state ?
Is it possible in the age of disinformation and corporate - controlled mass media ?
Are hunger - strikes umblically linked to celebrity politics ?
Would anybody care if the people of Nangla Machhi or Bhatti mines went on a hunger - strike ?
Sharmila Irom has been on a hunger strike for six years .
That should be a salutary lesson to many of us .
I ’ve always felt that it ’s ironic that hunger - strikes are used as a political weapon in a land where most people go hungry anyway .
We are in a different time and place now .
Up against a different , more complex adversary .
We ’ve entered the era of NGOs – or should I say the era of palthu shers - in which mass action can be a treacherous business .
We have demonstrations which are funded , we have sponsored dharnas and social forums which posture militantly but never follow up on what they preach .
We have all kinds of ‘ virtual ’ resistance .
Meetings against SEZs sponsored by the biggest promoters of SEZs .
Awards and grants for environmental activism and community action given by corporations responsible for devastating whole ecosystems .
Vedanta , a company mining bauxite in the forests of Orissa wants to start a university .
The Tatas have two charitable trusts that directly and indirectly , fund activists and mass movements across the country .
Could that be why Singur has drawn so much less flak than Nandigram , and why they have not targeted , boycotted , gheraoed ?
Of course the Tatas and Birlas funded Gandhi too – maybe he was our first NGO .
But now we have NGOs who make a lot of noise , write a lot of reports , but who the sarkar is more than comfortable with .
How do we make sense of all this ?
The place is crawling with professional diffusers of real political action .
‘ Virtual resistance ’ has become something of a liability .
There was a time when mass movements looked to the courts for justice .
The courts have rained down a series of judgments that are so unjust , so insulting to the poor in the language they use , they take your breath away .
A recent Supreme Court judgment allowing the Vasant Kunj Mall to resume construction though it did n’t have the requisite clearances said in so many words , that the question of Corporations indulging in malpractice does not arise !
In the era of corporate globalization , corporate land - grab , in the era of Enron and Monsanto , Halliburton and Bechtel , that ’s a loaded thing to say .
It exposes the ideological heart of the most powerful institution in this country .
The judiciary along with the corporate press , is now seen as the lynchpin of the neo-liberal project .
In a climate like this when people feel that they are being worn down , exhausted by these interminable ‘ democratic ’ processes , only to be humiliated eventually , what are they supposed to do ?
Of course it is n’t as though the only options are binary – violence versus non-violence .
There are political parties that believe in armed struggle , but only as one part of their overall political strategy .
Political workers in these struggles have been dealt with brutally , killed , beaten , imprisoned under false charges .
People are fully aware that to take to arms is to call down upon yourself the myriad forms of violence of the Indian State .
The minute armed struggle becomes a strategy , your whole world shrinks and the colors fade to black and white .
But when people decide to take that step because every other option has ended in despair–should we condemn them ?
Does anyone believe that if the people of Nandigram had held a Dharna and sung songs the West Bengal Government would have backed down ?
We are living in times , when to be ineffective is to support the status quo ( which no doubt suits some of us ) .
And being effective comes at a terrible price .
I find it hard to condemn people who are prepared to pay that price .
You have been traveling a lot on the ground -- can you give us a sense of the fissures you are seeing on the ground .
What are the trouble spots you have been to ?
Can you outline a few of the combat lines in these places ?
Huge question – what can I say ?
The military occupation of Kashmir , neo- facism in Gujarat , civil war in Chhattisgarh , MNCs raping Orissa , the submergence of hundreds of villages in the Narmada Valley , people living on the edge of absolute starvation , the devastation of forest land , the Bhopal victims living to see the West Bengal government re-wooing Union Carbide – now calling itself Dow Chemicals - in Nandigram .
I have n’t been recently to Andhra Pradesh , Karnataka , Maharshtra , but we know about the almost hundred thousand farmers who have killed themselves .
We know about the fake encounters and the terrible repression in Andhra Pradesh .
Each of these places is has its own particular history , economy , ecology .
None is amenable to easy analysis .
And yet there is connecting tissue , there are huge international cultural and economic pressures being brought to bear on them .
How can I not mention the Hindutva project , spreading its poison sub-cutaneously , waiting to errupt once again .
I ’d say the biggest indictment of all is that we are still a country , a culture a society which continues to nurture and practice the notion of untouchability .
While our economists number - crunch and boast about the growth rate , a million people , human scavengers - earn their living carrying several kilos of other peoples ’ shit on their heads every day .
And if they did n’t carry shit on their heads they would starve to death .
Some fucking superpower this .
How does one view the recent State and police violence in Bengal ?
No different from police and State violence anywhere else – including the issue of hypocrisy and doublespeak so perfected by all political parties including the mainstream Left .
Are communist bullets different from capitalist ones ?
Odd things are happening .
It snowed in Saudi Arabia .
Owls are out in broad daylight The Chinese Government tabled a bill sanctioning the right to private property .
I do n’t know if all of this has to do with climate change .
The Chinese Communists are turning out to be the biggest capitalists of the 21st century .
Why should we expect our own Parliamentary Left to be any different ?
Nandigram and Singur are clear signals .
It makes you wonder – is the last stop of every revolution advanced capitalism ?
Think about it - the French Revolution , the Russian Revolution , the Chinese Revolution , the Vietnam War , the Anti- Apartheid struggle , the supposedly Gandhian Freedom struggle in India … what ’s the last station they all pull in at ?
Is this the end of imagination ?
The Maoist attack in Bijapur -- the death of 55 policemen .
Are the rebels only a flip face of the State ?
How can the rebels be the flip side of the state ?
Would anybody say that those who fought against Apartheid – however brutal their methods - were the flip side of the state ?
What about those who fought the French in Algeria ?
Or those who fought the Nazis ?
Or those who fought Colonial Regimes ?
Or those who are fighting the US occupation of Iraq ?
Are they the flip side of the State ?
This facile new report - driven ‘ human rights ’ discourse , this meaningless condemnation game that we all are forced to play , makes politicians of us all and leaches the real politics out of everything .
However pristine we would like to be , however hard we polish our halos , the tragedy is that we have run out of pristine choices .
There is a civil war in Chattisgarh sponsored , created by the Chattisgarh Government which is publicly pursing the Bush doctrine – if you ’re not with us , you are with the terrorists .
The lynch pin of this war , apart from the formal security forces , is the Salwa Judum – a government backed militia of ordinary people forced to take up arms , forced to become SPOs ( Special Police Officers ) .
The Indian State has tried this in Kashmir , in Manipur , in Nagaland .
Tens of thousands have been killed , hundreds of thousands tortured , thousands have disappeared .
Any Banana Republic would be proud of this record ..
Now the government wants to import these failed strategies into the heartland .
Thousands of Adivasis have been forcibly moved off their mineral –rich lands into police camps .
Hundreds of villages have been forcibly evacuated .
Those lands , rich in iron - ore are being eyed by corporations like the Tatas and Essar .
MOUs have been signed , but no one knows what they say .
Land Acquisition has begun .
This kind of thing happened in countries like Colombia – one of the most devastated countries in the world .
While everybody ’s eyes are fixed on the spiraling violence between government backed militias and guerilla squads , multinational corporations quietly make off with the mineral wealth .
That ’s the little piece of theatre being scripted for us in Chattisgarh .
Of course it ’s horrible that 55 policemen were killed .
But they ’re as much the victims of Government policy as anybody else .
For the Government and the Corporations they ’re just cannon fodder – there ’s plenty more where they came from .
Crocodile tears will be shed , prim TV anchors will hector us for a while and then more supplies of fodder will be arranged .
For the Maoist guerillas the police and SPOs they killed were the armed personnel of the Indian State , the main , perpetrators of repression , torture , custodial killings , false encounters .
The ones whose professional duties involve burning villages and raping women .
They ’re not innocent civilians – if such a thing exists - by any stretch of imagination .
I have no doubt that the Maoists can be agents of terror and coercion too .
I have no doubt they have committed unspeakable atrocities .
I have no doubt they cannot lay claim to undisputed support from local people – but who can ?
Still , no guerrilla army can survive without local support .
That ’s a logistical impossibility .
And the support for Maoists is growing , not diminishing .
That says something .
People have no choice but to align themselves on the side of whoever they think is less worse .
But to equate a resistance movement fighting against enormous injustice , with the Government which enforces that injustice is absurd .
The government has slammed the door in the face of every attempt at non-violent resistance .
When people take to arms , there is going to be all kinds of violence – revolutionary , lumpen and outright criminal .
The government is responsible for the monstrous situations it creates .
The term Naxals and Maoists and outsiders is being used very loosely these days .
Can you declutter it .
‘ Outsiders ’ is a generic accusation used in the early stages of repression by governments who have begun to believe their own publicity and can’t imagine that people have risen up against them .
That ’s the stage the CPI ( M ) is at now in Bengal , though some would say repression in Bengal is not new , it has only moved into higher gear ..
In any case what ’s an outsider ?
Who decides the borders ?
Are they village boundaries ?
Tehsil ?
Block ?
District ?
State ?
Is narrow regional and ethnic politics the new communist mantra ?
About Naxals and Maoists – well …
India is about to become a police state in which everybody who disagrees with what ’s going on risks being called a terrorist .
Islamic terrorists have to be Islamic – so that ’s not good enough to cover most of us .
They need a bigger catchment area .
So leaving the definition loose , undefined , is effective strategy , because the time is not far off when we ’ll all be called Maoists or Naxalites , terrorists or terrorist sympathisers and shut down , by people who do n’t really know – or care - who Maoists or Naxalites are .
In villages of course that has begun – thousands of people are being held in jails across the country , loosely charged with being terrorists trying to overthrow the state .
Who are the real Naxalites and Maoists ?
I ’m not an authority on the subject , but here ’s a very rudimentary potted history .
The Communist Party of India the CPI was formed in 1925 .
The CPI ( M ) Communist Party Marxist - split from the CPI in 1964 and formed a separate party .
Both of course were parliamentary political parties .
In 1967 the CPI ( M ) along with a splinter group of the Congress , came to power in West Bengal .
At the time there was massive unrest among starving peasantry in the countryside .
Local leaders of the CPI ( M ) – Kanu Sanyal and Charu Mazumdar led a peasant uprising in the district of Naxalbari which is where the term Naxalites comes from .
In 1969 the government fell and the Congress came back to power under Siddharta Shankar Ray .
The naxalite uprising was mercilessly crushed - Mahashweta Devi has written powerfully about this time .
In 1969 the CPI ( ML ) – Marxist Leninist split from the CPI ( M ) .
A few years later around 1971 , the CPI ( ML ) devolved into several parties : the CPI - ML ( Liberation ) largely centred in Bihar , CPI –ML ( New Democracy ) functioning for the most part out of Andhra Pradesh and Bihar , the CPI - ML ( Class Struggle ) mainly in Bengal .
These parties have been generically baptized ‘ Naxalites . ’
They see themselves as Marxist Leninist , not strictly speaking Maoist .
They believe in elections , mass action and , when , absolutely pushed to the wall or attacked - armed struggle .
The MCC – the Maoist Communist Centre at the time mostly operating in Bihar was formed in 1968 .
The PW Peoples War , operational for the most part in Andhra Pradesh was formed in 1980 .
Recently , in 2004 the MCC and the PW merged to form the CPI ( Maoist ) They believe in outright armed struggle and the overthrowing of the state .
They do n’t participate in elections .
This is the party that is fighting the guerilla war in Bihar , Andhra Pradesh , Chattisgarh and Jharkhand .
The Indian state and media largely view the Maoists as " internal security " threat .
Is this the way to look at them ?
I ’m sure the Maoists would be flattered to be viewed in this way .
The Maoists want to bring down the State .
Given the autocratic ideology they take their inspiration from , what alternative would they set up ?
Would n't their regime be an exploitative autocratic violent one as well ?
Is n't their action already exploitative of ordinary people ?
Do they really have the support of ordinary people ?
I think it ’s important for us to acknowledge that both Mao and Stalin are dubious heroes with murderous pasts .
Tens of millions of people were killed under their regimes .
Apart from what happened in China and the Soviet Union , Pol Pot , with the support of the Chinese communist party ( while the West looked away discreetly ) wiped out two million people in Cambodia and brought millions of people to the brink of extinction from disease and starvation .
Can we pretend that China ’s cultural revolution did n’t happen ?
Or that that millions of people in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe were not victims of labour camps , torture chambers , the network of spies and informers , the secret police .
The history of these regimes is just as dark as the history of Western Imperialism , except for the fact that they had a shorter life - span .
We cannot condemn the occupation of Iraq , Palestine and Kashmir while we remain silent about Tibet and Chechnya .
I would imagine that for the Maoists , the Naxalites as well as the mainstream Left , being honest about the past is important to strengthen peoples ’ faith in the future .
One hopes the past will not be repeated , but denying that it ever happened does n’t help inspire confidence ….
Nevertheless , in this part of the world , the Maoists in Nepal have waged a brave and successful struggle against the monarchy in Nepal .
Right now in India the Maoists and the various Marxist Leninist Groups are leading the fight against immense injustice in India .
They are fighting not just the State , but feudal landlords and their armed militias .
They are the only people who are making a dent .
And I admire that .
It may well be that when they come to power they will as you say , be brutal , unjust and autocratic , even worse than the present government .
Maybe , but I ’m not prepared to assume that in advance .
If they are , we ’ll have to fight them too .
And most likely someone like myself will be the first person they ’ll string up from the nearest tree – but right now , it is important to acknowledge that they are bearing the brunt of being at the forefront of resistance .
Many of us are in a position where we have are beginning to align ourselves on the side of those who we know have no place for us in their religious or ideological imagination .
It ’s true that everybody changes radically when they come to power – look at Mandela ’s ANC .
Corrupt , capitalist , bowing to the IMF , driving the poor out of their homes – honouring Suharto the killer of hundreds of thousands of Indonesian communists with South Africa ’s highest civilian award .
Who would have thought it could happen ?
But does this mean South Africans should have backed away from the struggle against apartheid ?
Or that they should regret it now ?
Does it mean Algeria should have remained a French Colony , that Kashmiris , Iraqis and Palestinians should accept military occupation ?
That people whose dignity is being assaulted should give up the fight because they can’t find saints to lead them into battle ?
Is there a communication breakdown in our society ?
Yes .

Rescuers are struggling to reach the injured in time
Search for survivors
Pakistan 's military spokesman has said an entire generation of young people has been wiped out in the areas worst hit by a massive earthquake .
Maj Gen Shaukat Sultan , quoted by the AFP news agency , said children had been the biggest casualties .
Many were killed when schools collapsed .
At least 20,000 people are thought to have been killed in Pakistan , with some reports suggesting the toll may double .
Many areas hit by the quake are only just being reached by aid workers .
A road has been re-opened into Muzaffarabad , the capital of Pakistan - administered Kashmir where 11,000 are thought to have died , allowing trucks to deliver food and medical supplies .
I saw death in front of me ... this was the worst nightmare with open eyes
Jahangeer , Lahore
Send us stories and pictures Eyewitness : ' Cries haunt me '
But people are becoming more and more desperate in the city , he says , with supply trucks mobbed and reports of looting at damaged shops and homes .
The rescue effort has been slowed by landslides which have wiped out roads and bridges , and a lack of helicopters to ferry in vital heavy lifting equipment .
Correspondents say anger is mounting in communities where significant outside help has yet to arrive , amid fears time is running out to find survivors .

Many of the victims were schoolchildren , who had just begun classes when school buildings collapsed on top of them .
Children made up half the population of the affected area and were particularly vulnerable , the UN children 's agency Unicef has said .

The long - awaited arrival of Pakistani soldiers with heavy lifting equipment on Monday means the search can finally be stepped up , our correspondent says .
Military spokesman Maj Gen Shaukat told AFP : " It is a whole generation that has been lost in the worst affected areas .
The maximum number affected was schoolchildren .
" Rescuers are pulling out dead children in Muzaffarabad but there is no - one to claim the bodies which shows their parents are dead . "
With some towns and villages completely flattened , President Pervez Musharraf told the BBC that Pakistan needed " massive cargo helicopter support " and aid supplies from the international community .
Amid scenes of death , destruction and destitution , the rescue effort begins
In pictures
The US immediately came forward to offer eight military helicopters from its force in Afghanistan .
Many other countries across the world have offered financial help and practical support .
Gen Musharraf said the military had been mobilised but because roads in remote mountainous regions had been blocked or swept away in landslides , there was severe pressure on Pakistan 's " limited " transport and helicopter resources .
" Other than that , we of course need relief goods in the form of tents and blankets and medicines , " he said .
Officials in Indian - administered Kashmir said the death toll had risen to at least 750 , with the bodies of 300 people found in one town alone .
Thousands in the region fled their homes on Sunday night after warnings of a further earthquake were broadcast from mosques .
Indian ruling Congress Party chief Sonia Gandhi toured the town of Uri , near the Line of Control dividing Pakistani and Indian - controlled Kashmir , and promised government help .
But angry residents in towns nearby said they had received no assistance .
UN emergency relief coordinator Jan Egeland echoed the appeal for swift help .
" We know that every hour counts in an earthquake of this magnitude , " he said .
He spoke as tens of thousands of survivors spent a second night in the cold without shelter .
The earthquake , which hit at 0350GMT on Saturday , is thought to have been the strongest the region has seen in a century .

An overview of the trackball concept
Kathy and I had been enjoying amateur astronomy for about a year when I decided it was time to try my hand at building a telescope .
I was n't happy with equatorial or Dobsonian mounts -- both types have difficulty reaching certain parts of the sky , and equatorial mounts make you do some back - breaking contortions to reach the eyepiece once you do find your target -- so I decided to see if I could design something that would be easy to point and easy to look into no matter where in the sky it was aimed .
I did n't want to be influenced by what others had done , so I purposefully did n't look for other designs until I had come up with one on my own .
I followed a few false leads , but I eventually figured out that a spherical base resting in a socket would let me point the scope anywhere in the sky with equal ease , and it would let me rotate the eyepiece to a comfortable position no matter where I was looking .
That was half the battle , but one of the things I did n't like about Dobsonian mounts is that you have to keep shoving them by hand to track the stars .
How could I make my mount track automatically ?
The answer to that came in a flash of inspiration :
The stars move because the Earth - - a sphere - - rotates .
But I was building a spherical telescope , so if I made it rotate in the opposite direction , it would track .
Once I realized that , the solution was obvious : rest the sphere against an axle that points at the celestial pole , and rotate the axle .
Confident that I had just reinvented the wheel -- almost literally - - I went online to see how other people had done it .
Surprise !
Apparently nobody had .
Spherical telescopes were old news ( Isaac Newton even mounted his scope on a ball ! ) , but nobody was talking about my kind of mount .
I showed a scale model to other astronomers , figuring there must be some fundamental flaw in the design that would explain why nobody was building them , but nobody I talked to could find anything wrong with the concept .
And none of them had ever heard of this design , either .
So I searched the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office database , and came up blank there , too .
As near as I could tell , I had come up with a new design for a mount that not only eliminates the pointing problems of equatorial mounts and Dobsonian mounts , but also tracks .
I called it the " trackball " because there 's no better name to describe it .
Happily , another search of the USPTO database showed that the term " trackball " has fallen into the public domain , so apparently anyone is free to use it as a generic term for this type of telescope .
Many people urged me to patent the design , but I decided I would much rather put it into the public domain so anybody could build ( and sell ) them as they wish .
So I did just that .
In July of 2005 I displayed the scope and mount at a public star party , effectively placing it in the public domain .
The article in Sky and Telescope reinforced that action , as does this web site .
My actions only affect the parts of the design that are new with me , of course , but that much at least is free for everyone to use , and nobody may patent it .
After the article came out , I heard from several people who remembered seeing similar designs in the past .
None of those designs have been quite the same as mine , but the concepts are similar enough to make it clear that the idea has been around for a while .
That 's okay with me !
As with any star party , the more the merrier .
And it turns out that Canadian amateur telescope maker Pierre Lemay came up with the same idea 10 years before I did , so he clearly has the prior art .
I 've put more detailed information on the other designs below .
Speaking of other designs , here 's a photo of my second trackball , which I made for my wife , Kathy .
It 's nearly identical to the first in construction and focal length .
The biggest difference is that I beefed up the mount a bit and used a different motor .
More on that on the mount page .
So how do you build a trackball ?
The most important thing is not to be afraid to experiment .
My design philosophy has been to make it work first , then worry about making it pretty .
I 'll describe how I built mine , but if you have a better idea for any of aspect of the design , go for it !
Look around your shop for whatever will work rather than following my recipe to the letter .
So with that in mind , here 's a general idea of how to build a trackball .
I 've divided the instructions into two pages to make them easier to load and view .
Click on the part of the top photo you 're interested in , or click on the following links .
Below these links I 've written some instructions for using the completed telescope and mount , and some other ideas and random thoughts about the design .
How to use the telescope
The trackball is amazingly easy to set up .
Just put the mount on a level surface , aim the drive axle at the celestial pole , set the telescope on the mount , and turn on the motor .
This simple alignment is all you 'll need for visual observing even at relatively high power .
To find your target , just push the scope where you want it to go .
If the eyepiece is n't in a comfortable position , rotate the scope until it is .
Most times you can sit down while you 're observing , which is by far the most comfortable way to view .
Once you 've found your target , just let go and the scope will track .
You can center it east - west ( right ascension ) with the fast or slow tracking buttons , but north - south ( declination ) adjustments are made by nudging the scope by hand . *
Also , if there 's any play in the gears ( and there probably will be ) , then you 'll want to overshoot to the west and then pull the scope back to the east to load the gears so the scope will begin tracking the moment you let go .
You 'll quickly learn to combine these adjustments into one smooth , quick motion , so you do n't even think about it anymore .
You 'll just point , let go , and observe .
If your target drifts out of the field to the east or west , adjust the tracking speed .
If it drifts to the north or south , nudge the mount sideways or raise or lower the axle a bit to bring it back .
That 's called drift aligning , and it's a piece of cake .
If you 've never done it , click here for instructions .
* It turns out there 's an easy way to make a declination adjustment .
Thanks go to Pierre Lemay ( see below ) for the idea .
He figured out that you can make a declination adjustment by mounting the idler bearings on a pivot that lets you move them toward and away from the drive axle .
That will force the ball to roll up or down the axle , which translates to motion in declination .
Very neat !
I 've got a couple other thoughts about this concept on the mount page .
A few other random thoughts
Cooling
There 's not a lot of air flow inside the ball .
My scope takes about half an hour to cool on an average night , but then again , my mirror is pretty thin .
If yours is thicker , it might take longer , and you might need to install a fan .
I 've experimented with a 1.5 " muffin fan mounted at an angle inside the ball where it's out of the light path and can swirl air down under the mirror and back out the other side of the ball , and that seems to work okay .
You might be able to drill holes in the ball and mount a fan to blow air straight out ( or in ) , but if you do , use a small drill so the holes do n't mess up your tracking .
They have to be small enough that the grid of them will ride across the bearings without bumping .
You might try putting insulation over the counterweight to keep it from radiating heat into the ball , but that might just slow down the cooling process .
It depends on how fast its heat will escape through the outer surface of the ball .
Experiment with removable foam before you spray permanent stuff in there !
Nesting
You could cut a big enough hole in the ball for the secondary cage to nest in there during transport , but that would probably cut into your ability to look close to the horizon .
I thought collapsibility would be a neat thing when I was designing my scope , but I quickly gave it up when I saw how difficult it would be , and in truth I 've never needed to take the telescope apart except to tinker with it anyway .
Maybe if it was longer , but at 38 inches it fits into the back seat ( or upright in the passenger seat ) of my Volkswagen just fine .
Carrying
I have n't put a handle on mine yet , but the part of the ball directly below the eyepiece never rides on the bearings , so a handle there should n't get in the way of anything .
On the other hand , it 's pretty easy to carry the scope by the lip of the ball , so I may just keep doing that .
One other thought on the subject : I 'm not sure how strong an acrylic sphere is .
My fiberglass sphere is plenty strong enough to support the entire scope 's weight from a couple of handle attachment points , but you might want to err on the side of caution with an acrylic sphere .
Ideas to experiment with
( Any of these that are not already patented I also place in the public domain )
The ball could be made of an open grid of wires or hoops or whatever .
You would need larger bearing surfaces -- maybe slides -- so the gaps would n't affect the tracking , but it would really help with cooling ( and maybe with weight , too ) .
The axle could be a conveyor belt or a sling or anything else that pushes the ball .
It could be spring - loaded to press into the ball while tracking and moved away while slewing .
( This would allow the use of a very grippy substance for the axle , which could help eliminate fussiness over balance . )
The mount could be any kind of a cradle , even a toilet - seat - style hole , with the axle pressed against the scope ( maybe spring loaded as mentioned above ) .
Rotation could be constrained to the correct direction with multiple bearing surfaces oriented in the proper direction , or with a suction cup on a bearing that stuck to the bottom of the ball .
( That would probably have to be on a lever so it could be moved away while slewing . )
The axle could be cone - shaped , so variable speed could be accomplished by moving the axle longitudinally rather than changing the motor speed .
You could paint a star map on the ball and use a pointer on the mount to help you aim the scope .
Of course when you rotate the scope for a comfortable eyepiece position , your map will move ...
You could use the telescope itself for precise latitude alignment .
Drift align the scope once , and after you 've got it tracking perfectly , put Polaris ( or Sigma Octantis if you 're in the southern hemisphere ) in the center of the view of a medium - power eyepiece .
Mark the point where the ball and the axle come together , then next time you set up just sight on Polaris ( or Sigma Octantis ) and move the axle up and down until the marks line up .
You could probably use a similar method for left - right alignment using the idler bearings .
You could use magnets for fine - tuning the counterweight system .
Overdo the weight inside the ball by a pound or so , and put a metal strip up near the focuser .
Stick magnets on the metal strip , and remove them when you put a heavy eyepiece in .
Or you could embed a metal strip in the ball ( easiest if you 're making a fiberglass ball ) on the side opposite the focuser and stick a few magnets to that when you use a heavy eyepiece .
Credit for this idea goes to Pierre Lemay ( see below ) .
You can make a declination adjustment by mounting the idler bearings on a pivot that lets you move them toward and away from the drive axle .
That will force the ball to roll up or down the axle , which translates to motion in declination .
Very neat !
You could get the same effect by moving the drive axle in and out ( being careful not to change your polar alignment in the process -- and being careful not to push the ball off the other bearings ! )
Total cost
I put about $ 500 into my first trackball .
Some of that was blind alleys ( making a fiberglass sphere instead of buying an acrylic one , experimenting with Teflon instead of bearings , etc ) .
My second and third ones cost about $ 350 - $ 400 each .
If you buy a finished primary mirror rather than make your own , it will probably run you more .
Or you could rob the mirrors and other hardware out of your Newtonian and build the whole thing for practically nothing .
Once you use a trackball , you 'll never go back to that old scope anyway . :-)
Here 's my scale model : a Christmas tree ornament with a film can taped to it to represent the top end of the scope .
I smooshed modeling clay inside the ball to counterbalance the film can , and set it on a triangle of sticks .
When I spun the rubber - hose axle that I placed over one of the sticks , the film can would trace an arc across the sky .
Near the pole , it would just spin in place .
It worked !
The other designs
Several people have emailed me since the article came out in Sky & Telescope magazine , telling me about other designs for making sperically mounted scopes track .
The earliest I 've heard of so far was built in the early 1970s by Norman James .
His scope floated in a pan of water and was driven with an axle attached to the low end of the ball by a suction cup .
Here are links to a couple of pictures of that :
http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/archives/photos/69RTMC11.jpg
and
http://www.rtmcastronomyexpo.org/archives/photos/72RTMC04.jpg
The person who emailed me that said there 's a publication about this same inventor 's ideas .
I have n't looked it up yet , but here 's the citation :
James , Norman .
Fiberglass Applications for the Telescope Maker . pp29-52 .
Proceedings of the 1970 Annual Convention of the Western Amateur Astronomers .
( 8 inch Newtonian , spherical mounting )
Then there 's a Belgian man named Alphonse Pouplier who motorized an Astroscan and had an article about it in the August 1993 Sky & Telescope .
He did n't use a polar - aligned axle , but he did come up with a clever tracking system -- and his even has go - to capability .
He has posted his article online ; the URL is http://users.skynet.be/alphonse/skytel.htm
The third , and so far closest design to mine , was built by Pierre Lemay of Quebec .
He tried a single drive axle with two omnidirectional idler bearings and had trouble with the axle slipping against the sphere , so he switched to two drive axles and a single idler .
That gave him better control of the ball , and also allowed him to devise a very clever way to make fine adjustments in declination .
He mounted his idler bearing on a pivot so it can move toward or away from the drive axles .
That forces the ball to roll up or down the axles , which provides declination control .
He has a lot of information about his design on his website :
http://www.telescopelemay.com
Pierre also arrived at the same conclusion I did regarding patents .
He decided to put his idea in the public domain , so he showed it at the 1995 Stellafane convention , and it was featured in the " Ten Top Telescope Ideas of 1995 " article in the January 1996 issue of Sky & Telescope .
Pierre would be happy to discuss his design with anyone who is interested .
His email address is to the right .
( Sorry you can't click on it or copy and paste it ; it 's a graphic file to thwart spambots that search the internet for addresses to send junk mail to . )
Drift alignment
Drift alignment can seem pretty involved if you get a complicated set of instructions , but it 's actually very simple .
In the northern hemisphere , do this :
Aim the telescope at a star to the south , and somewhere near the celestial equator .
( That 's 90 degrees away from the pole , along a line that runs straight overhead . )
Look for north - south motion of the star .
We 're only concerned with north - south motion .
If it drifts east or west , your drive is set too fast or slow .
And I 'm talking about actual motion , i.e. the direction you have to push the telescope to re-center the star .
If the star drifts south , then rotate the entire mount so the axle points farther west .
If it drifts north , rotate the mount so the axle points farther east .
Now look at a star near the horizon to the east , and see if it drifts north or south .
This time if your target drifts south , then angle your axle farther upward ( toward a higher latitude on your scale ) .
If it drifts north , lower the axle .
If you were a long way off in either direction , do the whole procedure again to fine - tune it .

I 've had a lot of help in developing the trackball idea .
My wife , Kathy , has been incredibly supportive and has helped brainstorm many a gadget at unlikely hours of the day .
David Davis and Mel Bartels , thin mirror gurus and telescope builders extraordinaire , have also been most generous with their time and enthusiasm .
Thanks also to Ted Touw , Craig Daniels , Chuck Lott ( of the Lott 35 mm finder fame ) , Tom Conlin , Arnie Wittstein , Jim Ruzicka , Dave Cole , Bill Murray , and the entire Eugene Astronomical Society for help and support .
Thanks also to Gary Seronik , my editor at Sky & Telescope , who knows how to make a writer feel appreciated .
Thanks to you all , I 've had a ton of fun on this project .
After the article came out , I heard from many people who remembered seeing similar designs , and from one person who had actually built a similar design over a decade ago .
My thanks to all of you who helped flesh out the history of this idea , and my thanks especially to Pierre Lemay , who not only arrived at the same design before I did , but who placed it in the public domain just as I did .
Great minds think alike !
I hope anyone else who builds a trackball will get as much enjoyment from it as I have had with mine .

US confirms it is arming Sunni insurgents John Byrne
Published : Sunday June 10 , 2007 Print This Email This The U.S. military has confirmed that it is arming Sunni insurgent factions to try to contain al - Qaida in Mesopotamia , according to a report in Monday 's New York Times by veteran Iraq correspondent John Burns .
" With the four - month - old increase in American troops showing only modest success in curbing insurgent attacks , American commanders are turning to another strategy that they acknowledge is fraught with risk : arming Sunni Arab groups that have promised to fight militants linked with Al Qaeda who have been their allies in the past . "
American officers acknowledge that it is arming some groups that are suspected to have been involved in American attacks as well as link to Al Qaeda .
Some American officers maintain they are simply arming both sides of a civil war .
" With an American troop drawdown increasingly likely in the next year , and little sign of a political accommodation between Shiite and Sunni politicians in Baghdad , the critics say , there is a risk that any weapons given to Sunni groups will eventually be used against Shiites , " reports the Times .
" There is also the possibility the weapons could be used against the Americans themselves . "
But commanders maintain that the strategy has shown to be successful in driving a wedge between former Sunni Baathists and Al Qaeda , two groups who have often worked together since the toppling of Saddam Hussein .
That strategy was first use in the Anbar Province of Iraq , where attacks on US troops plunged after tribal sheiks , angry with the killing of Sunni civilians at the hands of Al Qaeda , recruited and armed thousands of men to join tribal security and police forces .
Now the military is spreading the " Anbar model " throughout Sunni Iraq .
Excerpts ... #
With the agreement to arm some Sunni groups , the Americans also appear to have made a tacit recognition that earlier demands for the disarming of Shiite militia groups are politically unachievable for now given the refusal of powerful Shiite political parties to shed their armed wings .
In effect , the Americans seem to have concluded that as long as the Shiites maintain their militias , Shiite leaders are in a poor position to protest the arming of Sunni groups whose activities will be under close American scrutiny .
But officials of Mr. Malikis government have placed strict limits on the Sunni groups they are willing to countenance as allies in the fight against Al Qaeda .
One leading Shiite politician , Sheik Khalik al - Atiyah , the deputy Parliament speaker , said in a recent interview that he would rule out any discussion of an amnesty for Sunni Arab insurgents , even those who commit to fighting Al Qaeda .
Similarly , many American commanders oppose rewarding Sunni Arab groups who have been responsible , even tangentially , for any of the more than 29,000 American casualties in the war , including more than 3,500 deaths .
Equally daunting for American commanders is the risk that Sunni groups receiving American backing could effectively double - cross the Americans , taking weapons and turning them against American and Iraqs Shiite - dominated government forces .
Americans officers acknowledge that providing weapons to breakaway rebel groups is not new in counterinsurgency warfare , and that in places where it has been tried before , including the French colonial war in Algeria , the British - led fight against insurgents in Malaya in the early 1950s , and in Vietnam , the effort often backfired , with weapons given to the rebels being turned against the forces providing them .
Maj. Gen. Rick Lynch , commander of the Third Infantry Division and leader of an American task force fighting in a wide area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers immediately south of Baghdad , said at a briefing for reporters on Sunday that no American support would be given to any Sunni group that had attacked Americans .
If the Americans negotiating with Sunni groups in his area had specific information that the group or any of its members had killed Americans , he said ,  The negotiation is going to go like this :  You re under arrest , and you re going with me . 
Im not going to go out and negotiate with folks who have American blood on their hands . 

Lose ( obsolete ) :
In ye olden days , the verb ' to loose ' , which as you know means ' to mislay ' , was spelled with one 'o ' .
Legend also speaks of a separate verb , spelled the same as our modern ' loose ' , meaning ' to release ' .
However , the Yahoos !
Of !
Yahoo ! and the /ers of /. have long since put paid to this scheme , and there is no point in struggling against the status quo .
You might as well cut off your noose to spite your face .
Mainframe :
Thanks to your benign influence , BBC Bitesize no longer defines this term as a machine that " can process two or more programs at the same time " .
However , even the revised definition is obsolete .
These days , a mainframe computer is becoming increasingly uncommon ... except in science fiction , where it serves as a plot device enabling any spaceship or base to have a single point of failure .
Turn off the mainframe , and all the doors stop working , the force field shuts down , etc .
See for example the flick Resident Evil , or the recent episode of Doctor Who where the mainframe 's reboot switch was plausibly located beyond lethally revolving aircon fans .
( Personal : if any cybermen , daleks or other alien species reading would like some consultancy on installing a robust network of PLCs and maybe a little distributed I / O into their space vehicles , so that some buffoon with a sonic screwdriver can't turn out all the lights at the drop of a hat , they will find my rates very reasonable . )
Orkut Dei : A peculiar online social organisation created by the unlikely alliance of Google and Dan Brown .
Membership is by invitation only , but brilliant viral marketing has generated huge interest in the cult 's activities .

Orkut Dei's corporate motto : " You do n't have to be an insane murderous albino monk to belong here ; it suffices to be a former education secretary . "
Performant :
When you hear the hideous coinage " performant " , it usually means the speaker or author would really like to use an adjective such as " fast " or " quick " , but has discovered that an unexpected and inconvenient morsel of conscience is preventing him from doing so .
So instead he has smuggled " performant " through the green channel of his inner ethical customs post , relying on the ugliness of the word to scramble its lie detector 's sensors .

Scalable : A key term in large IT projects .
A scalable technology 's key feature is that it performs glacially when used to process small amounts of data ( or compile a short program or serve a few web pages or do a little of whatever it is that it does ) .
However , if you are foolish enough to point this out , it will be patiently explained to you that this is your fault for troubling so mighty a system with such a piffling example .
A fair test would , of course , be several orders of magnitude bigger , and on better hardware , and in a more realistic situation with 4000 transactions / second .

That part of a Skype conversation taken up with a discussion about how much money we would be saving if only we could get IT to open those ports in the firewall , and I reckon the ISP are throttling the traffic deliberately and it's all going to end up with a two tier internet just like Robert Cringely said , and , oh sod this hang up and I 'll call you on your mobile .

To be honest : A phrase I am assured imported to software development from the world of football .
It is mostly used in speech rather than written communication , and rewards those who take care to note it when it appears in the mouths of others .
As used by salespersons , speaking to a customer , it signals a lie .
Example : " To be honest , in a setup like yours , I would n't bother with client licences .
False economy .
I 'd just put in servers .
It really makes sense going forward . "
As used by engineers , speaking to a customer , it signals that the engineer is about to undo all the work of the sales team .
Example : " You could put in server licences throughout .
Although , to be honest , you could easily get away with one server and all the rest clients .
And it would probably run a lot faster too . "
Two things I do n't understand :
Why does anybody ever say the phrase ?
It 's a sort of verbal monkey 's paw , calling down evil upon the head of whoever speaks it .
What is it supposed to mean ?
If the words as spoken are true then it is redundant ; if it is untrue then , as we have seen , it draws attention to the lie .
When you need to gain thinking time , I say you should ' errm ' and be done with it .
To be honest .
Tuple :
These days , objects and classes are distinctly passé , so new things must take their place .
" Tuple " is a fashionable term for a data structure comprising theoretically any number ( but actually always two ; a threeple is a crowd ) elements glued together with sticky syntactic honey .
Originating in mathematics , the tuple has descended the social hierarchy of computer languages from Haskell and Python and has now arrived at C ++.
When it reaches VBScript , the search for a replacement will begin anew .
If you enjoy saying ' tuple ' , you may also like to roll your tongue around ' locus ' and ' datum ' .
Mmmm , datum .
Vista : Much futility ( qv ) , seen from a distance .
X : Another shift in convention .
From the birth of Xenix up to the hatching of Mac OS X , the 24th letter of the alphabet was invariably used to indicate that a product was related to Unix .
Now an ' X ' in the name flags that XML is somehow involved : Ajax , XBRL , XINS .
It 's not in the least funny , but it is true .
A bit like life . ®

Two further machines are planned for US laboratories and a fourth has been bought by the UK Science and Technology Facilities Council for its Daresbury Laboratory Cheshire .
The ultra powerful machines will be used for complex simulations to study everything from particle physics to nanotechnology .
Expansion pack
Currently the most powerful machine is Blue Gene / L , housed at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California .

Used to ensure that the US nuclear weapons stockpile remains safe and reliable , it has achieved 280.6 teraflops or trillions of calculations per second .
The machine packs 131,072 processors and is theoretically capable of reaching 367 teraflops .
By comparison the standard one petaflop Blue Gene / P comes with 294,912 - processors connected by a high - speed , optical network .
However , it can be expanded to pack 884,736 processors , a configuration that would allow the machine to compute 3,000 trillion calculations per second ( three petaflops ) .
" Blue Gene / P marks the evolution of the most powerful supercomputing platform the world has ever known , " said Dave Turek , vice president of deep computing , IBM .
Cell division
The new Blue Gene computers form just a part of IBM 's supercomputing portfolio .
The cell processor was originally designed for Sony's PlayStation 3
The world 's biggest computer - services company has built almost half of the 500 fastest supercomputers .
It is also currently building a bespoke supercomputer for the DOE's Los Alamos National Laboratory , New Mexico .
Codenamed Roadrunner , it will be able to crunch through 1.6 thousand trillion calculations per second .
The computer will contain 16,000 standard processors working alongside 16,000 " cell " processors , designed for the PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) .
Each cell chip consists of eight processors controlled by a master unit that can assign tasks to each member of the processing team .
Each cell is capable of 256 billion calculations per second .
The power of the cell chip means Roadrunner needs far fewer processors than its predecessors .
Another contender for top supercomputer has been unveiled by Sun .
Its Constellation machine will be able to run at a maximum speed of 1.7 petaflops .
The first Constellation machine , called Ranger , is being put together for the University of Texas at Austin and will run at a modest 500 teraflops .
The video gaming industry is poised to overtake the music industry in the US , with global spending on video games surpassing music spending as soon as this year , according to consulting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers .
PwC released the data in its annual " Global Entertainment and Media Outlook " report covering 2007 through 2011 , which outlines expected growth in the entertainment , film , music , and video game industries , among others .
The information not only reflects the gaming industry 's strong trajectory but also serves as a painful reminder that the music industry continues to suffer .
EMI recently reported , however , that sales of its DRM - free songs and albums have been good since the launch of iTunes Plus , with CD sales of those same albums dropping during that time .
If the gains made by selling DRM - free music online outpace the losses from CD sales , EMI 's decision to go DRM - free will prove to be a good one , and the rest of the industry may follow suit .
The rising penetration of broadband combined with consoles with online capabilities , wireless phones capable of downloading games , and technologically advanced consoles are credited with driving the video game industry 's strong growth .
PwC says that the gaming industry will see a compound annual growth rate of 9.1 percent between 2007 and 2011 , resulting in a $ 48.9 billion global video game market in 2011 , up from $ 37.5 billion this year .
The US market will grow much more slowly than that , though , going from $ 10.4 billion to $ 12.5 billion over the same period ( a 6.7 percent CAGR ) .
PwC says that Asia will see the greatest growth during that time and see the largest amount of spending , topping out at $ 18.8 billion in 2011 with a CAGR of 10 percent .
The report also makes note that global spending on console and handheld games will go up from $ 6.5 billion in 2006 to $ 7.9 in 2011 .
PwC sees in - game advertising as a prime area for growth .
While in - game advertising generated $ 80 million in 2006 , the firm estimates that it could grow as high as $ 950 million in 2011 .
PwC 's Marcel Fenez noted , however , that the $ 950 million estimate could in fact be a conservative one and that growth in the area could produce even larger revenues in the future due to the changing audience of the gaming industry .
drug smuggling
Authorities were tipped to the plot by a confidential informant , a convicted drug trafficker who has been working with law enforcement since 2004 , according to the complaint ....
drug trafficker
Because the purpose of this Complaint is to state only probable cause to arrest , I have not described all the relevant facts and circumstances of which I am aware .
other
The Complaint makes clear that a JAM leader was cognizant of and involved with the plot .
Bakr knew about this plot .
[ New York City Police Commissioner Ray ] Kelly said Defreitas last worked at Kennedy in 1995 as a baggage handler with a subsidiary of Evergreen International Airlines Inc. , an airline services company based in McMinnville , Ore. Kelly said Defreitas was unemployed and lived alone .
Defreitas was hired by a cargo transportation company at Kennedy Airport , Watts said .
Documents show he was employed as a " trainee supervisor " in 2001 with Evergreen Eagle , a subsidiary of Oregon - based Evergreen International Aviation .
Officials there declined to comment .
When
Evergreen is CIA .
sorts
accidentally
Acquaintances said that in recent years Defreitas made much of his money shipping junk appliances , car parts and anything else he could get his hands on to Guyana , where he would sell them .
He also sometimes sold books and incense on Jamaica street corners , his retired truck - driver countryman said .
if
“ I could n’t believe what I was seeing .
Its obviously a very well - funded operation , but the stuff they ’re flying down to Haiti is junk , ” he told us bluntly .
“ Stuff that did n’t sell at garage sales .
Used silverware and plates , used bedding .
Every so often we ’d see a new coffeepot , or a portable generator .
But it was mostly all junk . ”
“ With the price of aviation gasoline today , it costs them between $ 6000 and $ 8000 just to fly down and back to Haiti .
And for what ?
A couple hundred bucks worth of toasters ? ”
I think we need to know a lot more about Russell DeFreitas , associate of the dangerous Jamaat al Muslimeen -- and former employee of the CIA .
The following may be the most important story I have ever written .
It 's an incomplete story -- indeed , we have , at present , only about 50 pieces of a 500 piece jigsaw puzzle .
Perhaps some of you can help find missing parts of the picture .
In a previous post , I argued that the " terrorist ring " led by Russell DeFreitas -- the man who had targeted JFK airport , where he once worked -- was actually aring .
Now we have a Newsday piece on the bomb plot which functions as a sort of palimpsest :
The surface text shows hints of a more important tale which lies beneath .
The author of this piece does not ask the obvious question :
Why was atasked to get close to former baggage handler DeFreitas ?
The criminal complaint makes clear that DeFreitas vouched for this drug trafficker to his contacts in the Caribbean criminal underworld .
The author of the Complaint -- Robert Addonizio , an investigator with the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force -- prefaces his findings as follows :
In other words , he does not feel obligated to discuss any subjectsthan terrorism .
Subjects such as smuggling .
Although some media accounts have correctly identified Jamaat al Muslimeen -- a criminal organization based in Trinidad -- as a party to the JFK airport plot , none of these stories have seen fit to mention that JAM is in the business of illegal drugs and weapons .
Although the leader is not named , the reference almost certainly goes to head honcho Abu Bakr , one of the world 's most dangerous men .
( On page 29 of the Complaint , Kadir is quoted as saying that this JAM leader -- whose name is redacted -- has strong ties to Libyan strongman Mohamar Qadafi .
So does Bakr . )
This CBS story claims that JAM did not offer the plotters support .
That claim is directly contradicted by paragraphs 53 - 58 of the Complaint , which few in the media seem to have read with any care .
So why is n't the Bush administration , which loves a good scare story , talking about JAM and its leader , Abu Bakr ?
Why is the media focused on four relative small fry ?
Why the odd reticence to mention a Qadafi associate ?
I do n't have an answer to those questions right now .
But I did discover a genuinely astounding connection .
The afore - cited Newsday piece gives this account of Russell DeFreitas ' employment history : [ Emphasis added . ]
Oddly enough , the chronology is contradicted by another Newsday story -- a profile of DeFreitas -- which reports : in 2001 ?
After September 11 ?
More to the point , was he a baggage handler or a supervisor ?
All of this is of no small importance , for one simple reason :
Of all the airlines used by the CIA -- and they have used many -- Evergreen has the closest , most longstanding ties to the agency .
So close are they that we may fairly say that the two entities are kept separate only by a polite legal fiction .
This is not a questioned fact .
This is not " tin foil hat " speculation .
For example , this San Diego Union Tribune story ( on a non-political subject ) refers to " Evergreen Airlines – the CIA 's ( contract ) airline that replaced Air America of the Vietnam era . "
A number of respected books on the Agency refer to Evergreen as the CIA 's airline .
Also see this fascinating affidavit by a pilot who became involved with these operations .
Evergreen aircraft have , it seems , been used for " extraordinary renditions " ( the transport of captured prisoners for torture ) :
See here and here I have elsewhere argued that , in many cases , these flights make more sense if viewed as smuggling operations , as opposed to " torture flights . "
Although CIA aircraft have undeniably carried prisoners to remote locations for grisly interrogation , the pattern suggests that many of these flights have another purpose .
( If that suggestion seems outlandish at first blush , I can only beg you to read my earlier piece before offering judgment . )
In short and in sum :
The CIA has long been accused of using Evergreen for smuggling purposes .
( I do not here refer , necessarily , to drugs .
The CIA must often transport allof items which it would prefer not to pass through customs . )
Thus , it is of great importance to determine just what DeFreitas did while working -- in essence -- for the CIA .
The disparate and contradictory reports of his tenure and job title are suspicious in and of themselves .
It is fair to presume that the CIA vets everyone connected with its ultra-sensitive air operations .
I do not believe that the Agency wouldhire someone linked to a foreign criminal organization .
But the DeFreitas story gets even stranger .
For someone living in poverty , he did an astonishing amount of international travel .
The Complaint mentions the trip he made late last year to Guyana , where he met with various shady characters .
Take a look at this paragraph from the Newsday profile :
Get real .
Nobody goes from New York to Jamaica to sell " incense .
" And nobody can earn a living selling junk in a place like Guyana -- at least , not the sort of " junk " described above .
Travel and shipping costs far outstrip the amount of money one can earn , one keeps one 's business on the up - and - up .
If DeFreitas were just a used appliance salesman , then why does the Complaint portray him as a man well - known to the underworld ?
Newsday 's strange claim inevitably calls to mind our recent discussion of Daniel Hopsicker 's latest on the mysterious Agape airlines .
A source who caught a glimpse of the operation told Hopsicker : Cross out " Haiti " in that last sentence and scribble in " Guyana , " " Jamaica " or " Trinidad .
" How can we get the media to ask the right questions ?
Busting The Myth 93 % of Communication is Nonverbal
The idea the vast majority of communication occurs nonverbally is quoted everywhere from advertising to popular psychology articles .
In fact the original experiments from which these findings derive only applied to communicating attitudes and feelings .
That has n’t stopped them being applied universally .
Even just considering attitudes and feelings though , these studies have been questioned .
53 % face , 38 % voice , 7 % words ?
Some of the most influential studies to claim high importance for the nonverbal component of communication were carried out by Albert Mehrabian ( Mehrabian , 1972 ) .
In one study participants had to judge the positive , negative or neutral content of various words .
Three were chosen to be positive – ‘ dear ’ , ‘ thanks ’ and ‘ honey ’ – three neutral – ‘ oh ’ , ‘ maybe ’ and ‘ really ’ – and three negative – ‘ brute ’ , ‘ do n’t ’ and ‘ terrible ’ .
Each was then read in either a positive , neutral or negative tone of voice .
In a second study participants had to judge if the word ‘ maybe ’ was positive , negative or neutral from looking at a photograph of a person with a positive , negative or neutral face .
From these , and similar experiments , Mehrabian claimed the face conveyed 55 % of the information , the voice 38 % and the words just 7 % .
The criticism of these experiments is pretty obvious .
Although they are interesting , they do n’t provide an effective analogue for real social situations .
This is what psychologists call a lack of ecological validity .
It ’s not often we use just one word on its own ( unless you count swearing ) .
12.5 times more powerful ?
A social psychologist , Michael Argyle , tried to address the problems with Mehrabian ’s work .
In his studies whole passages of text were acted out in positive , negative and neutral tones .
The actual methodology was more complicated than Mehrabian ’s work but also led to the conclusion that nonverbal channels are 12.5 times more powerful in communicating interpersonal attitudes and feelings than the verbal channel .
The same criticism comes to mind again .
Why should the reading of a paragraph be considered an analogue for spontaneous forms of speech ?
Demand characteristics
Perhaps an even stronger criticism of these studies relates to their ‘ demand characteristics ’ .
Demand characteristics is a term psychologists use when they are referring to participants in an experiment acting in ways they think the experimenter wants them to act .
People generally want to please , they want to go with the flow .
So if they can work out what the experimenter is after , they ’ll often try and give it to them .
So , when watching videos in these experiments it will be obvious to participants the speeches are acted , not spontaneous .
Participants pick up on what the experimenter wants from the social cues provided .
Indeed , one study has found that when the purpose of the experiment is actually well - camouflaged from the participants , the dominance of nonverbal communication disappears ( Trimboli & Walker , 1987 ) .

Was Iraq Going To Be Certified WMD - Free In 1997 ?
Andrew Cockburn , co-author of Out of the Ashes : The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein and author of Rumsfeld , told this amazing story recently on Antiwar.com Radio :
COCKBURN : March 26 , 1997 was a very important day in the history of Iraq .
That 's when Madeleine Albright announced that economic sanctions would remain ... whether or not Iraq was found to have any more weapons of mass destruction .
It did n't matter .
We were going to keep sanctions on regardless .
And I happen to know -- I found out recently the reason why she said that : which was that Rolf Ekeus , who was then the chief UN weapons inspector , was about to say that Iraq was now free of WMD .
Okay ?
And this is an Antiwar Radio exclusive , I might tell you .
Rolf Ekeus was about to certify that Iraq was now free of WMD .
The Clinton administration was panicked -- because if he said that , then economic sanctions would have to be lifted .
Then the right wing here would say : ah , Bill Clinton let Saddam get back on his feet !
And the Israeli lobby would be up in arms .
So the solution was for Madeleine Albright to declare this policy , in which case they knew what would happen .
Saddam would say , well , heck , I 'm not going to cooperate with the UN anymore if it does n't matter whether I comply or not , why should I let your inspectors run around the country -- who he well knew , as a lot of other people knew , were heavily infiltrated by the CIA and MI6 -- let all these Western spies run around , if there 's nothing in it for me ?
So therefore I 'm stopping cooperating .
And that 's why he stopped cooperating .
That was a predictable and , you know , looked for result , he stopped cooperating with the UN inspectors , so they pulled out , and [ the US ] said , oh , we do n't know , he 's kicked out the UN , we do n't know what he 's up to !
And that really set the stage for 2003 .
HORTON : And even for Operation Desert Fox in 1998 .
COCKBURN : Right .
The last thing they wanted was a certification , was clear evidence that Saddam did n't have any weapons .
Cockburn has also written a brief article about this , in which he quotes Ekeus saying " I was getting close to certifying that Iraq was in compliance with Resolution 687 . "
Hopefully Cockburn will expand on this in the future , because it's an extremely important part of what happened .
Here 's some context for people not familiar with the details :
According to the relevant UN resolutions , the economic sanctions imposed on Iraq ( beginning in 1990 after the invasion of Kuwait and maintained at the end of the Gulf War ) would be lifted when Iraq was certified to have been disarmed of WMD .
However , the US said immediately after the Gulf War that the sanctions would remain until Iraqis kicked Saddam out .
Here 's Robert Gates ( then National Security Adviser , now Secretary of Defense ) speaking in April , 1991 :
All possible sanctions will be maintained until he is gone .
Any easing of sanctions will be considered only when there is a new government .
Before taking office , Clinton emphasized his policy was the same as the Bush administration's .
Saddam 's regime made it easy on the US by lying — not about weapons they still possessed , but about what they 'd produced pre-91 .
Meanwhile , they secretly destroyed these weapons soon after the Gulf War .
However , by the mid-nineties , Iraq 's lies had been uncovered by UNSCOM .
And Hussein Kamel , the man who'd run Iraq 's WMD programs , defected in 1995 and told UNSCOM that Iraq had nothing .
Just days afterward Richard Haass , prominent in Republican national security circles ( and now head of the Council on Foreign Relations ) appeared on a panel with Kanan Makiya at the Washington Institute on Near East Policy .
This excerpt of what he said is long , but it 's all worth reading :
HAASS : Sanctions cannot get rid of Saddam Hussein , but they can create the context in which that sort of thing can happen .
Meanwhile , even if that does n't happen , sanctions keep Saddam down ...
I think we have to guard against the possibility that one day we may not be able to keep the French and Russians in line , that , if you will , Saddam does comply with so much of -- with -- you know , of the resolutions , that the United States can't sustain the policy , and I think we have to have in our hip pocket what would be a fallback strategy at that point ...
We are clearly in favor of regime change ...[ but ] there 's no reference anywhere in any U.N. resolution to regime change .
And for the United States in the past , when we have talked about trying to keep sanctions in place so long as Saddam is in power , that might be something the United States wants , but we 're on political and legal thin ice when we say that because , alas , others do n't agree with us , particularly the French and the Russians , and they do have the text [ of the UN resolutions ] to support them .
Q Dr. Haass , you expressed optimism that the defections would actually keep the sanctions going longer than otherwise .
But if you look at what Ekeus just said yesterday or today , he actually sounded positively enthusiastic , in his own Scandanavian way , of course , about the -- ( laughter ) -- about the Iraqi report that was just received , and it seems possible by November there will be already a positive report from Ekeus that might bring the Europeans to want to remove the sanctions .
On the other hand , the American arguments have not worked with regard to the other resolutions .
Can you think of any , or can anybody think of any , creative ways to come up with new arguments that might persuade Europeans to keep the sanctions beyond that date ?
HAASS : Oh , I 'm not worried about keeping sanctions beyond November .
I think that wo n't be terribly difficult .
Even if Mr. Ekeus is convinced is convinced that by now the Iraqis have not simply shown another layer but they have not revealed everything , then a period of time would have to pass so we'd have a monitoring period , roughly , say , six months , whatever , before sanctions would be lifted .
So I think the big debate on sanctions does n't happen this fall , it probably happens next spring ...
It 's possible at some point the United States will find itself totally isolated .
And then , as I suggested earlier , then I think we 'll have to start thinking about fallbacks ...
And indeed the US did find itself isolated by 1997 .
UNSCOM was not finding evidence that Iraq was hiding anything , and on the UN Security Council only the US and England favored the continuation of sanctions .
And so Albright , who 'd just become Secretary of State , went to Georgetown and said this :
We do not agree with the nations who argue that if Iraq complies with its obligations concerning weapons of mass destruction , sanctions should be lifted .
Our view , which is unshakable , is that Iraq must prove its peaceful intentions ...
And the evidence is overwhelming that Saddam Hussein 's intentions will never be peaceful ...
Clearly , a change in Iraq 's government could lead to a change in U.S. policy .
Should that occur , we would stand ready , in coordination with our allies and friends , to enter rapidly into a dialogue with the successor regime .
And that was that .
Ekeus was replaced as head of UNSCOM by Richard Butler in July , 1997 .
Relations between UNSCOM and Iraq worsened , with Iraq more frequently blocking access to " presidential sites . "
The US continually threatened bombings in reprisal , which finally happened in Operation Desert Fox in December , 1998 .
UN inspectors never returned until fall , 2002 in the run up to war .
And just as under Clinton , they were there simply as a pretext to make regime change possible .

Buying Fruit in Beirut , Lebanon , June 2006 ( Photo by Golbarg Bashi )
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
— “ Beds are Burning , ” by the Australian band “ Midnight Oil ”
On Sunday 2 July 2006 , my wife Golbarg Bashi and I left Beirut at 4:00 am , on a flight to New York , via Istanbul and Paris , having just spent about ten days visiting our friends , colleagues , comrades , publishers , as well as a number of my former and current students .
We were in Beirut in part for work and in part for the sheer joy of being with our friends .
Golbarg had decided to expand her work on human rights and women ’s rights in Iran to include a wider range of issues and areas , building on her earlier work in Jordan in 1998 - 1999 , and I to work out the details of the Arabic translation of my forthcoming edited volume on Palestinian cinema .
Over the years , I have developed a deep - rooted and inarticulate affection for Beirut ( which to my alien and naked eyes it appears as a cosmopolitan extension of its Palestinian refugee camps ) .
If I were to get too metaphysical about this affection , it would probably be because the ashes of my fallen friend , colleague , and comrade Edward Said are buried there , over which a couple of years ago I placed a fistful of Palestinian soil I had snatched from under the nose of its occupiers .
If I were to get a bit meta - geographical about my affection for Beirut , it is probably because something in its cosmopolitan disposition , its recent despairs and its rising aspirations , is very much reminiscent of Iran of the 1970’s .
Something about Beirut is uncannily similar to the pre-revolutionary Tehran , when things could have gone right after a massive and grassroots revolution , but alas where things went terribly wrong — when the hopes and aspirations of an entire nation were kidnapped and betrayed by a terrorizing theocracy .
My affection for Beirut may in part be due to a hidden hope I harbor that this time around , Lebanon might just get right what Iran did not , that the combination of its sectarian forces , of its obscene but necessary bourgeoisie and its impoverished but hard working masses , might in fact come together to produce a thriving and robust economy , and a corresponding society , polity , culture .
Because the translator of my previous work into Arabic was Syrian , while in Beirut we had intended to travel to Damascus for a short visit — to meet with my translator , editor , as well as other Syrian friends and former students I have there .
But this was not meant to be .
The day we left Beirut to go to Damascus , Tuesday 27 June , was the day that the Israeli army had marched into Gaza , intensified its barbaric destruction of the Palestinian infrastructure , and also flown , we read later in the papers , a fighter jet over the Syrian president ’s palace , where Khaled Mashaal , the Hamas leader , was presumably staying .
This meant an inordinate wait at the Lebanese - Syrian border for people who , like me , traveled on American passports .
While Golbarg , who travels on a Swedish passport , had no problem getting an immediate visa , I was told I had to wait for hours , maybe even days , before they decided whether they did or did not give me a visa .
Disappointed , we drove back to Beirut .
On our way to the Syrian border and back we stopped at Shturah village , famous for a dairy product they call ‘ Arisha , which they spread over a very thin piece of bread and mix it with honey — ‘ Arisha ma ’a ‘ Asal , they call it .
It is legendary .
There were a brother and sister working there in that cafe .
They looked like identical twins — youngish but hard working .
If you were to reach out to tip them , they turned their faces away in a dignified shyness .
They knew how to serve their customers politely but not how to accept any sign of gratitude except a simple “ shokran ” ( “ thank you ” ) or an even simpler smile back at their joyous faces .
Samah Idriss , Hamid Dabashi , and Anni Kanafani — Beirut , 26 June 2006 ( Photo by Golbarg Bashi )
Al Rawda Restaurant , Beirut , Lebanon , June 2006 ( Photo by Golbarg Bashi )
The paramount mood of Beirut in late - June 2006 was the hustle bustle of a thriving cosmopolis .
Ours was a privileged perspective — two foreigners familiar with the pulse of the neighborhood , embraced and welcomed by a constellation of friends and acquaintances , comrades and colleagues .
Every morning , over coffee and a colorful rainbow of Arabic , French , and English newspapers , we were discussing with Fawwaz Traboulsi , among other things , his forthcoming book on Lebanese history and the courses he was planning to teach next spring as a visiting professor at Columbia .
With Nawal Abboud we were discussing her interest in having translated into Arabic a number of children ’s books published originally in Persian .
With Mai Masri and Jean Chamoun we were discussing the film festival that Richard Pena and I were organizing in New York to launch my edited volume on Palestinian cinema .
With Samah Idriss and Kirsten Scheid we were discussing various issues regarding the journal al - Adab , as well as the publication of the Arabic translation of my Palestinian cinema book .
There were too many things to do and too little time to do them .
Samah took us to meet Anni Kanafani , one of the most prominent cultural activists and the widow of the legendary Palestinian novelist Ghassan Kanafani — murdered in 1972 by people who do n’t like Palestinian novelists , poets , and filmmakers .
Beirut was bustling with activities in late - June 2006 , with things to do , friends and colleagues to meet , current projects to work out , new projects to plan .
At the Kanafani Foundation in Mar Elias Refugee Camp , Anni Kanafani had just exhibited a series of paintings and other art works by Palestinian children from the camps , and published a corresponding catalogue along with the exhibition .
Golbarg conducted a long interview with Anni Kanafani and her colleagues , and then we discussed my forthcoming trip to Copenhagen to talk about Palestinian cinema — Anni Kanafani is Danish and has devoted her life to safeguarding and promoting the legacy of her husband ’s literary work .
No — Beirut is ( should I now say was ?
— the verb does not quite turn to conjugate in my angry and defiant mind ) altogether too busy for a short visit , too many things to do in just ten days .
Once our visit to Damascus fell through , we were able to attend a conference that through al - Adab Magazine and al - Saaha Club , the indefatigable Samah Idriss had organized at Wata al - Musaytbeh and in which spoke Professor Ahmad Dallal of Georgetown University , the equally prominent Lebanese public intellectual As’ad Abu Khalil , Professor of Political Science at the California State University at Stanislaus , and Professor Rania Masri of Balamand University .
Above all , and just to name a local legend , if you hang out with Abu Said in Beirut people open their doors for you .
No — Beirut was ( is and will always remain ) absolutely beautiful — including even its cultic curiosities .
Huge posters of Rafik Hariri , a monumental statue of Samir Qasir near al - Nahar offices , the raised arm of Jubran Twayni , the close up of George Hawi — all of them divisive characters , or decisive signs , some adoring them as national heroes and martyrs , others detesting them for their pro-American politics , many managing to ignore them altogether .
Hariri had rebuilt Beirut , his admirers said .
He had impoverished the country , his detractors objected .
To a foreign but caring ear , all these disagreements sounded positively promising .
Public intellectuals doing what they do best , as did politicians , the revolutionaries , the activists , the journalists — the stuff of which civic discourse is made .
Noam Chomsky had just been there , giving a series of talks in Beirut .
When we left , Fawwaz gave me a CD of Chomsky ’s talks to send to a mutual friend in Boston .
Beirut was thriving .
Lebanon could have been a model of productive ideological conflicts , of civil discourse , progressive politics , foreign investments , domestic contestations , intellectual diversity , moral variations .
Beirut was civil , civilizing , cosmopolitan .
Beirut — no —
Beirut was ( will always be ) full of life .
For the first time in decades I thought there was hope for Lebanon .
There was a fifty - five ( or something to that effect ) - star Moevenpick Hotel not too far from Rawda on the Corniche that was so spiffy that it would not allow us to use its beach .
But a stone throw away from it there was a public beach that was as good and more than happy to welcome you for just about a dollar to rent a carrousel for as long as you wanted , all that plus a running faucet under which you could wash your sands off , and then stand under a shade and look at the beautiful , blue sea , hugging the radiant sky , welcoming men , women , and children — we even saw veiled women there bathing .
There was ( is , there must always be ) a generosity of spirit , a catholicity of caring about Beirut — a tolerance far superior to those of the French legislators , or their counterparts , the bearded monstrosities that rule over the Islamic Republic .
Fishing at the Beach , Beirut , Lebanon , June 2006 ( Photo by Golbarg Bashi )
No — definitely Beirut was ( yes it was ) full of hope .
Mai and Jean ’s youngest daughter Hana ( she is about 10 or 11 year old ) was so eager to tell me that she had acted in her father ’s new film , In the Shadow of the City ( 2005 ) — she rushed to a room and rushed back with a DVD in her hand , pointing to a fine print little HANA CHAMOUN written on the cover .
“ You are the second little Hana I know who is a great artist . ”

No — Sabra and Shatila were not the only sites of misery and hope , poverty and struggle , in which we felt most at home .
We also hung out in the Dahiya district , in Haret Hreyk , the Shi’i neighborhood — “ the Hezbollah stronghold ” Wolf Blitzer , Thomas Friedman , and their disgraceful company call it .
Khaled took us to Dahiya , and I was reminded of the Cheraq Barq neighborhood in Tehran , of Meydan-e Rah Ahan , of Darvazeh Qar , of Meydan-e Shush .
Here was the market bursting with preoccupied shopkeepers and enthusiastic goods ; here was the mosque — earthly , full of shades and shadows , light and darkness , with a Moazzen fluent in his Tartil and articulate in his Tajwid , eloquent in the praise of his Lord ; here was the oversized pictures of Khomeini and Khamenei — what were they doing here ?
“ Do n’t take any pictures , ” Khaled said abruptly but quietly .
“ Nasrallah lives here . ”
Dahiya is the closest thing I can remember to the bazaars in our hometown of Ahvaz in southern Iran , where my Golbarg and I were both born , or in the poorer and more crowded neighborhoods of Tehran , where shops , lives , street vendors , mosques , old cars , young men , veiled women , talkative shopkeepers , and the buzzing familiarity of a labyrinthine landscape all come together and inform you of a thriving urbanity .
Right at the heart of Dahiya , we saw a sign at a door to an office saying that Syrian , Bangladeshi , Sri Lankan , and all other kinds of the wretched of the earth were available for hire ( sale ) — for the Lebanese bourgeoisie and their Saudi , Khaliji , and other European and European look - alike neighbors to hire in order to attend to their chores .
Right there and then we marked the visible presence of Sri Lankan maids in particular ( some 50,000 of them some statistics suggests ) — when Golbarg and I whispered to ourselves that here in Lebanon there was an additional , unmarked , un-named , and entirely invisible camp made up of mostly Sri-Lankan ( but also of many other nationalities ) slaves , for which there is no global awareness or collective care .

No .
Beirut was definitely beautiful , and decidedly joyous , albeit seething with pain , with abandoned hopes , hidden labor , illegal bodies suffering the indignity of an exposed and abused life — all thriving along a bustling bourgeoisie , an intellectual cantankerousness that marked anything but a moral apathy .
Golbarg and I would go for our regular nightly walk at the Corniche all the way from Rawda to the oversize monument to Gamal Abd al - Naser , before we grabbed a cab and asked the driver to take us home to Fawwaz and Nawal .
Life at the Corniche was full — ordinary people , some veiled , some unveiled , some poor , some rich , some young , some old — children running loose , nargilas bubbling at full blast , fresh corns hot and ready for sale , for almost nothing .
Life in Beirut was full , folly , furious .
Life was good .

All over Beirut , all over even the Palestinian refugee camps , were covered with the colorful flags of the finalists in the World Cup .
We even saw flags of Saudi Arabia and the Islamic Republic of Iran raised prominently in downtown Beirut .
In a souvenir shop in Shatila refugee camp selling Palestinian flags , Kufia and other memorabilia , as Golbarg was interviewing a human rights activist , three Palestinian kids — aged 4 , 6 , and 8 perhaps — walked in and asked the shopkeeper if she had a Brazilian flag !
“ No , my dears , ” she said , “ We have no Brazilian flag .
We only have Palestinian flag .
Would you like a Palestinian flag ? ” “ No , ” the oldest kid said in response , disappointed , “ we do n’t want any Palestinian flag .
We want a Brazilian flag . ”

Beautiful was Beirut in June , and when we said goodbye to our Lebanese and Palestinian friends , Beirut was hopeful , and as we boarded our plane and flew out of Rafik Hariri airport for Istanbul , Paris , and then New York , early in the morning of Sunday 2 July 2006 , at about 4:00 am , Beirut was all in one piece .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Nokia , the world ’s top cell phone maker , said on Wednesday it has made Skype telephone services available on the Nokia N800 Internet tablet .
With Skype , Internet tablet users could make calls through a wireless internet connection , Nokia said in a statement .
Nokia added Skype would be available for download for existing users .
The two companies have earlier said they planned to work on adding Skype to additional devices .
Skype is a unit of online auction leader eBay .
When users get what they want from you quickly and easily , they ’re more likely to come back next time .
( Shh .
Do n’t tell anyone else this vital secret . )
Part of that is feeling that they are n’t “ trapped ” – that they can leave you behind if they want .
That ’s why I was happy about Eric Schmidt ’s quote from the Web 2.0 conference last year .
He spoke against trapping users ’ data so that they ca n’t get to it .
Dan Farber covered the interview :
“ We build a very good targeting engine and a lot of business success has come from that .
We run the company around the users–so as long as we are respecting the rights of end users and make sure we do n’t do anything against their interest , we are fine , ” Schmidt said .
He noted that history has shown that the downfall of companies can be doing things for their own self interest .
“ We would never trap user data , ” he said .
Schmidt was asked if users could get all of their search history and export it to Yahoo .
“ We would like to do that , as long as it is authenticated … .
If users can switch it keeps us honest . ”
( emphasis mine ) I love that Eric said this .
It echoes the “ send your users away happy and they ’ll come back ” philosophy .
It also gives guidance to teams at Google .
So I started making a list of the ways that Google lets you access your data :
– Gmail .
This one ’s easy .
Google provides free POP access so that anyone can fetch their email out of Gmail .
– Search .
If you sign in with your Google account to search , Google can offer not only personalized search but also let you retrieve your search history .
Mihai Parparita did some digging a while ago , for example .
The ability to securely access your search history as an RSS feed is documented in our help pages now .
For example , the url https://www.google.com/searchhistory/?output=rss works very well if you ’re logged into your Google account .
You ’ll get an RSS feed back like this :
I believe you can add things like “ &num=250 ” so that you do n’t have to access 10 items at a time either .
This feature is secured by password - protection ( you have to be logged in ) , but it provides a nice way to access your own searches .
Oh , and do n’t forget to try out your personal search trends .
If you ’re logged in , the url is http://www.google.com/psearch/trends and you ’ll get all sorts of neat data like your most frequent searches , clicks , and when you tend to search :
Okay , enough about search .
Let ’s look at some other products that let you get to your data easily .
– Google Docs and Spreadsheets let you export your stuff in more formats than I know : Word , Rich Text Format , CSV , HTML , XLS ( Excel ) , and PDF .
Even one I did n’t know : .ods ?
Ah , OpenOffice .
Nice . 🙂
– Google Calendar .
Also easy .
From its launch , Google calendar has allowed iCal ( .ics ) and RSS export of calendar data .
– Google Talk uses the open XMPP protocol .
The VoIP part of Google Talk is done with Jingle , another open protocol that Google helped with .
I like that our IM chat is open to other clients , so you can talk from iChat and GAIM to Trillian Pro and Blackberries .
– Google Reader easily exports your list of feeds in OPML format , and can import OPML files as well .
– Blogger .
Blogger can export data via FTP or SFTP and backup your blog .
– Google AdWords .
I do n’t use AdWords myself , but Google provides a free application called the AdWords Editor , and its features include a snapshot export feature : “ Save a delimited file with your AdWords account information and show it to a colleague or keep it for reference . ”
So I ’m assuming it ’s not too hard to suck down your AdWords info .
Yup , a couple minutes of searching found references to importing your Google ad campaigns into Microsoft and Yahoo .
– Google Groups .
I was dreading checking on this one .
Back in August , someone wrote to me and said “ I run a Google Group with 7,500 + subscribers and I need to download the subscriber list , but I do n’t see an option for that . ”
It turns out that we did n’t offer that as a feature back in August .
We were able to help the fellow , but it did n’t sound like an often - requested feature , so I did n’t think the Groups team had gotten a chance to do this .
But I checked and it looks like the Groups team got a chance to add this .
Yay !
For a group I owned , I clicked “ Manage ” and then “ Browse membership list . ”
At the bottom right will be a button “ Export member list ” and clicking that will download a comma-separated value ( CSV ) file .
– Let ’s see , where else can you store data at Google ?
Ah , a Custom Search Engine .
There ’s even a bookmarklet to let you add sites to your custom search engine as you surf the web .
Can you get your entire list of sites exported from your Custom Search Engine ?
Yup .
Go to your search engine ’s control panel and click on the “ Advanced ” tab .
You ’ll get options to download your sites in XML or tab - separated value ( TSV ) file format .
– Lots of products like Google Analytics and the Google Webmaster Console also give options to export data in various formats .
Okay , so looking down this list , it looks like Google does pretty well in offering open access to your data , at least for all the important services that I checked .
If you know of some way that Google does n’t let you download your data , please feel free to mention it .
I like that Eric said this , because it ’s a really nice precedent to set .
The Israel - Lebanon war lasted from July 12 - August 14 last year .
Recently the BBC reported this :
Former ambassador to the UN John Bolton told the BBC that before any ceasefire Washington wanted Israel to eliminate Hezbollah 's military capability .
Mr Bolton said an early ceasefire would have been " dangerous and misguided " .
He said the US decided to join efforts to end the conflict only when it was clear Israel 's campaign was n't working ...
Mr Bolton , a controversial and blunt - speaking figure , said he was " damned proud of what we did " to prevent an early ceasefire .
Singapore showed a 30 % increase , making it the most frenetic city
People are walking 10 % more quickly than a decade ago , according to research in 32 cities across the globe .
Thousands of pedestrians were secretly timed in city centres with Singapore 's residents found to be the most swift , followed by Copenhagen and Madrid .
However , the chief researcher told the BBC walking faster did not necessarily mean people were getting healthier .
Professor Richard Wiseman , of the University of Hertfordshire in the UK , told the BBC that the results provided " a significant insight into the physical and social health of a city " .
" At one level , walking quickly is good , but if it 's a way of life - if you 're doing it simply to get from A to B as quickly as possible - then it goes with a whole load of other behaviours which are not quite so good for you .
FASTEST CITIES

What speed says about us
" As people speed it 's not the stress , it 's the result of not eating properly , exercising or seeing friends and family .
It can lead to all kinds of things , especially heart attacks . "
A frenetic pace of life was found to be driven to some extent by technology .
Mr Wiseman said communications were getting faster and faster .
" We are constantly in touch with each other and getting back to people as quickly as we can and that 's minutes and not hours .
That 's driving us to think everything has to happen now . "
The biggest changes were found in Guangzhou in China with an increase of more than 20 % .
Singapore showed a 30 % increase , making it the most frenetic city in the study .
New York was ranked 8th , while London was outside the top 10 .
The Middle East tended to have the slowest pace of life .
The study was carried out in collaboration with the UK's cultural relations agency , the British Council .
A sign of slower ageing ?
King 's College London scientists compared key ageing DNA with the number of moles in a study of 1,800 twins .
They found the more moles a person had , the more likely their DNA was to have the properties to fight off ageing .
The study , in the Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention journal , contrasts with the link between a high mole - count and high skin cancer risk .
Moles appear in childhood and disappear from middle age onwards .
When present in large numbers they can increase the risk of melanoma , a rare form of skin cancer .
Moles vary significantly in numbers and size between individuals .
It 's important people know that having a large number of moles can increase your risk of skin cancer
Dr Kat Arney , of Cancer Research UK
The average number of moles in people with white skin is 30 but some people may have as many as 400 .
The reason for such differences between people is unknown as is the function of moles .
Since moles disappear with age , scientists looked at the relationship between the number of moles and telomere length in cells , which is a good indicator of the rate of ageing in organs such as the heart , muscle , bones and arteries .
Telomeres , which get shorter as we age , are bundles of DNA found at the end of chromosomes in all cells and assist in the protection , replication , and stabilisation of the chromosome ends .
They have been compared with the plastic tips on shoelaces because they prevent chromosome ends from fraying and sticking to each other .
' Exciting '
In the study , researchers found those with more than 100 moles had longer telomeres than those with fewer than 25 .
The difference between the two mole groups was equivalent to six to seven years of ageing .
Lead researcher Dr Veronique Bataille said : " The results of this study are very exciting as they show , for the first time , that moley people who have a slightly increased risk of melanoma may , on the other hand , have the benefit of a reduced rate of ageing .
" This could imply susceptibility to fewer age - related diseases such as heart disease or osteoporosis , for example .
Further studies are needed to confirm these findings . "
Dr Kat Arney , of Cancer Research UK , said : " While this is an intriguing finding and deserves further investigation , it 's important people know that having a large number of moles can increase your risk of skin cancer .
" It 's especially important to enjoy the sun safely if you have lots of moles or burn easily . "
Thanks to Einstein , we know that matter and energy are just different versions of one another .
E=mc2 tells you how much energy you ’d get if you converted mass into energy .
Do n’t try , it ’s hard .
Physicists were concerned that all matter in the Universe would eventually decay into radiation after trillions and trillions of years of time .
But the impact of dark energy , a mysterious force accelerating the expansion of the Universe , might change those predictions for the fate of matter .
Physicists Lawrence Krauss and Robert Scherrer recently published a paper in the journal Physical Review D that predicts that the ratio between matter and radiation should remain roughly the same as dark energy continues to spread the Universe apart .
Right now we can see most of the Universe , but as it continues to expand , distant objects will appear to be moving away from us faster than the speed of light , and will disappear from view .
In 10 trillion years from now , only our local cluster of galaxies will be visible .
Krauss and Scherrer have calculated that new radiation created from decaying matter will be diluted as soon as it ’s created , thanks to dark energy .
As particles decay into radiation , the dark energy will increase the separation between photons , decreasing their energy and density in the Universe .
The clumps of matter that remain will still dominate .

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
DETROIT - The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan today announced an out - of - court settlement between the Utica Community School District and a local student over the censorship of her 2001 yearbook entry .
The student 's entry had been deleted from the yearbook because it contained a passage from the Bible .
" " While it is true that the Constitution forbids public schools to promote religion , schools must be careful not to suppress the private religious expression of students , " " said ACLU of Michigan Legal Director Michael J. Steinberg , who represented the student .
" " In this case , a high school purported to create an open forum for student expression , yet censored a student 's speech because it was religious in nature . " "
The student , Abbey Moler , was valedictorian of Stevenson High School 's class of 2001 in Sterling Heights , a town of 17,000 located 25 miles north of Detroit .
She and a handful of other noteworthy graduates were profiled in a section of the yearbook listing the students ' activities and the colleges they planned to attend .
In addition , each student was invited to share some words of wisdom or advice to pass on to the rest of the school .
In previous years , students ' entries in the section ranged from serious advice to humorous tidbits .
Moler , a devout Christian , submitted a bible verse that she found meaningful : " " I would like to share a favorite verse that shapes my life and guides me from day to day : ' For I know the plans I have for you , ' declares the Lord , ' plans to prosper you and not to harm you , plans to give you hope and a future . '
Jeremiah 29:11 ( New International Bible ) . " "
When the yearbook was published , Moler discovered that her entry had been omitted .
She and her parents complained , and were told that the school could not publish the entry due to its religious content .
" My personal relationship with Jesus Christ is the foundation of who I am , and the publication of my verse is critical to preserving student expression and First Amendment rights , " " said Moler , who is now 20 years old and studying to become a teacher .
" " I received a wonderful education from the Utica Community School District , and now that I am entering the teaching profession , I wanted to do my part in maintaining excellence in public education . " "
The ACLU and the school district were able to negotiate a settlement in the matter , thus avoiding the need to file a lawsuit .
The terms of the settlement include the following :
The district will place a sticker with Moler 's original entry in the copies of the yearbook on file with the school ;
The district has instructed the Stevenson High School yearbook staff not to censor students ' yearbook entries solely because they contain religious or political speech that others might find offensive ;
The district recently provided and will continue to provide in - service training and advice to school staff on free speech and religious freedom issues that arise in school ;
The district will write a letter of regret to Moler apologizing for the failure to include her entry in the yearbook .

SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) --
It 's no secret that millions of Internet users every day watch copyright - infringing video clips on YouTube , the upstart Web site that Google Inc. has agreed to acquire for $ 1.65 billion .
What 's less known is that YouTube has been watching the watchers .
YouTube 's actions in response to a subpoena it received in May show that it has been keeping tabs on users who post copyrighted material to its site -- and in one case shared the name of a user with lawyers from a Hollywood film studio .
On May 24 , lawyers for Viacom Inc. 's Paramount Pictures convinced a federal judge in San Francisco to issue a subpoena requiring YouTube to turn over details about a user who uploaded dialog from the movie studio's " Twin Towers , " according to a copy of the document .
“ 'I was happy to utilize YouTube when it was still not clearly established .
It felt a bit utopian , even though the days for that were clearly numbered . ' ” — Chris Moukarbel , filmmaker
YouTube promptly handed over the data to Paramount , which on June 16 sued the creator of the 12 - minute clip , New York City - based filmmaker Chris Moukarbel , for copyright infringement , in federal court in Washington .
That YouTube chose to turn over the data , rather than simply remove the offending video from its site -- as it did Friday when it agreed to take down 30,000 videos at the request of a group of Japanese media companies -- came as a surprise to copyright experts .
" You Tube seems to have given up too easily , " said Laurence P. Colton , an intellectual - property lawyer at the firm of Powell & Goldstein LLP in Atlanta .
Its prompt legal capitulation suggests that YouTube users who post copyrighted material should not expect the company to protect them from media - business lawsuits , said Colton , whose firm was n't involved in the Paramount subpoena or lawsuit and who learned of them from a MarketWatch reporter .
The " Twin Towers " episode is reminiscent of the way the entertainment industry vanquished the first version of Napster Inc. NAPS and other digital - music sites that made it easy to download copyrighted songs over the Internet .
Music company lawyers first warned and then sued individual users who downloaded their songs .
Now it looks like piracy hunters for the movie studios are using the same technique against YouTube users .
YouTube 's decision to help Paramount track down Moukarbel stands in stark contrast to the philosophy of Google , which has fought the U.S. Justice Department over attempts to access data about consumers who use its search services .
Google GOOG , +0.13 % has balked at releasing even the most innocuous information about its users ' behavior to the U.S. government in the past .
Also , it 's now battling requests for user details coming from Brazilian and Indian government investigators .
Google declined repeated phone and e-mail requests for comment for this story .
Julie Supan , YouTube 's senior marketing director , declined comment .
The end of ' utopia '
With more media companies signaling that they will come after YouTube for compensation over copyrighted material , Moukarbel 's experience suggests that some of those among the Web site 's 40 million users who post copyrighted material can expect legal trouble .
Moukarbel settled the suit after he admitted making the film and agreed to remove it from his own Web site and from YouTube , according to a copy of a court order that was part of the settlement .
He also agreed to make an effort to remove it from other sites where it had been posted .
Moukarbel told MarketWatch in an interview that YouTube 's actions signaled to him the end of an era for the video site .
" I was happy to utilize YouTube when it was still not clearly established .
It felt a bit utopian , even though the days for that were clearly numbered , " Moukarbel said .
It remains to be seen if this has any chilling effect on the phenomenal growth of YouTube , which was founded just 20 months ago by former executives of PayPal , the electronic payment firm that was eventually acquired by eBay Inc .
The freewheeling nature of the site - and its apparent cloak of user anonymity -- has helped the upstart become a top 20 Web site whose users watch up to 100 million video clips every day .
A slew of lawsuits like those filed against individual digital music pirates could change that atmosphere , and perhaps the growth rate , of YouTube 's online community .
" This community was built as a kind of free - for - all , where people could have a lot of fun and do it rather anonymously , " Colton said .
" You do n't get that kind of community by saying , ' Here , sign up and at the simplest drop of a subpoena , we 'll give that information away . ' "
To be sure , Google , which hopes to close the YouTube purchase by year 's end , has already taken steps to reduce the copyright liability it will inherit from the private firm .
Just before it announced the acquisition of YouTube , the two companies signed licensing agreements with several large media firms , including Vivendi's Universal Music Group , Warner Music Group Corp .
WMG , +0.67 % , Sony BMG and CBS Corp. CBS , - 4.76 %
Several large entertainment industry providers are now teaming up to request compensation from the site , according to The Wall Street Journal .
Viacom VIA , - 9.09 % , which owns Paramount , estimates that pirated versions of video clips from its MTV , Comedy Central and Nickelodeon channels are watched 80,000 times a day on YouTube , according to the Journal .
Paramount Pictures spokeswoman Nancy Kirkpatrick said that the company 's actions against Moukarbel " in no way means we 're targeting YouTube . "
She declined further comment on the lawsuit against Moukarbel .
When asked about YouTube , a spokeswoman for the Motion Picture Industry Association said " we continue to pursue those who violate copyright laws on all levels , and we will continue to monitor YouTube for copyrighted material . "
That means YouTube users who post such material could face legal problems similar to Moukarbel's .
Moukarbel , meanwhile , said he harbors no hard feelings toward YouTube about the incident .
" I was happy with its run on YouTube , and , frankly , I was surprised it lasted as long as it did , " he said .
" That they eventually offered my information to Paramount does n't bother me at this point . "

This is simply not true .
Recursive locking is a superset of non-recursive locking .

So then how can recursive - locking be more dangerous > than non-recursive locking ?
This is simple basic logic .
Simple , basic logic .
First , implementation of efficient and reliable threaded code revolves around one simple and basic principle : follow your design .
That implies , of course , that you have a design , and that you understand it .
A correct and well understood design does not require recursive mutexes .
While recursive mutexes may seem a convenience for debugging , in fact it 's the opposite -- you 're better off with a " strict " debugging mutex ( like the POSIX error - check attribute ) that checks , tracks , and enforces ownership restrictions a " normal " mutex may ignore in favor of runtime efficiency .
Many implementations may have arrived at the concept of recursive mutexes for any number of reasons -- some perhaps even because someone really thought they were a good idea .
But allow me to explain , for the sake of context , why POSIX has recursive mutexes .
Bear with me , because I 'll follow into some more objective commentary .
In the early days of POSIX , we were also working with the Open Software Foundation to provide a thread library for DCE ( known commonly as " DCE threads " or sometimes " D4 threads " because the interface vaguely resembles that of the draft 4 version of the POSIX threads amendment ) .
We came to the realization that the biggest contraint was compatibility with existing NON - threaded operating systems .
The biggest problem with threading existing code is that locking requires analysis and understanding of the data and code relationships .
That can be a stupendous and impractical job for something the size and complexity of , for example , the typical C runtime of a non -threaded operating system .
Especially when you consider that we were supplying reference code for upwards of a dozen operating systems .
Most ( though not all ) were from the " UNIX " family -- but of vastly differing branches .
Analyzing and repairing even one was infeasible , and we could n't ignore any of them .
There 's one common idiom to deal with this sort of task , external locking : ( lock_mutex ( &a ) ; x = malloc ( size ) ; unlock_mutex ( &a ) ; ) .
But of course every facility in the process that calls malloc ( ) needs to agree on a single mutex " a " .
And because something you call while holding the lock might also call malloc ( ) , the lock must have the property that the owning thread can re-lock without deadlocking .
But unless you can do enough analysis to identify all possible execution paths , you can only use a single mutex within the process : a " global lock " .
There need be only one ; there CAN be only one .
Because if you know that it 's OK to have more than one , you do n't need any at all ; you can simply lock properly in the first place , where needed .
And so DCE threads has pthread_lock_global ( ) and pthread_unlock_global ( ) .
But if that 's all that 's necessary , why does POSIX have recursive mutexes ?
Because of a dare .
We were pushing in the POSIX working group for our concept of attributes objects .
And in particular the idea that one could support a range of potentiallyf useful and non-standard fundamental mutex behaviors without substantially complicating a simple and fast " inline lock " code path or invalidating basic POSIX semantics ; that is , all the complication would be kept out of the main and common lock code .
Some people just did n't believe us .
So I proved it by generalizing " the global lock " into a recursive mutex attribute .
Of course it worked , though we never actually bothered to DO anything with the proof .
However , having implemented it , I did n't bother to delete it , and it went into our code base .
And that made it part of DCE threads on the next code drop to OSF .
And it seemed silly to have it and not document it .
Besides , I also built a strict " error - check " mutex type that would rigidly enforce mutex ownership , and that was useful for debugging .
But nobody was supposed to use recursive mutexes .
For the original intended purpose , only the global mutex would work anyway .
And if you could analyze the code paths enough to know that a separate mutex was safe , why the heck would anyone want the overhead and complication of a recursive mutex instead of just doing it right ?
I still did n't delete it , but I more or less stopped thinking about it for many years .
POSIX finally became threaded with the approval of POSIX 1003.1c - 1995 , and POSIX 1003.1 , 1996 edition , integrated it all into a single document .
And then along came The Open Group , which had already successfully tied together the " 1170 " common interfaces of disparate UNIX environments into a single portable specification , UNIX 93 .
And then followed with UNIX 95 , adding more common features .
All very nice .
And now they were working on UNIX 98 , and it would include threads .
But they did n't want just " POSIX threads " .
They wanted common and reasonably widely accepted EXTENSIONS to threads .
Many of these extensions were really useful .
Some were utterly stupid ( like pthread_setconcurrency ( ) , meaningful only to pitifully busted 2 - level scheduler hacks , though I wo n't say any more at the risk of beginning to sound a little biased ;-) ) .
In particular , though , almost everyone thought that recursive mutexes should be in there .
And they are .
OK , I said I 'd actually comment on the objective facts .
So here are a couple ...
1 ) The biggest of all the big problems with recursive mutexes is that they encourage you to completely lose track of your locking scheme and scope .
This is deadly .
Evil .
It 's the " thread eater " .
You hold locks for the absolutely shortest possible time .
Period .
Always .
If you 're calling something with a lock held simply because you do n't know it 's held , or because you do n't know whether the callee needs the mutex , then you 're holding it too long .
You 're aiming a shotgun at your application and pulling the trigger .
You presumably started using threads to get concurrency ; but you 've just PREVENTED concurrency .
I 've often joked that instead of picking up Djikstra 's cute acronym we should have called the basic synchronization object " the bottleneck " .
Bottlenecks are useful at times , sometimes indispensible -- but they 're never GOOD .
At best they 're a necessary evil .
Anything .
ANYTHING that encourages anyone to overuse them , to hold them too long , is bad .
It 's NOT just the straightline performance impact of the extra recursion logic in the mutex lock and unlock that 's the issue here -- it 's the far greater , wider , and much more difficult to characterize impact on the overall application concurrency .
People often say " I added threads to my application and it got slower .
Stupid threads " .
And the answer is almost always , no ( but we 'll be more tactful here ) , " uninformed programmer " .
They forget to unlock when they need to , because they forget that where you unlock is just as important as where you lock .
Threading is NOT just about about " a different model for application structure " , it 's about concurrency .
Locks kill concurrency .
Locks held longer than necessary for " safety " kill concurrency even worse .
2 ) Sometimes you need to unlock .
Even if you 're using recursive mutexes .
But how do you know how to unlock ?
Threaded programming is built around predicates and shared data .
When you hand a recursive mutex down from one routine to another , the callee cannot know the state of predicates in the caller .
It has to assume there are some , because it cannot verify there are n't ; and if the caller had known that there were no broken predicates , it should have allowed concurrency by unlocking .
So how can you wait ?
You need to release ( not just unlock ) the mutex in order to allow some other thread to change a predicate .
But if you release , you 've left your predicates dangling in the wind ... unchecked , unknown , unprotected .
That 's idiotic design , and the most fundamental error in the Java language .
" Do n't call while holding broken predicates " , is all they can say by way of excuse .
But if there are no broken predicates , you UNLOCK so the application can have a chance to act concurrent .
If you 're ever going to design a language that tries to do this , make sure it has real first - class support for predicates , so that it understands who they are and what they mean , and can make decisions like this for you , reliably .
At the very least it has to be able to diagnose when you blow it ... and Java can't even do that .
POSIX , luckily , does n't provide the mechanism to perform this sort of data demolition .
You can only unlock , and you cannot detect when an unlock will release .
That is , when you call pthread_cond_wait ( ) on a recursive mutex , you may NOT release ... and in that case you 've deadlocked .
You 'll never continue from your predicate loop until some other thread changes the predicate , which it can't do because you hold the lock .
The rest of the application may or may not eventually come to a halt , but you sure have n't done it any good .
You 're squeezing the entire application through your bottleneck .
Recursive mutexes are a hack .
There 's nothing wrong with using them , but they 're a crutch .
Got a broken leg or library ?
Fine , use the crutch .
But at least be aware that you 're using a crutch , and why ; and once in a while check out the leg ( or library ) to be sure you still need the crutch .
And if it 's not healing up , go see a doctor , because that 's just not OK .
When you have no choice , there 's no shame in using a crutch ... but you can't run very well on a crutch , and you 'll also be slowing down anyone who depends on you .
Recursive mutexes can be a great tool for prototyping thread support in an existing library , exactly because it lets you defer the hard part : the call path and data dependency analysis of the library .
But for that same reason , always remember that you 're not DONE until they 're all gone , so you can produce a library you 're proud of , that wo n't unnecessarily contrain the concurrency of the entire application .
Or sit back and let someone else do the design .

On a recent Wednesday afternoon , Gunther Mendel took a break from ice - skating with his 8 - year - old son , Tobias , to photograph his goofiest faces , like the one where he rolls his eyes back into his head and stretches his tongue out of his mouth .
" I'm a lucky dad , " Mr. Mendel says outside Vienna 's eminent City Hall building , the Rathaus .
Meanwhile , workers inside the building were trying to make active dads like Mendel , a sign of the times – literally .
In mid-December , the Vienna City Council launched the " Vienna Sees It Differently " campaign , unveiling posters which featured the city 's public pictographs – but with gender changes .
Now , those changes are being implemented all across the Austrian capital .
By the end of the year , all city buildings will have signs featuring men changing diapers and women riding elevators .
This month , the Vienna Public Transport system , which is also taking part in the campaign , will begin replacing old , tattered stickers for reserved seating with updated ones featuring men with babies , elderly women , and disabled women .
" The campaign shows familiar images in an unfamiliar way .
We want the effect to be jarring in the best sense of the word , " said Sonja Wehsely , the former city councilor for women 's issues , at the campaign 's press conference in December .
" By playing with our expectations , the campaign encourages us to change the way we think , see , and act . "
Ursula Bauer , the city 's project director for the implementation of gender mainstreaming , says they set out to be provocative and their mission was accomplished .
Though Ms. Bauer says the city has received " hundreds " of supportive e-mails and calls , it " easily " has gotten 3,000 complaints – 80 percent of which have been from men .
Complaints ranged from speculated costs of the campaign , to men saying female pictographs are exclusive to women declaring that skirts represented an " unemancipated " female .
Mendel , however , thinks the campaign is progressive .
If he needed to change a baby 's diaper and saw the new sign , he says , " I would feel 100 percent integrated . "
Overwhelmingly , diaper - changing facilities are found in women 's restrooms .
" It should n't always be the same stupid signs .
This generation is different , " Mendel says .
He suggests that 30 to 40 percent of fathers in this capital city are now " changing nappies at home and in public . "
The campaign has stimulated both public and private discourse , says Marlene Parenzan , vice president of the Austrian Women 's Ring , a Vienna - based umbrella organization for women 's groups .
Gender mainstreaming in politics is easier , Ms. Parenzan says .
" What is much more difficult to change is the people themselves .
The population as a whole is not very gender - sensitive , " she says of the city , where the world 's most respected and most well - paid symphony orchestra did not admit women until 1997 .
" Men and women need to be shocked somehow , " she says .
" Their attention needs to be drawn to the fact that we are not [ treated ] equally . "
Vienna 's campaign might inspire change on the national level and eventually pique some interest in the European Union , says Bauer , the project director .
She has received calls from provincial Austrian and German government officials asking about the campaign .
Even privately owned local businesses have called to inquire where they could pick up the signs , most notably the exit sign depicting a female .
The campaign " ca n't change the whole society , but it can offer at least the fundaments , and this is what you have to do – especially when you use public money , " Bauer says .
Gender mainstreaming means " to step back and say : ' Could n't it be different ? ' , " she adds .
But when it comes to EU or Austrian regulations , sometimes that answer is " no . "
So the female exit sign – which shows a woman with wind - blown hair racing toward the door , as she is stylishly clad in a modern dress and mid-calf high - heeled boots – will not be used across Europe anytime soon .
Franz Kaida , a member of the Association of Austrian Safety Practitioners , a Vienna - based interest group for active and retired safety experts , says his main concern was that the signs complied with EU legislation .
Mr. Kaida , however , did have one question about the artistic liberties taken with the city 's campaign signs : " Do you think that long hair , skirt , and boots represent all women ? "
But until the city finds something better , the Viennese – both male and female – will continue to cross the street at the crosswalk , which is marked by a sign featuring a man donning a fedora .

Hawking enjoys zero G
BY WILLIAM HARWOOD
STORY WRITTEN FOR CBS NEWS " SPACE PLACE " & USED WITH PERMISSION
Posted : April 26 , 2007
Physicist Stephen Hawking , the wheelchair - bound theorist known for his insights into the nature of black holes and gravity , experienced weightlessness today during an eagerly anticipated airplane ride off Florida 's East Coast .
Credit : Zero Gravity Corp .
Attended by a team of physicians , nurses and supporters , Hawking enjoyed 20 to 25 seconds of weightlessness during eight parabolic arcs aboard the Zero Gravity Corp .'s Boeing 727 jet .
Passengers on such flights are weightlessness as they " fall " toward Earth inside the plane 's foam - padded interior .
At the bottom of each arc , the nose of the plane is pulled up , briefly subjecting the passengers to about 1.5 times the force of gravity .
Hawking , who suffers from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or ALS - Lou Gehrigs Disease - was closely monitored throughout the afternoon flight .
After returning to the Kennedy Space Center 's shuttle runway , he was all smiles and officials said he enjoyed the ride .
" Many people have asked me why I am taking this flight , " the renowned physicist told reporters earlier today at the Shuttle Landing Facility .
" I am doing it for many reasons .
First of all , I believe that life on Earth is at an ever increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster , such as sudden global warming , nuclear war , a genetically engineered virus or other dangers .
" I think the human race has no future if it does n't go into space .
I therefore want to encourage public interest in space , " he said , speaking through a computer in his famously robotic " voice . "
" I have long wanted to go into space and the zero gravity flight is a first step toward space travel .
I also want to demonstrate to the public that everyone can participate in this type of weightless experience . "
Peter Diamandidis , president of Zero Gravity Corp. , said the flight was organized to benefit four charities - Easter Seals , the Starlight Starbright Children 's Foundation , Augie 's Quest and the X Prize Foundation .
Eight seats were auctioned off , raising some $ 150,000 .
Rides on the plane normally sell for $ 3,500 per passenger .
" We 're really excited , " Diamandis said .
" The entire team is pumped and ready to go to fulfill his dream of being weightless . "
To ensure 's Hawking 's safety , the physicist was closely monitored by his personal team of physicians and nurses .
During a test flight Wednesday using an eighth grade student as a stand in , the team perfected the way they will gently lower Hawking to the padded floor after each parabola to make sure he remains comfortable during the half - minute or so when he will be subjected to 1.5 times the normal force of gravity .
" We 've done a tremendous amount to ensure safety on this flight , " Diamandis said .
" We feel we have an excellent safety plan . "
Diamandis said Hawking 's doctors planned to assess blood pressure , oxygen levels and other factors after the first parabola to make sure it is safe to proceed .
Diamandis said he would be happy with a single parabola , prompting Hawking to interject a computer - synthesized " no ! "
" As you can imagine , I am very excited , " Hawking said earlier .
" I have been wheelchair bound for almost four decades and the chance to float free in zero G will be wonderful . "
Hawking is considered one of the world 's leading authorities on quantum black holes and big bang cosmology .
Along with his scholarly achievements , Hawking is the author of the popular bestseller " A Brief History of Time . "
With crops gone to pot , North Dakota fights for industrial hemp RAW STORY
Published : Saturday July 21 , 2007 Print This Email This
An article in today 's New York Times features North Dakota farmer , school principal and state representative David C. Monson , who advocates the legalization of hemp for farming purposes .
Six states have considered the legalization of industrial hemp , which has been banned on a federal level even though it only contains traces of THC , the psychoactive substance produced in much greater concentration in hemp grown for use as a recreational substance .
" This is not any subversive thing like trying to legalize marijuana or whatever .
This is just practical agriculture , " says Monson .
" We 're desperate for something that can make us some money . "
Unfortunately , the DEA treats industrial hemp the same as it does " marijuana ; " while North Dakota has legalized growing industrial hemp on a state level , it remains outlawed federally .
# EXCERPTS :  North Dakota is really pushing the envelope on this one ,  said Doug Farquhar , the program director for agriculture and rural development at the National Conference of State Legislatures .
Legislatures in Maine , Montana , West Virginia and other states have passed bills allowing farmers to grow industrial hemp , said Alexis Baden - Mayer , the director of government relations for Vote Hemp , a group that presses for legalization , but those laws have not been carried out given federal drug law .
This battle is decidedly , and Midwesternly , pragmatic .
In 1993 , scab , a fungus also known as Fusarium head blight , tore through this region , wiping out thousands of acres of wheat , a prized crop in North Dakota , where agriculture remains the largest element of the economy .
Hard rains left water pooling in fields , giving scab an opening .
The fungus has turned up in varying degrees ever since , even as farmers searched for a cure .
On a recent afternoon , as rain pounded his 710 acres , Mr. Monson gloomily yanked the head off a stalk of his wheat , revealing for a visitor whitish , shriveled seeds  the telltale signs of scab .
But hemp , Mr. Monson argued , offered an alternative for North Dakotas crop rotation .
Its tall stalks survive similarly cool and wet conditions in Canada , just 25 miles north of here , where it is legal .
And it suits the rocky soil left behind here by glaciers , soil that threatens to tear up farm equipment for anyone who dares to plant crops like beets or potatoes beneath ground .

A wholesaler fillets a tuna at the Tsukiji fish market in Tokyo in a file photo .
Japanese researchers are looking for ways to reduce stress levels in tuna caught in nearby waters , so they taste better when they hit the plate .
REUTERS / Kiyoshi Ota
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japanese researchers are looking for ways to reduce stress levels in tuna caught in nearby waters , so they taste better when they hit the plate .
A vigorous fish , tuna tends to thrash wildly when caught , which researchers believe raises its body temperature and leads to whitening of its meat , sharply cutting its flavor and value .
“ People want to eat tuna when it ’s as fresh as possible , but once it struggles the freshness goes down , ” said Kunihiko Konno , a professor at Hokkaido University who is leading the stress - reduction project .
Tuna tend to struggle especially hard if too many are trapped in a net at once or if they are kept in crowded conditions at fish farms , but the researchers are focusing mainly on how to reduce stress when the fish are caught , he added .
Although they have yet to reach firm conclusions , Konno said the best way to reduce stress levels was likely to be quite simple -- and final .
“ Kill them very quickly , ” he said .

Let ’s face it , in recent years , the rapid propagation and uncontrolled use of portable mass storage devices has started to pose considerable security risks to corporations .
While being very useful , a simple USB key , and even an iPod , could easily be used to steal data or to introduce viruses and other nasties to your network .
Security researchers have long warned us about the risks associated with portable storage devices and how vital it is for companies do something about them .
But before going further , let me ask a question to those of you who are in charge of administrating a network :
What is your company doing to minimize those risks ?
I ’ve heard many proposed answers to this inquery ; everything from filling USB ports with epoxy , to disabling them completely via BIOS or by implementing group policies .
However , in most situations , people wo n’t do a thing about them , and if this is the case where YOU work , you really need to do something about the situation .
GFI , a security software company that has long been a favorite of mine , has just come out with a simple , elegant solution to the problem .
Their answer is named EndPointScan , and it is a free online service that allows you to check which devices are or have been connected to computers on your network ( and by whom ) .
EndPointScan carries out granular checks across all types of ports – USB , Firewire , Bluetooth , Infrared , PCMIA and Wi-Fi – on all machines .
This utility provides complete and thorough information about all portable devices and can scan multiple computers simultaneously .
EndPointScan is fully compatible with existing network management or administrative tools such as Active Directory and it will also work on Vista systems .
In my case , the application worked flawlessly – just like all other GFI products I ’ve used in the past - and did the job it was designed for perfectly .
First , before using the tool , you ’ll need to install its ActiveX component .
Then , a Web interface will ask you about what computers you want to scan : a single machine or a range ( or list ) of them .
It will then proceed to scan your network based on the chosen settings .
When finished , the application will display a report providing details about which computers may be at risk , and when expanded , will list the devices that are or have been connected to them .
Here is a picture of a sample report .
Globally , I must say that I was pretty impressed by the ease of use of this application and the level of information it brought me .
Even if EndPointScan will not prevent people from using USB devices on your network , it will at least paint you a good portrait of what is happening in your environment .
Hmm …
I wonder what the application will detect if I ever feel like connecting one of those USB humping dogs to my box .
Will it be considered as a security risk ?
Maybe someone from GFI will eventually end up here and provide us with an answer . :)
Vonage developed one of the first Internet telephone services and has attracted more than two million customers .
But last year , Verizon — one of Vonage ’s biggest competitors — sued for patent infringement and won a verdict in its favor in March .
The Gates memo predicted that a large company would “ patent some obvious thing , ” and that ’s exactly what Verizon has done .
Two of its patents cover the concept of translating phone numbers into Internet addresses .
It is virtually impossible to create a consumer - friendly Internet telephone product without doing that .
So if Verizon prevails on appeal , it will probably be able to drive Vonage out of business .
Consumers will suffer from fewer choices and higher prices , and future competitors will be reluctant to enter markets dominated by patents .
But do n’t software companies need patent protection ?
In fact , companies , especially those that are focused on innovation , do n’t : software is already protected by copyright law , and there ’s no reason any industry needs both types of protection .
The rules of copyright are simpler and protection is available to everyone at very low cost .
In contrast , the patent system is cumbersome and expensive .
Applying for patents and conducting patent searches can cost tens of thousands of dollars .
That is not a huge burden for large companies like Microsoft , but it can be a serious burden for the small start - up firms that produce some of the most important software innovations .
Yet , as the Vonage case demonstrates , participating in the patent system is not optional .
Independent invention is not a defense to patent infringement , and large software companies now hold so many patents that it is almost impossible to create useful software without infringing some of them .
Therefore , the only means of self - defense is the one Mr. Gates identified 16 years ago : stockpile patents to use as bargaining chips in litigation .
Vonage did n’t do that , and it ’s now paying a very high price .
Only patent lawyers benefit from this kind of arms race .
And Microsoft ’s own history contradicts Mr. Smith ’s claim that patents are essential for technological breakthroughs : Microsoft produced lots of innovative software before it received its first software patent in 1988 .
As more and more lawsuits rock the industry , we should ask if software patents are stifling innovation .
Bill Gates certainly thought so in 1991 , even if he wo n’t admit it today .

Chocolate , roses , diamonds , jewels , shoes , may be your first guess , but when it comes to what women really want there is really only one answer â€ “ affection .
Men have been scratching their heads for years in an attempt to figure out how the female mind works .
They have searched through aisle after aisle looking for jewels , romantic cards , flowers , and lingerie trying to determine what will make the woman in their life happy .
The answer is very simple , if you give women affection , everything else will fall into place .
For women , affection means hugs , kisses , holding hands , cuddling , snuggling , everything that is hands on that says , I love you .
When a woman has the right amount of affection ( and it does vary from woman to woman ) she will be putty in your hands .
Many men may mistakenly buy chocolate or roses , but neglect to present them with the essential hug or kiss of affection .
This is actually counter - productive and lessens the impact of the gift .
Women are not as materialistic as they may appear to be .
Yes , they love gifts , presents , and surprises , but only when they are presented from an affectionate and adoring partner .
Many men often wonder why women seem to be less interested in sex as compared to men .
The answer is to give a woman plenty of affection , and then the sex will follow .
For women , affection is the equivalent of foreplay .
Women donâ€™t easily jump from one role to another .
For example , if a woman has been at work all day , then she has been acting in her professional role .
When she returns home , she may have children to take care of , the mother role .
If she doesnâ€™t have children , she may just need some time to relax first .
Sex may be the last thing on her mind .
However , if her partner lavishes her with plenty of affection , her mood will change and she will shift from one role to another .
Kind words , thoughtful acts , and plenty of physical affection are the key ingredients that compose a womanâ€™s basic needs and desires from her partner .
Like men , the basic need of every woman is to be loved .
When her partner lavishes her with affection , she understands that he loves her .
Harsh words , arguments , and critical attitudes are quick to make a woman feel unloved .
Her needs are met through gentleness , kindness , patience , and affection .
It is a wise man that understands that his partner craves his affection and attention and deals patiently and lovingly with her .
When a woman feels that she is the apple of her manâ€™s eye , she will in turn do everything she can to please him .
The key is for men to understand that women long for affection , and then to assess how much affection their woman needs .
There is a point where too much affection can stifle a woman and cause her to feel smothered , so make sure that you tread with caution .
Just watch her response to your affectionate actions and then you will be able to properly evaluate how much affection she craves .
Al Qaeda 's Strength ' Undiminished ' in Iraq The White House says al Qaeda is on the run ; intelligence says otherwise .
July 12 , 2007  --
A military intelligence report that concludes al Qaeda has largely restored itself to pre- 9/11 strength will be the focus of a meeting at the White House today .
The meeting was called to discuss a pending National Intelligence Estimate .
While the military has maintained that al Qaeda is on the run in Iraq , by any number of measures the terror group and its affiliates are as strong as ever , and June was the most violent month since the start of the war , a senior U.S. military official told ABC News .
" Despite our successes in taking out leaders and infrastructure , " said the official , " al Qaeda 's operational capability appears to be undiminished . "
Asked about the al Qaeda comeback , Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff said today on " Good Morning America , " " It reflects the fact that just as we improve our defenses , the enemy tries to improve its defenses and rebuild itself . "
Al Qaeda operations are marked by the use of suicide bombers , and the latest intelligence assessment shows that suicide attacks were near an all - time high in May and June .
According to the report , al Qaeda in Iraq is responsible for 15 percent of the attacks in the country , often the most deadly .
Sunni insurgents are blamed for 70 percent of attacks , and Shiite militias 15 percent .
Shiite attacks , however , have sharply increased and are now probably higher than 15 percent .
ABC News has learned the most recent military intelligence assessment of Iraq also shows that the overall level of violence in the country -- measured as the number of " violent incidents " -- hit its highest level in June since the war began .
According to the assessment , an average of 178 attacks a day were carried out in June .
By comparison , there were only 94 attacks a day in March 2006 , the month after the attack on the Golden Dome mosque in Samarra touched off a wave of sectarian violence .
The record level of violence comes despite significant progress in a few key areas .
Anbar Province , for example , was once the most dangerous area in Iraq and has experienced a turnaround a senior military official calls " miraculous . "
Attacks on civilians are also down significantly .
But in other areas , the trends are moving in the wrong direction :
The number of attacks on U.S. soldiers is way up , now accounting for 70 percent of all attacks in Iraq .
While violence has dropped dramatically in Anbar Province , the number of attacks has risen sharply in four other provinces : Baghdad , Salahaddin , Diyala and Basra .
In June , there were a record 55 attacks with Iranian - made roadside bombs -- called explosively formed penetrators .
This is the deadliest form of roadside bomb seen in Iraq .
Mortar attacks on the Green Zone have dramatically increased .
The increase in violence can be attributed to a sharp rise in attacks on U.S. forces , including a record number of attacks with Iranian - made explosives in June , as well as a sharp increase in attacks on Baghdad 's Green Zone , 90 percent of which are fired from Shiite neighborhoods .
The bark of certain yew trees can yield a medicine that fights cancer .
Now scientists find the dirt that yew trees grow in can supply the drug as well , suggesting a new way to commercially harvest the medicine .
Scientists originally isolated the drug paclitaxel — now commonly known as Taxol — in 1967 from the bark of Pacific yew trees ( Taxus brevifolia ) in a forest near the Mount St. Helens in Washington .
This yew also yields related compounds known as taxanes that can be converted to paclitaxel .
Research since then has revealed other yew species generate paclitaxel and taxanes as well , as do some fungi and certain hazelnut varieties .
A decade ago , University of Portland biochemist Angela Hoffman and her colleagues were interested in growing yew in the lab from cuttings .
They discovered small yew branches could secrete paclitaxel into plant food , raising the possibility that yew trees might release the drug into the soil .
Tree farming
The scientists collaborated with Weyerhaeuser , a forest - products company that grows yew trees to extract taxanes .
Their research now suggests yew trees might secrete paclitaxel and other taxanes from their roots .
The scientists recently presented their findings at the American Chemical Society meeting in Chicago and will detail the results in June at a joint meeting in Boise of the Northwest Region of the American Chemical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science Pacific Division .
Weyerhaeuser grows yew trees for several years before pulling them up and replanting the fields .
" This means they have acres of soil they could use , " Hoffman said .
She estimated harvesting paclitaxel from the soil can become profitable if the growers can generate more than 20 grams per acre .
Based on lab experiments , Hoffman and her colleagues calculated that the top foot of an acre of yew dirt should yield roughly 35 grams of paclitaxel and some 70 grams of related taxanes , " stuff that would have just gone to waste anyhow , " Hoffman told LiveScience .
In the field
To field test their ideas , the scientists took nearly 40 cubic feet of yew soil from a Weyerhaeuser field and mixed it with a few gallons of rubbing alcohol in a cement mixer for several hours .
The taxanes dissolve in the alcohol , which the scientists then filter off and extract taxanes from .
The field results suggest an acre of soil would yield about 25 to 30 grams of paclitaxel and about 200 grams of related taxanes .
On average , a single dose of paclitaxel contains about 10 to 200 millionths of a gram of the drug , Hoffman said .
Twenty grams of the medicine " would probably be enough to last 30 to 50 people throughout their entire treatment , " she estimated .
The reason less paclitaxel was found in the field than in the lab could be because the scientists ' lab techniques are currently more efficient than their field methods , Hoffman said .
Also , paclitaxel could have broken down when left out too long in the field .
In contrast , the reason more taxanes were found in the field than in the lab could be because they are left over from previous yew plantings .

JOHANNESBURG , Nov. 14 — South Africa ’s Parliament overwhelmingly voted today to legalize same - sex marriages , making the nation the first in Africa and the fifth in the world to remove legal barriers to gay and lesbian unions , according to activists .
The legislature voted after the nation ’s highest court ruled that South Africa ’s marriages statutes violated the constitution ’s guarantee of equal rights .
The court gave the government a year to amend the legal definition of marriage .
That deadline expires in two weeks .
Melanie Judge , program manager for OUT , a gay rights advocacy group , noted that the Netherlands , Belgium , Spain and Canada were the only other countries to allow same - sex marriages nationwide .
In most African nations , she said , homosexuality is still treated as a crime .
Some penalties are stiffer than those for rape or murder ..
Ms. Judge credited South Africa ’s liberal constitution with forcing change .
“ This has been a litmus test of our constitutional values , ” she said in a telephone interview .
“ What does equality really mean ?
What does it look like ?
Equality does not exist on a sliding scale . ”
Nature Gives Up on Open - Source Peer Review
11 January 2007 at 12:30 pm Peter G. Klein
| Peter Klein |
The open - source , wiki model does not , apparently , work well for scientific publishing .
Nature had placed a selection of submitted manuscripts online and invited feedback from researchers around the world , promising to take the feedback into consideration as part of the formal review process .
But the scientific community showed little interest .
Few authors were willing to participate in the experiement , and the online papers did n’t get much feedback .
During Nature ’s trial , only 5 percent of 1,369 papers ranging from astronomy to neuroscience that were selected for traditional peer review were also posted on the Internet for open commentary .
Of those , 33 papers received no comments .
The rest received a total of 92 technical comments .
The journal concluded that many researchers were either too busy or had no real incentive in evaluating their colleagues ’ work publicly .
In addition , none of the editors found the posted comments influenced their decision whether a paper gets published .
I ’m a little surprised by this .
According to Lerner and Tirole , the open - source model should work in settings with strong reputation effects .
One would think that in small , close - knit , specialized scientific communities the incentives to provide useful feedback — assuming it ’s not anonymous — would be fairly high .
On the other hand , there are opportunities to do so at conferences , seminars , workshops , the faculty lounge — and even blogs ! — and the opportunity costs of doing it via Nature ’s setup may have been too high .

So as you might remember , my previous web hosts suddenly noticed that I was running a site with a forum , a blog , a wiki , and 90,000 unique visitors a month ( 12,000 a day ) on a jokey little budget web hosting plan that cost $ 6 a month .
They promptly pulled the plug and I had to fight just to get the blog back up temporarily .
Amazingly a minor avalanche of hot web2.0 geeks came to my aid , and then Positive Internet stepped in to give us a free and rather enormous dedicated server .
This is generosity beyond my wildest dreams , especially since I clearly lack the funds to keep the site up with anything like that kind of resource , and as a result , badscience .
net is now spectacularly overpowered : I want you to picture a small hornby carriage being dragged up the east coast mainline at 140 mph by a full - size nuclear powered freight locomotive .
This is Orca .
She ’s hot .
Now obviously I nearly died with shock , but it ’s fair to say that Positive Internet are a pretty amazing organisation .
They also host , for example , Richard Stallman , free software guru and digital activist , and various free software projects , like this GNU / Linux distribution .
This is clearly a company with a very strong commitment to geek politics issues , which is very much where I see us ( once my book ’s polished off at the lawyers I ’ve got a second column in the pipeline , ramming the cultural impact of things like IP , CC , and GNU down the throats of a wider and unwilling audience ) .
The people at Positive have also been incredibly helpful and funny , and they hosted the Ricky Gervais podcast .
I think it ’s fair to say that they are the clear geek ’s choice for web action , and I for one will not be missing any opportunity to explain how wonderful they are whenever I get the chance .
So the blog is now back up and fully running ( your old logins should all work here ) and if there are any problems just let me know and I will promptly bash my head against the desk and pass it on to some of the amazing people who ’ve helped me out , specifically ( so far ) Alex Lomas , who is undoubtedly the main star of the show so far , and very kindly did the migration patiently and with ( let me be clear ) truly astonishing competence .
That level of high end geekery to me is indistinguishable from magic and someone should give him an even better job than the one he already has , if they know what ’s good for them .
I had n’t seen world science expert Dr Damian Counsell from pootergeek for ten years – he was a popstar and much cooler than me in Oxford – but he popped up out of nowhere to help during the initial panic and I will be forever indebted ( he is a tiny bit war–mongery these days , but the kind of warmonger you can chat to , which is what it ’s all about ) .
The forum is next to come back on , and then next come the plans to develop badscience .
net into an uber - participatory quack - busting pseudoscience - fighting media - monitoring comedy community evil empire , which I think will be rather good fun .
I have a small band of hot web2.0 geeks who I have ensured are neither undercover saboteurs sent in by the vitamin pill industry nor emmisaries of corporate media satanism , and hopefully now we ’ve migrated some will stick around .
If you ’d like to chip in then drop me an email , ben@badscience.net as ever , I can offer love , microfame , booze , and I know a lot of hot girls .
A bit of money came in before through paypal when we were down which was great – I ’m incredibly grateful and was slightly startled at a couple of the donations – it ’s quite safe and will be spent on all the other stuff besides servers , especially the evil empire expansion , but mainly crack cocaine and sex workers .
Thank you all so so much , seriously .
On a slightly weepy note , I have to say this has been a truly motivating object lesson in how the voluntary skills exchange no - dosh economy can really come up with the goods , and even if I did moan very briefly about spending all my time giving talks in schools for free and then losing the train receipts like a dick ( thus losing money ) , and even though there were times when I considered starting a cynical vitamin pill company or tedious “ readers ’ health worries ” magazine column ( I ’d rather slam my balls in the car door ) just to pay the webhosting bills , I honestly would n’t have it any other way .
This experience has totally put my fighting shoes on .
Hot badscience 2.0 action
So , onward .
There are a few ideas I ’ve chatted around with a couple of people , and I ’d be really interested to hear anyone ’s views on what they ’d like to see here .
My feeling is there is a massive community of sharp interesting people who hang out here , and a massive amount of interesting material out there to discuss .
The one boring thing I ’d like to do quickly is get the forum so that it integrates with the design of the blog and uses the same login , so it ’s less of a hassly different world ( maybe using Vanilla ) .
The first proper thing I really want to do is get the links miniblog ( on the right ) running so that when you click on a link , you go to a page , with the link at the top , and discussion beneath .
This would be great because it would allow for a lot of entertaining real - time discussion ( and debunking ) of a large number of dodgy media science and health stories , as well as remote parallel discussion of other loopy blogs , and crucially commentary on all kinds of stuff like webpages , commercial sites , and mainstream media , that resist commentary by design .
It would also be great because the google rank is quite high on badscience .
net so it would bring more people into our discursive rational clutches .
Also it would be good to expand and have more pages , especially for other people to post interesting quack / scare links .
This is just a snippet of the fun stuff and extra content to come ( buckets , audio , written , buckets , seriously ) , but beyond that I do n’t want to suggest too much here , because I would n’t want to colour your suggestions , and I really do want to hear if there ’s anything people would be up for , especially community stuff .
And meanwhile , let ’s not forget that Positive have an excellent shared hosting plan for just over a tenner a month , as well as rather delicious dedicated servers of all varieties for every scale of need , not to mention their managed servers for gigantic projects .
They are clearly the ethical choice for geeks .
Seriously though … post below , just so I know you ’re still there …
The Centre for the New Europe ( CNE ) is a think tank based in Brussels , Belgium .
Its hosts events for policymakers , parliamentarians and journalists , and publishes reports and books on a range of free market topics .
Founded in 1993 by a Belgian lawyer and a Belgian journalist after a meeting in the Hilton Hotel on the Toison d'Or in Brussels , it is very strongly pro-free - market , with a particular focus on the privatisation of health care .
It is a member of the International Policy Network and regularly collaborates with other members of the Atlas Economic Research Foundation network .
It is also a member of the Stockholm Network of European free - market think tanks .
The funding of the CNE is not transparent .
It failed to answer a think tank survey by the Corporate Europe Observatory in 2005 .
However , the annual reports of Exxon Mobil reveal that CNE in 2003 and 2004 received $ 40,000 and $ 80,000 respectively for its " Global Climate Change Education Efforts " .
" We find that support for liberal ideas -- free trade , social tolerance , economic liberty -- extends far beyond Europe 's Liberal parties .
Therefore , we back no party or programme .
We find that liberalism has friends and enemies in every party .
We hope to unite its friends and persuade its enemies . " [ 1 ]

The campus shooting phenomenon in the US would have lost much of its power to shock by now if it were n't for the fact that the perpetrators keep ingeniously introducing new twists .
Last October , it was an Amish school , of all places ; in 2005 it was a school on a Native American reservation .
On what was almost exactly the eighth anniversary of Columbine - hitherto a one - word thumbnail for this whole family of atrocities - the 32 - body - count shooting at Virginia Tech has an uncomfortably competitive flavour .
The man who killed himself all too late in the day in Blacksburg , Virginia , claimed more than twice as many victims as Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris did at Columbine high school in 1999 .
Though " Virginia Tech " does n't have the same ring as the punchier " Columbine " , you wonder if this new shooter was n't making a bid to update the cultural lexicon - to coin the new byword for random campus violence .
While the killers continue to improvise , the media aftermath is numbingly ritualistic .
We ask : why do these rampages keep happening , why primarily in the United States , and what is to be done ?
The answers vary , but they are universally unsatisfactory .
Why do they happen ?
If it does not sound too tautological , campus shootings keep happening because they keep happening .
Every time one of these stories breaks , every time the pictures flash round the world , it increases the chances that another massacre will follow .
In the main , all of these events are copycat crimes .
Campus shootings are now a genre , much as , in literature , campus - shooting novels are a genre , one of whose entries I am guilty of writing myself .
They are part of the cultural vocabulary , and any disgruntled , despairing or vengeful character - of any age of late , since grown - ups now want in on the act - now has the idea of shooting up a campus firmly lodged in his brain .
I do not believe that the choice of schools or colleges for the pursuit of grievance or , often , for the staging of what I call " extroverted suicide " , is arbitrary .
For most of us , school and university are the seats of profound and formative emotional experiences , and the psychological power of these locales does not necessarily abate with age .
Only last month I had reason to walk down the hallway of an elementary school in the US , and the lockers , lino and acrid chalk - dust smell sent my head spinning with memories , not all of which were pleasant .
I felt claustrophobic , smothered , actively grateful to be spared the tyrannies of Mrs Townsend 's home room , and relieved to get out .
In fact , I could n't believe I was allowed out of the door without a pass .
For a lucky few , school and college are where we first distinguish ourselves .
But for the majority , they are the site of first humiliation , subjugation and injury .
They are almost always our first introduction to brutal social hierarchies , as they may also sponsor our first romantic devastation .
What better stage on which to act out primitive retribution ?
As for why America in particular sponsors these killings ... as I write , relatively little has been made public about the shooter in Virginia , but that wo n't be the case for long , which is probably as he would have wanted it .
Anonymity is the last thing most of his fellow campus shooters have sought .
Time was that appearing in the newspaper for doing something dreadful was a fearful prospect .
But Americans appear to have lost touch with the concept of shame .
Now that my compatriots have eschewed the old distinction between fame and infamy for the all - embracing concept of " celebrity " , all that counts is being noticed .
Even posthumous attention beats being ignored .
I would far prefer that this new killer remained anonymous .
Were all such culprits to remain utterly and eternally unknown , the chips on their shoulders interred with their bones , their grudges for ever private , surely the frequency of these grotesquely gratuitous sprees would plummet .
One of the driving forces for most of these killers is not just to be noticed , but , however perversely , to be understood .
But you can't outlaw being disaffected or artificially force a culture to re-embrace the concept of shame .
Nor do we want educational institutions to engender the paranoid , dread - steeped ethos of modern airports .
Surely the only effective preventative measure is logistical .
Make it harder to get guns .
How many mass killings does the American public have to witness before its government gets serious about gun control ?
While the source of armaments in Monday 's shooting has yet to be disclosed as I write , Virginia has some of the most lax gun laws in the country .
You can buy " only " one handgun per month , and criminal - background checks are not required to buy weapons at gun shows .
Nevertheless , American versions of strict gun control are so farcical that many campus shooters would still have had no problem acquiring weapons while playing by the most stringent of rules likely to be applied .
Who is to say that campus shooters of the future wo n't be perfectly content to bide their time as a required " waiting period " between purchase and acquisition ticks by ?
For America 's federal government to take gun control seriously , nothing less than mass armed insurrection is required .
Were the public ever to act on the principles of their own Declaration of Independence , for example - " That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive ... it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new Government " - Congress would shut down the gun industry in a heartbeat .

Scientists in China say they have succeeded in controlling the flight of pigeons with micro electrodes planted in their brains , state media reports .
Scientists at the Robot Engineering Technology Research Centre at Shandong University of Science and Technology said their electrodes could command the pigeons to fly right or left , up or down , Xinhua news agency said .
" The implants stimulate different areas of the pigeon 's brain according to signals sent by the scientists via computer and force the bird to comply with their commands , " Xinhua said .
Amazon dropped the bomb today by announcing its DRM - free music store .
The previously - rumored store will be launched sometime " later this year " and offer unprotected MP3 files for purchase .
The Amazon music store , which does not appear to have a name yet , will offer " millions " of songs from over 12,000 record labels .
Predictably , EMI has offered its own catalog to Amazon .
Just last month , the music label announced that it would begin selling DRM - free tracks through the iTunes Store , making EMI the first major label to forego file protections .
At that time , EMI emphasized that the DRM - free deal was n't iTunes - exclusive and that the company was looking to expand its partnerships to other music sites as well .
" Our MP3 - only strategy means all the music that customers buy on Amazon is always DRM - free and plays on any device , " said Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos in a statement .
" We ’re excited to have EMI joining us in this effort and look forward to offering our customers MP3s from amazing artists like Coldplay , Norah Jones and Joss Stone . "
With this move , Amazon is beating iTunes to the punch by offering an entirely DRM - free store to the public .
However , aside from EMI , the other three major labels wo n't be launching DRM - free tracks with Amazon just yet .
Steve Jobs has reportedly been pressuring the other labels to follow EMI 's lead by offering unprotected , higher - quality tracks through the iTunes Store , but no deals have been struck yet .
We will keep you updated with developments on this story as they come in .
Benjamin Houghton had fewer reasons than most to fear the surgery he ’d scheduled at the West Los Angeles VA Medical Center to remove his potentially cancerous left testicle .
For one thing , the 47 - year - old Air Force veteran and father of four already knew that he could function normally with a single , healthy testicle .
For another , he was getting his surgery in a system that has prided itself on its pioneering efforts to prevent medical errors .
One top VA official said the VA ’s approach to safety is considered “ a benchmark by healthcare organizations throughout the world . ”
But in Houghton ’s case , the hospital missed the mark .
Last June 14 , doctors mistakenly removed the right testicle instead of the left , according to medical records and a claim filed by Houghton and his wife Monica , 39 .
Advertisement
Now the couple are seeking about $ 200,000 for future healthcare costs outside the Department of Veterans Affairs system and an undisclosed amount in damages .
Their claim is pending .
Houghton was left deprived of the testosterone the healthy testicle produced , setting him up for potential health complications including sexual dysfunction , depression , fatigue , weight gain and osteoporosis .
Within a healthcare system with nationally recognized patient safety innovations , he joined the ranks of hundreds of thousands of Americans each year who are victimized by medical errors .
“ At first I thought it was a joke , ” said Houghton , who recalls being told of the mistake immediately afterward , while he was in recovery .
“ Then I was shocked .
I told them , ‘ What do I do now ? ’ ”
Dr. Dean Norman , chief of staff for the Greater Los Angeles VA system , has formally apologized to Houghton and his wife .
Advertisement
“ We are making every attempt that we can to care for Mr. Houghton , but it ’s in litigation , and that ’s all we can tell you , ” he said .
Norman added that the hospital has made changes in its practices as a result of the case .
But Houghton , who has received care through the VA since his discharge in 1989 , wants nothing more to do with a system that he believes failed him .
The surgery Houghton went in for that day was not urgent .
He had first been diagnosed with metastatic testicular cancer in 1989 .
He declined surgery at that time and retired after chemotherapy at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland .
There had been no sign of the cancer ’s recurrence , but his left testicle was atrophied and painful , and there was a chance that it could harbor cancer cells .
Advertisement
The VA surgeon , fifth - year UCLA medical resident John T. Leppert , was supposed to remove Houghton ’s left testicle and perform a vasectomy on his right side for birth control purposes , according to medical records that Houghton and his attorney gave The Times .
In medical parlance , what happened instead was a “ wrong site surgery , ” a category that includes operating on or removing the wrong limb or organ , doing the wrong procedure or treating the wrong patient .
It is a rare , if often devastating , occurrence .
Leppert could not be reached for comment .
The mistake resulted from a series of missteps along the way , a classic pattern long recognized by safety experts .
Errors , they say , are seldom due to a single doctor ’s or nurse ’s incompetence or negligence .
Advertisement
By its own guidelines and those of national hospital regulators , the VA hospital was required to obtain informed consent from the patient for the surgery , mark the operation site and take a “ timeout ” in the operating room to double - check that doctors were targeting the correct site , doing the correct procedure and operating on the correct patient .
According to Houghton ’s medical records , something appears to have gone awry at all three of these steps .
The consent form , prepared the day of surgery , stated that the right testicle was to be removed and a left vasectomy performed , when it should have said the opposite .
The records do not say who prepared the form .
Both Leppert and Houghton signed it , Houghton said .
Houghton did not have his glasses so could not read it , his wife recalled .
Advertisement
The surgeon said , “ ‘ This is what we talked about before .
Just sign here and here , ’ ” Houghton said .
“ I did n’t actually read it . ”
Although Houghton ’s experience serves as an object lesson on reading consent forms carefully , even a thorough examination wo n’t necessarily catch errors , said Fran Griffin , project director at the nonprofit Institute for Healthcare Improvement in Cambridge , Mass .
“ You see what you expect , not what is actually there , ” she said .
“ That ’s why the consent , while it ’s an important step , by itself will never be sufficient . ”
The next step -- marking the site with a surgical pen -- is supposed to take place before sedation , so the patient can participate .
Advertisement
Houghton said he was asked to identify the surgical site and pointed to his left testicle , but both he and his wife said no one marked it .
Houghton ’s records do n’t mention a mark .
Finally , the medical records show that a timeout was called , but it ’s unclear whether medical personnel consulted any document besides the erroneous consent form .
The lapses occurred within a system that since 1999 has focused on error prevention .
The idea behind the approach , which has been used for years in the aviation industry , recognizes that mistakes will happen .
But safety mechanisms are supposed to be built into the system at various steps along the way , so lapses are caught before they do harm .
Norman detailed how the West Los Angeles hospital has tightened its guidelines :
Advertisement
An electronic , rather than a written , consent form is now used , he said , meaning that the information in a patient ’s records goes directly to the form without the risk of a transcription error .
And well before the patient is wheeled into the operating room , the surgeon must review the consent form and make sure that it , the chart and the patient agree on the procedure .
Whereas , before , one clinician might mark the site and then go off duty , now the surgeon who will perform the procedure must mark and initial the site .
And surgeons at the hospital have attended a mandatory “ timeout ” workshop on safety and teamwork .
It had been planned before the wrong - site error , but “ the case made it easier to get everyone ’s attention , ” Norman said .
Getting the VA ’s attention is what the Houghtons and their attorney , Dr. Susan Friery , said they hoped to accomplish by going public with their situation .
Advertisement
Houghton still has n’t had the aching testicle removed .
The botched surgery has taken a toll on his and Monica ’s marriage and on the two of their combined five children who remain at home .
The Frazier Park resident is on disability and cares for the children , ages 8 and 13 , while his wife works for Princess Cruises in Valencia .
“ When I come walking in from work , they ’ll say , ‘ Daddy ’s having a good day ’ or ‘ Daddy ’s having a bad day , ’ ” Monica Houghton said .
“ Our relationship has changed ....
It ’s hard .
I ’d like to see it not happen to somebody else . ”

Every day that young Genarlow Wilson remains in prison for consensual sexual activity is a further indictment against the prosecutors , lawmakers and judges of the Georgia legal system .
Lawyers for Mr. Wilson have applied for a writ of habeas corpus to challenge his cruel and unusual 10 - year sentence .
The Superior Court should grant it .
When he was 17 , Mr. Wilson received oral sex from a 15 - year - old girl .
For that , he has served over two years of a strict minimum decade - long prison term .
He was convicted of aggravated child molestation , a charge intended for adult sexual predators .
If Mr. Wilson had engaged in sexual intercourse with the same girl , it would have been a misdemeanor under an exemption for contact between minors .
Oral sex was left out .
Legislators have since corrected the unintended trap .
If Mr. Wilson engaged in the same action today , it would be a misdemeanor .
The Board of Pardons and Paroles is legally prohibited from granting clemency for this offense .
And the State Senate adjourned for the year without taking up a bill that would have allowed judges to review sentences in cases like Mr. Wilson’s .
The behavior of the district attorney , David McDade , requires particular scrutiny .
He charged Mr. Wilson with raping a different girl at the same party , and a jury acquitted him in 2005 .
Mr. McDade has distributed a graphic videotape of the events in that case to legislators as part of a lobbying effort at the State Senate against Mr. Wilson ’s release .
And Mr. McDade went on television last month and said , referring to Mr. Wilson and others involved , “ Six young men basically gang - raped a 17 - year - old . ”

One small slice of bread , one giant leap for toasters .
A few weeks ago , we rounded up a bunch of high tech toasters and wrote about about using a hot - air gun to draw designs , by hand , on fancy toast .
We ’ve now mounted the hot air gun to a computer - controlled X - Y control system so that we can use it to print arbitrary images on toast .
The hot air gun that we ’ve used is actually intended to be the printing head of our 3D sugar printer , where it serves to selectively fuse the printing media together .
Recently we succeeded in mounting the hot air gun to the carriage of the printer .
The next step was testing the XY motion control system without the Z axis installed .
It turns out that you can actually do some interesting things with just the print head and the X -Y gantry .
Especially since , as one of our astute readers noted in a comment , “ ( 3D printer – Z axis ) + hot air rework station =completely digital toast imaging technology . ”
Our thoughts exactly .
We certainly are n’t the first ones to aim for true CNC toast– A group of students at Olin College apparently were working towards that goal a few years ago , but may have given up in favor of their laser cutter– which is ( we think ) cheating on building a CNC toaster .
( Do n’t get us wrong –
We are of course very fond of laser cutters – they can be used to cut cake , or engrave matza , or just about anything else .
Whether merely ablating away part of your bread with a high power CO2 laser should count as toasting is perhaps debatable , but it ’s certainly an expensive way to make breakfast . )
Hello world !
To begin our 2D testing , we placed a cookie sheet where the Z axis of the printer would normally go .
We had to stack a few pieces of bread on top of each other so that the top piece would be at the correct level to be printed on , just a few millimeters below the heat gun nozzle .
Our resolution for these tests was 10 dots per inch ( 2.5 mm pixel size ) .
Next , we tried out a photographic subject .
When we thought about what face we ’d expect to see staring out of a little rectangle , the clear choice was Ze Frank .
We pulled a great still from this article about small screen movies .
( It is , of course , a still from The Show with zefrank . )
Getting an image to print correctly took several things going right : a good image , and adjusting the air flow rate , temperature , and the length of time spent on each pixel .
Here is the actual image that we printed , 55 x 42 pixels :
Quite a bit of fine tuning was necessary to get the correct amount of darkening to show the image best .
We made a short movie of the toast - printing process , 1:18 , no sound .
You can watch the hot toasting action on YouTube or embedded here :
One of the other cool things that toast visibly is a papadum .
It ’s a nice round canvas .
I drew a sunflower in Inkscape and scaled it down to make a good test subject .
I used large dots in the middle ( not a grey or a set of small dots ) so that when it reduced , the pattern in the middle was still visible .
It even shows up nicely on the papadum .
Unfortunately , while the papadums toast very easily , they get flexible when heated and tend to curl .
To counteract this tendency , we held them down to the cookie sheet with magnets .
This was tricky – the papadums are brittle !
If you perform a Google search on the terms CNC and Toast , one of the top hits is our friends at Because We Can .
Not that they are making CNC toast , but they score high on those terms because they make things with a CNC routing table and one of the cofounders is Jeffrey “ Toast ” McGrew .
I adapted this photo and printed it on bread , so we made a piece of CNC Toast toast for Toast .
( And yes , we gave this piece of Toast toast to Toast ) .
Home Combining Total and Ad Hoc Extensible Pattern Matching in a Lightweight Language Extension Combining Total and Ad Hoc Extensible Pattern Matching in a Lightweight Language Extension .
Don Syme , Gregory Neverov and James Margetson .
Pattern matching of algebraic data types ( ADTs ) is a standard feature in typed functional programming languages but it is well known that it interacts poorly with abstraction .
While several partial solutions to this problem have been proposed , few have been implemented or used .
This paper describes an extension to the .NET language F# called ``Active Patterns '' , which supports pattern matching over abstract representations of generic heterogeneous data such as XML and term structures , including where these are represented via object models in other .NET languages .
Our design is the first to incorporate both ad hoc pattern matching functions for partial decompositions and ``views ' ' for total decompositions , and yet remains a simple and lightweight extension .
We give a description of the language extension along with numerous motivating examples .
Finally we describe how this feature would interact with other reasonable and related language extensions : existential types quantified at data discrimination tags , GADTs , and monadic generalizations of pattern matching .
Quite related to the recent discussions of the relationships between libraries , frameworks and language features .

A Quick Comparison
Paul Graham .
James Gosling .
Whether you like the languages these guys champion or not , I think most people would agree that they ’re both pretty good programmers .
They also represent two different ends of the programming spectrum .
Take the topic of program design , for instance ; and by design , I mean spending time thinking about how to write a program before you actually write it .
When asked what makes some programmers more productive than others , Gosling responded :
“ They think about what they do .
They do n’t rush in and slap things together .
They have a holistic picture of what is to be built . ”
Seems like the kind of guy who would be a proponent of designing a program before you start writing it , right ?
Now , let ’s look at what Paul Graham has to say on the subject :
“ I was taught in college that one ought to figure out a program completely on paper before even going near a computer .
I found that I did not program this way .
I found that I liked to program sitting in front of a computer , not a piece of paper . ”
So , on the one hand , we have the corporate Java programmers who like to work out every detail of a program before they start writing it , and on the other , we have the cowboy Lisp hackers who throw out code and hope for the best .
Who ’s right ?
“ We need our design methodologies ! ”
Allow me to start by saying that I lean more to Gosling ’s side .
Design is great .
I ’m wishing I had done more of it sooner .
For example , I ’m currently working on a small strategy game .
If I had n’t taken the time to get an idea of how I wanted to write it first , I ’d be screwed right around this point .
My first problem came in how I wanted to represent the board .
Should I just draw sprites in random locations ?
Should I store the board as a grid of tiles ?
Ultimately , I went with the tiles .
At that point , I had a new problem : in addition to possibly holding a soldier , each tile would also have to have information about its terrain ( mountain , forest , etc. ) .
How would I represent this information ?
Should I make a list for tiles , have each spot of the list hold an object of Soldier , and have each type of terrain I want derive from Soldier ?
That ’s a bit messy .
Should I hard - code terrain information based on the map I load ?
No , what if terrain changes during battle ?
If I had n’t worked out these problems in the beginning , I ’d have a mass of broken code .
There ’s no need to go overboard on design .
Before I started to write my game , I got a good idea of all the features the game would have , what classes and functions I would use in the program , and what all these elements did and how they communicated with each other .
That ’s all ; it was really a very high level overview .
But I ’m glad I did it ; you have to do some design .
Rebuttal from the Lisp Camp
The general sentiment among Lisp programmers who think they do n’t need to do design is that the Lisp language gives them this freedom .
I do n’t really understand the logic behind this , but you can read any of Paul Graham ’s essays , or a post on comp.lang.lisp , to find it .
No matter what language you code in , you have to do some amount of design ; even in Lisp .
When I was writing my RPG language in Lisp , I had trouble in the beginning because I was starting off with a bad design .
My original plan was to read words from a file and look them up in a symbol table to see how the rest of the line would be read .
Eventually , I decided to represent rooms in the game as hierarchical data , like XML ; I also decided to work backwards , and write the functions to process this data before I worried about constructing it from a file .
Seems like a design decision , does n’t it ?
If I had thought about my design before I began writing my program , I would have saved myself quite a bit of time .
To Be Continued …
This should probably be called “ How much Design is Enough , Part 1 ” .
This game is the first project I ’ve ever done any real design on , and I ’m very early in the coding process , so I ’m going to have to see how it pans out .
But so far , this design thing looks like it might be pretty cool .
You should do it .
Now , I ’ll wait for the angry comments to roll in .

Pregnant women who do not eat fish regularly could be harming their baby 's development , doctors have warned .
Those who eat fish three times a week have brighter and better behaved children , say researchers .
Their study , published in The Lancet , concludes that women should be eating at least 12ozs ( 350g ) of fish and seafood a week .
But the researchers , from Bristol University , expressed concern that recent advice about what women should eat in pregnancy may be deterring them from eating fish .
The Food Standards Agency has advised mothers - to - be to eat no more than two portions of oily fish a week .
It said they can eat any amount of white fish , except shark and marlin .
The advice follows concerns about the food 's mercury content , which it is claimed could harm a baby 's nervous system , and concerns over pollutants in oily fish .
Oily fish such as salmon , mackerel ,
herring and trout contain the most omega 3 fatty acids , which play an important role in helping the brain grow .
Professor Jean Golding from Bristol University said : ' Eating fish , particularly oily fish , is important for a child 's development in the womb but the message has been overshadowed by warnings about possible risks .
' However , there is no evidence that small amounts of mercury have an adverse effect on the brain .
' If there was an adverse effect then we would have seen it in our study , rather than the big benefits gained from fish consumption in pregnancy . '
Some 9,000 families took part in the study , which compared the amount of fish eaten by pregnant mothers with the development and behaviour of their offspring up to age eight .
Mothers who ate more than 12ozs of seafood a week had children who were more advanced in development tests measuring motor , communication and social skills , were better behaved , and had better verbal IQ scores .
The children whose mothers had eaten little or no fish were 28 per cent more likely to have poor communication skills at 18 months and 35 per cent more likely to have poor coordination as toddlers .
The risk of bad behaviour and low verbal IQ at the age of eight was almost 50 per cent higher in children whose mothers avoided fish .
A study of fish oils in December showed they help boost babies ' brainpower , coordination and vocabulary .
Sue Macdonald of the Royal College of Midwives said women should be aware of the benefits of eating fish .
But she added : ' The research does present a dilemma in achieving a balance between eating sufficient fish , especially oily fish , to be of benefit against the negative effects of increasing the intake above recommended levels in terms of potential toxic effects .
' I would advise women to talk to their midwife , who can give realistic advice . '
let us not forget that things are rarely that simple , and people who refuse to see the gray areas are frequently idealists and fundamentalist , who conveniently ignore reality
The free market has failed at pricing those costs and appropriately assigning them to Dudes business and the oil industry ( and pricing structure ) .
There is some fundamental truth in a Walter Williams article , that speaks of the moral high ground offered by libertarianism and our free market system .
In the article , Williams explains that our markets morally distribute goods and services , and that government taxation is in - fact highly immoral in comparison .
This is convenient to spur debate , however .
So how do we handle those who present us with black and white solutions to complex problems ?
I say , introduce some complexity into the argument and see whether it holds up .
Sometimes they do ...
Here is an example of one source of a " gray area " that make stylized examples like Walter 's falter : Externalities .
In his article , a Dude got $ 30 for mowing the lawn , so Walter says he has earned the right for $ 30 of groceries .
He claims that this is an example of how efficient and moral our capitalist system is .
The system was moral in that it rewarded Dude ( with beer and steak ) at a level commensurate with his contribution to Society ( his lawn mowing ) .
I agree , we have a great system and I do love it and enjoy it for the most part .
But wait .. what if , in the process of mowing the lawn , Dude was unaware that he caused a rock to fly out of his mower and severely injure a nearby child , and he was not held accountable .
Dude was unaware that this had happened , and nobody knew the source of the injury when the toddler ran into the home crying .
This can be seen as a negative externality ( loosely defined ) to Dude 's lawn mowing business .
Say now , that the child is uninsured and the family lacks the resources to stitch that wound .
Now we have a morality problem .. do we not ?
A less direct and less costly externality of his business is his 2 cycle lawn mower , which is old , leaks , and has emmissions hundreds of times worse per gallon than a modern car .
The price of his gas ( which is passed through to his customer ) does not properly include all the costs associated with burning that gas .
Costs such as environmental , public health , past current and future military action associated with securing oil , etc ... Government tries ( and admittedly fails some of the time ) to recognize positive and negative externalities and remedy them through tarrifs , taxes , incentives etc . .
I am not saying this is the always the right approach , but simply want to point out that the libertarian ideal will always suffer from the unavoidable fact that our markets fail to take into account ( by pricing properly ) the true costs and true benefits of many products .
We see this in the ridiculously low cost of non-renewable and polluting energy , or chemicals , which rarely carry the full cost burden in the price to account for the society wide destruction they cause .
Like the unidentified rock that wounded the child , when we all get cancer and the company that sold us the chemical is bankrupt , do n't we all look to gov't to help us out ?
And is this really that unreasonable for a civilized society ?
to expect that we all share the burden of this type of event , as a kind of insurance against the free market 's externalities .
The solution is not always more taxes .
The solution is to use the power of government to help identify and incorporate these costs into the market as best as we can .
Carbon trading and caps are an example .
Nobody was taxed , but a maximum level was set by the Government and the free market then priced and traded credits accordingly .
Simplified libertarian or free - market examples lead us to believe that if only government would stay out of our way , the " invisible hand " will sort everything out .
There is a brilliant elegance to the free market and the benefits it produces , but we must recognise that we do n't live in a vacuum and can never achieve a perfect market that would cure all ills .
There will always be information asymetry , conspiracy , monopoly , unaccounted for positive and negative externalitiess and more such problems that need to be addressed .
That being said , I think federal government intrusion has gone too far ... and would like to see a reduction in Washington 's influence in exchange for greater autonomy and power at the State level .
Federal government is so big , it actually muddles the market so much that it creates some serious externalities of sorts .
We have so many energy subsidies its ridiculous and determining the true cost of ethanol or petroleum is an even greater challenge .
OMAR ALI MOHAMMED , 18 , BAGHDAD
My second name is Ali , which is a Shia name .
My first name is Omar , a traditionally Sunni name .
A militiaman from the Shia Mehdi army
My mother liked the idea that through my name I was reflecting both the Sunni and the Shia traditions , despite the fact that we are Shia .
It turns out her decision to call me Omar was not a good one .
My name is not to the liking of either Shias or Sunnis , and I was nearly killed recently because of it .
During my exams , I had to travel between my mainly Sunni neighbourhood to a Shia district .
As always , there were militias belonging to each sect on the outskirts of each area .
As I was about to enter the Shia area , an armed militiaman stopped me .
He asked me to show him my ID card .
The militiamen saw my name , and they asked me whether I was Shia or Sunni .
I told them that I was Shia , but my mother called me Omar to bring the two sects closer .
They started beating and kicking me severely because they thought I was a liar , and they told me that if they saw me again , they would kill me .
Either I change my name , or I leave the country altogether
The same thing happened to me at the hands of Sunnis , because my father 's name is Ali .
I narrowly escaped being killed .
It is strange , I do not feel that I belong to either side .
I am Shia by birth , but I have always seen myself as an Iraqi .
I have always been proud of my name which unites the two sects .
There is no solution .
Either I change my name and accept being forced to take sides , or I leave the country altogether .
Now , I am even afraid to leave the house .
KHALID , 29 , BAGHDAD
I live in Talbiya , a Shia area , very close to Sadr city .
Our neighbourhood is currently under the control of the Mehdi army , one of the most powerful Shia militias .
The Mehdi army is made up of ordinary people who took matters into their own hands after the regime collapsed and they saw that the government was not doing anything to protect them .
These individuals now play a major role in our area .
You see them driving expensive cars and carrying arms .
People go to them for help and protection .
The militias are becoming indispensable to us because they provide us with protection .
I agree that militias play a negative role , but given the weakness of the police , army and the state of lawlessness , we find ourselves forced to rely on them .
For example , the militias helped a family to get their son released after he was kidnapped by militias in another area .
The militias have an effective intelligence network , and they know everyone in the area .
They are becoming indispensable to us because they provide us with protection .
MOHAMMED , POLICEMAN , BAGHDAD
The role of the militias often does not conflict with that of the police at all .
I cannot call them outlaws ; there is no law
For example , you see militiamen helping traffic police in their work , and they also help in deterring thieves and burglars .
Merchants and grocers used to be very frightened of sending their goods to be sold in Jamila market , one of the biggest vegetable and fruit markets in Baghdad .
But now there are no thieves in Jamila market , thanks to the militias .
I cannot call these men outlaws , because there is no law in the first place .
They are people whose existence is dictated by the lawlessness and chaos in Iraq .
ABU MUSTAFA , DOCTOR'S ASSISTANT
I have been living in this mainly Shia neighbourhood for 20 years .
Although I am Sunni , I have n't suffered any ill - treatment in this area , even after the increase of sectarianism in the country .
People in my area come to me for medical help any time day or night .
However , I think that the existence of militias is a problem .
Mehdi army militiamen in Baghdad
I fear that I may be attacked if the Shia militias in the area were to be provoked by Sunni militias .
One day I found a threatening note pinned to my door warning me to leave the neighbourhood .
I took the note and I went to the militia 's headquarters .
They told me that it was not their work , and asked me to call them should anything untoward happen .
They assured me they knew me very well , and that they were aware that I helped people and that I did not behave in a sectarian way .
But I am not happy or comfortable that the militia have control .
The only authority that should carry arms is the government police and security , or else we will have chaos .
But for the time being , they make the place more secure , because the government is still weak .
KHALIDA , 40 , BAGHDAD
I am a Shia woman living in Amariya , which is a mainly Sunni area in Baghdad .
The militias have turned our lives into a living hell
There were a large number of Saddam 's senior army officers and many ex-Baath party senior officials living here ; all of them made wealthy during the reign of Saddam .
After Saddam was toppled , most of them lost their power and privileges and they were struggling both financially and psychologically .
It was easy for them to join the pro al - Qaeda militias .
I told the neighbours that we were Sunnis , but after months of fear , I have decided to leave Iraq .
I have seen killings every day .
I saw with my own eyes young men being killed simply for being the sons of Shia families in the area .
I saw a 20 - year - old girl being killed simply for having worked in a hairdresser 's shop .
The militias have turned our lives into a living hell .
They want us to live according to their laws and rules .
Young children are not allowed to wear shorts and western hairstyles are not permitted .
Coffee is among the most widely consumed beverages in the world , and that the preponderance of scientific evidence suggests that moderate coffee consumption ( 3 - 5 cups per day ) may be associated with reduced risk of certain disease conditions , such as Parkinson ’s disease .
Some research in neuropharamacology suggests that one cup of coffee can halve the risk of Parkinson ’s disease .
Other studies have found it reduces the risk of Alzheimer ’s disease , kidney stones , gallstones , depression and even suicide .
American Society for Nutrition ’s panel chair Dr. James Coughlin , a toxicology / safety consultant , says that recent advances in epidemiologic and experimental knowledge have transformed many of the negative health myths about coffee drinking into validated health benefits .
Dr. Coughlin and two distinguished researchers discussed some of the benefits – and a couple of the remaining increased risk factors ( possible increase in blood pressure and plasma homocysteine ) – on April 30 at the Experimental Biology meeting in Washington , DC .
Dr. Rob van Dam , an epidemiologist at the Harvard School of Public Health and the Harvard Medical School , studies the link between diet and the development of type 2 diabetes .
Worldwide , an estimated 171 million persons have diabetes , mostly type 2 diabetes , and an alarming increase to 366 million persons is expected for the year 2030 .
While increased physical activity and restriction of energy intake can substantially reduce risk of type 2 diabetes , he believes insight into the role of other lifestyle factors may contribute to additional prevention strategies for type 2 diabetes .
In recent epidemiological studies in the U.S. , Europe and Japan , persons who were heavy coffee consumers had a lower risk of type 2 diabetes than persons who consumed little coffee .
Interestingly , he says , associations were similar for caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee , suggesting that coffee components other than caffeine may be beneficial for glucose metabolism .
Coffee contains hundreds of components including substantial amounts of chlorogenic acid , caffeine , magnesium , potassium , vitamin B3 , trigonelline , and lignans .
Limited evidence suggests that coffee may improve glucose metabolism by reducing the rate of intestinal glucose absorption and by stimulating the secretion of the gut hormone glucagon - like peptide - 1 ( GLP - 1 ) that is beneficial for the secretion of insulin .
However , most mechanistic research on coffee and glucose metabolism has been done in animals and in lab tubes and therefore metabolic studies in humans are currently being conducted .
Further research may lead to the development or selection of coffee types with improved health effects .
Dr. Lenore Arab , a nutritional epidemiologist in the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA , notes that the first coffee controversy dates back 430 years when in 1570 some monks petitioned the pope to condemn this drink , so popular among Muslims .
Pope Clement VIII , liking how it kept the monks from falling sleep during mass , purportedly blessed it instead .
The rest , including the United States ’ wholesale conversion to coffee following the Boston Tea Party , is history .
In reviewing the latest epidemiologic literature on cancers and coffee , Dr. Arab has found there to be close to 400 studies of the associations between coffee consumption and cancers various at various sites .
The earlier controversy with regard to colon cancer was based on flawed analyses , she says .
More thorough analyses and the accumulation of evidence suggest no negative effect on the incidence of colon cancer , and possible protective effects for adenomas of the colon as well as for rectal cancer and liver cancer .
Mechanisms which might contribute to a possible anticarcinogenic effect include reduction in cholesterol , bile acid and neutral sterol secretion in the colon , increased colonic motility and reduced exposure of epithelium to carcinogens , the ability of diterpenes to reduce genotoxicity of carcinogens , and lower DNA adduct formation , and the ability of caffeic acid and chlorogenic acid to decreased DNA methylation .
In other cancers – breast , ovarian , and prostate – the evidence is not suggestive of either risk or protection .
There are two areas , says Dr. Arab , in which there is some evidence of increased risk : leukemia and stomach cancer .
The evidence for the former is intriguing , for the latter insubstantial .
She concludes that a systematic review of the newer data for liver , rectal , stomach cancer and for childhood leukemia is due .

Richard Clarke Advised New York City Subway Searches
Now this is a surprise .
Richard Clarke advised New York City to perform those pointless subway searches :
Mr. Clarke , a former counterterrorism adviser to two presidents , received widespread attention last year for his criticism of President Bush ’s response to the Sept. 11 attacks , detailed in a searing memoir and in security testimony before the 9/11 Commission .
Unknown to the public , until recently , was Mr. Clarke ’s role in advising New York City officials in helping to devise the “ container inspection program ” that the Police Department began in July after two attacks on the transit system in London .
Seems that his goal was n’t to deter terrorism , but simply to move it from the New York City subways to another target ; perhaps the Boston subways ?
“ Obviously you want to catch people with bombs on their back , but there is a value to a program that does n’t stop everyone and is n’t compulsory , ” he said in a deposition .
Mr. Clarke later added , “ The goal here is to impart to the terrorists a sense that there is an enhanced security program , to deter them from going into the New York subway and choosing that as a target . ”

Snapshot for April 4 , 2007 .
Current recovery great for profits , poor by most other measures
by L. Josh Bivens
Recent data regarding fourth quarter ( 2006 ) growth in U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) allows us to examine how the current recovery , now entering its fifth year , stacks up against the other recoveries since World War II that lasted as long .
This assessment can shed light on the effectiveness of macroeconomic policies enacted in the name of improving economic growth .
This much is clear : the current recovery substantially lags the historical average in GDP growth , employment growth , investment in equipment and software , and , with the deflating housing market , even in residential investment .
Conversely , corporate profit growth in the current recovery ( despite a 3 % dip in the last quarter of 2006 ) has been almost twice as rapid as in the past .
In short , the current recovery looks weak on all measures except profit growth .
As a policy lesson , the large tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 , which have had ample time to affect the economy by now , have failed to deliver economic performance that even matches up to the past average .

Hungary may legalize porn involving 14 - to 17 - year - olds for home use BUDAPEST , Hungary ( AP ) 
A bill modifying Hungary 's penal code could allow pornographic material involving 14 - to 17 - year - olds to be made and kept for personal use .
The Justice Ministry said the draft proposal , presented last month by Hungarian Justice Minister Jozsef Petretei , was in line with European Union norms which give members states the right to regulate the issue at national level .
But Opposition lawmakers attacked the proposal as " legalized pedophilia " and a family welfare group described it as " the waiting room of prostitution . "
Petretei said Monday that the proposal had taken into account the age in Hungary — 14 — at which consensual sexual relations are allowed .
" If we consider people 14 years of age to be mature enough to consent to sexual acts , then the chance to make picture recordings of this ... can also be allowed , " Petretei told lawmakers in parliament .
The minister added that if deputies felt the issue offended their " moral sensitivity , " they could propose changes to the bill .
Petretei also said that to bring Hungarian laws in line with EU norms , the ministry was also advocating changes in the same bill which would increase penalties for some other porn-related issues .
The center - right opposition parties strongly criticized the plan .
" This is a scandal , " Miklos Soltesz , from the opposition Christian Democratic Peoples Party , told state television .
" We initially thought the intention to legalize child pornography was government insanity ... but it seems they 're serious . "
Idiko Gall Pelcz from Fidesz , the largest center - right opposition party , described the proposal as " legalized pedophilia , " calling it " revolting and distressing . "
" I can only hope that there will be many of us here in parliament who agree ... that to make pornographic recordings of minors is not part of and not a necessary condition of natural sexual development , " Gall Pelcz said in parliament .
A civic group described the plan as " the waiting room of prostitution . "
" This goes against common sense and the international rules on children 's rights , " the Association of Large Families , which represents families with at least three children and claims to be Hungary 's largest civic organization , said in a statement .
Gergely Barandy , a deputy from the governing Socialist Party , said one possible solution would be to reject the ministry 's proposal relaxing the current law , but to give judges discretion in applying it .
" We would consider it unfair to threaten a 19 - year - old person with prison for taking erotic pictures of his 17 - year - old wife for their own use , " Barandy said in a statement .
The bill — which is part of a longer series of proposed changes to the penal code stretching to 104 pages — says the pornographic material cannot involve people between the ages of 14 and 17 if they are related to or under the care of the person making the recordings .
The participants also must give their consent to the video or photos and the material cannot be made for commercial purposes .
The debate of the bill began in parliament last week and while some speakers mentioned general reservations about the plan , no concrete counterproposals were made .
Parliamentary Speaker Katalin Szili said Monday that the debate of the bill would continue next week .
Changes to the penal code require a simple majority in parliament , so in theory the government parties — which hold 210 of the 386 seats — would have enough votes to approve the proposal .
Changes suggested by lawmakers are voted on separately , so the bill could be approved even if the part in question is rejected .
Currently , Hungarian law says that adults making pornographic materials involving people under the age of 18 can be sentenced to up to two years in prison .

Last week began with a Supreme Court decision declaring that the federal government had the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions and all but ordering the Bush administration to do so .
It ended with a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change — the world ’s authoritative voice on global warming — warning that failure to contain these emissions will have disastrous environmental effects , especially in poorer countries , which are least able to defend themselves and their people against the consequences of climate change .
One would hope that these events would shake President Bush out of his state of denial and add his authority to the chorus of governors , legislators and business leaders calling for an aggressive regulatory and technological response to the dangers of global warming .
They have n’t .
When asked about the Supreme Court decision , the president said he thought he was already doing enough .
He argued further that there was little point in the United States ’ doing any more unless other polluters like China acted as well .
That ignores the reality that no developing country is going to move unless the United States — which produces one - fourth of the world ’s emissions with only 5 percent of its population — takes the lead .
The report from the intergovernmental panel was the second of three due this year .
The first concluded with “ 90 percent certainty ” that humans had caused the rise in atmospheric temperatures over the last half - century .
The most recent focused on the consequences , few of them positive .

In 2004 , two Florida adolescents – 16 - year - old Amber and 17 - year - old Jeremy–took digital photos of themselves nude and engaged in some sort of sexual contact .
They then sent the photos from a computer at Amber ’s house to Jeremy ’s email address .
Somehow , the Tallahassee police got possession of the photos , and both Amber and Jeremy were arrested and charged with producing , directing or promoting a photograph featuring the sexual conduct of a child .
Jeremy was also charged with possession of child pornography .
Amber appealed the charge , believing she had the law on her side .
In 1995 , a Florida court ruled that two 16 - year - olds could not be found delinquent for having sex with each other .
Since Amber was engaged in legal sex , she and her attorney reasoned that the police had violated her guaranteed right to privacy .
Remember this ( edited ) exchange between Alice and the White Queen in Through the Looking Glass ?
“ Suppose he never commits the crime ? ”
“ That would be all the better , would n’t it ? ”
“ Of course it would be all the better , but it would n’t be all the better his being punished . ”
“ You ’re wrong there , at any rate .
Were you ever punished ? ”
“ Only for faults . ”
“ And you were all the better for it , I know ! ”
“ Yes , but then I had done the things I was punished for .
That makes all the difference . ”
“ But if you had n’t done them , that would have been better still ; better , and better , and better ! ”
This month , a Florida Appeals Court voted 2 - 1 to uphold the charge against Amber .
Writing for the majority , Judge James R. Wolf , speculated that both Amber and Jeremy could have eventually sold the photos to child pornographers or shown them to friends .
He also said that transferring the digital images from a camera to a computer and then sending them via email created “ innumerable problems ” because the computers could be hacked .
Judge Wolf ’s reasoning must make every Florida parent with photos of their naked children a bit uncomfortable .
After all , they might show the photos to friends , and those friends might even sell them to child pornographers .
Or one might slip out a of parent ’s pocket or purse and be picked up by a stranger , who could then sell it to a child pornographer .
And who knows how many parents with photos of their naked toddlers might become child pornographers ?
Amber and Jeremy are too young to be listed on a sex offender registry , thank goodness , but there is no doubt that their privacy was violated , and there is no telling what kind of psychological effect this circus has had on them .
US Attorneys investigator accuses White House of cover up by blocking Miers ' testimony Michael Roston

Sitting before an empty chair with a name placard for Harriet Miers , former White House Counsel , a top Democrat on the House committee investigating the firing of 8 US Attorneys accused President George W. Bush of perpetrating a cover up .
" The President 's inconsistent position on allowing senior advisers to testify may reflect [ President Bush 's ] concern about what the advisers may say rather than steadfast adherence to concept of executive privilege , " said Rep. Linda Sanchez ( D - CA ) , the Chairwoman of the Subcommittee on Commercial and Administrative Law , the House Judiciary Committee body that authorized a subpoena for Miers ' appearance .
But her Republican counterpart argued that there was no need for Miers to appear .
He insisted that the White House was not involved in the firings .
" We do n't generally need Ms. Miers ' information , and we do n't need a showdown , " said Rep. Chris Cannon ( R - UT ) , who then accused the Democratic members of the committee of " smoke and mirrors . "
But the committee 's chairman , Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) made it clear that he saw there was a legal necessity for the hearing .
" I 'm still catching my breath after the six or more myths that Mr. Cannon has propounded , " he said .
" We 're here today because we issued a subpoena . "
He added , " We 're still trying to get to the bottom of this . "
The committee had believed that Miers would attend the hearing , announcing via a statement on Monday afternoon that it would attempt to evaluate on a case - by - case basis whether the answers to particular questions were covered by executive privilege .
But Miers 's attorney Tuesday informed the committee that she would not appear on Capitol Hill hours after Sara Taylor , former White House political director and top aide to Karl Rove , completed her testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
Taylor admitted on several occasions that she had probably answered questions that were covered by executive privilege .
" I 'm trying to walk a very fine line here and I 'm probably answering questions that really fall within the guidelines of Mr. Fielding 's letter , " she said during the Tuesday hearing .
" And I 'm going to do my best not to do that . "
Committee rejects claim of ' executive privilege '
In the hearing , Rep. Sanchez presented a detailed legal argument in which she rejected the claims of executive privilege that Miers was relying on .
She dismissed them as ' novel ' legal reasoning that was not in keeping with long - standing precedent .
" Those claims are not legally valid , and Ms. Miers is required , pursuant to the subpoena , to be here now , " " No one is here on behalf of the White House to assert that claim ... a statement from the president is legally required in order for the claim to be legally valid . "
She added that the Bush White House 's went beyond that of President Richard Nixon , who eventually allowed his counsel John Dean to testify in the Watergate probe .
[ Rep. Sanchez 's full statement can be downloaded at this link . ]
Cannon argued in response that there was no evidence of underlying criminality that justified legal enforcement of the committee 's subpoena .
He argued that attempting to enforce the subpoena would undermine Congress 's power in the future to investigate executive branch wrongdoing .
Sanchez did not agree .
" Witnesses cannot simply refuse to appear before the subcommittee , " Sanchez answered , stating that Cannon should enforce the subpoena 's enforcement if he wanted to protect the power of the legislative branch .
Democratic member raises specter of criminal contempt
While the motion that Rep. Sanchez was advancing was limited to rejecting Bush 's assertion of executive privilege , other Democrats suggested that a ' contempt of Congress ' citation was in order .
" I support the chair in bringing a contempt citation , " said Rep. Stephen Cohen ( D - TN ) .
" This is an affront to each of us , Democratic , Republican , and Libertarian . "
But a Republican responded , suggesting that executive privilege was needed for the same reason that the legal system protected spousal privilege and attorney - client privilege .
" We want folks to be honest and candid with each other , that 's the best thing for society , " Rep. Ric Keller ( R - FL ) stated .
He went on to suggest that without executive privilege , President Bush could not get ' honest and candid advice ' about policy issues , such as an honest assessment about the failure of America 's warfighting strategies in Iraq .
Keller added , " The President is acting not just to protect himself but to protect the Presidency , and future Presidents . "
Committee prepares subpoena for Republican e-mails
As a final matter , Sanchez 's subcommittee authorized the issuing of a subpoena for e-mails written by senior White House staff on Republican National Committee e-mail accounts .
Rep. Sanchez noted that the committee had attempted to gain the e-mails , but was stymied by a White House assertion of executive privilege .
" The White House has interfered , insisting that it first be allowed to review and redact e-mails based on whatever privileges it unilaterally deemed appropriate , " Sanchez said .
She went on to reason that , " The committee has exhausted all reasonable means to obtain the RNC communications through cooperation .
And it is evident that the RNC communications , which may include complaints about US Attorneys by political officials and Republican Party activists are essential to our investigation . "
The subcommittee authorized the issuance of subpoena by a voice vote , and the hearing was adjourned .
Background : Miers played large role in Attorneys firings
The White House 's insistence that Miers not appear before the House Judiciary Committee may prevent Congressional investigators from piecing together key details of the US Attorneys firings .
Earlier testimony made it clear that Miers was an important player in the current controversy .
D. Kyle Sampson , former Chief of Staff to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales , explained how he received informal instructions from Miers and her lieutenant Bill Kelley at the White House on a regular basis .
" I remember speaking with Harriet Miers and Bill Kelley about that .
Sometimes this subject would come up after a Judicial Selection Committee meeting , which was a once - a - week meeting that happened in the Roosevelt Room , " Sampson told Senator Ted Kennedy ( D - MA ) in his March 29 appearance before the Senate Judiciary Committee .
He added , " The issue of replacing U.S. attorneys most frequently came up as sort of a pull - aside after a Judicial Selection meeting . "
E-mails turned over to Congressional investigators also made clear that Miers was running damage control around Jan. 16 when Senator Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) first complained on the Senate floor about the firings .
" The US Attorneys themselves have n't fired any shots .
Harriet feels very strongly that we should n't respond to the merits , even though we are convinced that they have disloyally stirred up the Senators , " her aide Kelley wrote to Sampson on Jan. 16 .
Frederick Cole wants the Democratic Party to take back the White House in 2008 .
“ Look what a mess we ’re in , ” said Cole , a nurse in Louisville , Ky .
“ It ’s time for some fresh , new - thinker ideas . ”
Yet if his party nominates Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York for president , the 52 - year - old Democrat plans to vote for her Republican opponent .
“ It ’s a personal thing , ” Cole said .
“ I do n’t like her .
I think she ’s condescending and arrogant , even worse than Al Gore , who has no personality . ”
It is a paradox of the 2008 presidential race .
By a wide margin , several polls show , voters want a Democrat to win -- yet when offered head - to - head contests of leading announced candidates , many switch allegiance to the Republican .

In a Los Angeles Times / Bloomberg poll conducted this month , this dynamic was most clearly evident with Clinton .
When registered voters were asked which party they would like to win the White House , they preferred a Democrat over a Republican by 8 percentage points .
But in a race pitting Clinton against former New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani , the Republican was favored by 10 percentage points .
Clinton ’s showing against Giuliani was the starkest example of how the general Democratic edge sometimes narrows or vanishes when voters are given specific candidates to choose between .
The poll also showed Clinton trailing when matched against two other Republicans , Sen. John McCain of Arizona and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney .
The deficits , however , were within the survey ’s margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .

These results , as well as follow - up interviews of poll respondents , reflect the array of difficulties that Clinton could face as the Democratic nominee .
Plenty of time remains for Clinton to temper resistance to her candidacy .
But for now , her failure to match her party ’s generic advantage underscores the primacy of personal appeal in a presidential race , regardless of political context .
“ You give someone a name , and they automatically associate it with a specific set of pros and cons , ” said Dean Spiliotes , a political science professor at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire .
“ With a candidate as well - known as Hillary Clinton , that ’s going to cause some problems . ”
Conversations with a dozen Times / Bloomberg poll respondents , including Cole , exposed a number of those problems , above all a sour aftertaste from controversies of her White House years with President Clinton .

“ I just do n’t feel like she has the integrity to do the right thing , ” said retired service - station owner Richard James , 62 , a Democrat who lives in Herriman , Utah .
James wants a Democrat to win in 2008 ; he sees President Bush ’s tenure as a “ shipwreck ” marked by cronyism and a botched war .
Yet he would vote for Giuliani over Clinton .
“ He ’s got some honesty to him , ” James said .
To Carol Bendick , 63 , a Democrat who lives in Danville , Ill. , Bush is too cozy with the oil industry , and she , too , wants a Democrat to succeed him .
But she would support Giuliani over Clinton .

“ Who wants four or eight more years of the Clintons ’ marital disputes , paid for by the United States , we the people ?
I certainly do n’t , ” said Bendick , a teacher on disability .
Several men who prefer a Democrat for president , but not Clinton , said they were simply unwilling to support a woman .
Kevin Kidd , 45 , a Democrat who owns a bar in Farwell , Mich. , said a female president would make the United States “ look a little wimpier . ”
“ Some countries have woman presidents , and I just think it makes them look weak , ” he added .

Mark Penn , Clinton ’s chief campaign strategist , said his reading of the electorate is that few voters hold such views .
A more important aspect of the race , he said , is Clinton ’s strong support from women inspired by the hope of electing the nation ’s first female president .
Penn also noted the wide fluctuation of early surveys on general - election matchups , with some , such as a Wall Street Journal / NBC poll last week , showing Clinton ahead of Giuliani .
“ It ’s all extremely competitive , ” he said .
Still , the Gallup Poll has found Giuliani leading Clinton by an average of 5 percentage points in three surveys this year .
Women favored Clinton over Giuliani by 6 points , but that was offset by her lackluster support among men .
Advertisement
Part of Clinton ’s challenge is that most voters have long held firm opinions about her , negative or positive , which could be tough to change .
Republican strategists think her detractors ’ entrenched views will be a major problem for her if she wins the nomination .
“ It ’s almost like Hillary Clinton ’s image has gotten burned into your screen , ” said Whit Ayres , a Republican pollster .
Some polls also have found that in matchups with Giuliani and McCain , Clinton ’s top Democratic rivals -- Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois and former Sen. John Edwards of North Carolina -- would fall short of the general backing for their party .
Retired Pennsylvania truck inspector Earl Geer , 55 , an independent , is disgusted with the Bush administration and hopes a Democrat will capture the White House .
But he would pick a Republican over Edwards .

“ I just think he ’s a slick character , ” Geer said .
Tom Devlin , 70 , a retired steel - mill worker in Wellsville , Ohio , faults Bush for factory shutdowns and job losses in the Rust Belt , and he would rather have a Democrat as president .
But he would choose McCain over Obama .
“ McCain has a lot more experience , and I just think he would do a better job , ” Devlin said .
In the Times / Bloomberg poll , Edwards trailed McCain by 5 percentage points , but was ahead of Giuliani by 3 and Romney by 14 .
Obama was ahead in all the matchups : by 5 percentage points over Giuliani , 12 over McCain and 16 over Romney .
Advertisement
Republican Fred Thompson was not included in the matchups , because he has not declared his candidacy .
( He is expected to do so soon . )
Some political veterans argue that polling on general - election matchups can be highly misleading when so much of the campaign lies ahead .
“ It says nothing about an election 17 months from now , ” said Mark Mellman , a Democratic pollster .
“ But it does say something about now . ”

An image of the moon taken by Buzz Aldrin and Neil Armstrong in July of 1969 .
This weekend 's full moon hangs lower in the sky than any other full moon of 2007 , according to NASA , and it 's a good time to be fooled .
When low on the horizon , the Moon can appear to be larger than when it 's higher in the sky .
It 's all an illusion , scientists say , and it does not involve any enlarging effects of the atmosphere .
Rather , it 's all in your mind .
Here 's how it works :
Our brains think things on the horizon are farther away than stuff overhead , because we 're used to seeing overhead clouds that are close compared to those on the horizon .
In the mind 's eye , the sky is a flattened dome .
With this dome as a reference , we expect something on the horizon ( such as the moon ) to be farther , and because it is actually no farther than when overhead , our brains goof and imagine that it is larger .
Skeptical ?
You can test this from home .
When the moon first rises , hold something small like the eraser of a pencil at arms length and compare its size to the moon on the horizon .
Do the same a couple hours later when the moon is higher .
Or try this :
Take a picture of the moon in both positions , then cut , paste and compare .
Another trick :
Make a tube from rolled - up paper so the opening is just slightly larger than the moon when it rises .
Tape the tube so the size stays fixed , then check later to see if the moon has changed sizes .
Officially , the moon will be full Saturday June 30 at 9:49 a.m. ET .
Of course , you 'll want to do your looking in the evening .
Local moonrise times are available from the U.S. Naval Observatory .
Keep in mind that mountains and buildings can dramatically alter your actual local moonrise time .
The big - moon - rising effect will be evident Friday , Saturday and Sunday .
On each evening , the moon will appear nearly full .
Interestingly , the moon is never fully full from our point of view , but that 's another story .
While you 're out , check out Venus and Saturn , which are snuggling close together in the western sky as darkness falls .
So why is one full moon lower in the sky than another ?
The moon 's orbit around Earth is tilted 5 degrees compared to the plane of Earth 's travels around the Sun , and Earth itself is tilted on its rotational axis .
All this accounts for the lunar phases , and it also means the moon 's path through our sky can be higher or lower depending on the angles on any given night .
The complex orbit of the Earth - moon system is constantly evolving , too .
Right now , the moon is moving away from us by more than 1.5 inches every year .
If you accept the premise that software development is a cooperative game , then you might wonder : what kind of game is it ?
Alistair Cockburn believes the closest analog to a software project is the cooperative game of rock climbing :
Technical .
The novice can only approach simple climbs .
With practice , the climber can attack more and more difficult climbs .
The more technically proficient rock climber can do things that the others cannot .
Similarly , software development is technical and requires technical proficiency , and there is a frank difference in what a more skilled person can do compared with a less skilled person .

Similarly , software development is technical and requires technical proficiency , and there is a frank difference in what a more skilled person can do compared with a less skilled person .
Individual and Team .
Some people naturally climb better than others .
Some people will never handle certain climbs .
At each moment of the climb , each person is drawing on their own capabilities .
They have to hold their own weight .
And yet climbing is usually done in teams .
There are solo climbers , but they are in the minority .
Under normal circumstances , climbers form a team and the team has to work together to complete the climb .
Similarly , software developers , while working on their individual assignments , must function as a team to get the software out .

Tools .
Tools are a requirement for serious rock - climbing : chalk , chucks , harness , rope , carabiner , and so on .
It is important to be able to reach for the right tool for the right moment .
It is possible to climb very small distances with no tools .
The longer the climb , the more critical the tool selection is .
Software developers will recognize this .
When you need a performance profiler , you really need it .
You can't function without the compiler .
The team gets stuck without the version control system .
And so on .

Planning and Improvising .
Whether bouldering , doing a single - rope climb , or a multi-day climb , the climbers always make a plan .
The longer the climb , the more extensive the plan must be , even though the team knows that the plan will be insufficient , and wrong in places .
Unforeseen , unforeseeable and purely chance obstacles are certain to show up on even the most meticulously planned climbing expeditions , unless the climb is short and the climbers have completed it several times before .
Therefore , the climbers must be prepared to change their plans , to improvise , at a moment 's notice .
This dichotomy is part of what makes software development manages gnash their teeth .
They want a plan , but have to deal with unforeseen difficulties .
It is one of the reasons why incremental development is so critical to project success .
It is why climbers climb in stages , and set various base camps .

Fun .
Climbers climb because it is fun .
Climbers experience a sense of flow while climbing , and this total occupation is part of what makes it fun .
Similarly , programmers typically enjoy their work , and part of that enjoyment is getting into the flow of designing or programming .

Challenging .
Climbers climb because there is a challenge .
Can they really make it to the top ?
Most programmers crave this challenge , too .
If programmers do not find their assignment challenging , they may quit , or start embellishing the system with design elements they find challenging .

Resource - limited .
Rock climbing works against a time and energy budget .
The climb needs to be completed before the team is too tired , before the food runs out , by nightfall or before the snows come .

The climb needs to be completed before the team is too tired , before the food runs out , by nightfall or before the snows come .
Dangerous .
If you fall wrong on a rock climb , you can be killed or maimed .
This is probably the one aspect of rock climbing that does not transfer to software development .
Rock climbers are fond of saying that climbing , done properly , is less dangerous than driving a car .
However , I have never heard programmers compare the danger of programming with the danger of driving a car or even crossing the street .
I 'll admit I had never quite thought of software development in this way , but Alistair 's rock climbing metaphor holds .
It 's certainly a far better metaphor than the tired old bridge building chestnut .
I see further analogs in the way the natural environment itself -- and the difficult to predict , uncontrollable weather conditions -- can make or break a project .
The one unsatisfying aspect of the rock climbing metaphor is that software tends to build upon itself in a way that rock climbing does n't .
Each subsequent version of the software expands on the capabilities and the platform established in the previous version .
So there are really two goals :
to reach the summit .
to make it easier for subsequent teams to reach the summit .
But these goals can be mutually exclusive .
In a followup article , Alistair illustrates with an example he calls " The Swamp Game " .
Consider a race across an uncharted swampland in which some particular ( unknown ) artifact must be produced at some particular ( unknown ) place in the swamp .
A team in this race would employ scouts and specialists of various sorts , and would create maps , route markings , bridges and so on .
The racers would not , however , construct commercial quality maps , roads or bridges , since doing so would waste precious resources .
Instead , they would estimate how much or little of a path must be cleared for themselves , how strong to build the bridge , how fancy of markings to make , how simple a map , in order to reach their goal in the shortest time .
If the race is run as part of a series , there will be new teammates coming after them to pick up the artifact and move it to a new place .
The first team will therefore be well served to make slightly better paths , maps and bridges , always keeping in mind that doing this work competes with completing the current stage of the race .
They also will be well served if they leave some people who understand the territory to be part of the next team .
Thus , the optimal strategies for a series of races are different than for a single race .
There is no closed - form formula for winning the game .
There are only strategies that are more useful in particular situations .
That realization alone may be the strongest return for using the economic - cooperative game language : people on live projects see that they must constantly observe the characteristics of the changing situation , to collect known strategies , to invent new strategies on the fly ; and that since a perfect outcome is not possible in an overconstrained situation , they much choose which outcome to prioritize at the expense of which others .
I find Alistair 's game theories fascinating and illuminating .
Based on the strength of these two essays , I just picked up a copy of Alistair 's book , Crystal Clear : A Human - Powered Methodology for Small Teams .
It 's based on the same cooperative game manifesto I 've covered in my last two entries .
I 've already run into one team using the Crystal method ( no , not that crystal method ) at a customer site .
I 'll have to check in with them next week and see how close they are to the summit .
And the next time someone asks you why software projects are so challenging , invite them to go rock climbing with you .
This is so unbelievably offensive , I got to wonder what it will take to get the FCC to come down on this radio station :
Colorado Media Matters :
Discussing the breakup of an alleged terrorist plot to attack U.S. soldiers at New Jersey 's Fort Dix , Newsradio 850 KOA host " Gunny " Bob Newman said on his May 8 show that " every Muslim immigrant to America who holds a green card , a visa , or who is a naturalized citizen [ should ] be required by law to wear a GPS tracking bracelet at all times , " and that the government should " bug their places of work and their residences " and monitor " [ a ] ll mosques and community centers . "
Newman added , " If they do n't like the idea , or if they refuse , throw their asses out of this country . "
Audio and contact names and links available on the CMM site .
Considering that Eric Rudolph *, Timothy McVeigh and Chad Castagana are all right wing Christian white men , would n't you think Newman would advocate ankle bracelets on all wingnuts males ?

You think your HDTV is impressive ?
Your HDTV sucks .
Sorry , I do n't mean to be a jerk , but it 's no longer cutting edge .
1920x1080 ?
Please .
Japanese broadcaster NHK has come up with what they call Super Hi-Vision , and it puts HD to shame with an insane resolution of 7680x4320 .
Yeah , that 's the equivalent of 16 HDTVs crammed into one .
Like I said , your HDTV sucks .
Advertisement
That 's not all :
The viewing distance can be four times as close as HDTV ( .75 times the screen height versus 3 times the screen height for HDTV ) .
Fortunately ( or unfortunately , depending ) , you wo n't need to toss your HDTV for a SHV set anytime soon .
That humungous resolution requires an insane 24 Gbps stream for broadcast , which is nowhere near what we 're currently capable of .
Furthermore , they just developed the first sensor for cameras so they can actually , you know , shoot video at that resolution , but there 's still a lot of work to be done .
Seeing that NHK are the dudes who developed HDTV in 1969 , it might be a while before these things start ending up in living rooms .

FreeBSD Linux Windows 2000
Reliability FreeBSD is extremely robust .
There are numerous testimonials of active servers with uptimes measured in years .
The new Soft Updates 1 file system optimizes disk I/O for high performance , yet still ensures reliability for transaction based applications , such as databases .
Linux is well known for its reliability .
Servers often stay up for years .
However , disk I/ O is non-synchronous by default , which is less reliable for transaction based operations , and can produce a corrupted filesystem after a system crash or power failure .
But for the average user , Linux is a very dependable OS .
All Windows users are familiar with the " Blue Screen of Death " .
Poor reliability is one of the major drawbacks of Windows .
Some of the major issues have been fixed in Windows 2000 , but " code bloat " has introduced many more reliability problems .
Windows 2000 uses a lot of system resources and it is very difficult to keep the system up for more than a couple of months without it reverting to a crawl as memory gets corrupted and filesystems fragmented .
Performance FreeBSD is the system of choice for high performance network applications .
FreeBSD will outperform other systems when running on equivalent hardware .
The largest and busiest public server on the Internet , at ftp.freesoftware.com , uses FreeBSD to serve more than 1.2TB / day of downloads .
FreeBSD is used by Yahoo ! , Qwest and many others as their main server OS because of its ability to handle heavy network traffic with high performance and rock solid reliability .
Linux performs well for most applications , however the performance is not optimal under heavy network load .
The network performance of Linux is 20 - 30 % below the capacity of FreeBSD running on the same hardware 2 .
The situation has improved somewhat recently and the 2.4 release of the Linux kernel will introduce a new virutual memory system based on the same concepts as the FreeBSD VM system .
Since both operating systems are open source , beneficial technologies are shared and for this reason the performance of Linux and FreeBSD is rapidly converging .
Windows is adequate for routine desktop apps , but it is unable to handle heavy network loads .
A few organizations try to make it work as an Internet server .
For instance , barnesandnoble.com uses Windows - NT , as can be verifyed by the error messages that their webserver produces , such as this recent example : Error Message : [ Microsoft ] [ ODBC SQL Server Driver ] [ SQL Server ]
Can't allocate space for object ' queryHistory ' in database ' web ' because the ' default ' segment is full .
For their own " Hotmail " Internet servers , Microsoft used FreeBSD for many years .
Security FreeBSD has been the subject of a massive auditing project for several years .
All of the critical system components have been checked and rechecked for security - related errors .
The entire system is open source so the security of the system can and has been verified by third parties .
A default FreeBSD installation has yet to be affected by a single CERT security advisory in 2000 .
3 FreeBSD also has the notion of kernel security levels .
These are much more powerful than simple run-levels since they allow the administrator to completely deny access to certain operating system functions such as reading / dev/mem , changing file system flags , or writing to disks without mounting a filesystem .
FreeBSD includes a very robust packet filtering firewall system and many intrusion detection tools .
The open source nature of Linux allows anyone to inspect the security of the code and make changes , but in reality the Linux codebase is modified too rapidly by inexperienced programmers .
There is no formal code review policy and for this reason Linux has been suceptible to nearly every Unix - based CERT advisory of the year .
This problem is compounded by the fact that distributions like Red Hat tend to turn on notoriously insecure services by default .
However , Linux does include a very robust packet filtering firewall system and many intrusion detection tools .
Microsoft claims that their products are secure .
But they offer no guarantee , and their software is not available for inspection or peer review .
Since Windows is closed source there is no way for users to fix or diagnose any of the security compromises that are regularly published about Microsoft systems .
Filesystem FreeBSD uses the UFS ( Unix File System ) , which is a little more complex than Linux 's ext2 .
It offers a better way to insure filesystem data integrity , mainly with the " sofupdates " option .
This option decreases synchronous I/O and increases asynchronous I/ O because writes to a UFS filesystem are n't synced on a sector basis but according to the filesystem structure .
This ensures that the filesystem is always coherent between two updates .
The FreeBSD filesystem also supports file flags , which can stop a would - be intruder dead in his or her tracks .
There are several flags that you can add to a file such as the immutable flag .
The immutable ( schg ) flag wo n't allow any alteration to the file or directory unless you remove it .
Other very handy flags are append only ( sappnd ) , cannot delete ( sunlnk ) , and archive ( arch ) .
When you combine these with the kernel security level option , you have a very impenetrable system .
The Linux ext2 filesystem gets its performance from having an asynchronous mount .
You can mount FreeBSD UFS filesystems as asynchronous but this is very dangerous and no seasoned Unix admin would do this .
It 's amazing that Linux is designed this way by default .
Often a hard carsh permanently damages a mount .
FreeBSD or Solaris can sustain a very hard crash with only minor data loss , and the filesystem will be remountable with few problems .
There are several new journaling filesystems in development for Linux that will fix some of these issues , but these will not be ready for the 2.4 release of Linux .
The Microsoft FAT filesystem and the newer NTFS are both plagued by over 15 years of backwards compatability with the earliest of PC - based filesystems .
These filesystems were not designed for today 's demanding server applications , they were n't even designed with a multi-user OS or networking in mind !
Device Drivers
The FreeBSD bootloader can load binary drivers at boot - time .
This allows third - party driver manufacturers to distribute binary - only driver modules that can be loaded into any FreeBSD system .
Due to the open - source nature of FreeBSD , it is very easy to develop device drivers for new hardware .
Unfortunately , most device - manufacturers will only release binaries for Microsoft operating systems .
This means that it can take several months after a hardware device has hit the market until a device driver is available .
The Linux community intentionally makes it difficult for hardware manufacturers to release binary - only drivers .
This is meant to encourage hardware manufactureres to develop open - source device drivers .
Unfortunately most vendors have been unwilling to release the source for their drivers so it is very difficult for Linux users to use vendor supplied drivers at all .
Microsoft has excellent relationships with hardware vendors .
There are often conflicts when using a device driver on different versions of Microsoft Windows , but overall Windows users have excellent access to third party device drivers .
Commercial Applications
The number of commercial applications for FreeBSD is growing rapidly , but is still below what is available for Windows .
In addition to native applications , FreeBSD can also run programs compiled for Linux , SCO Unix , and BSD / OS .
Many new commercial applications are available for Linux , and more are being developed .
Unfortunately , Linux can only run binaries that are specifically compiled for Linux .
It is unable to run programs compiled for FreeBSD , SCO Unix , or other popular operating systems .
There are thousands of applications available for Windows , far more than for any other OS .
Nearly all commercial desktop applications run on Windows , and many of them are only available on Windows .
If you have an important application that only runs on Windows , then you may have no choice but to run Microsoft Windows .
Free Applications
There are many , many gigabytes of FREE software available for FreeBSD .
FreeBSD includes thousands of software packages and an extensive ports collection , all with complete source code .
Many people consider the FreeBSD Ports collection to be the most accessible and easiest to use library of free software packages available anywhere .
There are huge numbers of free programs available for Linux .
All GNU software runs on both Linux and FreeBSD without modification .
Some of the free programs for Linux differ between distributions , because Linux does not have a central ports collection .
The amount of free Windows software is much less than what is available for Unix .
Many Windows applications are provided as " shareware " , without source code , so the programs cannot be customized , debugged , improved , or extended by the user .
Development environment FreeBSD includes an extensive collection of development tools .
You get a complete C/C++ development system ( editor , compiler , debugger , profiler , etc. ) and powerful Unix development tools for Java , HTTP , Perl , Python , Tcl / Tk , Awk , Sed , etc .
All of these are free , and are included in the basic FreeBSD installation .
All come with full source code .
Linux includes all the same development tools as FreeBSD , with compilers and interpreters for every common programming language , all the GNU programs , including the powerful GNU C/C++
Compiler , Emacs editor , and GDB debugger .
Unfortunately due to the very splintered nature of Linux , applications that you compile on one system ( Red Hat 7 ) may not work on another Linux system ( Slackware ) .
Very few development tools are included with Windows 2000 .
Most need to be purchased separately , and are rarely compatible with each other .
Development infrastructure FreeBSD is an advanced BSD Unix operating system .
The source code for the entire system is available in a centralized source code repository running under CVS .
A large team ( 200 + ) of senior developers has write access to this repository and they coordinate development by reviewing and commiting the best changes of the development community at large .
FreeBSD is engineered to find elegant solutions for overall goals , rather than quick hacks to add new functionality .
Linux is a Unix - like kernel that must be combined with the GNU system to make a complete operating system .
Linux does not use any version control system so all bug - fixes and enhancements must be emailed back and forth on mailing lists and ultimately submitted to the one person ( Linus ) who has authority to commit the code to the tree .
Due to the overwhelming amount of code that gets written , it is impossible for one person to adequately quality control all of the pending changes .
For this reason there is a lot of code in Linux that was hastily written and would never have been accepted into a more conservative operating system .
Microsoft Windows is a closed - source operating system driven by market demand rather than technical merit .
New technologies are rushed into the product before they have been properly designed or fully implemented .
Very little is known about the internal development infrastructure of Microsoft but the " blue - screen of death " speaks for itself .
Support Several organizations , including BSDi , offer a wide range of support options for FreeBSD .
In addition to 24x7 professional support , there is a large amount of free , informal support available through Usenet newsgroups and mailing lists , such as questions@freebsd.org .
Once a problem is found , source code patches are often available within a few hours .
Many organizations provide professional support for Linux .
All the major Linux vendors offer some level of support , and several offer full 24/7 service .
There are many forums where Linux questions are answered for free , such as newsgroups and mailing lists .
As a last resort , you can always use the source to track down and fix a problem yourself .
Although support is available for Windows 2000 , you should be prepared to spend as long as an hour on hold , with no guarantee that your problem will be resolved .
Because of the closed source nature of Windows , there is no informal , free support available , and bugs are fixed on Microsoft 's schedule , not your's .
Since Windows 2000 is not updated frequently , you may wait years for bugs to be fixed .
Price , and Total Cost of Ownership FreeBSD can be downloaded from the Internet for FREE .
Or it can be purchased on a four CDROM set , along with several gigabytes of applications , for $ 40 .
All necessary documentation is included .
Support is available for free or for very low cost .
There is no user licensing , so you can quickly bring additional computers online .
This all adds up to a very low total cost of Ownership .
Linux is FREE .
Several companies offer commercial aggregations at a very low cost .
Applications and Documentation is available for little or no cost .
There are no licensing restrictions , so Linux can be installed on as many systems as you like for no additional cost .
Linux 's total cost of ownership is very low .
The server edition of Windows 2000 costs nearly $ 700 .
Even basic applications cost extra .
Users often spend many thousands of dollars for programs that are included for free with Linux or FreeBSD .
Documentation is expensive , and very little on - line documentation is provided .
A license is required for every computer , which means delays and administrative overhead .
The initial learning curve for simple administration tasks is smaller than with Unix , but it also requires a lot more work to keep the system running with any significant work load .
As some of you saw last week at WWDC , we have a brand new version of the Web Inspector .
We know that a lot people have found the current Web Inspector useful , and we have gotten a lot of feedback and suggestions about how to make it even better .
And boy have we been listening !
We have taken the current Web Inspector and have added a bunch of new features that you will find invaluable for web development :
Completely redesigned interface , no longer a transparent panel
Works with any WebView inside third - party applications , not just Safari
Supports docking to the inspected page
Shows all resources included by the page , sorted into categories
Global search through all text - based resources
Console to show errors and warnings with live JavaScript evaluation
Network panel showing resource load timeline along with HTTP request and response headers
Resource size and load time summary graph in the Network panel
Syntax highlighted HTML source
Inline JavaScript and HTML error reporting
We will be telling you in more detail about all of the great new features in future blog posts .
We have been working on this for a long time , but now we want to get the whole WebKit community involved with making this the best web development tool available .
So show up in # webkit or on the mailing list and suggest new ideas or implement them yourself ( remember everything is HTML , JavaScript and CSS ) !
And there is one more thing … all of this new inspector goodness also works on Windows .
The new inspector is available in the Mac and Windows nightly builds .
First a little background .
Planned Parenthood ’s mission is not solely to provide abortions .
Fully 95 % of their practice involves healthcare , family planning advice , dispensing birth control , screening for STD ’s , etc .
That ’s right , only 5 % of patients are seeking an abortion .
At my clinic , around 30 % of women choose a medical abortion ( RU - 486 ) .
The women I see span every age range , income level and social class .
Approximately 50 % of these women find themselves at the clinic because of birth control failures .
About half are married and have children at home .
Getting an abortion is an all - day experience .
The woman has to take a day ( or two ) off from work or school , find childcare and a friend to drive them home .
I live in a state where getting an abortion is not difficult but the time factor in prepping a woman for the procedure is onerous no matter what .
Before this day , she will have had extensive counseling about her options .
If she chooses abortion , she is informed in detail what to expect .
No one enters the procedure room uninformed .
Once her choice has been made and she arrives at the clinic , she is taken for an ultrasound to determine the size of her uterus and how far the pregnancy has advanced .
Abortion can be done in a Planned Parenthood clinic up to 14 weeks .
At this point , she is pre-medicated .
Medication ranges from a couple of ibuprofen to Ativan and Vicoden .
If the pregnancy is quite advanced a drug is given to soften the cervix .
At this point , she waits .
Most days the lag time between coming to the clinic and entering the procedure room is 4 or 5 hours .
Once I have called her back , I check her ID bracelet and ask her if she needs to use the bathroom .
Many times the woman is quite loopy from the medication .
More often than not , she is nauseous .
Think about it , she ’s pregnant , she has n’t eaten since the previous day , she ’s been sitting down for hours and she ’s been given the codeine - based drug , Vicoden on an empty stomach .
Codeine makes people hurl even under the best of circumstances .
I ’ve had days where the bulk of my job is rubbing backs and holding back hair as a miserable woman tries to get some relief .
Once the woman has disrobed and covered herself with a drape , the procedure goes fairly quickly .
Some women choose IV medication to further dull pain , but most opt not to do this .
The doctor or nurse practitioner comes in and introductions are made .
He / she is often accompanied by a medical resident who will actually do the surgery under observation .
Most days , the patient is also asked if a medical student might be allowed to observe .
If the patient has a companion with her , there are times when 6 or 7 people are packed into one tiny room .
Despite the fact that only 15 % of medical schools offer abortion training as an elective , our local med school does offer it and uses it well .
I ’m always glad to see new people interested in learning to do this procedure quickly and safely .
The resident will tell the patient everything that she is doing during the procedure .
First , there is a manual exam to determine the size of the uterus .
Despite the ultrasound , this is done to train the doctor to use her own senses in case she is working someplace where ultrasound is not available .
It ’s kind of like being able to do math without a calculator .
She then inserts a speculum , takes a swab to test for Chlamydia ( this is done on all patients ) and swabs the cervix with soap .
At this point , the cervix is numbed with Lidocaine .
This is several injections and can sometimes be uncomfortable .
At this point , dilation begins .
The dilators are a series of graduated rods that gently open the cervix .
This part will produce the beginning of sometimes severe cramping .
The ultimate size of the opening is determined by how far the pregnancy has advanced .
The last step is scraping the uterus and suctioning out the contents .
The suction can be done by machine ( I think the sound of the machine can be somewhat disconcerting ) or can be done manually , a quieter method .
After the contents have been removed , the speculum is removed and the doctor will take the contents to the lab and check to make sure the procedure is complete .
If the gestational sac is observed as intact the procedure is over .
In extremely rare circumstances , the procedure must be repeated if the sac ca n’t be found .
If the woman is early in her pregnancy , the sac is too small to see with the naked eye and she will have to return in 3 days to have her blood tested for beta -HCG .
A drop in this hormone level will determine the success of the procedure .
Occasionally , a woman will ask to see the products of conception .
The vast majority of what she will see once the blood is rinsed away is endometrial tissue .
If the resident can see the sac , she will separate it away .
What there is to see is not much .
The sac is a yellowish glob of mucous - like material .
There is no fully formed infant looking back at us .
From start to finish , the entire procedure outside recovery takes less than 10 minutes .
Finally , I lead the woman back to recovery , settle her into an easy chair , place a heating pad on her lap to ease the cramping ( which starts to subside 5 to 10 minutes after the procedure is done ) and feed her juice and cookies if she ’s feeling up to it .
Half an hour later , she checks for excessive bleeding , confers with the recovery nurse and goes home …. hopefully to a good dinner and a night of watching videos on the sofa .
I know there ’s a lot speculation here about the woman ’s mental or emotional state .
I think a lot people imagine a lot of sobbing and remorse and rending of garments .
I ’m sorry to inform you , this is just not the case .
Most women are nervous about the unknowns of the procedure itself .
None have actually changed their mind once they are in the room .
Some women walk in and out as fresh as though they ’ve had a day at the spa with little pain or nausea .
Some women look like they ’ve been dragged through a shrub backwards by the time they go .
In all my conversations with these women , we have never discussed the moral ramifications of their decision and believe me , these women talk about why they are there .
Women are very rational beings .
For a lot of reasons , we have been aborting our babies for thousands of years .
Although we never consider it , could it be in our DNA ?
In the animal kingdom , the female wo n’t even go into estrous if environmental conditions are not right .
Infanticide ( a mother eating her young ) is commonplace .
I have witnessed the matter - of - fact determination of literally hundreds of women to NOT bring a child into a world where it is not wanted or could n’t be adequately cared for .
I realize that unlike animals we as humans are capable of making “ moral ” choices .
I think that as a society , we are not judging morality by the same metrics .
Is it immoral to “ destroy life ” or is it immoral to preserve life then neglect it ?
I ’m devolving off into the usual DailyKos obsession with morality here but I think if people actually knew what happened in an abortion clinic and could witness for themselves how women handled it they would question some of their preconceived notions .
There is little connection between reality and propaganda in this case .
Aides helping Rep. Ron Paul of Texas with his long - shot run for the Republican presidential nomination never thought they would need more than the corner of a one - bedroom apartment .
They were wrong .
The campaign has outgrown its second headquarters , a 348 - square - foot office .
Mr. Paul has more campaign cash available than former Republican front - runner Sen. John McCain of Arizona , Federal Election Commission records show , and the antiwar conservative has become an Internet sensation .
Though political pros say Mr. Paul ’s chances of moving into the White House are between slim and none , some expect him to have an effect on the Republican race .
“ I watched the Republican presidential debates with neighbors , and two of the five people in the room said , ‘ Who is that guy ?
I really like him , ’ ” said Republican media consultant Tom Edmonds .
“ My gut tells me he ’s a sleeper and will indeed have an impact on the Republican race . ”
The Texas obstetrician — whose habit of opposing measures he deems unconstitutional won him the sobriquet “ Dr. No ” — is admired as a man of principle by many conservative leaders and has won attention from voters across the land , including Democrats .
Iowan Alex Gabis attended an event for Sen. Barack Obama , Illinois Democrat , in the Fairfield town square last week , but another presidential candidate was on his mind .
“ There is a Republican I like — he ’s from Texas , ” Mr. Gabis volunteered .
“ I do n’t look at the label .
I listen to what he says .
I think his name is Ron Paul .
I like him .
I ’d vote for him . ”
Mr. Paul , who raised most of his campaign dollars in the past quarter on the Internet and has $ 2.4 million cash on hand , wowed young voters across the country last month when he appeared on Comedy Central ’s “ Colbert Report . ”
When host Stephen Colbert introduced Mr. Paul as having voted against the USA Patriot Act and the Iraq war , the liberal audience went wild with cheers .
Mr. Colbert asked , “ Are you a Republican or are you not a Republican ? ” Mr. Paul responded : “ You ’re confused because I ’m a constitutionalist . …
It ’s not that unusual to put those together if you believe in the rule of law , and you believe in the American tradition , and believe in limited government and you believe in liberty . ”
Mr. Paul was one of six House Republicans to vote against the Iraq war in 2002 .
Commentator Pat Buchanan says Mr. Paul ’s effect on the race will depend on the size of the vote he attracts .
“ If he starts running up 15 percent or 20 percent of the vote in Republican primaries , it says :
The GOP is headed in the wrong direction , secure the border , get out of Iraq , come home , America , ” Mr. Buchanan told The Washington Times .
Influencing the Republican stance on major issues is the most likely outcome of the Paul candidacy .
“ While I am very skeptical that he will win the nomination , historically challengers ’ biggest impact has been in shaping the debate — forcing the more popular candidates to address issues they might like to gloss over , ” said Merrill Matthews , resident scholar at the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas .
“ I suspect Paul ’s principled opposition to massive government spending and the war could reach out to two different GOP groups — one large , one not so large — with the message : ‘ You are not alone . ’ ”
Mr. Matthews sees a twofold effect for Mr. Paul : “ His libertarian bent makes him the most principled of the Republican candidates .
The large segment of the conservative base shares his rebellion against the GOP ’s willingness to become part of Washington ’s big-spending establishment .
And as the only antiwar Republican candidate , he may provide a safe harbor to conservatives who are increasingly growing dissatisfied with the war . ”
Still , even some admirers are skeptics .
“ Certainly there is a case to be made for a GOP protest vote in favor of Ron Paul , ” said Jameson Campaigne Jr. , an Illinois - based director of the American Conservative Union .
“ But I do n’t think small - ‘ c ’ conservative voters dare waste a vote on such a thing — unless the three front - runners in January are all discredited — Mitt Romney , Rudy Giuliani and Fred Thompson . ”
Mr. Buchanan thinks the Texan is in it for the duration .
“ If he stays in the race , he will have a solid , hard - core but small following the whole way through the nomination contest , ” the former Nixon and Reagan White House aide said .
“ He has the money to go the distance because he harbors his resources . ”

Congress , looking for sources of revenue , happened upon an extraordinary loophole enjoyed by the extraordinarily rich private equity and hedge fund managers , effectively allowing these managers to pay taxes on their earnings at a 15 % rate .
Pretty nice for people making hundreds of millions a year .
While this looks like a simple fix , long overdue , there is nÃ¢â¬â¢t much support for it in Congress Ã¢â¬â on either side of the aisle !
In the wake of more attention being drawn to the general ineffectiveness of ingested antioxidants as even a marginal tool for health and longevity , Randall Parker remarks in passing :
Biogerontologist Aubrey de Grey makes what to to my mind is a persuasive argument against the expectation that antioxidants will deliver large health benefits :
The metabolic cost of making and retaining antioxidants in the body is pretty low .
If antioxidants could deliver benefits as large as some of their advocates claim then natural selection would long ago have selected for mutations that boost body antioxidant levels .
So why expect consumed antioxidants to deliver a big benefit ?
So ( I hear you asking ) why would n't the body make more detoxifying enzymes even in the absence of foods consumed that up - regulate detoxifying enzymes ?
My guess is that those enzymes are more metabolically expensive to keep around .
Human metabolism certainly is n't the most effective possible from a perspective of longevity , but one would expect that any easily attainable and practical change that benefits health in youth would already have been selected over the generations .
On the other side of the coin , simple changes that benefit health in old age and extend longevity do in fact exist , and have not been selected for - for example , mutations to boost the level of naturally occuring antioxidants in the mitochondria :
The catalase soaks up some portion of free radicals before they can attack your vulnerable mitochondrial DNA .
Damage to this [ DNA ] leads to an unfortunate chain of events that causes entire cells to rabidly produce damaging free radicals and export them throughout the body .
But stop a fraction of the original mitochondrial free radicals from attacking their birthplace , and you have slowed the rate at which one cause of aging happens - you have slowed down aging , and extended healthy life .
Evolution cares not for your old age - if you 're past the point of reproductive fitness , you 're on your own .
So mutations that might help your longevity , but have little benefit in youth , are unlikely to have prospered and spread in the dark days of cave living , disease , parasites and short , brutish lives .
It seems there is something to be done with antioxidants and advanced biotechnology in combination , given the evidence to date of the effectiveness of targeting to the mitochondria via gene therapy or other clever science .
But the salesmen of the " anti-aging " marketplace - those folk energetically waving pills and potions in your face today - are most likely sitting on a pile of junk and nonsense rather than any even marginally effective product .
Technorati tags : anti-aging , life extension
Patrons hold their Sony PlayStation 3 ( PS3 ) gaming consoles at a Best Buy store in Duluth , Georgia , November 17 , 2006 .
Sony Corp. is likely to cut its PlayStation 3 price again by year - end following this week 's $ 100 cut , a senior executive at Japanese game software maker Capcom Co. Ltd. said .
REUTERS / Tami Chappell
SANTA MONICA , California ( Reuters ) - Sony Corp. is likely to cut its PlayStation 3 price again by year - end following this week ’s $ 100 cut , a senior executive at Japanese game software maker Capcom Co. Ltd. said .
“ The number of PS2 users is still growing and a shift to the PS3 is on the back burner , ” Capcom Chief Financial Officer Kazuhiko Abe told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday .
“ But , the price has been cut once and it is likely to be cut again towards the end of the year .
I expect the ( PS3 ’s ) installed base to grow gradually . ”
Sony on Monday cut the price of the PS3 to $ 500 in the United States in a move to breathe life into sluggish demand .
Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox 360 and Nintendo Co. Ltd. ’s
Wii have outsold the PS3 by several times in the crucial U.S. market , leaving Sony , which has dominated the game industry over the past decade , in the unfamiliar position of playing catch up .
The new price , however , is still $ 20 more than the most expensive version of the Xbox 360 and twice as much as that of the Wii .
Abe , visiting Santa Monica for the E3 video game exposition , also said sales of its action horror title “ Resident Evil 4 ” for the Wii will likely exceed its target of 420,000 units for the current business year to March 2008 .
“ It is doing better than expected in Japan and the United States , and performing fairly well in Europe , ” Abe said .
“ Sales are bound to exceed 420,000 units . ”
Osaka - based Capcom is known for such major titles as “ Lost Planet ” shooting game and “ Devil May Cry ” action adventure .
Senator Patrick Leahy ( D - VT ) , weary of fighting to get honest answers out of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales in the political firings of eight federal prosecutors , took the unexpected step last week of sending Gonzales a list of the questions he should expect when he appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday .
Leahy , the committee 's Chairman , sent a letter to Gonzales on July 17 pointing out the number of times the embattled Attorney General said he could " not recall " in response to previous direct questioning on his department 's operations and saying that he " would like to avoid a repeat of that performance . "
" When you last testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 19 , 2007 , you often responded to questions from Senators on both sides of the aisle that you could ' not recall , ' " wrote Leahy in his letter to Gonzales .
" By some counts , you failed to answer more than 100 questions , by other counts more than 70 , and the most conservative count had you failing to provide answers well over 60 times .
As a result , the Committeeâ€™s efforts to conduct oversight were hampered . "
So Leahy sent questions in advance hoping to give Gonzales a week to think about some better responses to the questions surrounding the U.S. Attorney firings , National Security Letter abuses and the White House 's warrantless domestic spying program .
According to Leahy 's office , the Judiciary Chairman " put the Attorney General on notice that the Committee would expect answers on inconsistencies in the Attorney Generalâ€™s public statements and testimony involving the firing of several U.S. Attorneys as well as the Presidentâ€™s warrantless wiretapping program " including the following :
" On April 19 , you testified to the Senate Judiciary Committee that you had not spoken with anyone involved in the firings about that process because you did not want to interfere with the investigation .
Again , on May 10 , you testified to the House Judiciary Committee that you had not spoken with anyone involved in order to protect the integrity of the investigation .
Then on May 23 , Monica Goodling testified under oath before the House Judiciary Committee that she had an ' uncomfortable ' conversation with you during which you outlined your recollection of what happened and asked her for her reaction to your version .
Is Ms. Goodlingâ€™s testimony accurate , and if so , how do you account for your previous , uncorrected testimony to this Committee ? "
" On April 19 you testified before this Committee that your former Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson was responsible for putting together the list of U.S. Attorneys to be fired .
But on May 15 , the day after Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty announced his intention to resign , you said that the firings were largely Mr. McNultyâ€™s responsibility .
Mr. McNulty has said that he had very limited involvement in the decision of which U.S. Attorneys to fire .
Please describe all of your interactions with Mr. McNulty related to the replacement of the nine U.S. Attorneys and your understanding of his role in deciding which U.S. Attorneys would be fired .
Why has your description of who made the decisions , and who was most involved in the decision - making process , changed over time ? "
" When you were asked on February 6 , 2006 if any senior Justice Department officials , including your former deputy , James Comey , expressed concerns about the Bush Administrationâ€™s warrantless electronic surveillance program , you testified : ' I do not believe that these DOJ officials . . . had concerns about this program . '
Mr. Comey subsequently testified on May 15 , 2007 that on March 9 , 2004 , he informed you , as White House counsel , and others including the Vice President , that the Justice Department had concluded that the Administrationâ€™s warrantless electronic surveillance program did not have a legal basis .
He testified that you and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card tried to circumvent him , in his role as Acting Attorney General , by rushing to the hospital bedside of ailing former Attorney General John Ashcroft to try to persuade him to certify the program .
Please provide a full explanation for the legal authorization for the Presidentâ€™s warrantless electronic surveillance program in March and April 2004 . "
You can also expect some tough questioning from Russ Feingold ( D - WI ) who has long been in Gonzales 's face about the illegal domestic spying program and was a leader in trying to secure a no-confidence vote on the Attorney General last month .
" I voted against Alberto Gonzales to be the Attorney General because I was not convinced he would put the rule of law , and the interests of the country , above those of the President and the Administration , " said Feingold in June .
" Unfortunately , those concerns have been realized over and over .
He has failed in a very significant way .
He should resign . "
We 'll see if the hearings on Tuesday move us closer to that point .

{ ANAME ( ) }intro{ANAME}Introduction
This is the 16 September 1991 draft of the Lojban Mini-Lesson , an
introduction to the language that is intended to give readers a
basic idea as to how Lojban looks and sounds , and how it differs
from English and other languages .
For those familiar with it , this
corresponds to the first of the Esperanto Postal Course lessons ,
except that thus far , this is the only lesson , and it covers a bit
more of the language in one unit .
This mini-lesson is expected to
become a mainstay of our introductory package for Lojban .
At this
posting we already have people committed to translate this into
Esperanto and Swedish , and other language versions are expected to
follow .
We are interested in comments on the readability and
understandability of this material .
We especially want people to go
through it , and then to try the exercises at the end , so we can
determine whether the lesson teaches the material and whether the
exercises are appropriate and within the capability of the student .
We
want responses from both active Lojbanists and people who have not seen
any of our material before .
We are interested in more than just
corrections of typos — we want to know what you understood , and what
needs more explanation .
LLG will commit to providing individual
responses to all questions generated from this draft circulation , and
will provide an commented answer key to anyone who returns a completed
response ( please allow a little time for these responses — we have no
idea how much volume is to be generated ) .
For our benefit , if you do
the exercises .
please let us know whether you did them as you went
along , or after reading the entire lesson text , and also give us a rough
idea how much time the entire lesson took .
Of course this may cause
reviewers to become more interested in learning Lojban , and we certainly
would not object to that .
Contact LLG at the address above for more
information .
( Note :
There are exercises at the end of the lesson for each
section .
You may do these exercises as you go along , or wait until you
complete the entire lesson . )
{ ANAME ( ) }predicate {ANAME}1 .
The concept of the predicate
Let us consider John and Sam and three statements about them :
" John is the father of Sam " " John hugs Sam " and " John is taller than Sam "
These all describe relationships between John and Sam .
However , in
English , we
use a noun to describe a static relationship ( 1 ) , a verb to describe an
active relationship ( 2 ) and an adjective to describe an attributive
relationship ( 3 ) .
In Lojban we make no such grammatical distinctions ;
these three sentences , when expressed in Lojban , are grammatically
identical .
The same part of speech is used to represent the
relationship .
In formal logic this whole structure is called a
predicate ; in Lojban it is called a " bridi " , and
the central part of speech is the " selbri " .
Logicians refer to the things thus related as
arguments , while Lojbanists call them " sumti " .
These Lojban terms will be used for the rest of the lesson .

Place structures
In a relationship , there are a definite number of things being
related .
In English , for example , " give " has three places : the donor ,
the recipient and the gift .
For example :
-+ John gives Sam the book .+- and -+ Sam gives
John the book .+-
mean two different things because the relative positions of
" John " and " Sam " have been switched .
Further , -+ The book gives John Sam .+- seems
strange to us merely because the places are being filled by unorthodox
arguments .
The relationship expressed by " give " has not changed .
In Lojban , a given selbri has a specified
number of arguments .
The simplest selbri consists of a single root word , called a " gismu " , and
the definition in a gismu word - list gives the place structure
explicitly .
The primary task of constructing a Lojban sentence , after
choosing the relationship itself , is deciding what you will use to fill
in the sumti places .
{ ANAME ( ) }pronunciation {ANAME}3 .
Pronunciation
Lojban has six recognized vowels : " a " , " e " , " i " , " o " , " u " and " y " .
The first five are the pure Romance vowels : " a " as in " father " , " e " as
in " let " , " i " as in " machine " , " o " as in " dome " and " u " as in " flute " .
" y " is pronounced as the sound called " schwa " ; that is , as the
unstressed " a " as in " about " or " around " .
Twelve consonants in Lojban
are pronounced more or less as their counterparts are in English : " b " ,
" d " , " f " , " k " , " l " , " m " , " n " , " p " , " r " , " t " , " v " and " z " .
The " c " , on
the other hand is pronounced as the " sh " in " hush " , while " j " is its
' voiced ' counterpart , the sound of the " s " in " pleasure " .
" g " is always
hard as it is in " gift " , never as in " giant " . " s " is as in " sell " , never
as in " rose " .
The sound of " x " is not found in English ; it is like
' breathing through ' a " k " .
It is found as " ch " in Scottish " loch " , as
Spanish " j " , and as " ch " in some dialects of German .
It gets easier to
say as you practice it . " r " can be trilled , but does n't have to be .
Lojban also has three ' semi-letters ' : the period , the comma and the
apostrophe .
The period represents a glottal stop or a pause ; it is a
required stoppage of the flow of air in the speech stream .
The
apostrophe sounds just like the English letter " h " .
Unlike a regular
consonant , it is not found at the beginning or end of a word , nor is it
found adjacent to a consonant ; it is only found between two vowels .
The
comma has no sound associated with it , and is used to separate syllables
that might ordinarily run together .
It is only found inside names taken
from other languages ( it helps preserve the original sound of a
name ) .
Stress falls on the next to the last syllable of all words ,
except if that vowel is 'y ' , which is never stressed ; in such words the
third - to - last syllable is stressed .
If a word only has one syllable ,
then that syllable is not stressed .
{ ANAME ( ) }singlewds {ANAME}4 .
Single words that can act as sumti
Some words can be used singly to fill in a sumti place .
mi I , me , we , us , the speaker ( and maybe others ,
unspecified ) — Lojban words ( unless explicitly quantified , i.e .
labeled with a number ) , do not
distinguish between singular and plural forms .
do you , you all ,
thou , the person (s ) addressed by the speaker ti this thing , this person , this place ( usually indicated by a gesture ) ta that thing ,
that person , that place tu that yonder
thing , that yonder person , that yonder place zo'e something , it 's not important that you know
what ( " zo 'e " is used as a place filler ) da something , I have n't determined what ( " da " is the ' existential variable '
of logic ) ma what ? , fill in this blank ( " ma " is used for
asking some kinds of questions )
Let 's look at a simple Lojban bridi .
The place
structure of the gismu " tavla " is -+ x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} talks to x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} about x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} in language x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} +-
This bridi will
then have the form -+ x {SUB ( ) }1{SUB} tavla x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} x{SUB( ) }3{SUB} x{SUB( ) }4{SUB} +-
For example :
mi tavla do zo'e zo'e means I talk to you about something in some language .
do tavla mi ta zo'e means
You talk to me about that thing in a
language .
mi tavla zo'e tu ti means I talk to someone about that thing
yonder in this language .
ta tavla ma mi zo'e means That person talks to who ( ? ) about me in
some language .
or Who is that
person talking to about me ?
{ ANAME () }ellipsis{ANAME}5 .
Ellipsis
There are many words in Lojban that do not need to be written or
spoken aloud for them to operate .
For example , when " zo 'e " is left off of the end of the bridi , it is understood that the sumti place still exists , and is filled with some
unstated sumti .
This process is called
ellipsis .
Trailing " zo 'e "s are almost always
ellipsized .
mi tavla do means I talk to you .
do tavla mi means
You talk to me .
da tavla ta means Someone talks to that person .
do tavla zo'e mi means
You are talking about me .
zo'e tavla mi do means Someone talks to me about you .
{ ANAME ( ) }variant {ANAME}6 .
Variant forms of the bridi
Thus far you have seen one sumti before the selbri with any
remaining sumti coming afterward .
In fact , the selbri may come after
any number of the sumti without changing the
meaning of the bridi ( but not before all of
them ) .
So : -+ mi tavla do ti I talk to you about this .
mi do tavla ti I , to you , talk about this .
and mi do ti tavla I , to you , about this , talk .
+- all represent the
same relationship .
The important thing is that the order of the sumti has not changed .
These variations similarly
apply to selbri with
different numbers of sumti .
{ ANAME ( ) }switching {ANAME}7 .
sumti switching
For one reason or another you may want to change the order , placing
one particular sumti at the front of the bridi .
The operator " se " ,
placed before the last word of the selbri , will
switch the meanings of
the first and second sumti places .
So -+ mi tavla do ti I talk to you about this .
+-
has the same meaning as -+ do se tavla mi ti You are talked to by me about this .
+-
The operator
" te " ,
used in the same place , switches the meanings of the first and the third
sumti places .
-+ mi tavla do ti I talk to you about this .
+- has the same meaning
as -+ti te tavla do mi
This is talked about to you by me .
+-
Note that only the first and third
sumti have switched places ; the second sumti has remained in the second place .
The operators " ve " and " xe " switch the first and fourth sumti places , and the first and fifth sumti places , respectively .
More than
one of these operators may be used on a given selbri at one time , and in
such a case they are evaluated from left to right .
However , in practice
they are used one at a time , as there are better tools for complex
manipulation of the sumti places .
{ ANAME ( ) }selbrimod{ANAME}8 .
selbri modification
When two gismu are adjacent the first one
modifies the second , and the selbri takes its
place structure from the rightmost word .
For
example , " sutra " means " x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is fast at doing
x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} " ; " sutra tavla "
means " x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} talks fast to x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} about x{SUB ( ) }3 {SUB} in language x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} " .
Specifically , the meaning of the first place of the first word is what
modifies the next word : " sutra tavla " means
" x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB} is a fast - thing type of talker to x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} about x{SUB ( ) }3{SUB} in
language x{SUB ( ) }4{SUB} " .
When three or
more gismu are in a row , the first modifies the second , and that
combined meaning modifies the third , and that combined meaning modifies
the fourth , and so on .
For example , " sutra tavla cutci " means " x{SUB ( ) }1{SUB}
is a fast - talker type of shoe ( for x{SUB ( ) }2{SUB} of material x{SUB ( ) }3 { SUB} ) " .
That is ,
it is a shoe that is worn by a fast talker rather than a shoe that is
fast and is also worn by a talker .
{ ANAME () }selbriconv{ANAME}9 .
Converting a selbri to a sumti
Often we wish to talk about things other than the speaker , the
listener and things we can point to .
Let 's say I want to talk about a
talker other than " mi " .
What I want to talk
about would naturally fit into the first place of " tavla " .
Lojban , it turns out , has an operator
that pulls this first place out of a selbri and
converts it to a sumti .
" le
tavla " refers to " the talker " , and may be
used as a sumti .
( Note
that the double underline in examples marks the selbri , while each
single underline marks a sumti .
This notation
is only for clarifying the sentence structure and is not a part of the
language . )
~pp~
mi tavla do le tavla
-- ===== -- --------
means
I talk to you about the talker
~/ pp~
Similarly
" le sutra tavla " is " the fast talker " , and " le sutra te tavla "
is " the fast subject of talk " or " the subject of fast
talk " .
( Which of these
related meanings is understood will depend on the context in which the
expression is used .
The most plausible interpretation within the
context will generally be assumed by a listener to be the intended one . )
{ ANAME ( ) }marking {ANAME}10 .
Marking the selbri
There is a problem when we want to say " the fast one is talking " ;
" le sutra tavla " means " the fast talker " , not
" the fast one is talking " .
To solve this problem we mark the selbri with the word " cu " .
The word " cu " has no meaning , and stands only to
mark the beginning of the selbri within the bridi , separating it from a previous
sumti .
It comes before any other operator , such
as " se " or " te " .
So :
~pp~
le sutra tavla means the fast talker
le sutra cu tavla means
The fast one is talking .
=====
le sutra se tavla means
The fast talked - to one .
le sutra cu se tavla means
The fast one is talked to .
========
~/ pp~
" cu " is always assumed to be in front of the selbri .
It may be elided
( left out ) if this will not alter the grammar of the sentence , as in " mi cu
tavla do " .
{ ANAME ( ) }names {ANAME}11 .
Names
All words in Lojban end in vowels except for names .
Names end in a
consonant followed by a pause or glottal stop , either of which is
represented by a period .
Note that all grammatical punctuation in
Lojban is spoken and represented by words rather than symbols .
Names
are ' Lojbanized ' by conforming them to Lojban spelling and providing a
final consonant if there is n't one ; this consonant is typically " s " or
" n " for English names , but any Lojban consonant may be used .
Remember that a comma without spaces around it in the middle of a name can be
used to separate syllables that would ordinarily be run together in
Lojban .
To convert a Lojbanized name into a sumti ,
use the article " la " . " la
djan . " is " the one called John " .
For obvious reasons , the
letter sequence " la " may not occur inside any
name .
Likewise , " doi " may not appear in a name ,
for reasons that will be obvious in the following
section .
( If a name would use either of these two sound patterns , it
must be changed , perhaps to use " ly " or " le " , " do 'i " or " dei " instead . )
{ ANAME ( ) }vocatives {ANAME}12 .
Vocatives and imperatives
You may call someone 's attention to the fact that you are
addressing them by using " doi " followed by their
name .
The phrase " doi djan . " means " Oh , John ,
I 'm talking to you " .
It also has the effect of
setting the value of " do " ; " do " now refers to " John " until it is changed
in some way in the conversation .
If you say " do tavla " , it means " you
are talking " .
For the imperative in Lojban , the word " ko " is
substituted for " do " .
The phrase " ko tavla "
instructs the listener to do whatever is necessary to make " do tavla "
true .
For example :
~pp~
ko tavla means Talk .
-- =====
ko sutra means
Be fast .
-- =====
mi tavla ko means
Be talked to by me .
-- ===== --
or Let me talk to you .
~/ pp~
" ko " can fill any appropriate sumti place , and can be used as often as
is appropriate for the selbri : " ko kurji ko " and " ko ko kurji " both
mean " You take care of you " and " Be taken care of by you " , or to put it
colloquially , " Take care of yourself " .
{ ANAME ( ) }greetings {ANAME}13 .
Greetings
In all natural languages , greeting words are idiomatic .
In Lojban
" coi " means " hello " and " co'o " means " good - bye " .
Either word may stand
alone , they may follow one another , or either may be followed by a pause
and a name .
'' coi. djan . '' means Hello , John . '' co 'o. djan . '' means Good - bye , John .
{ ANAME ( ) }attitudinals {ANAME}14 .
Attitudinals
Different cultures express emotions and attitudes with a variety of
intonations and gestures that are not included in the written language .
Some of these are available in some languages as ejaculations ( i.e .
Aha ! ,
Oh no ! , Ouch ! , Aahh ! , etc. ) , but they vary greatly from culture to
culture .
Lojban has a part of speech known as an ' attitudinal ' which
specifically covers this type of commentary on spoken statements .
They
are both written and spoken , but require no specific intonation or
gestures .
Grammatically they are very simple : one or more attitudinals
at the beginning of a bridi apply to the entire
bridi ; anywhere else in the bridi they apply to the word immediately to the
left .
Some attitudinals are :
~pp~
Lojban English attitude Ejaculations and other English used
'' '' '' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' ' '''''' ' ' ' ' ''_
. a'o hope hopefully , I hope
.e'o request , petition , please ! , get it done !
command ( with rank )
.iu love , endearment ,
affection
. oi complaint , discomfort Oy ! , Ouch !
.ua discovery Eureka !
. ui happy , cheerful Whee !
.uu pity , compassion Aww !
~/ pp~
Attitudinals represent scales of emotion ,
and there are some indicators available to show where on the scale you
are :
~pp~
cai intense or absolute .iucai intense love
extreme feeling
sai strong feeling .iusai strong love
ru'e weak or mild feeling .iuru'e mild love
cu'i indifference .iucu 'i " no love lost "
nai single word negator .iunai hate , enmity
naicai intense opposite .iunaicai intense hate
naisai strong opposite .iunaisai strong hatred
nairu'e mild or weak opposite .iunairu'e mild hatred
~/ pp~
Intensity indicators may stand on their own , indicating intensity of
emotion while leaving the emotion unspecified , or they may be used to
modify another attitudinal , but they will only modify the word
immediately to the left .
Thus " .a'o.uu "
expresses hope mixed with pity , but " .a'o.uucai " expresses " hope mixed
with intense pity " , not " intense hope mixed with intense pity " .
( Note
that , unlike in a selbri , attitudinals do not
modify each other in any strict order , but are mixed .
If multiple
emotions are indicated , the one that the speaker wants most to express
usually comes first . )
{ ANAME ( ) }yesorno{ANAME}15 .
Yes or no questions
All yes or no questions in English may be reformulated to begin " Is
it true that ... " .
In Lojban we have a word that asks precisely that
question in precisely the same way .
" xu " placed
in front of a bridi asks whether that bridi is true as stated .
" xu " , however , is
technically an attitudinal and can go almost anywhere in the bridi , in which case it asks the same question but
emphasizes the word immediately
to the left of it .
So
~pp~
xu do tavla mi means
Is it true that you are talking to me ?
-- ===== --
do xu tavla mi means
Are you the one talking to me ?
-- ===== --
do tavla xu mi means Talking to me ?
Is that what you 're doing ?
-- ===== --
do tavla mi xu means
Is it me you are talking to ?
-- ===== --
~/ pp~
An affirmative answer may be given by simply restating the bridi .
Lojban has a shorthand for doing this with
the word " go'i " .
This word stands for the whole
bridi and assumes the values represented by the
sumti are unchanged unless you specifically
replace them .
Instead of a negative answer , the bridi may be restated in such a way as to make it
true .
If this can be done by substituting sumti , it may be done with " go 'i " as well .
question : '' xu do kanro ' '
Are you healthy ?
answer : '' mi kanro ' '
I am healthy .
or : '' go 'i '' I am healthy .
( " ' ' do ' ' " to the questioner is " ' ' mi ' ' " to the respondent ) or : ' 'le tavla cu kanro ' '
The talker is healthy .
or : ' 'le tavla cu go 'i ' '
The talker is healthy .
A general negative answer may be given by " na go 'i " .
" na " may be placed before any selbri ( but after the " cu " ) .
It is equivalent to stating " It is not true that ... " before the bridi .
It does not imply that anything else is true
or untrue , only that that specific bridi is not
true .
{ ANAME ( ) }other {ANAME}16 .
Other terms
All gismu have combining - forms associated with
them which may be combined into compounds called " lujvo " .
All gismu have at least one
combining - form associated with them and may have as many as four , not
counting the full form of the word , which may only appear at the end of
a lujvo .
The short combining - forms or affixes are called " rafsi " .
A
lujvo may act in any way like a gismu within a bridi .
Any
word that can behave in this way is called a " brivla " ; that is , a brivla is any word
that can stand alone in a selbri or can modify
another brivla .
When
two or more brivla are strung together in a selbri or a sumti , the
combination is called a " tanru " .
A tanru may also have " se" - type
operators as well as brivla in it , as well as
some other features not yet covered .
The little words that are not brivla , and
usually indicate grammatical structure are called " cmavo " .
The cmavo also
include the attitudinals and short sumti like
" mi " and " do " .
Mozilla ’s Firefox browser claims to provide a safer browsing experience out of the box , but some of the best security features of Firefox are only available as extensions .
Here ’s a roundup of some of the more useful ones I ’ve found .
Add n’ Edit Cookies
This might be more of a web developer tool , but being able to view in detail the cookies that various sites set on your visits can be an eye - opening experience .
This extension not only shows you all the details , but lets you modify them too .
You ’ll be surprised at how many web apps do foolish things like saving your password in the cookie .

Dr. Web Anti-Virus Link Checker
This is an interesting idea — scanning files for viruses before you download them .
Basically , this extension adds an option to the link context menu that allows you to pass the link to the Dr. Web AV service .
I have n’t rigorously tested this or anything , but it ’s an interesting concept that could be part of an effective multilayer personal security model .

FormFox
This extension does n’t do a whole lot , but what it does is important — showing a tooltip when you roll over a form submission button of the form action URL .
Extending this further to visually differentiate submission buttons that submit to SSL URLs would be really nice ( as suggested by Chris Shiflett ) .

FlashBlock
Flash has n’t been quite as popular an attack vector as Javascript , but it still potentially could be a threat , and it ’s often an annoyance .
This extension disables all embedded Flash elements by default ( score one for securing things by default ) , allowing you to click to activate a particular one if you like .
It lacks the flexibility I ’d like ( things like whitelists would be very handy ) , and does n’t give you much ( any ? ) info about the Flash element before you run it , but it ’s still a handy tool .

LiveHTTPHeaders & Header Monitor LiveHTTPHeaders is an incredibly useful too for web developers , displaying all of the header traffic between the client and server .
Header Monitor is basically an add - on for LiveHTTPHeaders that displays a chosen header in Firefox ’s status bar .
They ’re not really specifically security tools , but they do offer a lot of info on what ’s really going on when you ’re browsing , and an educated user is a safer user .

This restores some of the granularity Firefox users used to have over what Javascript can and cannot do .
I ’d like to see this idea taken farther ( see below ) , but it ’s handy regardless .

NoScript
This extension is pretty smooth .
Of all the addons for Firefox covered here , this is the one to get .
NoScript is a powerful javascript execution whitelisting tool , allowing full user control over what domains allow scripts to run .
Notifications of blocked execution and the allowed domain interface are nearly identical to the built - in Firefox popup blocker , so users should find it comfortable to work with .
NoScript can also block Flash , Java , and “ other plugins ; ” forbid bookmarklets ; block or allow the “ ping ” attribute of the tag ; and attempt to rewrite links that execute javascript to go to their intended donation without triggering the script code .
The one thing I ’d really like to see from this extension would be more ganularity over what the Javascript engine can access .
Now it ’s only “ on ” or “ off , ” but being able to disable things like cookie access would eliminate a lot of potential security issues while still letting JS power rich web app interfaces .

Places handy little buttons in the status bar that let you quickly enable or disable Java or Javascript support .
Note that this will not work with the latest stable Firefox ( 1.5.0.1 ) .
Hopefully a new version will be available soon .

ShowIP
This is another tool that is n’t aimed at security per se , but offers a lot of useful information .
ShowIP drops the IP address of the current site in your status bar .
Clicking on it brings up a menu of lookup options for the IP , like whois and DNS info .
You can add additional web lookups if you like , as well as passing the IP to a local program .
Handy stuff .
This is another tool that is n’t aimed at security per se , but offers a lot of useful information .
ShowIP drops the IP address of the current site in your status bar .
Clicking on it brings up a menu of lookup options for the IP , like whois and DNS info .

SpoofStick
The idea with this extension is to make it easier to catch spoofing attempts by displaying a very large , brightly colored “ You ’re on ” in the toolbar .
For folks who know what they ’re doing this is n’t wildly useful , but it could be just the ticket for less savvy users .
It requires a bit too much setup for them , though , and in the end I think this is something the browser itself should be handling .

Tamper Data Much like LiveHTTPHeaders , Tamper Data is a very useful extension for web devs that lets the user view HTTP headers and POST data passed between the client and server .
In addition , Tamper Data makes it easy for the user to alter the data being sent to the server , which is enormously useful for doing security testing against web apps .
I also like how the data is presented in TD a bit better than LiveHTTPHeaders : it ’s easier to see at a glance all of the traffic and get an overall feel of what ’s going on , but you can still drill down and get as much detail as you like .

The condition causes emotional and communication problems
Peter Temple , 27 , from York , has Asperger 's Syndrome and his family said he had found regular sessions with a psychologist helpful .
But the local health authority said it was stopping the sessions because his high IQ meant he could not be classed as having a learning disability .
The North Yorkshire and York Primary Care Trust said it could not comment .
A spokesman said the trust would not comment on individual cases but confirmed that having Asperger 's alone does not qualify a person for support .
' In tears '
Asperger 's Syndrome causes communication and emotional problems .
Mr Temple said : " It was a bit of a shock .
I was actually in tears with it .
" I thought things have just gone downhill . "
Keith Temple , Peter 's father , said : " It 's ridiculous .
Everybody knows people with autism have a spiky profile .
" They can be very good at some things and poor at others .
It 's the poor things that mean they need support . "
The Bradford - based SACAR Trust , which supports people with Asperger 's Syndrome and Autism , said it was common for people with the condition not to get help and the lack of support could lead to mental health problems .
Executive director Paul Donaldson said : " Lots of people , unfortunately , if they do n't get the right support in place can regress .
" They can actually get anxiety , frustration and depression and if that occurs then sadly they may fall within the bounds of mental health because of the problems that is causing . "
Update , 3/2/2009 : Use this authenticated paid link report form now .
One thing I heard at SES London was that people wanted a way to report paid links specifically .
I ’d like to get a few paid link reports anyway because I ’m excited about trying some ideas here at Google to augment our existing algorithms .
Google may provide a special form for paid link reports at some point , but in the mean time , here ’s a couple of ways that anyone can use to report paid links :
– Sign in to Google ’s webmaster console and use the authenticated spam report form , then include the word “ paidlink ” ( all one word ) in the text area of the spam report .
If you use the authenticated form , you ’ll need to sign in with a Google Account , but your report will carry more weight .
– Use the unauthenticated spam report form and make sure to include the word “ paidlink ” ( all one word ) in the text area of the spam report .
As far as the details , it can be pretty short .
Something like “ Example.com is selling links ; here ’s a page on example.com that demonstrates that ” or “ www.shadyseo.com is buying links .
You can see the paid links on www.example.com/path/page.html” is all you need to mention .
That will be enough for Google to start testing out some new techniques we ’ve got — thanks !
Update , May 12th , 2007 : I finally got some time to circle back around to this subject .
I wanted to add an example or two of the sorts of reports that we’d be interested in getting , and try to answer a few questions about paid links .
Let ’s start with some questions .
Q : Can you give me some more background on how Google views paid links ?
A : Absolutely .
Start with this post from 2005 .
It ’s a pretty good review of our policies at the time ( e.g. link sellers can lose trust , such as their ability to flow PageRank / anchortext .
Also , we ’re open to semi-automatic approaches to ignore paid links , which could include the best of algorithmic and manual approaches . ) .
You can also read about panels at search conferences where we did a site review and how much paid links stood out in a site review .
I even mentioned earlier this year that paid articles / reviews / posts should be done in a way that does n’t affect search engines .
Here ’s a post from January , for example , where I said :
Yet another “ pay - for - blogging ” ( PFB ) business launched , this time by Text Link Brokers .
It should be clear from Google ’s stance on paid text links , but if you are blogging and being paid by services like Pay Per Post , ReviewMe , or SponsoredReviews , links in those paid - for posts should be made in a way that does n’t affect search engines .
The rel= ” nofollow ” attribute is one way , but there are numerous other ways to do paid links that wo n’t affect search engines , e.g. doing an internal redirect through a url that is forbidden from crawling by robots .
txt .
So this post should n’t be a surprise ; it ’s inline with our previous discussion of paid links .
Some people wanted a way to report potential paid links and that was the main reason for this post .
Q : Now when you say “ paid links , ” what exactly do you mean by that ?
Do you view all paid links as potential violations of Google ’s quality guidelines ?
A : Good question .
As someone working on quality and relevance at Google , my bottom - line concern is clean and relevant search results on Google .
As such , I care about paid links that flow PageRank and attempt to game Google ’s rankings .
I ’m not worried about links that are paid but do n’t affect search engines .
So when I say “ paid links ” it ’s pretty safe to add in your head “ paid links that flow PageRank and attempt to game Google ’s rankings . ”
Q : Can you give me an example of the sort of things you ’d be interested in hearing about ?
A : Sure .
Here are some paid text links on a site dedicated to Linux :
There are a few interesting things about these links .
If you take off your webmaster hat and put on a user hat for a minute , you quickly start asking yourself questions like “ Why is a Linux site linking to a bunch of poker , pills , and gambling sites ? ”
Users often consider links like this spammy or low - quality .
I ’m sure some people will happily defend links like these , but in my experience people who search on Google do n’t want links like these to affect Google ’s search results .
There are a couple other interesting things about these links .
First , you ca n’t tell it from the image , but the “ Sponsored Links ” text in the example above is actually an image , not text .
The rest of that site is very text - heavy , so the choice to make the “ Sponsored Links ” be an image is potentially trying to avoid detection of these links as paid .
I ca n’t be sure that ’s the reason , of course — maybe they just wanted that phrase to be pretty .
The second interesting thing about these links is that our current approach to paid links worked quite well in this case .
Our existing algorithms had already discounted these links without any people involved .
However , our manual spamfighters had detected these links as well .
Q : So in addition to algorithms , Google has people who take action on spam ?
A : Algorithms and algorithmic spamfighting are an essential way to improve Google ’s quality , but Google does reserve the right to take manual action on spam ( here ’s a reference from 2004 where GoogleGuy , a search engine rep , said that Google can take manual action on spam ) .
For example , if someone reports off - topic , keyword - stuffed porn for someone ’s name , we do reserve the right to take manual action on that .
In my personal opinion , Google ’s philosophy on webspam is to look for scalable , robust approaches that improve our quality ( with a heavy emphasis on algorithms ) .
I did an interview last year with John Battelle where I gave my personal opinion in more detail .
Q : That paid link example was helpful .
Can you give me another example ?
A : Sure .
This one also has “ paid advertising ” as an image , but our existing algorithms still discount these links :
Q : Okay , that example gives me a feel for the sort of paid links you ’d like to hear about .
What will you do with the new reports you get ?
A : There are several ways that we intend to use the data .
Our current algorithm detected the paid links above just fine , but these outside reports are a great way to measure ( and then improve ) the precision and recall of our existing algorithms on independent data .
Next , the reports help build datasets for future algorithms .
So the data helps us build the next generation of algorithms to improve quality .
It also lets us work on new tools and techniques to improve how we detect paid links .
Finally , we can investigate and take direct action on many reports that we receive .
Q : This is all well and fine , but I decide what to do on my site .
I can do anything I want on it , including selling links .
A : You ’re 100 % right ; you can do absolutely anything you want on your site .
But in the same way , I believe Google has the right to do whatever we think is best ( in our index , algorithms , or scoring ) to return relevant results .
Q : It ’s Google ’s job to return clean / relevant results regardless of what people do on the web , so I do n’t intend to send any feedback to Google .
A : You ’re right , it is our job .
If you ’d rather not send any feedback to Google , I respect that decision .
The primary intent of this post was to enable the people who did want to send us reports to do so .
I appreciate when people do send us feedback , because that data helps Google improve its search quality and helps Google design new algorithms to give better results .
Q : Are you getting pretty good reports in response to this post ?
A : Definitely .
We ’re getting a nice quantity of reports — I believe that we ’ve gotten more paid link reports than there are comments on this thread .
The quality is also high , in that many of the reports are pretty detailed .
It ’s also cool that ( at least from a quick glance at our reports ) , a majority of the reports appear to be going to our authenticated form .
I ’m glad to see people using that form , because we can give those authenticated reports more weight .
Q : I ’m worried that someone will buy links to my site and then report that .
A : We ’ve always tried very hard to prevent site A from hurting site B .
That ’s why these reports are n’t being fed directly into algorithms , and are being used as the starting point rather than being used directly .
You might also want to review the policy mentioned in my 2005 post ( individual links can be discounted and sellers can lose their ability to pass on PageRank / anchortext / etc. , which does n’t allow site A to hurt site B ) .
Q : Are you interested in things like affiliate links ?
Are you interested in hearing about directories in this report ?
A : Nope , I ’d be most interested in feedback like the examples that I mentioned above , or things like paid posts that might affect search engines .
If you ’re still unsure what sort of reports we ’d like to get , that ’s okay .
Fortunately , the vast majority of people sending in reports are on the same wavelength and are sending in solid feedback like the examples above .
Q : Hey , as long as we ’re talking about directories , can you talk about the role of directories , some of whom charge for a reviewer to evaluate them ?
A : I ’ll try to give a few rules of thumb to think about when looking at a directory .
When considering submitting to a directory , I ’d ask questions like :
– Does the directory reject urls ?
If every url passes a review , the directory gets closer to just a list of links or a free - for - all link site .
– What is the quality of urls in the directory ?
Suppose a site rejects 25 % of submissions , but the urls that are accepted / listed are still quite low - quality or spammy .
That does n’t speak well to the quality of the directory .
– If there is a fee , what ’s the purpose of the fee ?
For a high - quality directory , the fee is primarily for the time / effort for someone to do a genuine evaluation of a url or site .
Those are a few factors I ’d consider .
If you put on your user hat and ask “ Does this seem like a high - quality directory to me ? ” you can usually get a pretty good sense as well , or ask a few friends for their take on a particular directory .
Q : Google ’s quality guidelines say “ Make sites for users , not search engines . ”
Put that in context for me ; how does that interact with buying links ?
A : If someone is buying text links to try to rank higher on search engines , they ’re already doing something intended more for search engines than for users .
If you finish that guideline , you ’ll see that it ’s talking about doing radically different things for engines versus users ( for example , cloaking or creating doorway pages ) .
It would be a misinterpretation of that guideline to think “ Okay , I can only do things for users , I can never do things for search engines .
Therefore I can buy text links , but not in a way that does n’t affect search engines . ”
That same philosophy would mean that you would n’t create a robots .
txt file ( users do n’t check those ) , never make any meta tags ( users do n’t see meta tags ) , never create an XML sitemap file ( users would n’t know about them ) , and would n’t create web pages that validate ( users would n’t notice ) .
Yet these are all great practices to do .
So if you want to buy links , I ’d buy them for users / traffic , not for PageRank / search engines .
Q : Suppose I did n’t want to read all the comments on this post .
Did you post any other nuggets that I should be aware of ?
A : Hmm .
Well , someone did mention AdSense spam and so I reiterated how to report MFA or AdSense spam .
I ’ll quote that for folks that are interested :
If you see a spammy or made - for - AdSense site , do the following :
– Click on the “ Ads by Google ” link .
– At the bottom of the page , click on the “ Send Google your thoughts on the site or the ads you just saw ” link and fill out the form .
– When you fill out the form , at the bottom you ’ll get to a section that says “ Add additional information here : ” .
Include the word “ spamreport ” all in one word to make sure that the webspam team can see the feedback .
I do n’t want any Google user to encounter spam , so please feel free to use Google ’s authenticated spam report form for any other type of spam .
We can also handle authenticated spam reports in several different languages .
Q : I kinda liked that nugget .
Got any other interesting nuggets ?
A : One rule of thumb is that if a link seller is talking about how hard it is to find a paid link or how paid links are made so that no one will know , that ’s probably a bad sign to Google .
For example , someone forwarded me an alleged email from one link seller that went like this :
Matt says they will try to find the links .
This is where our service really cleans up ALL the competors !
Google may be able to find the competition very easily ( sitewide links are easy to spot ) , but our ads are too hard to find .
Here ’s why …
1 . I have removed all identifying “ buy here ” items ( ads / html / divs ) , making our ads hard to find .
…
4 . Our service is not high profile , not flashy , not well known … making our ads hard to find .
…
Personally , when the link seller is talking about how a paid link is hard to find , that would worry me .
( Yes , this was a different company than the post I did about undetectable paid links and spam earlier this year . )
Q : I do n’t think paid links are the biggest threat to Google ’s quality .
I think technique X is having a bigger impact ; why are n’t you tackling that ?
A : It ’s a safe assumption that Google ’s webspam team is working on several different things at once .
The posts I did in mid-April were mainly to reiterate Google ’s stance on paid links and provide a way that people can give us feedback if they want .
I hope that the examples above give an idea of the sort of things that people want to tell us about , and that we want to hear about .
It is a period of civil war .

Backers of stronger copyright laws form lobby group [ CNET via Techdirt ]
WASHINGTON , Nov. 6 , 2006  --
Voters around the country get the recorded messages -- called robocalls -- up to five times a day , telling them to vote for Republican and Democratic candidates in their region .
Charles Hartley of Streamwood , Ill. , said he has been inundated with robocalls the last three weeks from both parties but hears mainly from Republican groups .
Hartley said he has received between 25 and 30 calls from the National Republican Congressional Committee in the last three weeks and as many as two to three calls a day from Republicans talking solely about Tammy Duckworth , a Democrat who is running for Congress .
Voter David Stone of Philadelphia said he gets the same amount of calls each day and shares Hartley 's experience of hearing a Democrat 's name repeated continually in a recording paid for by a Republican group .
" Mostly what I 'm getting is calls from Republican organizations about Lois Murphy , the Democratic candidate [ for the House ] .
And you think the call is from Murphy and then they go on to spin the facts , " Stone told ABC News .
" It 's annoying , " Stone said .
" I think voters are hearing the name and then they think it 's the Democrat pushing their candidate many times throughout the day , but it 's really paid for by the Republicans . "
Today Democratic Congressional Committee Chairman Rahm Emanuel expanded on these Republican robocalls that use Democratic candidates ' names such as Duckworth and Murphy .
Emanuel said the Republicans are using " dirty tricks " by calling voters numerous times a day and making them believe the Democratic candidate paid for the message .
Emanuel was particularly frustrated with Republican robocalls that come late at night .
" What they 're doing is midnight to 6 o'clock in the morning phone calls to Democratic voters in the name of Democratic candidates .
This is the worst of dirty tricks , " Emanuel said .
National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Carl Forti said his group has never played a part in these late - night calls .
" There are many groups making phone calls .
The accusations against our group are totally untrue , " Forti said .
The NRCC never places phone calls past 8 p.m. , he said .
However , Democrats still plan to use legal means and push Republicans on an FCC regulation that requires an entity responsible for a prerecorded phone call to identify themselves at the beginning of the call instead of waiting until the end .
Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee General Counsel Bob Bauer said if these robocalls ID the caller at the end of the message , it is a clear violation .
The National Republican Congressional Committee has not yet responded to the caller ID issue , but Forti said , " We comply with all federal laws and regulations regarding political phone calls . "
Daniel Steinberger , Ellen Davis and Matt Stuart contributed to this report .
“ I ’ll talk to you about discrimination , ” he said one morning , while discussing , without bitterness , his early years as an Army officer .
“ Let ’s talk about being refused to be served at a restaurant in public .
Let ’s talk about having to do things two times , and being accused of not speaking English well , and having to pay myself for my three master ’s degrees because the Army did n’t think I was smart enough .
So what ?
Just work your ass off .
So what ?
The hard work paid off . ”
Taguba had joined the Army knowing little about his father ’s military experience .
“ He saw the ravages and brutality of war , but he was n’t about to brag about his exploits , ” Taguba said .
“ He did n’t say anything until 1997 , and it took me two years to rebuild his records and show that he was authorized for an award . ”
On Tomas ’s eightieth birthday , he was awarded the Bronze Star and a prisoner - of - war medal in a ceremony at Schofield Barracks , in Hawaii .
“ My father never laughed , ” Taguba said .
But the day he got his medal “ he smiled — he had a big - ass smile on his face .
I ’d never seen him look so proud .
He was a bent man with carpal - tunnel syndrome , but at the end of the medal ceremony he stood himself up and saluted .
I cried , and everyone in my family burst into tears . ”
Richard Armitage , a former Navy counter - insurgency officer who served as Deputy Secretary of State in the first Bush term , recalled meeting Taguba , then a lieutenant colonel , in South Korea in the early nineteen - nineties .
“ I was told to keep an eye on this young guy — ‘ He ’s going to be a general , ’ ” Armitage said .
“ Taguba was discreet and low key — not a sprinter but a marathoner . ”
At the time , Taguba was working for Major General Mike Myatt , a marine who was the officer in charge of strategic talks with the South Koreans , on behalf of the American military .
“ I needed an executive assistant with brains and integrity , ” Myatt , who is now retired and living in San Francisco , told me .
After interviewing a number of young officers , he chose Taguba .
“ He was ethical and he knew his stuff , ” Myatt said .
“ We really became close , and I ’d trust him with my life .
We talked about military strategy and policy , and the moral aspect of war — the importance of not losing the moral high ground . ”
Myatt followed Taguba ’s involvement in the Abu Ghraib inquiry , and said , “ I was so proud of him .
I told him , ‘ Tony , you ’ve maintained yourself , and your integrity . ’ ”
Taguba got a different message , however , from other officers , among them General John Abizaid , then the head of Central Command .
A few weeks after his report became public , Taguba , who was still in Kuwait , was in the back seat of a Mercedes sedan with Abizaid .
Abizaid ’s driver and his interpreter , who also served as a bodyguard , were in front .
Abizaid turned to Taguba and issued a quiet warning : “ You and your report will be investigated . ”
“ I was n’t angry about what he said but disappointed that he would say that to me , ” Taguba said .
“ I ’d been in the Army thirty - two years by then , and it was the first time that I thought I was in the Mafia . ”
THE INVESTIGATION
Taguba was given the job of investigating Abu Ghraib because of circumstance : the senior officer of the 800th Military Police Brigade , to which the soldiers in the photographs belonged , was a one - star general ; Army regulations required that the head of the inquiry be senior to the commander of the unit being investigated , and Taguba , a two - star general , was available .
“ It was as simple as that , ” he said .
He vividly remembers his first thought upon seeing the photographs in late January of 2004 : “ Unbelievable !
What were these people doing ? ”
There was an immediate second thought : “ This is big . ”
Taguba decided to keep the photographs from most of the interrogators and researchers on his staff of twenty - three officers .
“ I did n’t want them to prejudge the soldiers they were investigating , so I put the photos in a safe , ” he told me .
“ Anyone who wanted to see them had to have a need - to - know and go through me . ”
His decision to keep the staff in the background was also intended to insure that none of them suffered damage to his or her career because of involvement in the inquiry .
“ I knew it was going to be very sensitive because of the gravity of what was in front of us , ” he said .
The team spent much of February , 2004 , in Iraq .
Taguba was overwhelmed by the scale of the wrongdoing .
“ These were people who were taken off the streets and put in jail — teen - agers and old men and women , ” he said .
“ I kept on asking these questions of the officers I interviewed : ‘ You knew what was going on .
Why did n’t you do something to stop it ? ’ ”
Taguba ’s assignment was limited to investigating the 800th M.P.s , but he quickly found signs of the involvement of military intelligence — both the 205th Military Intelligence Brigade , commanded by Colonel Thomas Pappas , which worked closely with the M.P.s , and what were called “ other government agencies , ” or O.G.A.s , a euphemism for the C.I.A. and special - operations units operating undercover in Iraq .
Some of the earliest evidence involved Lieutenant Colonel Steven L. Jordan , whose name was mentioned in interviews with several M.P.s .
For the first three weeks of the investigation , Jordan was nowhere to be found , despite repeated requests .
When the investigators finally located him , he asked whether he needed to shave his beard before being interviewed — Taguba suspected that he had been dressing as a civilian .
“ When I asked him about his assignment , he says , ‘ I ’m a liaison officer for intelligence from Army headquarters in Iraq . ’ ” But in the course of three or four interviews with Jordan , Taguba said , he began to suspect that the lieutenant colonel had been more intimately involved in the interrogation process — some of it brutal — for “ high value ” detainees .
“ Jordan denied everything , and yet he had the authority to enter the prison ’s ‘ hard site ’ ” — where the most important detainees were held — “ carrying a carbine and an M9 pistol , which is against regulations , ” Taguba said .
Jordan had also led a squad of military policemen in a shoot - out inside the hard site with a detainee from Syria who had managed to obtain a gun .
( A lawyer for Jordan disputed these allegations ; in the shoot - out , he said , Jordan was “ just another gun on the extraction team ” and not the leader .
He noted that Jordan was not a trained interrogator . )
Taguba said that Jordan ’s “ record reflected an extensive intelligence background . ”
He also had reason to believe that Jordan was not reporting through the chain of command .
But Taguba ’s narrowly focussed mission constrained the questions he could ask .
“ I suspected that somebody was giving them guidance , but I could not print that , ” Taguba said .
“ After all Jordan ’s evasiveness and misleading responses , his rights were read to him , ” Taguba went on .
Jordan subsequently became the only officer facing trial on criminal charges in connection with Abu Ghraib and is scheduled to be court - martialled in late August .
( Seven M.P.s were convicted of charges that included dereliction of duty , maltreatment , and assault ; one defendant , Specialist Charles Graner , was sentenced to ten years in prison . )
Last month , a military judge ruled that Jordan , who is still assigned to the Army ’s Intelligence and Security Command , had not been appropriately advised of his rights during his interviews with Taguba , undermining the Army ’s allegation that he lied during the Taguba inquiry .
Six other charges remain , including failure to obey an order or regulation ; cruelty and maltreatment ; and false swearing and obstruction of justice .
( His lawyer said , “ The evidence clearly shows that he is innocent . ” )
Malicious programs are installed by visits to a booby - trapped site
Researchers from the firm surveyed billions of sites , subjecting 4.5 million pages to " in -depth analysis " .
About 450,000 were capable of launching so - called " drive - by downloads " , sites that install malicious code , such as spyware , without a user 's knowledge .
A further 700,000 pages were thought to contain code that could compromise a user 's computer , the team report .
To address the problem , the researchers say the company has " started an effort to identify all web pages on the internet that could be malicious " .
Phantom sites
Drive - by downloads are an increasingly common way to infect a computer or steal sensitive information .
They usually consist of malicious programs that automatically install when a potential victim visits a booby - trapped website .
" To entice users to install malware , adversaries employ social engineering , " wrote Google researcher Niels Provos and his colleagues in a paper titled The Ghost In The Browser .
Finding all the web - based infection vectors is a significant challenge and requires almost complete knowledge of the web
Google researchers Hi-tech crime
Avoiding attacks
" The user is presented with links that promise access to ' interesting ' pages with explicit pornographic content , copyrighted software or media .
A common example are sites that display thumbnails to adult videos . "
The vast majority exploit vulnerabilities in Microsoft 's Internet Explorer browser to install themselves .
Some downloads , such as those that alter bookmarks , install unwanted toolbars or change the start page of a browser , are an annoyance .
But increasingly , criminals are using drive - bys to install keyloggers that steal login and password information .
Other pieces of malicious code hijack a computer turning it into a " bot " , a remotely controlled PC .
Drive - by downloads represent a shift away from traditional methods of infecting a computer , such as spam and email attachments .
Attack plan
As well as characterising the scale of the problem on the net , the Google study analysed the main methods by which criminals inject malicious code on to innocent web pages .
Spam e-mails are a common way to infect a computer
It found that the code was often contained in those parts of the website not designed or controlled by the website owner , such as banner adverts and widgets .
Widgets are small programs that may , for example , display a calendar on a webpage or a web traffic counter .
These are often downloaded from third - party sites .
The rise of web 2.0 and user - generated content gave criminals other channels , or vectors , of attack , it found .
For example , postings in blogs and forums that contain links to images or other content could unwittingly infect a user .
The study also found that gangs were able to hijack web servers , effectively taking over and infecting all of the web pages hosted on the computer .
In a test , the researchers ' computer was infected with 50 different pieces of malware by visiting a web page hosted on a hijacked server .
The firm is now in the process of mapping the malware threat .
Google , part of the StopBadware coalition , already warns users if they are about to visit a potentially harmful website , displaying a message that reads " this site may harm your computer " next to the search results .
" Marking pages with a label allows users to avoid exposure to such sites and results in fewer users being infected , " the researchers wrote .
However , the task will not be easy , they say .
" Finding all the web - based infection vectors is a significant challenge and requires almost complete knowledge of the web as a whole , " they wrote .

Modern life can be stressful and living with less things can often be a positive change .
When I was in my early 50s , I began to question the lifestyle my husband and I were living .
I longed for a simpler lifestyle : I knew I wanted less stress , I knew I was tired of working for someone else , and I felt there had to be a way to achieve my goal of quitting the corporate world for good .
Quitting was going to be easy , but the more difficult task was finding the ways I could maintain my goal once I did quit .
The question of " What are you willing to change in your life to achieve your goal ? " kept filtering through my mind , and I realized the answer was not using the words " give up " interchangeably with the word " change " in that phrase until I was able to understand the difference .
Advertisement
The most reasonable and surest way to achieve my goal was to just quit , and then deal with the aftermath in a very pro-active way .
Yes , it was a " guts " move that many people would n't be able to handle , but with my husband 's support and the knowledge that I would be the one handling " the aftermath , " I quit , and then never looked back with regret .
That does n't mean it was easy , but my goal of making this work for both of us was tantamount to everything else .
After taking the first two weeks to just rest , recuperate and think , I began listing all the changes on paper that needed to be made , which included carefully guarding the resources that my husband continued to bring into our lives as well as finding new venues of producing income or additional resources based on what we already had .

Some decisions were just plain easy , such as canceling a standing weekly appointment at the beauty salon for hair and a manicure or eating out numerous nights a week because there was no time to fix meals , but even then , I knew this was only the tip of the iceberg .
The first major decision was to sell our home , which was way too big and costly for the two of us .
Two people who want a simpler lifestyle do n't need or want an executive home with four bedrooms , four bathrooms , a three - and - a - half car garage , etc .
( You know your house is too big for you when two of the bathrooms are regularly dusted rather than cleaned because of non-use ! )
The 3,000 + sq. ft. house sold relatively quickly , and then came the task of finding a smaller house .
When I found that much smaller house still within convenient driving distance of my husband 's employment , then began the monumental task of downsizing our possessions to fit our new abode , which was slightly more than 1,200 sq. ft .
That was perhaps the most sizeable job of all , and required several garage and consignment sales .
( You know you have too many clothes when your yearly wardrobe requires two full - sized walk - in closets ! )

After we moved came the adjustment period of being content and happy in a smaller home , and that did take some getting used to .
My husband could care less what type of house we lived in , but I had initial difficulty because nothing " fit " properly according to my former lifestyle .
This was a mental change I needed to make , and through home improvement projects and fixing what did n't work for me such as non-functioning closets and antiquated storage cupboards , within the first year , I grew to love that much smaller and unpretentious home .
As I worked through the process of making each room or space as functional and comfortable as possible for the least amount of expended money , I found I still had too many possessions .
( A smaller home means fewer possessions , which means less to clean and take care of !
I established the rule that I had to be able to see all three walls of any cupboard or closet to avoid clutter or unnecessary stuff . )

Simultaneously , I began to tackle the financial problems of not having a significant savings program , but having an ample amount of credit card debt .
This portion of downsizing our lives required constant attention , but I discovered some wonderful surprises that seemed so obvious in hindsight .
For example , the more time I spent in the kitchen making our meals without the aid of convenience foods , the more we skipped eating out and the less I was spending on groceries .
The more time I spent in formulating grocery lists according to what was on sale , and establishing and then using a price book , the more funds were available out of the grocery budget for using on eliminating credit card debt .
The biggest and most important life lesson I learned was that I could waste our resources by not being careful how I used them .
I found that if I minded the pennies , the dollars would take care of themselves .
I cut out all the extraneous spending I could because I wanted to make sure I did n't have to re-enter the job market again .

I established a small kitchen garden to supplement our fresh vegetable , fruit and herb needs , and loved the small brick patio and bench area we built together for free under a shade tree near the garden .
( Nothing beat enjoying an early morning cup of coffee while sitting on that bench just looking at a beautiful growing garden ! )
I realized I only needed two pair of jeans - one for everyday and a good pair .
I needed only a couple pair of shoes , one casual jacket and one dressier coat , etc .
( You find you do n't need two or three dressy evening outfits if your daily lifestyle dictates jeans and tennies ! )
I realized I did n't need magazine subscriptions or daily newspapers because with the internet and a television , I could meet my needs without unnecessary costs .
( You will love how little you then have to recycle , too ! )
I realized that I did n't need to buy coffee or soda when I was out shopping but could reward myself quite nicely with a cup of coffee at home once I was done .
I realized that if I saved daily change instead of carrying it in my purse and then spending it , I could control the amount of money dribbling out of my hands .
Each month , I would then roll the change and bank it in our savings account .
( This later translated to saving all change plus $ 1 bills for both of us and if you do n't think that does n't amount to some sizeable savings , then just try saving it for one week to see what is getting away from you ! )
I realized that if you pay yourself first into a savings account or better yet , do so through a payroll deduction direct deposit into your savings account , within six months , you will have a sizeable balance .
( You can then maximize this account to also serve as your emergency funds account , but roll over into a longer - term , more productive interest bearing account when it gets beyond what you need for an emergency fund so that your money will work for you ! )
I realized that we did n't need two vehicles if I planned my errands and " need to do " trips to coincide with weekends or times that my husband 's vehicle was available to me .
( Eliminating one vehicle also eliminates payments , fuel , licensing , taxes , etc . ! )
I realized that we were more than content to provide our own entertainment at a much less expensive cost if we availed ourselves of what was offered at a much reduced rate or even free within our own community .
( The symphony orchestra did n't fold because we were no longer dues - paying members ! )
I realized we did n't need more than one credit card , and that no credit cards should ever be carrying a balance .
I realized that paying cash for everyday expenses such as gasoline are way more frugal and cost effective than having to write out checks , expend postage , etc. , to get a credit card bill paid .
I realized that if I could contain the outflow of money on credit cards as well as daily living expenses , I could much better control how much of that money stayed in my pocket , thereby lessening expenses each month .
( Credit cards breed carelessness in me when it comes to handling money and yet cold , hard cash in my hand is likely to stay in my hand ! )
I realized we did n't need to be spending up to one thousand dollars on gifts and holiday functions each year for friends and family members , but with careful planning and an attentive eye towards sales throughout the year , we could meet those needs just as nicely at a fraction of the cost .
I realized that every bit of information I needed to acquire on a simpler , more frugal lifestyle could probably be found on the internet .
( You will be amazed at the wealth of information to be found on the internet , and how much you can learn to make a simpler , more frugal lifestyle a reality for your family .
I am not talking about an austere lifestyle - just one that is more satisfying , more fulfilling , and not necessarily based on how much money you can spend to achieve your goals . )
Through downsizing our lifestyle , we were also able for the first time to meet and then exceed the ten percent tithe .
And by reading and researching ways to get the credit card debt under control , we have finally realized that dream .
( There are numerous sites on the web for strategic debt reduction and if you have n't availed yourself of these incredibly useful and free sites , I strongly recommend it .
When you understand how important this step is and how easily it can be accomplished with today 's internet sites that formulate your " plan of attack " on debt , you will have half the battle won !
It is very possible for middle - income families to strategically reduce their debt load by thousands of dollars every year . )
Today , our lifestyle is very simple , very frugal but not stingy towards us or the things we want to do .
Our expectations of what we " need " in this life are separated out from our " wants " , and we know the difference .
We are now devoid of undue stress and compromises in our life , and we are happier than we have ever been .
We have a financial plan we can live within comfortably while meeting our expectations and know our future is as secure as we can make it .
We look forward to each new day as a gift from God to be enjoyed and counted as a blessing .
And I personally would do it all over again in a heartbeat for the benefits we have received from this adventure !

In his best John McCain imitation , disgraced former House Speaker , FOX News analyst and potential GOP presidential candidate Newt Gingrich went on ABC's This Week morning to talk about the Virginia Tech massacre .
Gingrich , like many far - right conservatives , suggested that the solution to massacres like Virginia Tech is to have all the students and their teachers packing heat .
Apparently having 30 ( or 300 , depending on the lecture ) hormone - drenched kids , with next to no experience aiming a gun , firing weapons at each other simultaneously , and during a high - stakes emotional crises , in class is a good thing .
Then again , watch the clip below and you 'll see how Gingrich first says that the fact that VA Tech is a " gun- free zone " led to the mass death because students and teachers could n't take each other out with their concealed weapons .
But then , oddly , and very McCain like , at the end of the clip note how Gingrich does a 180 and says it would be okay for schools to make themselves gun-free zones .
Uh , so the problem is that schools are gun-free zones and Gingrich 's solution is to pass laws letting schools be gun-free zones .
Methinks someone is still trying to convince the soccer moms that he's not the far - right extremist he really is .
But to so blatantly contradict himself in the same sentence - perhaps I should be comparing Gingrich not to McCain but to Mitt " I was for gays , gun control , abortion , and the environment before I was against them " Romney .
Embarrassment can be hard to live down
By Sean Coughlan
Embarrassment has its own painful , cringe - making place in everyone 's memory .
Who has n't felt that agonising spasm of acute embarrassment ?
Even years later , the awfulness can linger .
Even watching complete strangers on television embarrassing themselves can fill the room with that uncomfortable , toe - curling sensation .
Author and broadcaster Brian King has attempted to get below the blushing skin and examine how the malign lightning bolt of embarrassment can suddenly leave us feeling exposed and ridiculous .
Paul Merton enjoys Angus Deayton 's embarrassment
There are lots of grimly enjoyable stories , not just the usual round of doomed job interviews and sexual disasters .
Embarrassment can be more subtle .
The Shakespearean actor and Star Trek star , Patrick Stewart , recalls a time he was watching television alone in a hotel room and stumbled upon an episode of Next Generation which he barely remembered having filmed .
" I had forgotten that I 'd ordered room service , " he says .
" The man arrived with my order .
He looked at the television and looked at me with such pity . "
That 's the comic timing of embarrassment , in a split second it can turn even a movie star into a lonely loser poring over past glories .
Feel for others
It 's not an emotion like guilt or regret , because no harm is intended to others .
If you get drunk at an office party and insult someone , you might feel guilty .
But if you tell them that you love them , that 's when you feel embarrassed .
A prerequisite for embarrassment is to be able to feel how others feel - you have to be empathetic
Professor Ray Crozier
" German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder , attending a solemn ceremony at Jerusalem 's Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial , was invited to turn a handle to boost the eternal flame commemorating the death of millions of Jews during the Holocaust .
" To the acute embarrassment of everyone present , the chancellor turned the handle in the wrong direction and extinguished the flame . "
The common thread in embarrassment is the sudden puncturing of our attempts to look competent , whether it's in the boardroom or the bedroom .
" We have this fundamental human need to be respected and not to look foolish , " King says .
And losing self - esteem " can feel like the world has ended " .
An example of such a raw nerve involves bedding and someone who , even years later , does n't want to be identified .
A young man from a modest home , he had grown up using blankets and sheets , and had never had a duvet .
When he arrived at university and was faced with an unfamiliar duvet cover , he had clambered inside each night , sleeping - bag style , doing up the buttons under his chin .
All was well until his first girlfriend came to visit - it was she who had to break the news about the correct bed covering technique to him .
Why blush ?
Embarrassment is about social situations , but it also has physical symptoms - such as blushing .
It is a uniquely human response , common to all cultures as a sign of sudden social awkwardness .
Ray Crozier , professor of psychology at the University of East Anglia , has researched the psychology of embarrassment and is author of Blushing and the Social Emotions .
Flintoff explains his embarrassment after the pedalo incident
The function of blushing , in evolutionary terms , could once have been to signal that someone had made an accidental mistake , admitting to an error and so avoiding a confrontation .
But there are people who are so self - conscious about blushing they have operations to prevent it , cutting the nerve that creates the blush .
Instead of feeling awkward about being easily embarrassed , Professor Crozier says it 's a sign of greater emotional intelligence .
" A prerequisite for embarrassment is to be able to feel how others feel - you have to be empathetic , intelligent to the social situation , " he says .
Social anxieties
Embarrassment is a way of making us adhere to social codes so that we do n't insult our friends , reveal our basic instincts or show too much of our private emotions .
People who are unembarrassable are likely to be poor at reading social situations .
So while everyone else cringes , they plough on , unable to pick up the sensitivities of the situation .
Embarrassment is a comedy staple
And the car - crash moment when it happens is like a " little death " - everything seems to stop , time seems to stand still and we talk about being " frozen " or " dying of embarrassment " or being " mortified " .
But what do we do when it happens , and how best to recover ?
" The best way to deal with embarrassment is to talk about it , " says workplace psychologist Gary Fitzgibbon .
" If you skulk off , you 're left with it .
You must n't let the embarrassment dominate . "
Once you admit to what 's happened and talk about it , everyone will feel much more relaxed and they 'll be laughing with you rather than at you .
As a way of developing social skills , one therapy he has used is to get people to talk in a group about their own worst embarrassing moments , helping them to face down their social anxieties .
Or else there 's the white lie .
But this can add to the confusion , as Bill Bryson found after he stumbled into his parents ' bedroom at just the wrong moment .
" To my surprise , the shades were drawn and my parents were in bed wrestling under the sheets .
More astonishingly still , my mother was winning .
My father was obviously in some distress .
He was making a noise like a small trapped animal .
" ' What are you doing ? ' I asked .
' Ah , Billy , your mother is just checking my teeth , ' my father replied .
I believe you are supposed to be traumatised by these things .
I can't remember being troubled at all , though it was some years before I let my mother look in my mouth again . "
I think my most embarrassing moment must be the time while working in an upmarket cosmetics shop , I overheard a co-worker talking to a customer about her husband 's love of golf .
Having earlier listened to 45 minutes on the subject , I decided to save the poor customer and cut in with " God , why do people play golf ?
Do n't they have a life or a job ? " ... only for my co-worker to say " this is Colin Montgomerie , world - class golfer and multi-millionaire . "
My reply was " I 'm going out to the stockroom to beat myself to death with a bottle of shower gel . "
Unsurprisingly I never lived it down at that job !

It was my first day in a new high school in a new state and I was trying to blend in , not be too noticible as a ' newbie ' .
I was not used to stairs in a school and was walking down with the rest of the students and I missed a step and fell most of the way down before catching a side bar and swinging around and back to upright .
I can't imagine the color of my face .
So much for first impressions !
I felt like the future was already lost .
I marched on like nothing but obviously since I bring it up 35 years later it must have been pretty embarrassing .

Would love to know where I can get that nerve - cutting operation from .
My Doctor had prescribed me Betablockers and , when they did n't work , refered me to a psychologist but neither has stopped the blushing ( did n't help that the psychologist was a hottie ! )
Hope the operation is available on the NHS !!

Aged 18 , I had a bar job in a working men's club .
One evening , I served an elderly lady , who had come out without putting her false teeth in .
She fizzed and spluttered as I strove to understand her order .
After she 'd gone , I turned to the bar manager working beside me , and launched into a tirade , saying how disgusting and repulsive it was that people did n't wear their false teeth like they 're supposed to .
Halfway through , I noticed him looking at me strangely , eyes widening .
Time began to slow down , as with a growing horror , I found my eyes were drawn to his mouth , for the first time seeing beyond his bushy moustache , and very very slowly it began to dawn on me something that , in the six months or so I 'd worked there , I 'd never noticed before ... yes , you guessed it .

Freshly arrived in NYC , jetlagged and slightly worse for wear I went to bed ( naked ) in my hot , non airconditioned hotel room .
Woke up at an ungodly hour , stumbled into what I thought was the bathroom , and as the automatic door clicked shut behind me I realised I 'm standing naked in a brighly lit corridor .
Instantly sober and wide awake , took elevator to ground floor , walked to reception manhood in hand and asked for replacement key .
The girl at reception had real trouble keeping a straight face .
I 've heard the same happening to others .

She had to be attended to by members of the St. John 's Ambulance .

Lecture - hall cartoon depictions aside , the nucleus is not a balloon .
Rather , its architecture is defined by a specialized cytoskeleton ( the nuclear lamina ) consisting of proteins known as lamins .
These proteins give structure to the nuclear envelope during interphase ; during cell division , a complex dance of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation causes them to disassemble ( allowing for chromosome segregation into the daughter nuclei ) and then reassemble following cytokinesis .
Derangement of the lamina might be expected to cause serious trouble for the cell .
Indeed , an extensive body of work over the past 5 years has clearly demonstrated that a particular mutation in the lamin A gene ( LMNA ) results in severe nuclear malformation .
In humans , this mutation gives rise to a devastating disease , Hutchinson - Gilford progeria syndrome ( HGPS ) .
( For earlier articles on HGPS , see here and here ) .
Two new papers , published back - to - back in the most recent issue of PNAS , describe the impact of the HGPS lamin A mutant protein ( also called “ progerin ” ) on progression of the cell cycle and the results of mitosis .
Dechat et al. find that progerin perturbs the cell cycle at multiple stages , both at entry into S phase and progression into M .
The mechanisms are related :
An uncleaved farnesylated moiety causes progerin to tightly associate with membranes , drastically changing its solubility profile and distribution ; the mutant therefore interferes both with nuclear disassembly ( during M , prior to chromosome segregation ) and reassembly ( after G1 , before DNA synthesis begins ) .
Alterations in mitosis and cell cycle progression caused by a mutant lamin A known to accelerate human aging Mutations in the gene encoding nuclear lamin A ( LA ) cause the premature aging disease Hutchinson –Gilford Progeria Syndrome .
The most common of these mutations results in the expression of a mutant LA , with a 50 - aa deletion within its C terminus .
In this study , we demonstrate that this deletion leads to a stable farnesylation and carboxymethylation of the mutant LA ( LAΔ50 / progerin ) .
These modifications cause an abnormal association of LAΔ50 / progerin with membranes during mitosis , which delays the onset and progression of cytokinesis .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that the targeting of nuclear envelope / lamina components into daughter cell nuclei in early G1 is impaired in cells expressing LAΔ50 / progerin .
The mutant LA also appears to be responsible for defects in the retinoblastoma protein - mediated transition into S - phase , most likely by inhibiting the hyperphosphorylation of retinoblastoma protein by cyclin D1 / cdk4 .
These results provide insights into the mechanisms responsible for premature aging and also shed light on the role of lamins in the normal process of human aging .
Cao et al. demonstrate that the mutant protein forms aggregates during mitosis ( at a time when the wildtype lamin is happily soluble , waiting for the nuclear envelope to coalesce after cytokineses ) .
As a result , both chromosome segregation and separation of the daughter nuclei is aberrant , and binucleated cells frequently form .
A lamin A protein isoform overexpressed in Hutchinson –Gilford progeria syndrome interferes with mitosis in progeria and normal cells Hutchinson –Gilford progeria syndrome ( HGPS ) is a rare genetic disorder characterized by dramatic premature aging .
Classic HGPS is caused by a de novo point mutation in exon 11 ( residue 1824 , C -> T ) of the LMNA gene , activating a cryptic splice donor and resulting in a mutant lamin A ( LA ) protein termed “ progerin / LAΔ50 ” that lacks the normal cleavage site to remove a C - terminal farnesyl group .
During interphase , irreversibly farnesylated progerin / LAΔ50 anchors to the nuclear membrane and causes characteristic nuclear blebbing .
Progerin / LAΔ50 ’s localization and behavior during mitosis , however , are completely unknown .
Here , we report that progerin / LAΔ50 mislocalizes into insoluble cytoplasmic aggregates and membranes during mitosis and causes abnormal chromosome segregation and binucleation .
These phenotypes are largely rescued with either farnesyltransferase inhibitors or a farnesylation - incompetent mutant progerin / LAΔ50 .
Furthermore , we demonstrate that small amounts of progerin / LAΔ50 exist in normal fibroblasts , and a significant percentage of these progerin / LAΔ50 - expressing normal cells are binucleated , implicating progerin / LAΔ50 as causing similar mitotic defects in the normal aging process .
Our findings present evidence of mitotic abnormality in HGPS and may shed light on the general phenomenon of aging .
In the penultimate sentence of that abstract lies our connection to normal aging .
Progerin is generated at some rate in normal cells ( probably because the splice site ablated in the mutant is not 100 % efficient ) , and when it accumulates to a detectable level , the same cell cycle interference and mitotic failures seen in HGPS can occur in an otherwise normal cell .
If the binucleated progeny of these cell divisions escape apoptosis , they will presumably undergo some type of permanent cell cycle arrest ( e.g. senescence ) , and persist in the tissue — unable to divide further , but certainly available to cause damage to their microenvironment and contribute to age - related decline in tissue function .
The distribution of progerin expression is n’t smooth :
There ’s a small population of highly progerin - positive cells , and almost no detectable expression in the vast majority of cells ( see their Figure 5 ) .
If progerin expression is a truly sporadic event , one would expect to see more intermediate cases .
The presence of a few very bright cells against a dark background suggests that there might be some sort of positive feedback at play : Could expression of progerin result in expression of even more expression , perhaps by interference with mRNA splicing ?
THE BUSH - CHENEY OIL WAR Administration Plans to Steal Iraqi Oil For Mega - Rich Revealed for First Time By Richard Walker
Iraqi oil workers are waking up to the fact that a proposed hydrocarbon law the Bush administration wants the Iraqi Parliament to pass will effectively place the countrys massive oil reserves in the hands of big U.S. and British oil giants for decades .
Many Iraqis are only realizing now what experts have been saying since 2003 : that the invasion of Iraq was about oil and Israel , and not about Americas security .
The new law would transfer ownership of the majority of Iraqs oil from the Iraqi government and hand it to multinational oil companies linked mostly to the United States , though the British would have a slice of the action .
There would be no benchmarks establishing how much of the profits oil companies would have to share with Iraq .
The law would not pass muster in any other oil producing country in the world , especially one with the huge reserves Iraq has .
The measure was drawn up by Bearing Point , a Virginia company that received a $ 240 million contract within weeks of the Iraq invasion to work with the Iraqi oil ministry .
At that time , Ahmed Chalabi , the darling of the Washington neo-cons was heralding a new Iraq in which an American - led group of oil companies would take over and manage the countrys oil reserves .
Chalabi was not alone .
In 2004 , as L. Paul Bremer was vacating Iraq where he had been virtually its ruler , he passed the baton for economic reconstruction in particular Iraqs oil future to a former CIA source , Iyad Allawi and his close associate , Adel Abdul Mahdi .
Within months Allawi presented proposals for a new petroleum law to Iraqs Supreme Council , calling for an end to nationalization and the privatization of the oil industry .
To close observers it was clear Allawi was the puppet chosen by the United States to do its bidding in the critical area of oil .
Since then the United States has put continuous pressure on the Iraqis to privatize their oil .
A draft of the new law was shown to the Bush administration in 2006 , but the Iraqi parliament was not allowed to see it until February 2007 .
SLICK DICK CHENEY
This is no surprise to those who have closely studied the Bush Administrations bogus case for going to war and more importantly the activities of Vice President Dick Cheney , beginning with his first 10 days in office in January 2001 .
He was the number two in an administration staffed mostly by former oil company executives who understood the importance of Iraqs oil reserves .
None was better informed or better placed to plan to control those reserves than Cheney .
During week two of the Bush presidency , Cheney set up the National Energy Policy Development Group that later became known as the vice presidents  Energy Task Force . 
Cheney has since used executive privilege to hide the activities of that that group and its meetings with heads of the big energy companies in the United States .
But Freedom of Information
Act searches have provided reporters with insights into what Cheney was up to prior to and after the Sept. 11 attacks .
The group was busy drawing up lists of companies and countries that were keen to get their hands on Iraqs national resources .
The lists were entitled  Foreign Suitors for Iraqi Oil Contracts as of March 5 , 2001 . 
Cheney knew Iraq possessed oil riches .
It had enough oil for the United States to break the OPEC stranglehold on world oil prices .
Iraqs oil is high grade and easily refined .
More importantly Cheney knew it would be cheap to extract it from the ground because most of it is in shallow wells 1,400 to 2,000 feet beneath the desert floor .
In total , the reserves were reckoned to be several hundred billion barrels with at least 120 billion barrels already located .
There was enough to put Iraq in the top tier of oil producers for well into the latter half of this century .
A commentary by James A. Paul of the respected Global Policy Forum in December 2002 contained observations that were to prove prescient considering they were written before the Iraq invasion .
Paul wrote :
 Oil analysts believe a U.S. - controlled Iraqi government would quickly make deals with the companies for privatized production .
Such deals , though possibly agreed in advance of the war , would be justified by the new government on the basis that only the companies would be able to quickly resume post - war production .
. . .
In other words , Paul was saying that after an invasion the US would have enough troops on the ground to ensure that oil production was brought up to speed and that oil facilities were protected .
Paul also foresaw a takeover of Iraqs oil as a prelude to the United States putting pressure on Kuwait , Iran and Saudi Arabia to de-nationalize their oil companies and allow U.S. and UK oil giants a 50 - 50 split in the production and profits from those countries  oil .
During the planning stages for the attack on Iraq , Cheney focused on Iraqs oil .
Evidence of that can be seen in the fact that the State Department was tasked to examine ways to control Iraqs oil post invasion .
In the four months leading up to the beginning of the war , the State Departments Oil and Energy Working Group burned its own midnight oil planning for the future of Iraqs energy reserves .
The State Departments planners devised a method of privatization through what they called PSAs , or production sharing agreements .
They were , in effect , contracts whereby big oil companies would get the most profitable deals .
The Iraqi government would still have ownership but exploration and production would be in the hands of U.S. and British multinationals .
According to oil experts familiar with PSAs they are only used in relation to 10 % of worlds oil because they are weighted in favor of private companies and not in favor the nations which own the oil .
It only got better for Cheney when a month after the war began , a new Iraqi oil minister was appointed by U.S. Coalition Provisional Authority chief L. Paul Bremer .
The minister quickly announced that Iraq would tear up all previous oil contracts agreed to by Saddam , leaving the suitors  the Russians , Chinese and French out in the cold .
Bremer ran Iraq like ancient Rome , hiring and firing at will , while making sure he chose the right Iraqis to handle the oil issue .
One of his appointees , Adel Abdul Mahdi , announced at the end of 2004 that a new petroleum law would open up Iraq to foreign oil companies .
Iraqi oil workers and senior members of the Shiite majority are now beginning to realize what has been happening under their noses .
The Kurds were the first to spot the subterfuge and have threatened to block the new law , but their efforts may have come too late .
White House pressure on Nouri al - Malikis government to pass the oil privatization law has been unrelenting .
After all , oil was the prize behind the invasion , and there will be no draw down of U.S. troops until Bush and Cheney are sure Iraqs oil production and exploration are in the hands of U.S. - British oil giants .

( Issue # 31 , July 30 , 2007 )
The news came down early this month that Hugo Chavez intended to nationalize industry in Venezuela .
There have been many media glorifications of Chavez in recent times , who has been using the oil wealth of Venezuela to improve the lives of the poorest in the nation .
Many socialists think this might be their one bright point in the history of the movement .
They see Chavez as the guy who will prove that socialism can work .
But it wo n’t .
Why wo n’t it work ?
Atlas is shrugging , and the capitalists have been pulling up stakes for years .
Asked about the AES investment by a Venezuelan newspaper in May 2000 , Chavez said , “ I do not have to meddle in that , because I consider it strictly private . ”
He said the company ’s executives “ displayed a quite progressive vision . ” …
Forbes magazine at the time said the AES move was “ perplexing , ” noting that other investors were fleeing because they saw Chavez as an unpredictable , self - styled revolutionary autocrat .
Yep .
It seems that when Chavez first showed up , he told a few businessmen that their investments were safe .
Quite a few other businessmen did n’t believe him , and started pulling their investments out of the country .
Those who did believe Chavez ended up getting screwed anyway , even if it was 6 years later .
Why does this matter ?
Well , regardless of whether you ’re a capitalist or socialist , capital is necessary to expand business and expand an economy .
You can believe capital comes from people looking to make a profit by investing , or you can believe that capital comes from the desires of workers and the central planning of government .
Either way , capital is necessary .
Unfortunately , though , people who want to make a profit get very scared when someone who is advocating nationalizing industry get elected into power .
They force the socialists to put their money where their mouthes are , by removing their money from the equation and asking the government and workers to actually put that investment where it is needed .
And by pulling out their investment when the economy is nationalized , they give the socialists profits ( which used to go to investors ) with which to distribute that capital .
We ’re going to watch the real - life effects of socialism before our eyes .
External investment , faced with the understanding that property rights have now been nullified , has ceased .
But the socialists in Venezuela have ample national resources that they may be able to use to remain afloat .
If any country can show how wonderful socialism can become , it ’s probably Venezuela .
It ’s too bad — for the people of Venezuela — that it ’ll fail .
The May Day stadium has 150,000 seats and a total floor space of more than 207,000m2 .
This makes the MAY DAY Stadium the biggest stadium in the world !
It ’s a comprehensive athletic and cultural base where varieties of athletic activities can be held including football games .
The inner stadium floor area covers 25,000 m2 including 14,000 m2 of which its athletic field is artificially made and 8,300 m2 of lawn .
Vertical axis of stadium is 450 m and horizontal axis 350m .
The stadium has eight storeys and is more than 60 metres high from the ground to the roof .
The 60 metre long canopy is enough to cover the section of the stands .
The pent of the inner roof is 60 metres long and the outer roof 40 m long .
The 16 arch roofs link with one another like flower petals .
The roofs look like a large flower floating on the clear water of the Taedong , or a parachute which has just landed , so it gives the impression of a dynamic sculpture .
The stadium has 80 exits and ten lifts .
The stadium is constructed in a parachute - shape and large slantwise semicircular arched roof made of 16 semicircular spans , covering a surface area of 94,000 m2 , stretching 60 m inwards and 40 m outwards .
11,000 tons of structural steel was used in the roof construction alone .
The stadium was completed on May 1st , 1989 .
Supreme enlarged assembly was adopted in the ceiling public business of May Day Stadium .
The method won gold prize in the 16th International Invention and New Technology Exhibition held in Geneva , Switzerland in April 1988 .
The stadium has various training halls , recreation rooms , an indoor swimming pool , an ultrasonic bat , a
sauna , beds and so on , which are indispensable for the players training and convenience .
It also has
dining rooms , and a broadcasting room and telex booths .
The rubberised indoor running track is several
hundred metres long and is on the sixth floor .

To those who traffic in humans , the slaves are nothing but cargo .
Undocumented workers , lured to the United States with the promise of a better life , often end up being sold into slavery .
The traffickers take extraordinary measures to get the workers inside the United States .
Some come hidden in shipping containers , stashed under the flatbeds of pickup trucks , or packed like sardines in the trunks of cars .
Others are even rolled up in carpets .
Smugglers and those who traffic slaves prey on the desperate .
" It 's almost always based upon a vulnerability .
Poverty , despair , poor education , little prospects , " said Wan Kim , the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department 's Civil Rights Division .
" Again , everyone trying to reach for the brass ring -- and that is America for many people across the world , " Kim continued .
" And so when they get a hope of an opportunity to do something significant , to make a life for themselves , in many cases to help bring money back to the family that they 're leaving behind -- they jump on it , and they 're lead by deceit to come to America and then all the promises are broken . "
The Global Trafficking Trade in the U.S .
In an effort to crack down on smugglers , the Justice Department has set up 42 task forces nationwide to work with state and local officials .
From 2001 to 2006 the department prosecuted 360 people for human trafficking and modern day slavery -- a 300 percent increase over the previous six years .
To date the government has helped more than 1,000 victims from 72 countries escape the multibillion dollar smuggling industry that fuels modern day slavery .
The numbers are staggering .
Government estimates say 800,000 people are bought , sold and smuggled worldwide annually .
As many as 18,000 of them make their way to the United States from all corners of the world from at least 72 countries , including Cameroon , Egypt , Indonesia and Korea .
Dozens of smuggling rings identified by the government traffic people in the United States , part of what is now a multibillion dollar black market industry .
' Lucrative Underground Activity '
Kim noted , " This may be the second or third most lucrative underground activity in the world . "
" If you think about the typical underground illegal activity -- selling guns , selling illegal drugs -- once you sell the contraband , it 's gone .
You get the money and then you go find some more contraband to sell .
Selling a human being is something that can be done over and over and over again .
A woman forced into prostitution can generate thousands of dollars per night . "
In 2005 , the government convicted members of the Carreto smuggling cartel of promising scores of poor women from Mexico marriage and a chance for a better life in America , only to force them into sexual slavery in Queens and Brooklyn , N.Y .
The women -- some forced to work in a filthy brothel -- were told to charge johns $ 25 to $ 35 , of which they did n't see a penny .
They were also beaten to keep them under control , and their movements were restricted .
" This kind of modern day slavery is hard to imagine in the United States .
I think these cases are so painful to see , and it's often hard even for the victims to recognize that they are victims , " said Julie Myers , assistant Homeland Security secretary in charge of Immigration and Customs Enforcement or ICE .
" It 's disgusting , " Myers said .
" These organizations are run by some of the very worst criminals in our society .
They treat human beings as cargo , as commodities to prey upon for a simple profit . "
Working From Sunup to Sundown
Some victims become slaves because they are too poor to pay their smuggling transport fee .
Seven years ago Jose Martinez , formerly of Mexico , was toiling in a Florida slave camp 's tomato fields from dusk to dawn .
He told ABC News a smuggler sold him for $ 350 .
Each night Martinez 's captors locked him in a trailer with 28 other workers .
He was under constant watch , and under threat of violence .
He finally ran away after four months of captivity .
In a similar Florida slavery case , Ramiro Ramos and his brother Juan were sentenced to 15 years in prison in 2004 for enslaving farm workers who worked from sunup until sundown .
Hundreds of undocumented workers have been warned they would be shot if they tried to leave .
" They had been told that if you try and leave , you 'll be fed to the alligators .
They heard that people had been beaten , " said Laura Germino , coordinator of the Anti-Slavery Campaign for Immokalee Workers , a nonprofit worker support group .
" You are supposed to be able to go to a place with wages and good working conditions .
In this situation , people had no freedom of movement due to the extreme atmosphere of coercion , of violence , of fear that they were going to be killed , " she said .
The traffickers use not only violence to control slaves , but also the threat of deportation and arrest .
Undocumented workers are often told they will be sent to prison and face even worse conditions .
Melanie Orhant , managing attorney of Break the Chain , a resource group for enslaved persons , said " the psychological coercion is a very large factor . "
" Physical coercion , rapes , beatings , sexual assault , locking people in closets , definitely happens , " Orhant said , " but the primary tool , one of the first tools that they use is psychological coercion , isolating people , scaring people and putting major fear in people . "
So the victims stay hidden .
Signs of Slavery
" I think that one of the things that is very , very important to convey to Americans is that this is a problem that exists in local communities and it's a problem of recognition and awareness , " said the Justice Department 's Kim .
" It could be happening in your neighborhood and if the human traffickers are doing a good job , no one knows about it because it's an underground crime .
If they 're doing their jobs well , the victims are so scared , so subjugated , so victimized that they will not reach out for help , " he added .
Authorities and support groups say to watch out for signs that could indicate a person is being enslaved : children who do not go to school , adults who appear to be servants , working in and around homes , but who never leave or talk with neighbors .
Officials are asking the public to be more aware .
Terrified victims often need a helping hand to free them from suffering in the shadows .
Pierre Thomas ' series " Slavery in America : Living in the Shadows " continues Tuesday on " World News With Charles Gibson " and ABCNEWS.com .

NEUTRAL EVOLUTION HAS HELPED SHAPE OUR GENOME
Johns
Hopkins researchers have added to the growing mound of evidence that many of the genetic bits and pieces that drive evolutionary changes do not confer any advantages or disadvantages to humans or other animals .
" For a long time , the basic belief of evolution was that all random genetic changes that manage to stick around have some selective advantage , " says Nicholas Katsanis , Ph.D. , Associate Professor at Hopkins ’ Institute of Genetic Medicine .
" But our work adds to the case that frequently , we are what we are largely due to random changes that are completely neutral . "
" I am not at all discounting the role of natural selection , the persistence of genetic changes that confer some advantage , " Katsanis adds , " because it has been instrumental .
What this study does is to reinforce and highlight the equal , and in some cases greater , importance of neutral genetic drift . "
Describing their contributions to genetic drift online in PLoS Genetics , Katsanis says the Hopkins experiments demonstrate that one of the major architectural markers of the human genome , DNA repeat elements that make up over 40 percent of our genome , rose to prominence without offering any benefits to the organism it inhabits .
Repeat elements are fragments of DNA containing the same repetitive sequence of chemical base pairs several hundred times .
Katsanis and his team first stumbled onto one type of repeat element while looking at genes associated with Bardet Biedl syndrome , a rare disorder of substantial interest to the lab .
While hunting for new genes , they found portions of DNA that had been copied from the mitochondria , the energy - making apparatus of human cells that has its own small genome .
These mitochondrial sequences are known as numts .
When they expanded their study across the whole human genome , they found more than 1200 such pieces of mitochondrial DNA of various lengths embedded into chromosomes .
While chimps have a comparable number , mice and rats only have around 600 numts .
Since they increase in frequency as species advance , it suggested there was some evolutionary purpose to keeping them around .
Strikingly , however , none of these numts contained the blueprint ( an actual gene ) to make a protein that does anything , nor did they seem to control the function of any nearby genes .
" At best , it seems numts are a neutral part of our genome , " says Katsanis .
" If anything , they may be mildly negative since long repeat sequences can be unstable or get inserted inside genes and disrupt them . "
The researchers believe they have uncovered a possible reason why these potentially damaging but mostly neutral bits of DNA accumulate over time by comparing the sequences of human numts with those in different animals .
How closely the different species ’ sequences match can provide an estimate of when that particular sequence got inserted into the ancestor of the human genome .
Their calculations revealed that most numts became embedded in our genome over a 10 - million - year period centered roughly 54 million years ago - right around the time when the first primates emerged .
" When new species emerge , their numbers and therefore their genetic differences are very small , " Katsanis notes .
" This creates a genetic bottleneck during which any changes in the genome will either get eliminated quickly or spread to the whole population quickly . "
Katsanis proposes that numts , being " neutral , " were generally at low levels in ancient mammals , but during the primate emergence 54 million years ago , they accumulated and spread through the small early primate populations precisely because they were not detrimental enough to be eliminated .
Then , as these populations expanded , numts reached stable but higher frequencies .
The research was funded by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development , the National Institute of Diabetes , Digestive and Kidney Disorders , and the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

Senator John McCain ( R - Delusion ) simply has no credibility left on defense or foreign policy issues .
I understand that he was , at one point , a reasonable person and a man of reported integrity , someone who could work with groups and individuals on both sides of the aisle .
That time has passed .
The Senator said yesterday , regarding Iraq , " The consequences of failure are catastrophic because if we come home , bin Laden and Zarqawi , they are going to follow us . "
Um , Senator . . . Zarqawi is dead .
Not only is he dead , but the Senator used his death , which occurred nearly ten months ago , to smear those who advocated redeployment : " [ Zarqawi's death ] has got to be viewed as a success , " he said .
" It 's got to be viewed as perhaps a bit of a rebuke against those who are advocating that we cut and run out of Iraq . "
Almost a year later , with no improvement and tens of thousands more dead and wounded , McCain is saying the same things .
Yesterday he claimed that General Petraeus , the commander of all U.S. troops in Iraq , " goes out there almost every day in an unarmed humvee . "
This is , of course , absolutely ridiculous .
As CNN 's Michael Ware reports , " certainly the general travels in [ an up - armored ] humvee .
There ’s multiple humvees around it , heavily armed .
There ’s attack helicopters , predator drones , sniper teams , all sorts of layers of protection .
So , no , Sen .
McCain is way off base on this one . "
The only hope for McCain and his war is to confuse and mislead the American public to the extent that they no longer understand the reality of the situation .
It would be sad if it was n't so pernicious .
Between the ghost of Zarqawi following us home and our super General traveling with no defenses in the peaceful neighborhoods of Baghdad , it 's increasingly clear that McCain is unfit for any public office , let alone the presidency .
They were taken from a factory on the Sittingbourne Industrial Park last Monday , 7 May , after thieves made a hole in its metal and asbestos wall .
The ingots - which are highly dangerous if heated - were stacked next to a wall in a cellophane shrink - wrapped bale .
They measure about 2ft by 4in by 2in and look like aluminium , which is why police think they were taken .
Large vehicle
Officers said half of them had a brown and white painted edge , while the others had a green painted edge .
They all had the word MEL in raised lettering on the top face .
It is believed a large vehicle would have been needed to carry them all .

A plaintiff in a federal lawsuit against Pat Robertson says the televangelist threatened his life and that of his family at a legal proceeding Wednesday in the Norfolk federal courthouse .
The accuser , Phillip Busch , is suing Robertson for misappropriation of his image in the promotion of Robertson ’s protein diet shake .
According to a complaint Busch filed with the Norfolk police , Robertson entered a room in the courthouse Wednesday afternoon to be questioned for a deposition – an out - of - court form of testimony – and told Busch : “ I am going to kill you and your family . ”
Robertson ’s attorney , Glen Huff , denied the allegation Thursday , saying : “ There was no such threat . ”

Copyleft activists target G8 summit ... and Bono ?
Germany is getting ready for a very special spectacle this weekend .
16.000 cops , 1100 soldiers , numerous bodyguards and secret service agents and a barb wired fence that is seven miles long and eight feet high are supposed to make sure that the attendees of the G8 summit wo n't notice 100.000 expected demonstrators and their demands regarding climate change , fair trade and similiar issues .
This means that the odds of the copyleft activists who plan to attend the protests are n't too good .
A German organization called Netzwerk Freies Wissen ( network free knowledge ) nevertheless published a declaration demanding " better development and just access to knowledge " this week .
It states : Sharing is better than control .
That sounds like something P2P activists should support , right ?
Well , if it only was that easy .
Some file sharing friends apparently think that the declaration is too tame .
Their vision just got published on the German Indymedia website Speaking of redistribution :
The anonymous activists also published a list of links to Torrents of artists that will participate in an Anti-G8 concert next week .
The slogan of the virtual street fighters : " Bootleg Bono , sink capitalism ! "

Starbucks e-mailed the offer to employees in the south - eastern US
Starbucks pulled the free drink offer , saying it had been redistributed beyond its original intent .
The woman 's lawyer says $ 114 m equals the cost of drinks for all those turned away when the company decided to cancel its offer .
He hopes millions of other disappointed customers will join the legal effort .
The company originally e-mailed the offer to employees in the south - east of the US , with instructions to forward it to family and friends .
Like many popular things on the internet , the e-mail quickly got out of control , being forwarded to perhaps millions of people around the country and posted on websites .
When Starbucks realised how many people were coming in for their free drink , it rescinded the offer .
But one customer in New York city felt so betrayed she approached a lawyer .
He is accusing the company of fraud and is requesting class - action status for the lawsuit , hoping to sign - up countless others around the country who also missed out on their free drink .
Legal experts do not think the case has much chance of winning .

Ethanol as a fuel offers a host of potential benefits , according to its supporters .
It can be grown and refined primarily in the U.S. , whether made from corn , switchgrass or cellulose .
It is already being used as a fuel additive — to help gasoline burn more completely and , thus , cut down on air pollution .
And , because it is made from plants that pull carbon dioxide from the air , it does not add additional greenhouse gases to the atmosphere , which are driving climate change .
But a new study shows that it will not help clear the nation 's skies of smog ; on the contrary , it could increase the levels of that dangerous pollution .
Environmental engineer Mark Jacobson of Stanford University used a computer model to assess how the air pollution in the U.S. would react if vehicles remained primarily fueled by gasoline in 2020 or if the fleet transferred to a fuel that was a blend of 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline , so - called E85 .
Under the latter scenario , levels of the cancer - causing agents benzene and butadiene dropped , whereas those of formaldehyde and acetaldehyde rose :
In other words , it was a wash .
Because burning ethanol can potentially add more smog - forming pollution to the atmosphere , however , it can also exacerbate the ill effects of such air pollution .
According to Jacobson , burning ethanol adds 22 percent more hydrocarbons to the atmosphere than does burning gasoline and this would lead to a nearly two parts per billion increase in tropospheric ozone .
This surface ozone , which has been linked to inflamed lungs , impaired immune systems and heart disease by prior research , would in turn lead to a 4 percent increase in the number of ground level ozone - related deaths , or roughly 200 extra deaths a year .
" Due to its ozone effects , future E85 may be a greater overall public health risk than gasoline , " Jacobson writes in the study published in Environmental Science & Technology .
" It can be concluded with confidence only that E85 is unlikely to improve air quality over future gasoline vehicles . "
But estimates of the nitrogen oxides and unburned hydrocarbons released by ethanol combustion vary , according to Tim Gerlach , vice president of clean fuels and vehicle technologies at the American Lung Association of the Upper Midwest in St. Paul , Minn .
" We ran a couple of vehicles in multiple dynometer runs and measured tailpipe emissions , " he says .
" [ E85 ] compared very favorably to a low - sulfur , low - benzene , oxygenated gasoline . "
Specifically , burning E85 resulted in fewer ozone - forming compounds than gasoline .
And E85 's benefits as far as combating global warming outweigh any impact in ozone pollution .
" We need to have an orderly , sustained implementation of low - carbon fuels and a smooth transition to a low - carbon world , " says Roland Hwang , vehicles policy director at the Natural Resources Defense Council , an environmental group .
" E85 is a part of the solution to global warming . "
As a result of his ethanol finding , Stanford 's Jacobson suggests that electric vehicles , such as hybrids that plug into the existing electrical grid or hydrogen fuel cell cars might prove a better solution to future vehicle energy needs from an environmental perspective .
" We have n't reviewed the study here , " says Julie Ruggiero , a spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Energy , which is currently pursuing ethanol research as part of President Bush 's plans to increase its use as an alternative fuel .
" Ethanol is just one part of a broader renewable portfolio . "
Ethanol advocates agree .
" Ethanol is not the silver bullet , " says Matt Hartwig , a spokesperson for the Renewable Fuels Association , an industry group .
" It 's a very important tool in the toolbox to address energy security and to address the issues around global warming and the environment .
But it 's not the only answer . "
And Jacobson 's study may have revealed one of the downsides to this alternative fuel .
The main problem with sex in long term relationships is that the initial spark tends to disappear .
When you two first met , everything was new and exciting .
You did n't know each other 's bodies , you did n't know each other 's desires , and you did n't know exactly what your sex was going to be like .
Now that you 've been together for a while , you know all of those things .
And since variety is the spice of life , your sex life has dwindled from jalapeno hot to pepperoni mild .
Fortunately , you can easily spice up your sex life with a few simple tricks .
Here are ten ideas to get you started .
If you have been seeing your lover for a while , chances are that you 've gotten into a routine .
You probably have the same kind of sex , on the same kind of days , at the same kind of time , in the same kind of place .
While this routine may be comfortable , it 's certainly not sexy .
Surprise your lover one night and try to have sex in a random way , on a random day , at a random time , in a random place .
Just by breaking out of your routine , you will be able to rekindle some of the fire that you lost when your sex life became mundane .
Bush using Bin Laden scare tactics again May 23 , 2007 New London , Connecticut - President Bush tried to use declassified intelligence about Osama bin Laden Wednesday to defend his administration 's failed Iraq war policy .
" Here in America , we are living in the eye of a storm , " he claimed .
" All around us , dangerous winds are swirling and these winds could reach our shores at any moment . "
During a commencement address at the Coast Guard Academy , the president mentioned declassified intelligence that said bin Laden discussed sending a top lieutenant in 2005 to use Iraq as a base from which to launch attacks in the United States .
" Some question whether the fight in Iraq is part of the war on terror , " Bush said before describing the plot .
" There 's a reason bin Laden sent one of his most experienced paramilitary leaders to Iraq , " Bush said .
" He believes that if al Qaeda can drive us out they can establish Iraq as a new terrorist sanctuary . "
Bush added that " the best way to protect our people is to take the fight to the enemy ... so we do not have to face them at home . "
Bush also said authorities have uncovered and halted a number of planned terrorist attacks on the United States before they were carried out .
Seven months ago , a plot broken up by British authorities to blow up airplanes as they were flying toward the United States was broken up " just two or three weeks away from execution , " Bush said , citing " our intelligence community " as the source of his information .
" If carried out , it could have rivaled 9/11 in death and destruction , " he said .
Bush added that , in December 2001 , an al Qaeda operative was captured .
The U.S. intelligence community believes he had been trained at an al Qaeda camp in Afghanistan and had been sent to the United States before September 11 " to serve as a sleeper agent ready for follow - on attacks , " Bush said .
The U.S. intelligence community believes that the man had met with bin Laden " and offered himself up as a martyr , " Bush said .
Among the potential targets discussed were water reservoirs and U.S. military academies , Bush said .
The president cited two other post - 9/11 aviation plots , one allegedly devised by 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed " to repeat 9/11 destruction by sending operatives to hijack an airplane and fly into the tallest building on the West Coast . "
Bush said Mohammed has said the target was the Library Tower in Los Angeles .
Finally , another East Coast aviation attack plot was uncovered and halted in 2003 , Bush said .
It would have included " multiple airplanes that had been hijacked and crashed into targets in the United States , " he said .
Bush credited " bold action at home and abroad " with foiling the plans .
The address coincided with an ongoing push by the Democratic majority in Congress to force an end to U.S. involvement in Iraq .
On Tuesday , White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said bin Laden and a top lieutenant -- Abu Faraj al - Libbi -- planned to form a terror cell in Iraq in order to launch those attacks , Johndroe said .
Al - Libbi was a " senior al Qaeda manager " who in 2005 suggested to bin Laden that bin Laden send Egyptian - born Hamza Rabia to Iraq to help plan attacks on American soil , Johndroe said .
Johndroe noted that bin Laden later suggested to Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , then leader of al Qaeda in Iraq , that America should be his top priority .
That was followed in the spring of 2005 with bin Laden 's ordering Rabia to brief al - Zarqawi on plans to attack the United States , Johndroe said .
Johndroe added the intelligence indicates al - Libbi later suggested Rabia should be sent to Iraq to carry out those operations .
But al - Libbi was captured in Pakistan and taken into CIA custody in May 2005 .
After al - Libbi's capture , the CIA 's former acting director , John McLaughlin , described him as bin Laden 's chief operating officer , the No. 3 man in al Qaeda .
" Catching terrorists is sometimes like trying to solve a jigsaw puzzle without seeing the picture on the box , " McLaughlin said at the time .
" This is a guy who knows the picture on the box .
He knows what the big picture is . "
Al - Libbi is a Libyan who joined al Qaeda in the 1990s and fled to Pakistan after the United States invaded Afghanistan in late 2001 .
U.S. officials say al - Libbi was in contact with and directing alleged al Qaeda members in the United Kingdom who were planning attacks there and in the United States .
He was also believed to be behind two 2005 attempts to assassinate Pakistan 's President Pervez Musharraf .
Rabia took over al - Libbi 's position in the organization but was killed in in the North Waziristan tribal area of Pakistan near the Afghan border in December 2005 .
Jordanian - born al - Zarqawi was killed by a U.S. airstrike north of Baghdad in June 2006 .

We all know someone who ’s intelligent , but who occasionally defends obviously bad ideas .
Why does this happen ?
How can smart people take up positions that defy any reasonable logic ?
Having spent many years working with smart people I ’ve cataloged many of the ways this happens , and I have advice on what to do about it .
I feel qualified to write this essay as I ’m a recovering smart person myself and I ’ve defended several very bad ideas .
So if nothing else this essay serves as a kind of personal therapy session .
However , I fully suspect you ’ll get more than just entertainment value ( “ Look , Scott is more stupid than we thought ! ” ) out of what I have to say on this topic .
Success at defending bad ideas
I ’m not entirely proud to admit that I have a degree in Logic and Computation from Carnegie Mellon University .
Majoring in logic is not the kind of thing that makes people want to talk to you at parties , or read your essays .
But one thing I did learn after years of studying advanced logic theory is that proficiency in argument can easily be used to overpower others , even when you are dead wrong .
If you learn a few tricks of logic and debate , you can refute the obvious , and defend the ridiculous .
If the people you ’re arguing with are n’t as comfortable in the tactics of argument , or are n’t as arrogant as you are , they may even give in and agree with you .
The problem with smart people is that they like to be right and sometimes will defend ideas to the death rather than admit they ’re wrong .
This is bad .
Worse , if they got away with it when they were young ( say , because they were smarter than their parents , their friends , and their parent ’s friends ) they ’ve probably built an ego around being right , and will therefore defend their perfect record of invented righteousness to the death .
Smart people often fall into the trap of preferring to be right even if it ’s based in delusion , or results in them , or their loved ones , becoming miserable .
( Somewhere in your town there is a row of graves at the cemetery , called smartypants lane , filled with people who were buried at poorly attended funerals , whose headstones say “ Well , at least I was right . ” )
Until they come face to face with someone who is tenacious enough to dissect their logic , and resilient enough to endure the thinly veiled intellectual abuse they dish out during debate ( e.g .
“ You do n’t really think that do you ? ” or “ Well if you knew the < insert obscure reference here > rule / law / corollary you would n’t say such things ” ) , they ’re never forced to question their ability to defend bad ideas .
Opportunities for this are rare : a new boss , a new co-worker , a new spouse .
But if their obsessiveness about being right is strong enough , they ’ll reject those people out of hand before they question their own biases and self - manipulations .
It can be easier for smart people who have a habit of defending bad ideas to change jobs , spouses , or cities rather than honestly examine what is at the core of their psyche ( and often , their misery ) .
Short of obtaining a degree in logic , or studying the nuances of debate , remember this one simple rule for defusing those who are skilled at defending bad ideas :
Simply because they cannot be proven wrong , does not make them right .
Most of the tricks of logic and debate refute questions and attacks , but fail to establish any true justification for a given idea .
For example , just because you ca n’t prove that I ’m not the king of France reincarnated does n’t make it so .
So when someone tells you “ My plan A is the best because no one has explained how it will fail ” know that there is a logical gap in this argument .
Simply because no one has described how it will fail , does n’t necessarily make it the best plan .
It ’s possible than plans B , C , D and E all have the same quality , or that the reason no one has described how A will fail is that no one has had more than 30 seconds to scrutinize the plan .
As we ’ll discuss later , diffusing bad thinking requires someone ( probably you ) to construct a healthier framework around the bad thinking that shows it for what it is .
Death by homogeny
The second stop on our tour of commonly defended bad ideas is the seemingly friendly notion of communal thinking .
Just because everyone in the room is smart does n’t mean that collectively they will arrive at smart ideas .
The power of peer pressure is that it works on our psychology , not our intellect .
As social animals we are heavily influenced by how the people around us behave , and the quality of our own internal decision making varies widely depending on the environment we currently are in .
( e.g .
Try to write a haiku poem while standing in an elevator with 15 opera singers screaming 15 different operas , in 15 different languages , in falsetto , directly at you vs. sitting on a bench in a quiet stretch of open woods ) .
That said , the more homogeneous a group of people are in their thinking , the narrower the range of ideas that the group will openly consider .
The more open minded , creative , and courageous a group is , the wider the pool of ideas they ’ll be capable of exploring .
Some teams of people look to focus groups , consultancies , and research methods to bring in outside ideas , but this rarely improves the quality of thinking in the group itself .
Those outside ideas , however bold or original , are at the mercy of the diversity of thought within the group itself .
If the group , as a collective , is only capable of approving B level work , it does n’t matter how many A level ideas you bring to it .
Focus groups or other outside sources of information can not give a team , or its leaders , a soul .
A bland homogeneous team of people has no real opinions , because it consists of people with same backgrounds , outlooks , and experiences who will only feel comfortable discussing the safe ideas that fit into those constraints .
If you want your smart people to be as smart as possible , seek a diversity of ideas .
Find people with different experiences , opinions , backgrounds , weights , heights , races , facial hair styles , colors , past - times , favorite items of clothing , philosophies , and beliefs .
Unify them around the results you want , not the means or approaches they are expected to use .
It ’s the only way to guarantee that the best ideas from your smartest people will be received openly by the people around them .
On your own , avoid homogenous books , films , music , food , sex , media and people .
Actually experience life by going to places you do n’t usually go , spending time with people you do n’t usually spend time with .
Be in the moment and be open to it .
Until recently in human history , life was much less predictable and we were forced to encounter things not always of our own choosing .
We are capable of more interesting and creative lives than our modern cultures often provide for us .
If you go out of your way to find diverse experiences it will become impossible for you to miss ideas simply because your homogenous outlook filtered them out .
Thinking at the wrong level
At any moment on any project there are an infinite number of levels of problem solving .
Part of being a truly smart person is to know which level is the right one at a given time .
For example , if you are skidding out of control at 95 mph in your broken down Winnebago on an ice covered interstate , when a semi- truck filled with both poorly packaged fireworks and loosely bundled spark plugs slams on its brakes , it ’s not the right time to discuss with your passengers where y’all would like to stop for dinner .
But as ridiculous as this scenario sounds , it happens all the time .
People worry about the wrong thing at the wrong time and apply their intelligence in ways that does n’t serve the greater good of whatever they ’re trying to achieve .
Some call this difference in skill wisdom , in that the wise know what to be thinking about , where as the merely intelligent only know how to think .
( The de-emphasis of wisdom is an east vs. west dichotomy : eastern philosophy heavily emphasizes deeper wisdom , where as the post enlightenment west , and perhaps particularly America , heavily emphasizes the intellectual flourishes of intelligence ) .
In the software industry , the common example of thinking at the wrong level is a team of rock star programmers who can make anything , but do n’t really know what to make : so they tend to build whatever things come to mind , never stopping to find someone who might not be adept at writing code , but can see where the value of their programming skills would be best applied .
Other examples include people that always worry about money despite how much they have , people who struggle with relationships but invest their energy only in improving their appearance ( instead of in therapy or other emotional exploration ) , or anyone that wants to solve problem X but only ever seems to do things that solve problem Y .
The primary point is that no amount of intelligence can help an individual who is diligently working at the wrong level of the problem .
Someone with wisdom has to tap them on the shoulder and say , “ Um , hey .
The hole you ’re digging is very nice , and it is the right size .
But you ’re in the wrong yard . ”
Killed in the long term by short term thinking
From what we know of evolution it ’s clear that we are alive because of our inherited ability to think quickly and respond to change .
The survival of living creatures , for most of the history of our planet , has been a short term game .
Only if you can out - run your predators , and catch your prey , do you have the luxury of worrying about tomorrow .
It follows then that we tend to be better at worrying about and solving short term issues than long term issues .
Even when we recognize an important long term issue that we need to plan for , say protecting natural resources or saving for retirement , we ’re all too easily distracted away from those deep thoughts by immediate things like dinner or sex ( important things no doubt , but the driving needs in these pursuits , at least for this half of the species , are short term in nature ) .
Once distracted , we rarely return to the long term issues we were drawn away from .
A common justification for abuse of short term thinking is the fake perspective defense .
The wise , but less confident guy says “ hey are you sure we should be doing this ? ”
And the smart , confident , but less wise guy says “ of course .
We did this last time , and the time before that , so why should n’t we do this again ? ”
This is the fake perspective defense because there ’s no reason to believe that 2 points of data ( e.g. last time plus the time before that ) is sufficient to make claims about the future .
People say similar things all the time in defense of the free market economy , democracy , and mating strategies .
“ Well , it ’s gotten us this far , and it ’s the best system we have ” .
Well , maybe .
But if you were in that broken down Winnebago up to your ankles in gasoline from a leaking tank , smoking a cigarette in each hand , you could say the same thing .
Put simply , the fact that you ’re not dead yet does n’t mean that the things you ’ve done up until now should n’t have , by all that is fair in the universe , already killed you .
You might just need a few more data points for the law of averages to catch up , and put a permanent end to your short term thinking .
How many data points you need to feel comfortable continuing a behavior is entirely a matter of personal philosophy .
The wise and skeptical know that even an infinite number of data points in the past may only have limited bearing on the future .
The tricky thing about the future is that it ’s different than the past .
Our data from the past , no matter how big a pile of data it is , may very well be entirely irrelevant .
Some find this lack of predictive ability of the future quite frustrating , while others see it as the primary reason to stick around for a few more years .
Anyway , my point is not that Winnebagos or free market economies are bad .
Instead I ’m saying that short term bits of data are neither reliable nor a wise way to go about making important long term decisions .
Intelligent people do this all the time , and since it ’s so commonly accepted as a rule of thumb ( last time + the time before that ) , it ’s often accepted in place of actual thinking .
Always remember that humans , given our evolution , are very bad at seeing the cumulative effects of behavior , and underestimate how things like compound interest or that one cigarette a day , can in the long term , have surprisingly large impacts despite clearly low short term effects .
How to prevent smart people from defending bad ideas
I spent my freshman year at a small college in NJ called Drew University .
I had a fun time , ingested many tasty alcoholic beverages , and went to lots of great parties ( the result of which of course was that I basically failed out and had to move back to Queens with my parents .
You see , the truth is that this essay is really a public service announcement paid for by my parents – I was a smart person that did some stupid things ) .
But the reason I mention all this is because I learned a great bit of philosophy from many hours of playing pool in the college student center .
The lesson is this : Speed kills .
I was never very good at pool , but this one guy there was , and whenever we ’d play , he ’d watch me miss easy shots because I tried to force them in with authority .
I chose speed and power over control , and I usually lost .
So like pool , when it comes to defusing smart people who are defending bad ideas , you have to find ways to slow things down .
The reason for this is simple .
Smart people , or at least those whose brains have good first gears , use their speed in thought to overpower others .
They ’ll jump between assumptions quickly , throwing out jargon , bits of logic , or rules of thumb at a rate of fire fast enough to cause most people to become rattled , and give in .
When that does n’t work , the arrogant or the pompous will throw in some belittlement and use whatever snide or manipulative tactics they have at their disposal to further discourage you from dissecting their ideas .
So your best defense starts by breaking an argument down into pieces .
When they say “ it ’s obvious we need to execute plan A now . ”
You say , “ hold on .
You ’re way ahead of me .
For me to follow I need to break this down into pieces . ”
And without waiting for permission , you should go ahead and do so .
First , nothing is obvious .
If it were obvious there would be no need to say so .
So your first piece is to establish what is n’t so obvious .
What are the assumptions the other guy is glossing over that are worth spending time on ?
There may be 3 or 4 different valid assumptions that need to be discussed one at a time before any kind of decision can be considered .
Take each one in turn , and lay out the basic questions : what problem are we trying to solve ?
What alternatives to solving it are there ?
What are the tradeoffs in each alternative ?
By breaking it down and asking questions you expose more thinking to light , make it possible for others to ask questions , and make it more difficult for anyone to defend a bad idea .
No one can ever take away your right to think things over , especially if the decision at hand is important .
If your mind works best in 3rd or 4th gear , find ways to give yourself the time needed to get there .
If when you say ” need the afternoon to think this over ” , they say
“ tough .
We ’re deciding now ” .
Ask if the decision is an important one .
If they say yes , then you should be completely justified in asking for more time to think it over and ask questions .
Find a sane person people listen to
Some situations require outside help .
Instead of taking a person on directly , get a third party that you both respect , and continue the discussion in their presence .
This can be a superior , or simply someone smart enough that the other person might possibly concede points to them .
It follows that if your team manager is wise and reasonable , smart people who might ordinarily defend bad ideas will have a hard time doing so .
But sadly if your team manager is neither wise nor reasonable , smart , arrogant people may convince others to follow their misguided ways more often than not .
And yet more reasons
I ’m sure you have stories of your own follies dealing with smart people defending bad ideas , or where you , yourself , as a smart person , have spent time arguing for things you regretted later .
Given the wondrous multitude of ways the universe has granted humans to be smart and dumb at the same time , there are many more reasons why smart people behave in stupid ways .
For fun , and as fodder , here ’s a few more .
If you have some thoughts on this essay , or some more reasons to add , leave a comment :
Smart people can follow stupid leaders ( seeking praise or promotion )
Smart people may follow their anger into stupid places
They may be trained or educated into stupidity
Smart people can inherit bad ideas from their parents under the guise of tradition
They may simply want something to be true , that can never be

In this interview , Scott Swigart , interviewed Shawn Burke of Microsoft .
Shawn Burke regarding the way software is developed within Microsoft .
Shawn is a Director in Microsoft ’s .
NET Developer Platform group .
Currently , Shawn is focused on building shared - source projects focused on new developer technologies from Developer Division .
Since he started working at Microsoft in 1997 , he ’s worked on Visual J++ , Windows Forms , and Visual Studio .
This interview covered a wide range of topics some of which follow :
Scott Swigart : Shawn , thanks for taking the time to chat with us .
If you would n’t mind , could you introduce yourself a little bit ?
Shawn Burke : My name is Shawn Burke .
I ’ve been at Microsoft going on 10 years now .
I ’ve spent most of my career at Microsoft on the Windows Forms team .
Originally it was the WFC team , which was part of the Visual J++ product .
On Windows Forms ( which became a big chunk of the .NET framework ) I went from just a software engineer to lead engineer up to development manager on that product .
I ran that team for three or four years .
When VS 2005 shipped in 2005 , I was ready for a change .
I saw what I thought was a bunch of opportunities for Microsoft to improve the way that we develop our software , specifically around driving good contextual feedback into our products at an earlier point in the development cycle .
I went to Scott Guthrie and said , “ Hey , why do n’t we create a team that ’s fully focused on consuming early technologies here at Microsoft . ”
We ’re going to expose our learning ( and what we ’re doing ) really transparently out to the community .
We ’re trying to drive a tight feedback loop from the community into the development team who is actually building the product .
We ’re trying to improve quality all along the axis .
Scott :
So it ’s that whole concept of .
eating your own dog food
You ’re on a team now that specifically does that ?
Shawn : Kind of , yeah .
The dog food thing is usually more at a consumer - level .
We ’re really focused on development technologies .
We ’re focused on , “ Hey , some technologies are just getting off the ground .
What can we go out and try to build on top of that technology and really drive scenarios ? ”
Can we take actual Microsoft plugged - in engineers and do things with technology and influence how it develops ?
It ’s an extension of the dog - food - eating thing , but it ’s a little deeper than that .
Scott :
That makes sense .
My background is also with developer technologies , and I ’ve noticed regardless of whose technology you ’re using , that you sit back and look at it and wonder if the company that built it ever tried to do anything “ real ” with it .
There are always a lot of things you stub your toe on when you start .
Shawn :
There ’s one problem with developer technologies though , and this is something people do n’t really often realize .
When I build Minesweeper or Notepad or an application like that , it ’s very easy for me to enumerate the scenarios that people are going to use on it .
If I build a compiler or a framework , it ’s very difficult to enumerate the scenarios .
There are essentially an infinite number of them .
The stubbing - the - toe phenomenon is one we definitely focus on , and one of my goals is to try to avoid that .
At the end of the day , it ’s really hard to know exactly what people are going to use the development tools and frameworks for .
Scott :
Talk to me a little at a really high level about how Microsoft builds software ?
Where do ideas come from , and how do these get slated for coding ?
How do they get built ?
What are some of the things along the process to release and then even to servicing ?
Shawn :
So traditionally what ’s happened is that ’s been driven simultaneously bottom - up and top - down .
What ’s usually happened is that you have teams that have released a prior version of a product .
They ’ve learned about the space .
They looked at the industry .
They realize a need by talking to customers in a variety of ways .
They start coming up with things they think are going to address the needs of their customer set .
They do that via their engineers working with customers across their prior project .
They do that via their engineers just having brainstorms about , “ Oh my gosh .
We could solve this problem this way , ” et cetera .
So what ends up happening is that you wind up with a bunch of product ideas early in the product cycle , and people start slating out things that they want to do .
We ’ve gotten more regimented about this .
In the past , it was more like we ’d just write everything down that we wanted to do , and we ’d start going and doing it .
Then , farther down the road , we ’d have to start cutting things .
We ’ve gotten better about that .
We have quite a bit more top - down influence now .
Not over specific features , but what ends up happening is that the feature teams have a good read on what they think they need to do .
What happens top - down is that we have what are called “ pillars ” for a given product .
For Visual Studio 2005 one pillar was “ Please the VB [ Visual Basic ] customer . ”
The VB customer ( from the old Visual Basic days ) was not terribly thrilled with our VS 2003 and 2002 releases .
It did n’t really address their needs in a way that we thought it was going to .
For 2005 , one of the pillars was to address the needs of the VB customer .
From the top - down we ’ll have a few pillars , and the individual teams will need to justify how each one of their features fits into one of those pillars .
At that point , there tends to be some agreement on what people go off and build .
The process varies from team - to - team and from division - to - division within Microsoft .
In the developer division , the developers and the program managers will sit down and spec out a feature .
PMs will write the specs , and the developers will give them technical input .
The developers may write prototype , since the best way for most people to learn about a feature is to try and write it .
Then it becomes an iterative process where you refine the specs as you start to develop the product .
As time goes on , resource constraints usually cause you to trim down what you ’re going to deliver .
You just iterate from there .
Scott :
So software a lot of times goes through different milestones , you ’ll hear about a product being an M1 or an M2 .
Shawn : Yep .
Scott :
There are CTPs and there are RCs .
What is all that ?
What ’s a layman ’s glossary ?
Shawn : Usually what happens is similar to Boyle ’s Law : work expands to fit the space you give it , much like a gas .
So you need to put constraints in there to get things to ship .
One of the ideas of milestones is to force teams to think about their products and their features in manageable chunks .
The risk of having somebody go off and crank on a feature unsupervised for months or years at a time means you ’re going to have issues .
That just does n’t work .
So what you do with milestones is force people to break things into manageable chunks .
You make them tightly figure out exactly what the costs are going to be , figure out exactly what the testing recommendations and requirements are going to be , etc .
Usually what happens is that teams take their features for an entire product and break them up into milestones : milestone one ( M1 ) we are going to do this feature , milestone two ( M2 ) we are going to do this feature , etc .
At the end of each milestone , you have a mini-release .
A lot of times you do Community Tech Preview ( CTP ) at the end of a milestone .
Usually at the end of a milestone your at a know point where , which is to say the product is at zero active bugs at a certain priority level .
You figure out some filter for your bugs , and you say we ’re going to drive to zero at the end of the milestone .
Then you start over again with the next milestone .
As milestones go on , you are more and more careful about adding features .
Milestones are also used between teams .
If team A needs a feature from team B , team B will do that as an earlier milestone so that team A can pick it up sooner .
Another thing we started to do is add something that we call milestone quality , MQ .
Some people also call it M - crit , which is essentially a special milestone where we do n’t actually want teams writing code .
What we want them to do is make sure their processes work properly .
We want them to make sure they ’ve cleaned up any bugs that are left over from the prior product cycle , or bugs that have come in after the release of the product , time to improve check - in systems , things like that .
We ’ve added this so teams get to focus on their infrastructure , which is a good thing because historically it has n’t been on the schedule .
It ’s the old adage where a guy is walking down the path and sees two other guys trying to cut down a tree , and he says to them , “ You know guys , that tree would get cut down a lot faster if you would just sharpen that saw you ’ve got . ” and the guys reply , “ We do n’t have time to sharpen this saw , we ’ve got to get this tree cut down . ”
So giving teams a time to really sharpen the saw and improve their efficiency is a good thing .
That ’s what usually happens in MQ .
After that you usually have M0 which is the formal product scheduling and planning milestone and then you roll into the coding milestones – M1 , M2 – from there .
After that you usually have the Beta and RTM milestones .
Scott :
We ’re looking at open source and closed source , and Microsoft has obviously decided that a closed source way of doing business makes sense .
What ’s your impression of why that is ?
What ’s your impression of why Microsoft does n’t just open source everything ?
Shawn :
Well there ’s a whole set of reasons .
This project that I ’m running now is an open source project .
We ’re building on top of the new technologies , and the things we build are actually open source .
We are actually doing both .
We take customer contributions , the whole bit .
What ’s ending up happening , what is starting to evolve , specifically with my team ( and we are looking at duplicating the model ) is making a hybrid model where you have closed source cores , and open source projects focusing on added customer value , extended components , widgets , and stuff like that .
As far as why Microsoft does n’t go open source , there ’s a whole set of reasons for that .
I think the number one reason is just around IP pedigree .
The issue with open source is that it ’s very , very difficult–well it ’s impossible –to verify with a hundred percent certainty that every piece of idea in there is licensed properly to be in there .
It ’s very difficult for me to know if some developer that contributed to my project saw some code in some other project that he liked , and he picked that code up and dropped it into the project and maybe just tweaked it a little bit .
.
“ When your organization picks up software , you are taking on some amount of risk that there could be an IP issue with that code .
That ’s the number one issue that we see with open source .
You do n’t know how much risk there is , and there is limited , if any , IP protection provided .
When people adopt Windows they are provided with significant IP protection . ”
That ’s a core reason .
If you look at most open source projects , and actually just to be clear I ’m a fan of open source , I think open source drives a lot of value and is great for a lot of types of projects .
But if you look at most open source projects , there ’s a couple of things I think that are important about them , and one of them is that they are not that different than closed source or proprietary projects .
Open source projects have a few key people that do ninety - five percent of the work , and then they have a bunch of other people that kind of help out .
If you look at Microsoft at any given project , they have a few key people doing ninety - five percent of the work and you ’ve got a bunch of other people that do other stuff .
So the models end up looking pretty similar the more you squint at them .
The big difference is just that a model in which you pay people and whose job is to show up and write software every day , it ’s a little easier for us to drive accountability and drive productivity over longer term .
Scott :
It seems to me too that one of the advantages of open source is that it ’s easy to get a daily build , it ’s easy to get the latest drop of something .
Around open source projects that have achieved critical mass , even if a lot of people are n’t necessarily contributing to the code , the project is getting a lot of people using the code and submitting bugs , feedback , and feature requests .
It seems like Microsoft over the last few years has addressed that same issue a different way with things like CTPs and their bug tracking system known as Connect .
Shawn : I think it ’s important to point out that those aspects of taking customer feedback , issuing bugs , having rapid turn around , those things are separate from how the source is licensed .
Scott :
Well , I agree .
So , I wonder if you can take a minute and talk about CTPs and Connect specifically , and the rationale behind those .
What does Microsoft get out of those ?
What do customers get out of those ?
Shawn :
One of the issues that we ’ve had in the past , and this is one of the reasons that I went off and I started the team that I did , is that historically when the product got into beta and customers were actually able to use the product , it was basically too late for them to give any feedback that we could act on .
If we sent out a beta , and we ’re three months before shipping , and somebody says , “ Well , I do n’t like the way this works , ” all of a sudden we ’re in a situation where we have to ask “ Should we slip the product for a year because of this ? ”
It ’s just often too late to make those changes .
One of the benefits of having a milestone system ( and then using CTPs where we drive the product to a higher quality bar at an intermediate point ) is that people can pick up those CTPs and give us feedback at an earlier point in time .
That leads into where Connect becomes valuable , because Connect and the MSDN Product Feedback Center feed directly into our internal databases .
We see those bugs just like any other bugs .
They have no different appearance in the database .
That gives us a chance to see customer issues alongside testing - team issues .
We do our typical triage process and address them earlier .
I think the value of CTPs has definitely been to get people involved sooner .
Scott :
So , you said you ’re a fan of open source and you spend a certain amount of time around open source .
How do you feel that Microsoft is influenced by things that are happening in the open source world ?
And how do you see the open source world being influenced by things that are happening in closed source proprietary shops like Microsoft ?
Shawn :
That ’s a good question .
I think that open source really , at the end of the day , has forced us to take a closer look at how we relate to customers .
I think the expectations of customers have changed because of open source , because it gives them freedom to choose .
It lets them modify things for themselves , even though I think , a very small percentage of customers actually do that .
It ’s forced us to think deeply about how transparent we are .
I think if you go back ten years or even five years , the way we interacted with customers bears very little resemblance to the way that it looks today .
And I think all the changes that we ’ve made around being more open with our product plans and source are nothing but good .
We ’re licensing all kinds of stuff under Ms - PL ( Microsoft Permissive License ) these days .
It ’s definitely driven us to think about our value as being not purely based on our source code , but based on our brand , and our product , and our developer community .
Open source work has really driven that direction not only as a competitive response to the open source world , but really as a “ Wow that ’s a better way of doing things . ” response .
Scott :
Have you seen anything flow the other direction ?
Looking for different things happening in open source , have you thought , “ Hmm … they are kind of picking up on something we ’ve been doing for awhile ?
Shawn :
Well , a little bit .
Like I said , I think at the end of the day the software development practices are probably more similar than different .
I think most developers work in similar ways .
I think that you ’re starting to see some interesting kind of hybrids out there in the world .
And the one that jumps to my mind is Eclipse .
Eclipse started as funded by IBM .
They had IBM engineers working on this project that happened to be open - source .
It ’s kind of a hybrid model as well .
I ca n’t say that Microsoft has necessarily driven that change , but there are definitely things that are more common to the proprietary source model that have crept into open source as well .
Scott :
You know , one of the things that came out in a conversation we had awhile back was if you look at the successful open source projects , one thing that they tend to have in common is that they ’re very modular and pluggable .
Eclipse is a good example , right ?
It ’s very common for people to build all sorts of extensions to Eclipse .
Apache , since forever , has had modules that you can load in .
I get the impression that closed source proprietary is usually focused on analyzing the customer , analyzing the need , building features that address that , and then later there ’s recognition that certain things need to be extensible ?
For closed source shops it ’s always about building a feature .
Extensibility has to be justified , and it ’s viewed as making the feature more expensive .
In the open source world , a project does n’t really seem to survive unless it ’s extensible from day one .
Can you talk a little bit about how Microsoft views extensibility ?
And how Microsoft looks at making that tradeoff between just getting the feature out , versus getting it out in a really extensible way ?
Shawn : Yeah , absolutely .
I worked on frameworks for ten years , and we ’re all about extensibility , but a lot of it has been based on what the developers think people are going to want to do .
It ’s a little bit of hit and miss there .
We ’ve gotten more regimented about that .
I think it goes with what I was mentioning earlier about having closed source teams focus on extensibility and the open source teams build out that extensibility .
I think we ’re picking up that method from the way the open source community works because it makes sense .
When we were developing the .NET Framework , for example , we thought really hard about every single member of a class that we made virtual .
The issue you mentioned is cost , and the real issue for extensibility at Microsoft is two things .
One is supporting the extensibility point , and that ’s actually not that big of a deal .
The real issue with extensibility is supporting it over versions .
So , as soon as you open up a feature to be extensible it makes it a lot harder to write V2 because you have to maintain semantics , and calling orders , and event orders , and all sorts of stuff .
You even have to look at whatever bugs you had in your earlier implementations .
You often ca n’t fix things in your V2 implementation because people may have written code that depends on that behavior , and if you fix the bug , you break existing apps .
There ’s a lot of stuff that goes into making a feature extensible .
We certainly want to make things extensible , but we try to constrain it to the things that we believe are key features because of the long - term impact of extensibility .
Scott :
One case in point is something like Visual Studio , right ?
You guys had come out with a shiny new framework .
You had to have a development environment on top of it as fast as possible .
I ’m sure that in the initial version of Visual Studio , the focus was just on getting a really good IDE out there , and not so much getting the most extensible IDE out there , because the framework was n’t really viable until you had a development environment on top of it .
Shawn : Well , Visual Studio predated the framework a little bit .
Devenv , which is now Visual Studio , was originally the environment around Visual C++ , because we used to have different IDEs for each language .
When managed code came along , we had an IDE that was written completely in native code , and we shoe - horned in a set of managed code functionality .
But the realization we had was , we had an IDE that was extensible , but not with the technology that we were recommending people use the IDE to build .
Scott : Right , right .
So you were inventing managed code , but you had an IDE built using unmanaged code – an earlier technology .
So to extend , the IDE developers had to use an older technology .
Shawn : Exactly .
Yeah , there ’s a set of things that were very difficult .
Something that we worked really hard on in VS 2005 was to get a bunch of those extensibility points more managed code - friendly .
Scott :
So one last question .
Software always has all these “ ities , ” right ?
Security , reliability , scalability .
Since you ’ve been involved in how Microsoft builds what it builds , what special things does Microsoft do to make sure the product is secure , reliable , scalable –those sorts of professional , enterprise - class features ?
Shawn : Yeah , we do a lot .
It ’s actually amazing what we do there .
Ever since the Trustworthy Computing memo we ’ve done very rigorous security reviews of every single piece that ’s gone into a product .
For any given feature , even if you know it ’s not going to be a security issue , the PMs have people do threat models of the feature – which is to look at all the different kinds of typical threat vectors and think about , “ Hey , could you use impersonation here ?
Could you use spoofing ?
Could you use denial of service ? ”
Those kinds of things .
For each feature , we do that .
And then we also do security reviews at a code level .
We run a bunch of tools that look for things like buffer overruns , array access , uncaught exceptions , stuff like that .
We have static tools that go and look at the code and look for different sorts of vulnerabilities as well .
Managed code adds a whole other layer of complex security issues that we ’ve had to train up our developers on , and have had to build tools around .
We have threat reviews done by people , we have code reviews done by our people in security , we have tools that run that try and find things that people are n’t very good at finding –so that ’s just for security .
For stress , we have our testing teams that build these very elaborate tests that hit our products with all kinds of things , thousands of times , over days .
There ’s nothing better than at the end of the product cycle , when one of my developers has a bug that only repro’s after the stress harness has been running for two days .
Scott : [ laughs ]
Shawn : Yeah , seriously .
Those are just a beast to track down , because you have to make a guess about the root cause of the problem .
Usually , by the time it blows up , you do n’t have a lot of good debugging information about what caused the problem .
Scott : Right .
It ’s kind of like communicating with one of the rovers on Mars .
Shawn :
It ’s exactly like that , yes .
Scott :
You send your message , and four days later , you see if it got there .
Shawn : Exactly .
We do that around stress , and we try and drive those bugs really hard .
The tough thing about stress is , sometimes , it ends up being a bug in the OS or a bug in a driver–just really random stuff that we end up uncovering .
Security and reliability :
We do a ton of work around globalization and localization , making sure things are working right - to - left , making sure things work accessibility - wise ( we ’re 508 compliant ) , making sure that things work on different operating systems–especially for the Windows Forms team , because we have to run on Windows 98 , Win2K , WinXP , NT4 …
It was just incredible how many different operating systems we had to test .
What else ?
Scott : Performance –what are some of the methodologies that you use to just wring more performance out of stuff ?
Shawn : Right , performance .
We have scenarios that try to mimic customer scenarios , like the amount of time it takes to go from what we call a cold start–which is a machine that ’s just been rebooted that does n’t have any of our code running on it yet –to begin with a cold start to , start the IDE , create a new project , run the project , and display the running form .
We measure the amount of time it takes , and then we ’ll try and optimize those types of scenarios .
We take scenarios like that and then just really drill into them with a bunch of tools and a magnifying glass , and try and eke out exactly who ’s taking the time and how we can optimize it .
Scott : I ’ll hand you the microphone .
What are some things that you see on the horizon that you ’re pretty excited about ?
What are some messages that you ’d like to take the opportunity to get out ?
Shawn : I ’m insanely excited about Silverlight .
The technology rolled out over the last few weeks .
Silverlight is really just one of these magical convergences of technologies that we have been developing piecemeal where some people said , “ Oh my gosh !
We can put these technologies together in a really compelling way . ”
We have a full tool set .
We have this great rendering engine .
We ’ve got managed code .
We ’ve got dynamic languages .
We ’ve got a bunch of other stuff .
So I ’m really excited about that .
And one of the reasons that I ’m excited about Silverlight is that it ’s going to enable a client programming model .
ASP.NET is an extremely extensible and awesome product , but the kind of server stateless programming model is hard many developers to understand .
A client - side model is a little easier , so maybe we ’re going to see a resurgence of people being really excited about writing client side code , because they can crank this out a lost faster .
I ’m excited about how we ’re looking at how we can be more transparent .
I think that ’s super - important for us .
I think getting our customers more deeply involved and invested in our processes is not only good for us , but good for our customers .
And I think that I ’m really lucky to be in the Developer Division , honestly , because I think that ’s where all the action ’s at .

A Swiss driver caught with the pedal to the metal on a Canadian highway offered police the most creative excuse for speeding since aliens took the rap for a UK excess velocity outrage .
According to the BBC , the perp was pulled doing 100 mph in a 60 mph zone in Ontario , but explained that his need for speed was provoked by a simple lack of goats which in his native land regularly wander the roads acting as caprine velocity moderators .
A police officer 's notes record that he was " taking advantage of the ability to go faster without risking hitting a goat " .
Which is perfectly reasonable , given that police spokesman Joel Doiron said " he had never found a goat on the highways of eastern Ontario in his 20 years of service " .
Dorian confirmed the novelty of the explanation thus : " Nobody 's ever used the lack of goats here as an excuse for speeding . "
In mitigation , he added : " I 've never been to Switzerland , but I guess there must be a lot of goats there . " ®

In what could be the most embarrassing exploit to impact Windows Vista since its commercial launch in January , security engineers at McAfee 's Avert Labs confirmed today - and posted the video to prove - that the operating system can be caused to enter an interminable crash - restart - crash loop , by means of a buffer overflow triggered by nothing more than a malformed animated cursor file .
It is n't even a new exploit , as researchers with eEye discovered in January 2005 .
At that time , Microsoft acknowledged it affected versions of the operating system from the first edition of Windows 98 through to early releases of Windows XP , though it stated at the time XP SP1 was unaffected .
But apparently after researching field reports of limited attacks , Avert Labs discovered an apparently similar exploit using .ANI files impacts XP SP2 and Vista , as well as Windows 2000 SP4 and versions of Windows Server 2003 from the initial release through to SP1 .
Avert Labs stated XP SP1 and versions since were unaffected , though Microsoft warned the exploit does affect XP SP2 .
Advertisement
If both firms ' accounts are correct , Microsoft may have fixed the problem with XP SP1 in 2005 , and inadvertently un - fixed it sometime afterward .
Avert Labs ' video of the incident , posted to YouTube , shows a Vista system wherein the test file apparently trying to load the custom animated cursor .
When the operating system detects a crash , it first tries to save vital data prior to a restart sequence - one of Vista 's newer features .
It then informs the user that Windows Explorer has crashed .
But in trying to restart Explorer , the restarting crashes itself , sending Vista into a tailspin from which the only escape appears to be the off button .
The mouse input routines in Windows are designed with the intention of being relatively failsafe .
That 's why when the system appears to hang , you can often still move your mouse pointer .
As I 've personally witnessed on many occasions with Windows XP , it 's possible for a smaller OEM 's mouse driver - often an unsigned one - to trigger a similar tailspin loop that crashes Windows Explorer repeatedly .
In Windows , a lot depends on the mouse pointer 's very existence .
So if a customization feature can impact the mouse pointer 's ability to function , the integrity of the entire system can be jeopardized .
With my own systems , drivers and services that are unfriendly to one another - such as Stardock 's CursorXP animation program trying to co-exist with a Synaptics Pointing Device driver on a notebook with ATI Mobility Radeon 9600 graphics - can trigger an Explorer tailspin .
What I 'm calling the " tailspin " is nothing new .
What is very disturbing about this revelation , however , is that it can be triggered by nothing more than Microsoft 's own operating system software and processes .
McAfee reports this exploit is being utilized in the wild , and Microsoft today issued its boilerplate language warning users not to open e-mail attachments they do n't recognize .

Tim Donaghy , the NBA ref at the center of a federal investigation into fixing games and betting on contests he officiated , was forced into helping crooked gamblers by a fledgling gangster who threatened him , The Post has learned .
Donaghy , 40 , was a troubled gambler who placed high - stakes bets on just about anything he could – including his own rounds of golf – before the Philadelphia - based wiseguy wannabe learned the ref bet on games that he worked , sources said .
The thug ’s threats to expose Donaghy pressured the ref into feeding crooked gamblers privileged information that helped them win bets against the point spread – the margin of victory on which bettors wager – on NBA games , sources said .
Donaghy also made officiating calls during games that affected margins of victory , the sources said .
The investigation , which originated in the Eastern District of New York and is being presented to a grand jury , is likely to lead to arrests within the next week of the referee and at least two others , the sources said .
He is expected to turn himself in .
Donaghy now lives in Bradenton , Fla. , but still spends a considerable amount of time in the Philadelphia area .
“ The tragedy is he was n’t a bad ref , ” a source said .
“ Once he got mixed up , they would n’t let him go . ”
Donaghy ’s lawyer , John Lauro , and the FBI declined to comment .
A woman at Donaghy ’s Florida home shouted through the door , “ We have no comment . ”
The scheme involving Donaghy was uncovered during a sweeping investigation into high - ranking members of the Gambino crime family , sources told The Post .
“ It stems from an investigation into the administration of the Gambino family , ” said one source , who added that no one has yet been charged in that investigation .
The instigator of the plot allegedly used his contacts in the crime family to intimidate the NBA official with “ veiled threats of violence ” against Donaghy and his family , as well as the more immediate pledge to expose him , sources said .
During wiretaps of mobsters , a conversation involving the allegedly crooked ref was picked up and sparked an investigation .
Very recently , the FBI confronted Donaghy , who began to cooperate with authorities , sources said .
He resigned his NBA post in the past week .
In what is swiftly turning into the biggest black eye in NBA history , some of the information that Donaghy allegedly fed to gamblers could cause sweeping changes to the league .
“ This is a systemic issue for the NBA , ” a source said .
For instance , authorities are investigating whether Donaghy tipped off gamblers as to which referees were going to be calling a game before it was made public .
It ’s well known that referees have different styles of calling games that can affect how coaches manage the team and how different players are used .
A thornier issue for the NBA is long - running speculation that certain referees harbor deep dislike and bias against certain players .
“ There ’s a lot of bias , judgment calls , who likes who , how they call a game , ” a source said .
“ This information is proprietary and worth a lot to gamblers and the bookmakers . ”
In a statement yesterday , NBA Commissioner David Stern said the league wanted to “ assure our fans that no amount of effort , time or personnel is being spared to assist in this investigation , to bring to justice an individual who has betrayed the most sacred trust in professional sports , and to take the necessary steps to protect against this ever happening again . ”
Barry Mano , president of the National Association of Sports Officials , told the Los Angeles Times , “ If this is true , it is a tragedy of enormous proportion , not just for himself and his family but for our industry .
It can not be understated what a terrible thing this could end up being . ”
The ref had just finished his 13th season in the league , officiating more than 700 games and more than a dozen playoff matches .
One of his regular - season games was the infamous 2004 Indiana Pacers - Detroit Pistons brawl at the Palace at Auburn Hills , Mich. , when Pacers forward Ron Artest attacked a fan in the stands .
LeBron James , a star forward for the Cleveland Cavaliers , was stunned by news of the probe .
“ As a competitor , as hard as I play , it is disappointing , definitely , ” he said .
Pistons guard Chauncey Billups said , “ Everybody had the same kind of reaction , whether you played in the league or [ are ] just a regular citizen . ”
But many players said they thought well of the veteran official .
“ Suspect anything ?
No , of course not , ” said one player .
“ I thought he was one of the good ones . ”
Donaghy ’s gambling allegedly put him in the company of some bad characters , including the one who would eventually blackmail him , sources said .
Others involved in the gambling scheme are helping investigators and receiving FBI protection , sources added .
Though Donaghy did charity work in his community , he was known for his fiery temper that has led to fights with players and even neighbors .
In 2003 the NBA investigated an allegation that then - Portland Trail Blazers forward Rasheed Wallace cursed out the referee over a technical foul called against him .
In a game two seasons earlier when Blazers guard Bonzi Wells allegedly “ intentionally struck ” Donaghy .
Then , in 2005 , Donaghy was sued by his West Chester , Pa. , neighbor for instigating “ a pattern of public harassment . ”
Donaghy was also charged after a verbal dispute with a postal carrier , but the case was tossed when the carrier did n’t show up for a hearing , according to the Philadelphia Inquirer .
Donaghy ’s Florida neighbors said he moved onto the block less than a year ago , and his house was already up for sale .
One NBA coach told The Post about the betting scandal : “ Our officials are so scrutinized and evaluated , I ’m shocked something like this could happen .
I mean , even the evaluators are evaluated . ”
But others believe that if any of the allegations are proven true , it could deal pro basketball an irreversible blow .
“ What will happen is every time there is an arguable call at the end of games , fans are going to say , ‘ See ?
Told you .
It ’s crooked , ’ ” said an NBA team executive , who asked not to be identified .

Ban on Gays is Senseless Attempt to Stall the Inevitable
By Barry M. Goldwater
After more than 50 years in the military and politics , I am still amazed to see how upset people can get over nothing .
Lifting the ban on gays in the military is n't exactly nothing , but it 's pretty damned close
Everyone knows that gays have served honorably in the military since at least the time of Julius Caesar .
They 'll still be serving long after we 're all dead and buried .
That should not surprise anyone .
But most Americans should be shocked to know that while the country 's economy is going down the tubes , the military has wasted half a billion dollars over the past decade chasing down gays and running them out of the armed services .
It 's no great secret that military studies have proved again and again that there 's no valid reason for keeping the ban on gays .
Some thought gays were crasy , but then found that was n't true .
then they decided that gays were a security risk , but again the Department of Defense decided that was n't so - in fact , one study by the Navy in 1956 that was never made public found gays to be good security risks .
Even Larry Korb , President Reagan 's man in charge of implementing the Pentagon ban on gays , now admits that it was a dumb idea .
No wonder my friend Dick Cheney , secretary of defense under President Bush , called it " a bit of an old chestnut "
When the facts lead to one conlusion , I say it 's time to act , not to hide .
The country and the military know that eventually the ban will be lifted .
The only remaining questions are how much muck we will all be dragged through , and how many brave Americans like Tom Paniccia and Margarethe Cammermeyer will have their lives and careers destroyed in a senseless attempt to stall the inevitable .
Some in congress think I 'm wrong .
They say we absolutely must continue to discriminate , or all hell will break loose .
Who knows , they say , perhaps our soldiers may even take up arms against each other .
Well , that 's just stupid .
Years ago , I was a lieutenant in charge of an all - black unit .
Military leaders at the time believed that blacks lacked leadership potential - period .
That seems ridiculous now , as it should .
Now , each and every man and woman who serves this nation takes orders from a black man - our own Gen. Colin Powell .
Nobody thought that blacks or women could ever be integrated into the military .
Many thought that an all - volunteer force could never protect our national interest .
Well , it has , and despite those who feared the worst - I among them - we are still the best and will continue to be .
The point is that decisions are always a lot easier to make in hindsight .
but we seldom have that luxury .
That 's why the future of our country depends on leadership , and that 's what we need now .
I served in the armed forces .
I have flown more than 150 of the best fighter planes and bombers this country manufactured .
I founded the Arizona National Guard .
I chaired the Senate Armed Services Committee .
And I think it 's high time to pull the curtains on this charade of policy .
What should undermine our readiness would be a compromise policy like " Do n't ask , do n't tell . "
That compromise does n't deal with the issue - it tries to hide it .
We have wasted enough precious time , money and talent trying to persecute and pretend .
It 's time to stop burying our heads in the sand and denying reality for the sake of politics .
It 's time to deal with this straight on and be done with it .
It 's time to get on with more important business .
The conservative movement , to which I subscribe , has as one of its basic tenets the belief that government should stay out of people 's private lives .
Government governs best when it governs least - and stays out of the impossible task of legislating morality .
But legislating someone 's version of morality is exactly what we do by perpetuating discrimination against gays .
When you get down to it , no American able to serve should be allowed , much less given an excuse , not to serve his or her country .
We need all our talent .
If I were in the Senate today , I would rise on the Senate floor in support of our commander in chief .
He may be a Democrat , but he happens to be right on this question .
( Arizona Republican Barry M. Goldwater retired from the Senate in 1987 )

Voters post their marble into the different coloured drums
Voters enter a booth and pop a clear glass marble into one of three drums representing the candidates , instead of a putting a ballot paper into a box .
As the marble falls into the drum , it hits a bell so officials can tell if anyone votes more than once .
" It 's a unique system introduced in 1965 because of Gambia 's high illiteracy , " Gambia 's chief electoral officer Kawsu Ceesay told the BBC .
The bell resembles a bicycle bell so bicycles are banned from around polling stations to avoid any confusion .
" Three drums representing the three presidential candidates will be in the compartment attached to one another so they can't be lifted to see which is heavier , " he says .
The system also makes the counting process much more transparent
Chief electoral officer Kawsu Ceesay
" The drums are painted in the colour of the candidate 's party and have their photograph and party symbol . "
Incumbent President Yahya Jammeh 's drum is green and his rivals Ousainou Darboe and Halifa Sallah are yellow and grey respectively .
Sand or sawdust is also put into the bottom of the drum before it is inspected by party agents and shut with numbered seals so that a second sound is not heard .
Afterwards voters have their finger dipped in indelible ink .
Marbles have to be posted through a pipe at the top of the drum and those left on top are regarded as spoilt ballots .
" The system also makes the counting process much more transparent , " Mr Ceesay says .
The marbles are placed into trays with either 200 or 500 holes - similar to a solitaire board - which makes it easy for officials to verify numbers .

Parents who have seen " To Catch a Predator " on Dateline NBC are asking how much they should be worrying about their social - networking kids .
They need to know that the Predator series is no representation of risks to youth on the social Web .
It 's not even presenting a credible picture of sexual predation in general , we find in an in - depth look at the social costs of producing " The Shame Game " in the Columbia Journalism Review .
It shows how Dateline is fueling public fears not because it 's representing reality but because it 's representing reality TV .
" The explanation of why Dateline has seized on this mythical trend [ of growing numbers of sexual predators ] to anchor its venerable news show , " CJR suggests , " is that reality TV has so altered the broadcast landscape that traditional newsmagazine fare -- no matter how provocative -- just does n't cut it anymore . "
The CJR article continues , " Dateline has argued that ' Predator ' serves a genuine public good , but it could be argued that , in fact , Dateline is doing the public a disservice . "
One significant disservice is the way Dateline presented the numbers .
" When Attorney General Alberto Gonzales gave a speech about a major initiative to combat the ' growing problem ' of Internet predators , he cited a statistic that 50,000 such would - be pedophiles were prowling the Net at any given moment and attributed it to Dateline . "
An investigative reporter looked into the figure Attorney General Gonzales used and found Dateline had gotten it from " a retired FBI agent who consulted with the show " and who , when asked , suggested he kind of pulled it out of the air ( Dateline has since disowned the figure , CJR adds ) .
Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal refers in a January press release to " the towering danger of sexual predators . "
He has been working with attorneys general in many states on this , so I called a couple of AGs ' offices themselves for a more reality - based figure , not for predators but for something more concrete : cases of child exploitation related to social - networking sites nationwide .
I was given an approximate figure of 100 known cases - in 2005 , the best figure they had , and all MySpace - related because the number came from a Lexis - Nexis search of news media reports ( parents may have noticed that the news media have focused largely on MySpace ) .
The Uniform Crime Reporting System has n't caught up with cybercrime , I was told by an aide .
One hundred cases is 100 too many , but parents also deserve to hear how these cases occur .
As social media researcher Danah Boyd recently said in an interview at AlterNet , " we do not have a single case related to MySpace where someone has been abducted .
We 've had plenty of press coverage of these things , and every single one of them has proven not to be an abduction , but a runaway situation , or the kid was abducted by their noncustodial parent " ( to her last point , " according to data compiled by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children , more than 70 % of sexual abuse of children is perpetrated by family members or family friends , " CJR reports - not by men like those caught by Dateline ) .
In other words , in all the social - networking - related cases we know of so far , the minor went to meet the adult .
These kids are seeking the wrong kind of validation , support , or " thrills " by communicating with strangers .
They 're high - risk teens who are not getting the validation and support all children need and deserve from their families and friends .
They 're engaging in self - destructive behavior when contacted and groomed by strangers via email , online chat , IM , and social - networking and other kinds of Web sites .
Such contacts existed long before online social networking and of course long before the Web came along .
Let 's look at those contacts for a moment :
A study released last summer by the Crimes Against Children Research Center ( CACRC ) at the University of New Hampshire " found that the number of kids getting unwanted sexual advances on the Internet was in fact declining , " CJR reports .
Most kids simply delete those messages , and if they do , their senders have no way of knowing their physical location unless they broadcast it on a public Web page .
" That does n't mean Internet sex predators do n't exist , but Dateline heavily skews reality by devoting hour after hour of primetime programming to the phenomenon . "
So do other news outlets , such as ABC News , last spring misrepresenting the CACRC 's landmark 2000 study by saying that " one in five children has been approached by online predators . "
If they had a chance to read that study , parents will find that less than a quarter ( 24 % ) of those solicitations came from people 18 and older .
Only 3 % of the youth surveyed received solicitations that were " aggressive . "
" The [ CACRC study 's ] authors define ' aggressive ' as 'a solicitor who asked to meet them somewhere , called them on the telephone ; or sent them regular mail , money , or gifts ' , " we tell you in Chapter 5 of our book , MySpace Unraveled .
The figure for adult - to - teen aggressive solicitations was about 1 in 100 .
Still too high a number , but far fewer than one in seven ( the CACRC 's latest figure ) , and it 's important to note that the 2000 study also said " none of the solicitations led to an actual sexual contact or assault . "
Cyberbullies
Now let 's look at a very different number deserving of parental attention : peer harassment , or cyberbullying .
Compare the figure of 100 adult - to - minor predation cases in 2005 to 6.9 million " cases " of teen - to - teen cyberbullying .
The latter number comes from a 2006 study by criminology Profs .
J.W. Patchin and S. Hinduja which found that 33.4 % of US online teens have been victimized by cyberbullying ( see " Bullies Move Beyond the Schoolyard " ) .
According to Jupiter Research , there were 20.6 million US teens online by the end of last year .
One third ( 33.4 % ) of 20.6 million suggests 6.9 million incidents of cyberbullying .
These are the best figures we have on the noncriminal , peer - to - peer side of the social Web 's risk spectrum , but are actually much better numbers ( based on sound research methodology ) than the 100 cases of sexual predation compiled from news media stories .
The CACRC researchers tell me they 're starting work on a study that will update and vastly improve on that 100 - cases figure , but it wo n't be publicly available for over a year .
[ And consider one more notable number on the positive side of social networking : MySpace is the source of more than 100,000 visitors a year to the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline 's Web site .
It 's the hotline 's single biggest source of referrals .
More about this next week . ]
Even if the 100 - cases sexual - predation figure is multiplied 10 - fold and the 6.9 million cyberbullying one is n't conservative enough , we can still safely say that a great many more teen social networkers risk harassment by peers than by sexual predators .
This suggests to me that the focus of parents ' concerns at the very least needs to widen .
Yes , there are predators out there .
Alerted to that , online teens will be even better at deleting any sexual solicitations and not talking about sex online , the cardinal rules for protection from predation ( see " How to recognize grooming " ) .
But parents and teens also need to calmly , fearlessly discuss things like : what 's happening online among their peers at school , how we present ourselves online ( see " Protecting teen reputations on Web 2.0 " ) , what is / is n't appropriate to upload ( see " Teens ' child - porn convictions upheld " ) , how people try to manipulate people ( see " How social influencing works " ) , and how we all need to think about how we 're treating each other - online just as much as offline .

They are already used in Middlesbrough where people seen misbehaving can be told to stop via a loudspeaker , controlled by control centre staff .
About £ 500,000 will be spent adding speaker facilities to existing cameras .
Shadow home affairs minister James Brokenshire said the government should be " very careful " over the cameras .
Home Secretary John Reid told BBC
News there would be some people , " in the minority who will be more concerned about what they claim are civil liberties intrusions " .
" But the vast majority of people find that their life is more upset by people who make their life a misery in the inner cities because they can't go out and feel safe and secure in a healthy , clean environment because of a minority of people , " he added .
What really upsets people is their night out being destroyed or their environment being destroyed by a fairly small minority of people
John Reid
The talking cameras did not constitute " secret surveillance " , he said .
" It 's very public , it 's interactive . "
Competitions would also be held at schools in many of the areas for children to become the voice of the cameras , Mr Reid said .
Downing Street 's " respect tsar " , Louise Casey , said the cameras " nipped problems in the bud " and reduced bureaucracy .
" It gets across the message , ' please do n't litter our streets because someone else will have to pay to pick up that litter again ' , " she told BBC News .
" Half a billion pounds a year is spent picking up litter . "
' Scarecrow policing '
Mr Brokenshire told the BBC he had a number of concerns about the use of the talking cameras .
" Whether this is moving down a track of almost ' scarecrow ' policing rather than real policing - actually insuring that we have more bobbies on the beat - I think that 's what we really want to see , albeit that an initiative like this may be an effective tool in certain circumstances .
" We need to be very careful about applying this more generally . "
The talking cameras will be installed in Southwark , Barking and Dagenham , in London , Reading , Harlow , Norwich , Ipswich , Plymouth , Gloucester , Derby , Northampton , Mansfield , Nottingham , Coventry , Sandwell , Wirral , Blackpool , Salford , South Tyneside and Darlington .
HAVE YOUR SAY
A very silly idea from a government that is bereft of wisdom and out of touch

In Middlesbrough , staff in a control centre monitor pictures from 12 talking cameras and can communicate directly with people on the street .
Local councillor Barry Coppinger says the scheme has prevented fights and criminal damage and cut litter levels .
" Generally , I think it has raised awareness that the town centre is a safe place to visit and also that we are keeping an eye open to make sure it is safe , " he said .
But opponent and campaigner Steve Hills said : " Apart from being absurd , I think it 's rather sad that we should have faceless cameras barking at us on orders from who ?
Who sets these cameras up ? "
There are an estimated 4.2 million CCTV cameras in Britain .
A recent study by the government 's privacy watchdog , the Information Commissioner , warned that Britain was becoming a " surveillance society " .
Most software projects fail .
But that does n't mean yours has to .
The first question you should ask is a deceptively simple one : how big is it ?
Steve McConnell explains in Software Estimation : Demystifying the Black Art :
[ For a software project ] , size is easily the most significant determinant of effort , cost , and schedule .
The kind of software you 're developing comes in second , and personnel factors are a close third .
The programming language and environment you use are not first - tier influences on project outcome , but they are a first - tier influence on the estimate .
All other things being equal , large projects tend to fail .
That 's probably not news to anyone familiar with Metcalfe 's Law and Diseconomies of Scale .
So if the three most important factors determining the outcome of a software project are ...
Project size Kind of software being developed Personnel factors
... in that order , what else is left ?
If you can get those three factors under control -- if you 're developing a small , simple CRUD database website with a dream team of tightly gelled superstar developers , are you done ?
Of course there 's never any guarantee of project success , but can you at least say you 've performed adequate risk management ?
I 'm not so sure .
According to Bill de hra , you also have to consider the three pillars :
The conclusion I draw from this and my own experience having migrating my fair share of source trees is that the version control system is a first order effect on software , along with two others - the build system and the bugtracker .
Those choices impact absolutely everything else .
Things like IDEs , by comparison , do n't matter at all .
Even choice of methodology might matter less .
Although I 'm betting there are plenty of software and management teams out there that see version control , build systems and bugtrackers as being incidental to the work , not mission critical tools .
Bill 's analysis came as a pleasant surprise to me , because it 's exactly the same conclusion I reached while working with Microsoft 's Team System .
Once you get the three pillars in place ...
Version control Work item tracking Build system
... it 's a major improvement in software engineering quality for any software development project .
Of course , you do n't have to use Team System to get there , but a huge part of the value proposition for Team System is that it's " software engineering in a box " .
It provides tight integration between these three pre-installed pieces , with no complex configuration required .
However you get there , it 's just plain good software engineering to have these essentials -- the three pillars -- in place before proceeding too far on a software project .
So if we set up our dream team of tightly gelled superstar developers working on our small , simple CRUD database website with an outstanding best - of - breed integrated set of source control , work item tracking , and build tools -- are we done ?
Have we mitigated all the major project risks and set ourselves up to effortlessly , weightlessly fall into the pit of success ?
Sadly , no .
Bill notes that choosing a framework poorly suited to your problem domain can have a crippling effect on your productivity , too .
The relative verbosity of programming languages is n't the interesting thing ; nor is typing doctrine .
What 's interesting is the culture of frameworks and what different communities deem valuable .
My sense of it is that on Java , too many web frameworks - think JSF , or Struts 1.x - consider the Web something you work around using software patterns .
The goal is get off the web , and back into middleware .
Whereas a framework like Django or Rails is purpose - built for the Web ; integrating with the internal enterprise is a non-goal .
ETag support is just one example ; there are so many things frameworks like Rails / Django do ranging from architectural patterns around state management , to URL design , to testing , to template dispatching , to result pagination , right down to table coloring that the cumulative effect on productivity is startling .
I suspect designing for the Web instead of around it is at least as important as language choice .
So maybe the real lesson here is that software project success is n't about doing any one particular thing right ; it 's the much more daunting task of not doing anything wrong .
It certainly gives you a new appreciation for those rare successful software projects that somehow managed to snatch victory from the jaws of defeat .

We 'll have to keep a close eye on the litigation if it happens .

See , this is the sort of thing I 'm talking about : Appeals court reverses conviction for GOP official in New Hampshire phone - jamming case http://seattlepi.nwsourc...420AP_Phone_Jamming.html
CONCORD , N.H. ---
A federal appeals court on Wednesday reversed the conviction and sentence of a former Republican National Committee official accused in a phone - jamming plot on Election Day 2002 .
James Tobin , the former regional chairman of President Bush 's re-election campaign , was convicted in 2005 of helping to arrange more than 800 hang - up calls that jammed get - out - the - vote phone lines set up by the state Democratic Party and the Manchester firefighters ' union for about an hour .
Republican John Sununu defeated then - Gov. Jeanne Shaheen for the Senate that day .
Tobin was sentenced to 10 months in prison on charges of telephone harassment .
But the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Boston ruled that the statute under which Tobin was convicted " is not a close fit " for what Tobin did and questioned whether the government showed that Tobin intended to harass .
A Justice Department spokesman said prosecutors were reviewing the decision , and did not say if they planned to appeal .
There 's more to the article , but that 's the jist of it .

What is the status of the King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association et. al. v. J. Kenneth Blackwell lawsuit ????
On September 7 , 2006 U.S. District Judge Algernon L. Marbley issued an order to all 88 Ohio Board of Elections to protect the 2004 Presidential election ballots as evidence in the King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association et. al. v. J. Kenneth Blackwell lawsuit .
Plaintiffs in the King Lincoln case contend that Ohio Secretary of State J. Kenneth Blackwell violated the civil rights of various inner city African American voters during his administration of the 2004 presidential election .
The ballots are needed in order for the plaintiffs to establish their claim that there was an ongoing pattern and practice of targeting and disenfranchising African American voters .
Blackwell had made clear his intent to rid himself of the 2004 election evidence .
Federal law says ballots must be preserved 22 months after a presidential election , which would have allowed the Board of Elections to shredded all on September 2 , 2006 as Blackwell had already ordered .
Will the 2004 Presidential election ballots ever be fairly recounted ????

" 11 . In Butler County , a Board of Elections employee volunteered the information that “ the punch cards have always worked well for us , ” and “ the tabulators have always worked well in the past , ” but that on the morning of Election Day , November 2 , 2004 , a technician from ES&S ( Election Systems & Software ) came to the Board of Elections office and “ reprogrammed all of our tabulators . ”
It is my understanding that the technician , whose name I hope to ascertain , was uninvited .
The employee stated that there were six tabulators ( four were utilized , and two were on standby ) .

County Emergency Services Director Frank
Young said last week that in a face - to - face meeting with an FBI agent , he was warned that Warren County , outside Cincinnati , faced a “ terrorist threat . ”
County Commissioners President Pat South amplified , insisting to us at Countdown that her jurisdiction had received a series of memos from Homeland Security about the threat .
“ These memos were sent out statewide , not just to Warren County , and they included a lot of planning tools and resources to use for election day security .
“ In a face to face meeting between the FBI and our director of Emergency Services , ” Ms. South continued , “ we were informed that on a scale from 1 to 10 , the tri-state area of Southwest Ohio was ranked at a high 8 to a low 9 in terms of security risk .
Warren County in particular , was rated at 10 . ”
But the Bureau says it issued no such warning .
“ The FBI did not notify anyone in Warren County of any specific terrorist threat to Warren County before Election Day , ” FBI spokesman Michael Brooks told Enquirer reporters Erica Solvig and Dan Horn .

AFP
A California appeals court judge has ruled in favor of a petition filed by the EFF that frustrates Apple 's attempt to force rumor sites AppleInsider and Powerpage to reveal their sources .
In 2004 , web site AppleInsider published an " exclusive " account of a new Apple product alleged to be in development , a breakout box for GarageBand dubbed Asteroid ( presumably because it allowed you to rock .
Rimshot ! ) .
The ruling concludes that trade secrets do not categorically transcend freedom of the press , that there is no relevant legal distinction between journalistic blogging and journalism with regards to the shield law , and that Apple 's attempt to subpoena the e-mail service provider of one of the sites was a violation of the federal Stored Communications Act .
A brief history of Apple v. Does , and its significance
Following the unauthorized disclosure of alleged proprietary Apple trade secrets , Apple subpoenaed ( PDF ) several web site publishers along with their e-mail providers in order to discover where they got their information about Asteroid .
Challenging Apple 's subpoenas , the EFF filed a petition ( PDF ) for a protective order in Santa Clara Superior Court insisting that the site 's and their works are entitled to protection under the shield law .
Then in March of 2005 , Superior Court Judge James Kleinberg issued a decision ( PDF ) in favor of Apple , asserting that the legal protections conferred upon journalists by the first amendment and the California shield law do not imbue reporters with the right to disseminate trade secrets divulged to them by others .
The EFF appealed ( PDF ) the ruling , suggesting that coerced disclosure of journalistic sources would silence potential whistle - blowers by depriving them of the ability to remain anonymous .
Pointing out that important information about dangerous products could be obscured from public scrutiny by the excessive application of trade secret laws , the EFF argued that Apple should n't be allowed to arbitrarily silence journalists when the company had failed to pursue due diligence and internal investigation .
Under the interpretation of the first amendment , subpoenas necessitating disclosure of a journalist 's source are supposed to be used only when no other means of attaining the relevant information are available .
The EFF hoped to demonstrate that Apple had not conducted their own investigation in good faith .
In September of 2005 , additional evidence emerged to support the EFF 's claim that Apple had failed to internally investigate the leak before initiating legal action , a distinctly ironic revelation in light of the fact that Apple had attempted to deflect examination of its internal investigatory policies by claiming that the procedures used in their investigations were themselves trade secrets .
During the appellate court proceedings , the judges vigorously examined Apple 's claims , challenging the computer company 's assertion that the information disclosed by the journalists constituted a trade secret , and questioning the adequacy of Apple 's internal investigation .
Understanding California 's shield law
In general , shield laws are designed to prevent journalists from being held in contempt of court for refusing to disclose a source .
The California shield law specifically offers this protection to any " publisher , editor , reporter , or other person connected with or employed upon a newspaper , magazine , or other periodical publication or by a press association or wire service , or any person who has been so connected or so employed . "
The law states that individuals that are eligible for protection cannot be compelled " to disclose , in any proceeding as defined in ?
901 , the source of any information procured while so connected or employed for publication in a newspaper , magazine or any other periodical publication or for refusing to disclose any unpublished information obtained or prepared in gathering , receiving or processing of information for communication to the public . "
Section b of the California shield law extends the same protections to radio and television news reporters .
The California shield law only has one major exception : shield protection is not applicable when the testimony of a journalist is required in order to ensure that a defendant in a criminal case receives the constitutional right to a fair trial .
In 2000 , the California shield law was expanded to add some minor additional protections in order to prevent law enforcement agencies from exploiting loopholes in the legislation .
When Assemblywoman Carol Midgen proposed the expansion , she also issued a legislative report that articulated with great clarity the importance of the shield law .
The report contained the following tremendously cogent summary :
Journalists are professional investigators .
The main purpose of the shield law is to prevent government from making journalists its investigative agents and to prevent a journalist who is trying to cover the story from becoming part of the story ( which makes them wholly unable to cover it ) .
Increasingly , when a criminal case is newsworthy , the first thing ( not the last thing ) defense attorneys do is subpoena any journalist who has covered the story .
In this case , Apple v. Does , applicability of the shield law is an important aspect .
In a way , Apple is attempting to utilize the writers in question as its own investigators , trying to force them to reveal the source of Apple 's leak so that the company wont have to fully pursue an internal investigation .
Apple believes that it has the authority to force compliance with its demands in part because the company 's legal representatives are convinced that bloggers are not entitled to shield law protection .
Although the superior court sided with Apple , the appellate court sided with the bloggers .
The appellate court ruling
The decision ( PDF ) issued by the California Court of Appeals in favor of the petitioners echoes many of the concerns articulated by the EFF .
One of the most significant sections of the decision discusses the shield law and its applicability to the petitioners and this particular case .
Apple argued that the petitioners intentionally engaged in " trade secret misappropriation , " and that the goal of the petitioners ' articles was not journalistic in nature .
The appellate judges rejected the distinction , ruling that any effort to establish distinctions that address journalistic legitimacy is fundamentally antithetical to the function of the first amendment :
" We can think of no workable test or principle that would distinguish ' legitimate ' from ' illegitimate ' news .
Any attempt by courts to draw such a distinction would imperil a fundamental purpose of the First Amendment , which is to identify the best , most important , and most valuable ideas not by any sociological or economic formula , rule of law , or process of government , but through the rough and tumble competition of the memetic marketplace . "
Now we get to Apple 's claim that bloggers are not entitled to shield law protection .
This is possibly the single most important issue associated with this case , because it deals directly with the question of whether or not bloggers have the same rights as professional journalists .
Apple 's assumption regarding applicability of the shield law to bloggers is based on two arguments :
Apple says that the petitioners do not fall into any of the categories of individuals entitled to protection under the terms of the California shield law , and that the shield law does not recognize or address Internet publications .
Apple claims that bloggers " are not members of any professional community governed by ethical and professional standards , " and that shield law protection could then lead to abuse and misconduct .
( Ironically , if trade secrets were completely protected from journalistic disclosure as Apple desires , intellectual property law could also be be abused to conceal misconduct . )
In the decision , the judges argue that Internet news publication by bloggers is functionally identical to professional journalism within the context of the shield law :
" [ T ] he open and deliberate publication on a news - oriented Web site of news gathered for that purpose by the site 's operators ... appears conceptually indistinguishable from publishing a newspaper , and we see no theoretical basis for treating it differently .
Beyond casting aspersions on the legitimacy of petitioners ' enterprise , Apple offers no cogent reason to conclude that they fall outside the shield law 's protection . "
With regards to Internet publications , the judges concluded that the term " periodical publication " is applicable to the Mac rumor sites , and that the petitioners are entitled to shield law protection as a result :
" [ The legislature ] must have intended that the statute protect publications like petitioners ' , which differ from traditional periodicals only in their tendency , which flows directly from the advanced technology they employ , to continuously update their content .
We conclude that petitioners are entitled to the protection of the shield law , which precludes punishing as contempt a refusal by them to disclose unpublished information . "
Although the judges do not state outright that bloggers are entitled to shield law protection ( they explicitly avoid doing so because they feel that the term " blog " is too amorphous to be the subject of a legal precedent ) , they more or less imply that those who work on web based publications designed to provide news are entitled to shield law protection , and need not reveal their sources .
The judges also briefly addressed whether or not the petitioners are entitled to the constitutional right to freedom of the press .
This issue receives only superficial attention , because the matter is simply not disputed by Apple .
The judges state the obvious :
" [ W]e can see no sustainable basis to distinguish petitioners from the reporters , editors , and publishers who provide news to the public through traditional print and broadcast media .
It is established without contradiction that they gather , select , and prepare , for purposes of publication to a mass audience , information about current events of interest and concern to that audience . "
In the subsection entitled Importance of Preserving Confidentiality , the judges examine the implications of Apple 's claims and discuss the importance of protecting the identity of journalistic sources .
The judges start off the section by analyzing Apple 's argument that the public has no right to access corporate trade secrets .
The appellate judges disagree with Judge Kleinberg , and argue that classifying a piece of information as a trade secret does not give it unlimited protection from journalistic disclosure :
Apple first contends that there is and can be no public interest in the disclosures here because " the public has no right to know a company 's trade secrets . "
Surely this statement cannot stand as a categorical proposition .
As recent history illustrates , business entities may adopt secret practices that threaten not only their own survival and the investments of their shareholders but the welfare of a whole industry , sector , or community .
Labeling such matters " confidential " and " proprietary " cannot drain them of compelling public interest .
Timely disclosure might avert the infliction of unmeasured harm on many thousands of individuals , following in the noblest traditions , and serving the highest functions , of a free and vigilant press .
It therefore cannot be declared that publication of " trade secrets " is ipso facto outside the sphere of matters appropriately deemed of " great public importance . "
Next , the judges approach the difficult issue of resolving conflicts between the rights of intellectual property holders and the rights of journalists .
In the decision , the judges state that when intellectual property rights conflict directly with the journalistic function of disclosure in the name of public interest , freedom of expression necessarily takes priority :
This case involves not a purely private theft of secrets for venal advantage , but a journalistic disclosure to , in the trial court 's words , " an interested public . "
In such a setting , whatever is given to trade secrets law is taken away from the freedom of speech .
In the abstract , at least , it seems plain that where both cannot be accommodated , it is the statutory quasi - property right that must give way , not the deeply rooted constitutional right to share and acquire information .
The decision also addresses issues relating to the content and nature of the articles written by the petitioners .
The judges point out that the " trade secrets " exposed by the Apple rumor sites did n't include any specific information regarding technological methods or innovations , and that the Asteroid device itself is n't particularly unique or innovative .
The judges seem to feel that articles about the future release of a product carry more value as items of public interest than articles that disclose the secret methods and techniques used by a product :
Here , no proprietary technology was exposed or compromised .
There is no suggestion that anything in petitioners ' articles could help anyone to build a product competing with Asteroid .
Indeed there is no indication that Asteroid embodied any new technology that could be compromised .
...
The newsworthiness of petitioners ' articles thus resided not in any technical disclosures about the product but in the fact that Apple was planning to release such a product , thereby moving into the market for home recording hardware .
...
Such a secret plan may possess the legal attributes of a trade secret ; that is a question we are not here required to decide .
But it is of a different order than a secret recipe for a product .
And more to the point , the fact of its impending release carries a legitimate interest to the public that a recipe is unlikely to possess .
The decision also addresses the intrinsic newsworthiness of the content in question .
The appellate court judges challenge Judge Kleinberg 's assumption that , although public interest is served by disclosure of safety hazards , it is not served by disclosure of an upcoming product release .
The appellate judges argue that the release of new products , particularly technological products , can have a profound impact on society , and consequently constitute a subject of public interest :
" More generally , we believe courts must be extremely wary about declaring what information is worthy of publication and what information is not .
At first glance it might seem that Asteroid is nothing more than a hobbyist 's gadget with no ponderable bearing on the great issues of the day .
But such an impression would be , in our view , erroneous .
... [ Apple 's entry into the audio production market ] would inevitably contribute to blurring the line between professional and amateur audio production , and hence between professional and amateur composing and performing , in much the same way that the personal computer coupled with telecommunications technology has blurred the distinction between commercial and amateur publishing .
The decentralization of expressive capacity represented by such developments is unquestionably one of the most significant cultural developments since the invention of the printing press . "
Although I think the judges overstate the significance of Apple 's product , the point they make is valid and very important .
Product releases can have a profound impact on the technology industry , on consumers , and on the very nature of modern society .
Although Asteroid itself may not be particularly significant , the availability of information about such products is essential to modern consumers , and the judges argue that unfettered access to such information is a fundamental right :
" It is often impossible to predict with confidence which technological changes will affect individual and collective life dramatically , and which will come and go without lasting effects .
Any of them may revolutionize society in ways we can only guess at .
The lawful acquisition of information necessary to anticipate and respond to such changes is the birthright of every human , formally enshrined for Americans in our state and federal constitutions .
The publications at issue here fully implicated that birthright and the interests protected by those constitutional guarantees . "
The ruling of the appellate court and the issues addressed in the written decision represent an enormous victory for free speech advocates and the entire independent press community .
Assuming that the decision does n't get overturned by a higher court , the precedent established by this case could potentially help to ensure that journalistic bloggers receive full protection under state shield laws .
This case also affirms that intellectual property law does n't universally take priority over freedom of speech .
EFF Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl comments :
" Today 's decision is a victory for the rights of journalists , whether online or offline , and for the public at large , " said EFF Staff Attorney Kurt Opsahl , who argued the case before the appeals court last month .
" The court has upheld the strong protections for the free flow of information to the press , and from the press to the public . "
As a journalist that specializes in technology , I have had countless opportunities over the years to witness the impact of emerging technologies and I can't help but agree with the assessment of the judges as a result .
Access to information about emerging technologies and technological products is necessary for those that wish to live and thrive in the modern world .
Without information about the latest technologies , we can't make informed purchasing decisions , and we will be unable to take advantage of the fruits of technological progress .
As a result , the availability of such information ( or sometimes , the lack thereof ) has a profound impact on the quality of our lives .
It is encouraging to see judges openly acknowledging the value and importance of independent Internet news sources , and actively trying to protect them .

John Buse , president - elect of the American Diabetes Association and faculty member at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill , cited “ a worrisome trend in cardiovascular deaths and severe adverse events ” among patients using the drug in a letter to the agency in March 2000 .
The FDA sent Glaxo a warning letter in July 2001 after its own monitoring , saying the company ’s sales representatives had played down safety concerns and asking the company to send out a letter to doctors warning them of the risks .
The company sent out the letters on September 6 , 2001 , according to an article in the New York Times , which first reported the story .
The news comes after a pooled analysis of dozens of trials , published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday , concluded that Avandia increased the risk of heart attack by 43 percent and cardiac - related death by 64 percent .
Glaxo has disagreed with the study findings .
But shares in Europe ’s biggest drugmaker have taken a hit since the article Monday , on fears for sales , profits and the risk of lawsuits that could potentially reach billions of dollars .
Avandia is Glaxo ’s second - biggest seller , bringing in 1.6 billion pounds ( $ 3.16 billion ) and accounting for 7 percent of group revenues -- and significantly more of profits -- in 2006 .
Glaxo , Buse and the FDA could not be reached immediately .
The Times cited Buse as saying that his opinion of Avandia had not changed , but that regulators should not rush to judgment and instead wait for the results of a larger study now being conducted by Glaxo .
The paper also cited a Glaxo spokeswoman as saying the company “ strongly disagreed ” with the allegations in Buse ’s letter , “ which we found to be unbalanced and unsubstantiated . ”
“ We took the time to meet and talk with Dr. Buse at length about his concerns , ” the paper quoted spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne as saying .
“ We explained our reasons for why we disagreed with his characterization of the cardiovascular safety profile of Avandia . ”
Referring to the FDA ’s warning letter , the paper cited Rhyne as saying , “ Action was taken at the time to ensure representatives of the company were accurately reflecting the label for the product in any commercial activity . ”
Jessica Leighton , a deputy commissioner at the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene , also cautioned people inside buildings near the blast to close windows and set air - conditioners to recirculate the air inside instead of drawing in air from outside .
As people on the sidewalks scrambled to flee the blast and office workers in the buildings above looked down in horror , debris from the geyser pelted nearby skyscrapers .
Then it rained on the streets like a sudden hailstorm .
Some witnesses said the jet of steam roared like Niagara Falls .
Some people ran so fast their shoes came off .
Others dropped their briefcases and purses .
Men in tailored suits were caught in a lapel - singeing cloud .
At a health club high up in the Grand Hyatt hotel next to Grand Central , people working out on the treadmills said the explosion was so powerful they worried the building would collapse .
The steam shot up from a crater that looked like that of a volcano , with orange flames and bubbling mud around the edges .
The explosion packed enough force to flip over a tow truck that ended up in the crater , which was about 35 by 40 feet .
Several hours after the blast , officials said the crater could grow even larger because pavement at the edges was in danger of collapse .

The cloud of steam — and the hail of debris that followed — lasted more than two hours and immediately raised concerns about asbestos , which was used when the pipe was laid in the 1920s .
Officials advised people who had been in the neighborhood to discard their clothes and bathe carefully .
The mayor said the explosion appeared to have been caused by cold water that reached the pipe , which measured more than a foot and half in diameter and dated to 1924 .
“ Cold water apparently causes these to explode , ” he said .
Con Edison , which maintains the steam pipes beneath the city ’s streets , said the pipe ruptured at 5:56 p.m. Kevin Burke , the chairman of Con Edison , said crews had checked the pipe after the thunderstorm that soaked the city in the morning .
He said a heavy rain can cause a “ vapor condition ” if rainwater seeps onto a steam pipe , causing the steam to condense .
He said the inspection earlier in the day had given no indication that anything was amiss .

Industry , I write today in what began , at least , as a conflicted mixture of resignation and alarm .
Probably you do not recognize my name , but it 's both embossed and encoded on my credit card , so possibly you should .
I have been one of the staunchest defenders of your copyrights ever since the virtualization of music distribution began to challenge them , and I 've been one of your most dedicated personal patrons since I was old enough to spend my own money .
Originally I was a customer of necessity , of course , but I 'm a computer and internet professional for a living , and have been fully aware of every iteration of the technical possibilities for acquiring music without paying for it .
And yet , I have continued to pay .
In a single year , not too long ago , I bought 1000 CDs , and most of them were yours .
I continue to pay still .
I bought two CDs this week , and will almost certainly buy more than 100 over the course of this calendar year .
I have paid for legal downloads , as well .
I have stubbornly forgiven you your trespasses against everyone you nominally serve , and kept supporting the idea of music as a Big Business .
I have never condoned your numeric monopolies and tasteless denominator - lowering , but I support the dream of musicians being able to simply make music for their living , rather than operating themselves as a business , and somewhere far back in history that was what Industry allowed .
But I have also now started stealing your music .
I have n't stolen much , but I 'm sure you will agree that the moral issue is not merely one of quantity .
I have been one of the last independent apologists for a moral kernel , elusive now to perhaps the point of imagination , in your corrupt and desperate retreat , but now even I have given up .
I still buy , but now I also steal .
You have forfeited your right to my loyalty .
And maybe you 're too lost and beaten to care , and even more likely it 's too late to matter , but for a few minutes I 'm going to pretend that neither of those things are so .
I 'm going to pretend that you 're still capable of awareness and reason , and in a spirit of truth that you long ago stopped deserving , while I 've still taken little enough to list , I 'm going to tell you exactly what I have stolen from you , and why .
Idlewild : Warnings / Promises
I have stolen from you where you have tried to steal from me .
This Idlewild album came out months ago in Europe .
It will come out in a couple more months in the US .
Do n't you realize that I know this ?
The world is all connected now , we are not beholden to you for information .
An import copy of this record would cost me $ 26 .
The domestic copy will cost me $ 13 at most , probably less .
I refuse to pay you to play these pointless games with arbitrary dates and obsolete borders .
I can outlast you .
I refuse to pay you twice for withholding music when it 's supposed to be your job to bring it to me .
" You say something stupid like " , they sing , " ' Love steals us from loneliness ' " , but I doubt you 've even listened to this .
We are in here talking to each other about solitude and connection and our grandest mistakes , those of us for whom music is human , and you are outside in the streets shouting about damage and margins and some venal thing you 've obscenely labeled sacred , and insisting you are always right .
And we are in here listening to records without you .
Kyo : Kyo I have stolen from you where you wo n't let me buy .
Kyo are a French band I had to go to France to discover , and was n't that supposed to be the kind of thing I 'm paying you for ?
While you were watching people vying on TV to be the next disposable idol , I was wondering what the rest of the world sounds like .
Half the time it does n't sound all that different , sadly , because they 're probably watching those same miserable shows , but sometimes the small differences are enough to make me happy .
Kyo skip and crackle and soar in tones surprisingly similar to the ones you so happily and briefly exploited when they were Savage Garden's , but your greed is n't even loyal to itself , so how can you hope for loyalty from anybody else ?
I 'll buy this the next time I 'm in Paris , if there are still record stores by then .
What 's the last promise you made and kept for years ?
Armin Van Buuren : 76 BT : Movement in Still Life
I have stolen from you where you 've refused to learn how to sell .
Thirty - second samples are enough for some purposes , but you picked that format out of fear , not insight .
For some things , thirty seconds are n't nearly enough .
I 'm trying to find my way into a new genre , in which songs are long and evolve slowly .
You should be eagerly welcoming me ; new loves always mean new records .
You should have people following me around with piles of CDs in their arms , trying to help me learn what I love , instead of all these security guards wearing ear - plugs and standing by the exits .
I will buy 100 records once I figure out which ones they are , so why are you trying to make it harder and more expensive for me to get through the first dozen I have to eliminate to find them ?
But you never understood this before , why should you now ?
If you want money for this music I 'm stealing in order to explore , I 'll give you some right after you retroactively rescind decades of petty no -return policies and give me my money back for all the records I 've uncomplainingly bought and hated .
I 'll give you some as soon as you help me find more records that balance Armin Van Buuren 's steadily cinematic atmosphere with BT 's show - off energy , and vice - versa .
Some of these things I 've stolen from you I do n't even listen to , I 'm just keeping them to spite you .
Jan Garbarek : In Praise of Dreams I have stolen from you where you 've refused to learn about my world .
I sometimes need mood flows , but I hate radio .
I do n't want a stream of randomness , I want a stream of variations on a theme .
I want to define the theme .
Some nights I just want three hours of dinner - party music that is unfamiliar in specific , but reliably semi-anonymous and evocatively meditative .
I need a dozen albums from which I 'll hear a third of the songs once each and that 's it , and I 'd pay you what that 's worth , but with the price you ask , the nothing I pay by stealing them is a whole lot closer to the right value .
John Zorn : Love , Madness and Mysticism I have stolen from you because I am confused and afraid , and intrigued by confusion and fear .
I do n't know whether this John Zorn record alienates me or fascinates me .
I certainly can't decide based on excerpts , and I probably wo n't have even the most tentative guess until I 've listened to it several times , more or less against my existing will .
If I decide it 's mind - expanding genius , I 'll happily pay for it .
If I decide it 's stochastic crap my old parameters justifiably excluded , I 'll delete it .
If you believed in your music , and in me , you 'd take that deal in an instant .
My patience costs me dearly , after all , and yours costs you nothing .
But you do n't believe in your music .
Most of the time you do n't even know what it is .
And you certainly do n't know me , or where my curiosity leads or misleads me .
So you invest nothing , and you should n't be surprised by your returns .
Cyndi Lauper : At Last I have stolen from you where you refuse to acknowledge what I 've already paid .
For the price you ask for concerts , you should throw in CDs .
For the price you ask for DVDs , you should include the audio files .
For the price you ask for real albums , you should give away covers records .
Muse : Hullabaloo
I have stolen from you where you are being stupid .
Do you know what 's on this album ?
Do you know how much it costs in the US ?
Tristania : Widow 's
Weed I have stolen from you because you never learn .
Never mind how long copyrights last in law , sometimes they should be waived years early .
Sometimes a band so decisively supersedes itself that an earlier attempt is rendered moot .
This Tristania album is like a charcoal sketch for an airbrush epic .
Three completed airbrush epics later , the old sketches should be gifts of trivia for the truly dedicated .
Paying for my own trial and error is bad enough ; paying for yours is inane .
Joe Jackson : Big World Joe Jackson : Blaze of Glory I have stolen from you where you have betrayed the music .
Why are these two great Joe Jackson albums out of print ?
Go ahead , sue me .
If you were doing your job , I 'd have paid for them already .
Orchestra Baobab : Specialist in All Styles
And at least once , I admit , I have stolen from you for mostly no fault of yours .
I think there is a copy of this record somewhere in our house .
Possibly we have only Pirates Choice , not this , and possibly it was all a dream and we do n't own either .
We had all of Belle 's African dance music out when we were working on our wedding soundtrack last summer , and after that we 're not sure what happened .
Belle's theory is that I re-shelved them in my collection , and now they are lost .
This is a subjectively reasonable guess , since from her perspective CDs go magically from my current - rotation crate by the window , where one can easily be found among a dozen or two , into my shelves , where the act of searching for one among thousands tends to become overwhelming long before the collection 's internal organizational structure has a chance to explain itself .
I , on the other hand , both understand my shelving and know how hopelessly out of character it would be of me to put a CD that is n't in my database onto my shelves .
My best competing theory is that she misplaced this record somewhere , which is subjectively reasonable because she does n't even have a database , and obviously people who do not keep databases are the sort of people who lose things .
And clearly this is not your problem , Industry , by its intrinsic nature , but that does n't mean you 're entirely exonerated .
The African dance albums ended up in a different pile mostly because we feared that the American three - minute spasm - pop ethos had rendered sinuous six - to nine - minute African dance songs untenable .
That was n't our doing .
Nor was the fact that it was easier to steal this album online than to find it in our house , which is much more a function of the net than our house .
If you insist on ignoring this reality , you share some responsibility for the way our culture warps .
If you try to rely on deliberate obscurity , you will lose .
If you bank on valueless repackaging , we will show you another sense of " valueless " .
If you copy - protect CDs knowing full well that law - abiding listeners want to play them on laptops and iPods and Linux boxes , you precipitate morally correct resentment and defiance .
If , with the resources of an entire industry of full - time workers and decades of catalogs and data and precedent , you serve music listeners less well than listeners and their hacked - together tech kludges serve each other , then you are defeated by your own market forces , and by your own market .
And these are only the handful of reasons I have for stealing .
Arguably some of them are good , some are not .
Other people may steal less , and for better reasons , and I 'm sure plenty steal more for worse or none .
But know , in the end , that you created this crisis .
You had decades of control , and you spent it on complacency and greed , and so evolved this inevitable rebellion .
You took everything you thought you could get away with , and now you are wheezy robber barons begging the government to protect your dwindling hoards .
I 've defended you for far too long .
You smiled when you first got away with selling a Billy Joel LP for $ 8.98 , and you can damn well smile again now when we fold the worthless thing into jagged thirds and ram it up your ass .
You created the aesthetic of disposability , and now you are its most beautifully disposable work .
We will mourn you in infinite song .

And yet when faced with the prospect of someone calling you on your stubbornness -- your stubbornness which has cost 3,431 Americans their lives and thousands more their limbs -- you , Mr. Bush , imply that if the Democrats do n't give you the money and give it to you entirely on your terms , the troops in Iraq will be stranded , or forced to serve longer , or have to throw bullets at the enemy with their bare hands .
How transcendentally , how historically , pathetic .

This is , in fact , a comment about ... betrayal .
Few men or women elected in our history - whether executive or legislative , state or national - have been sent into office with a mandate more obvious , nor instructions more clear :
Get us out of Iraq .
Yet after six months of preparation and execution - half a year gathering the strands of public support ; translating into action , the collective will of the nearly 70 percent of Americans who reject this War of Lies , the Democrats have managed only this :
* The Democratic leadership has surrendered to a president - if not the worst president , then easily the most selfish , in our history - who happily blackmails his own people , and uses his own military personnel as hostages to his asinine demand , that the Democrats " give the troops their money " ;
* The Democratic leadership has agreed to finance the deaths of Americans in a war that has only reduced the security of Americans ;
* The Democratic leadership has given Mr. Bush all that he wanted , with the only caveat being , not merely meaningless symbolism about benchmarks for the Iraqi government , but optional meaningless symbolism about benchmarks for the Iraqi government .
* The Democratic leadership has , in sum , claimed a compromise with the Administration , in which the only things truly compromised , are the trust of the voters , the ethics of the Democrats , and the lives of our brave , and doomed , friends , and family , in Iraq .
You , the men and women elected with the simplest of directions - Stop The War - have traded your strength , your bargaining position , and the uniform support of those who elected you ... for a handful of magic beans .
You may trot out every political cliché from the soft - soap , inside - the - beltway dictionary of boilerplate sound bites , about how this is the " beginning of the end " of Mr. Bush 's " carte blanche " in Iraq , about how this is a " first step . "
Well , Senator Reid , the only end at its beginning ... is our collective hope that you and your colleagues would do what is right , what is essential , what you were each elected and re-elected to do .
Because this " first step " ... is a step right off a cliff .
And this President !
How shameful it would be to watch an adult hold his breath , and threaten to continue to do so , until he turned blue .
But how horrifying it is to watch a President hold his breath and threaten to continue to do so , until innocent and patriotic Americans in harm 's way , are bled white .
You lead this country , sir ?
You claim to defend it ?
And yet when faced with the prospect of someone calling you on your stubbornness -- your stubbornness which has cost 3,431 Americans their lives and thousands more their limbs -- you , Mr. Bush , imply that if the Democrats do n't give you the money and give it to you entirely on your terms , the troops in Iraq will be stranded , or forced to serve longer , or have to throw bullets at the enemy with their bare hands .
How transcendentally , how historically , pathetic .
Any other president from any other moment in the panorama of our history would have , at the outset of this tawdry game of political chicken , declared that no matter what the other political side did , he would insure personally - first , last and always - that the troops would not suffer .
A President , Mr. Bush , uses the carte blanche he has already , not to manipulate an overlap of arriving and departing brigades into a ‘ second surge , ' but to say in unequivocal terms that if it takes every last dime of the monies already allocated , if it takes reneging on government contracts with Halliburton , he will make sure the troops are safe - even if the only safety to be found , is in getting them the hell out of there .
Well , any true President would have done that , sir .
You instead , used our troops as political pawns , then blamed the Democrats when you did so .
Not that these Democrats , who had this country 's support and sympathy up until 48 hours ago , have not since earned all the blame they can carry home .
" We seem to be very near the bleak choice between war and shame , " Winston Churchill wrote to Lord Moyne in the days after the British signed the Munich accords with Germany in 1938 .
" My feeling is that we shall choose shame , and then have war thrown in , a little later ... "
That 's what this is for the Democrats , is n't it ?
Their " Neville Chamberlain moment " before the Second World War .
All that 's missing is the landing at the airport , with the blinkered leader waving a piece of paper which he naively thought would guarantee " peace in our time , " but which his opponent would ignore with deceit .
The Democrats have merely streamlined the process .
Their piece of paper already says Mr. Bush can ignore it , with impugnity .
And where are the Democratic presidential hopefuls this evening ?
See they not , that to which the Senate and House leadership has blinded itself ?
Judging these candidates based on how they voted on the original Iraq authorization , or waiting for apologies for those votes , is ancient history now .
The Democratic nomination is likely to be decided ... tomorrow .
The talk of practical politics , the buying into of the President 's dishonest construction " fund - the - troops - or - they - will - be - in - jeopardy , " the promise of tougher action in September , is falling not on deaf ears , but rather falling on Americans who already told you what to do , and now perceive your ears as closed to practical politics .
Those who seek the Democratic nomination need to - for their own political futures and , with a thousand times more solemnity and importance , for the individual futures of our troops - denounce this betrayal , vote against it , and , if need be , unseat Majority Leader Reid and Speaker Pelosi if they continue down this path of guilty , fatal acquiescence to the tragically misguided will of a monomaniacal president .
For , ultimately , at this hour , the entire government has failed us .
* Mr. Reid , Mr. Hoyer , and the other Democrats ... have failed us .
They negotiated away that which they did not own , but had only been entrusted by us to protect : our collective will as the citizens of this country , that this brazen War of Lies be ended as rapidly and safely as possible .
* Mr. Bush and his government ... have failed us .
They have behaved venomously and without dignity - of course .
That is all at which Mr. Bush is gifted .
We are the ones providing any element of surprise or shock here .
With the exception of Senator Dodd and Senator Edwards , the Democratic presidential candidates have ( so far at least ) failed us .
They must now speak , and make plain how they view what has been given away to Mr. Bush , and what is yet to be given away tomorrow , and in the thousand tomorrows to come .
Because for the next fourteen months , the Democratic nominating process -- indeed the whole of our political discourse until further notice -- has , with the stroke of a cursed pen , become about one thing , and one thing alone .
The electorate figured this out , six months ago .
The President and the Republicans have not - doubtless will not .
The Democrats will figure it out , during the Memorial Day recess , when they go home and many of those who elected them will politely suggest they stay there - and permanently .
Because , on the subject of Iraq the people have been ahead of the media ....
Ahead of the government ...
Ahead of the politicians ...
For the last year , or two years , or maybe three .
Our politics ... is now about the answer to one briefly - worded question .
Mr. Bush has failed .
Mr. Warner has failed .
Mr. Reid has failed .
So .
Who among us will stop this war - this War of Lies ?
To he or she , fall the figurative keys to the nation .
To all the others - presidents and majority leaders and candidates and rank - and - file Congressmen and Senators of either party - there is only blame ... for this shameful , and bi-partisan , betrayal .

Blubber Bots are DIY robotic species that navigate autonomously and intelligently .
Blubber Bots float , dance , seek and sing .
They are light - seeking helium - filled balloons that graze the landscape in search of light and cell - phone signals .
If you make a call and wave your phone near a Blubber Bot , it will go into a flocking dance or sing you a special tune .
They bellow sounds similar to a whale ’s song and serenade you with melodies .
When not being played with , they rest for awhile , awakening periodically and seeking attention .
Social and friendly in nature , Blubber Bots like to play .
You can invite other Blubber Bots over for a party to watch a roomful flock and mingle .
They propel themselves using helium buoyancy and two directional motors .
They are a little clumsy though and bump into things .
Fortunately , Blubber Bots are born with a feeler ( bump switch ) to help them out of tricky situations .
At a click of a “ feeler ” they back up and head in a new direction .
If you 're in the Los Angeles area , come build your own Blubber Bot on Saturday , June 30th , at Machine Project , Echo Park , with Jed Berk , the creator of “ Transitional Species ” interactive sculptures that combine emerging technologies and familiar forms .

「 Web（サイトの構築） に は Lightweight Language（LL：軽量言語）が向いている」。「日本Rubyの会」の会長でツインスパークに勤務する高橋征義氏は2006年2月9日，東京・目黒で開催されている開発者向けカンファレンス「
Developers Summit 2006 （デブサミ2006）」の講演でこう語った。その理由は「
Webサイトの陳腐化のサイクル」にあるという。
高橋氏 は 「 Webサイトは構築してから3年経つと陳腐化する」と指摘する。ただ，壊れたわけでもないWebサイトを3年でリニューアルするには，事前に顧客と話をつけておく必要がある。3年で捨てる予定のアプリケーションの予算は少ない—これが，WebにはPHPやRubyといったLLが向いている理由である。Javaのような重量級の言語だと，10年持ちそうな設計や構造のアプリケーションを作ることになり，費用もそれなりに高額になってしまう。
高橋氏が勤務するツインスパークは，実際にLL（主としてPHP，最近は一部Ruby）を使って，陳腐化サイクルの早いWebサイトを構築している。Javaを使った重量級の開発では，たいてい「ユーザー企業の情報システム部門がシステムを発注し，大手システム・インテグレータ（SIer）が受注する」という形になる。一方，ツインスパークが請け負う仕事は「ユーザー企業の営業部門や広報部門がシステムを発注し，大手広告会社が受注する」という形が多いという。大手広告会社がツインスパークにシステム構築を依頼するわけである。顧客は技術に興味はなく，間にSIerもいない。つまり「技術面の判断はツインスパーク1社に集中する」（同氏）ため，開発側が都合のよい開発言語やフレームワークを選べるというメリットがある。もちろん，技術面での責任も1社に集中するため，契約が重要だという。
講演では，最近話題 のWebアプリケーション・フレームワーク「 Ruby on Rails」 （RailsやRoRと略す）の特徴についても触れた。Railsの特徴は，一般に「DRY（Don't Repeat Yourself：同じことを繰り返さない） 」 と「 Convention over Configuration（設定より規約を重視）」の二つだといわれている。しかし，高橋氏は「これらの特徴は他のフレームワークにもある」と指摘。Javaなどを使っている非LLユーザーにとっては，Railsが持つ「言語内DSL（Domain Specific Language） 」 「密結合 」 「非コンポーネント志向」の三つの特徴を理解することが重要だと述べた。
Railsは，Rubyのコードとして実行できる範囲内で，Rails独自の表記法を採用している。このような言語内DSLの例として，ほかにもRuby用のビルド・ツールであるRakeなどがあるという。
密結合は，現在のソフトウエア開発では一般に「よくないもの」とされている。柔軟性が欠如するからだ。ただ，Rubyはとても柔軟なメソッド呼び出しの仕組みを採用しているため，密結合との組み合わせは実はバランスがよい。高橋氏は「粗密と（言語の）硬軟のバランスが重要」と指摘する。
3番目の非コンポーネント志向は，Railsの開発者であるDavid Heinemeier Hansson氏（DHHと略す）がコンポーネント技術に懐疑的なところからきているという。小規模なシステムだとコンポーネントはうまく機能するが，コンポーネントの組み合わせが増えると動かなくなる。結局は「作り直したほうが早い」ことになる。このため，Railsは「早く作り直せる」「改修しつつ再利用できる」ことを念頭に開発されているという。

My fellow citizens , at this hour , American and coalition forces are in the early stages of military operations to disarm Iraq , to free its people and to defend the world from grave danger .
And with those words , George W. Bush announced the beginning of the Iraq war on March 19 , 2003 .
And on its fourth anniversary , let 's follow this war through the words of George Bush .
... my fellow Americans : Major combat operations in Iraq have ended .
In the battle of Iraq , the United States and our allies have prevailed .
- May , 2003
U.S. Fatalities : 139
The plan sets out ambitious timetables and clear benchmarks to measure progress and practical methods for achieving results .
In the 83 days since I announced the end of major combat operations in Iraq , we have made progress , steady progress , in restoring hope in a nation beaten down by decades of tyranny .
- July , 2003
U.S. Fatalities : 206
As America carries out its strategy for security and reconstruction , we need the resources to do the job in Iraq .
Soon I will send Congress a request for additional money we need to keep our commitments .
In this time of challenge of America , as we ask so much of our military , we in government have a solemn responsibility to give you every tool you need to achieve victory .
- September , 2003
U.S. Fatalities : 320
I 'm pleased to report back from the front lines that our troops are strong , morale is high and our military is confident we will prevail .
- November , 2003
U.S. Fatalities : 446
The liberty we prize is not America 's gift to the world ; it is God 's gift to humanity .

Today George Bush said :
Yet those on the ground are seeing some hopeful signs .
And on the ground :
An explosion at a Shiite mosque in Baghdad killed at least eight worshippers Monday , the fourth anniversary of the start of the war , while a series of car bombs struck the oil - rich city of Kirkuk in northern Iraq , killing 12 , police said .

Plenty of reasonable people can disagree about foreign policy .
What ’s really strange is when one reasonable position is completely and forcibly excluded from the public debate .
Such was the case after 9 - 11 .
Every close observer of the events of those days knows full well that these crimes were acts of revenge for US policy in the Muslim world .
The CIA and the 911 Commission said as much , the terrorists themselves proclaimed it , and Osama underscored the point by naming three issues in particular : US troops in Saudi Arabia , US sanctions against Iraq , and US funding of Israeli expansionism .
So far as I know , Ron Paul is the only prominent public figure in the six years since who has given an honest telling of this truth .
The explosive exchange occurred during the Republican Presidential debate in South Carolina .
Ron was asked if he really wants the troops to come home , and whether that is really a Republican position .
“ Well , ” he said , “ I think the party has lost its way , because the conservative wing of the Republican Party always advocated a noninterventionist foreign policy .
Senator Robert
Taft did n’t even want to be in NATO .
George Bush won the election in the year 2000 campaigning on a humble foreign policy — no nation - building , no policing of the world .
Republicans were elected to end the Korean War .
The Republicans were elected to end the Vietnam War .
There ’s a strong tradition of being anti-war in the Republican party .
It is the constitutional position .
It is the advice of the Founders to follow a non-interventionist foreign policy , stay out of entangling alliances , be friends with countries , negotiate and talk with them and trade with them . ”
He was then asked if 9 - 11 changed anything .
He responded that US foreign policy was a “ major contributing factor .
Have you ever read the reasons they attacked us ?
They attacked us because we ’ve been over there ; we ’ve been bombing Iraq for 10 years .
We ’ve been in the Middle East — I think Reagan was right .
We do n’t understand the irrationality of Middle Eastern politics .
So right now we ’re building an embassy in Iraq that ’s bigger than the Vatican .
We ’re building 14 permanent bases .
What would we say here if China was doing this in our country or in the Gulf of Mexico ?
We would be objecting .
We need to look at what we do from the perspective of what would happen if somebody else did it to us . “
And then out of the blue , he was asked whether we invited the attacks .
“ I ’m suggesting that we listen to the people who attacked us and the reason they did it , and they are delighted that we ’re over there because Osama bin Laden has said , ‘ I am glad you ’re over on our sand because we can target you so much easier . ’
They have already now since that time — have killed 3,400 of our men , and I do n’t think it was necessary . ”
Then the very archetype of the State Enforcer popped up to shout him down .
“ That ’s really an extraordinary statement , ” said Rudy Giuliani .
“ That ’s an extraordinary statement , as someone who lived through the attack of September 11 , that we invited the attack because we were attacking Iraq .
I do n’t think I ’ve heard that before , and I ’ve heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th . ”
Now , this is interesting because it is obvious that Ron never said that we invited the attacks .
This was a lie .
He said the US foreign policy was a “ contributing factor ” in why they attacked us , a fact which only a fool or a liar could deny .
Giuliani then went on to say that he has never “ heard that before ” — a statement that testifies to the extent of the blackout on this question .
Ron Paul was invited to respond , and concluded as follows :
“ I believe very sincerely that the CIA is correct when they teach and talk about blowback .
When we went into Iran in 1953 and installed the shah , yes , there was blowback .
A reaction to that was the taking of our hostages and that persists .
And if we ignore that , we ignore that at our own risk .
If we think that we can do what we want around the world and not incite hatred , then we have a problem .
They do n’t come here to attack us because we ’re rich and we ’re free .
They come and they attack us because we ’re over there .
I mean , what would we think if we were — if other foreign countries were doing that to us ? ”
Wow , he broke the great taboo in American political life !
Why this should be a taboo at all is unclear , but there it is .
But now that it is finally out in the open , this shocking theory that the terrorists were not merely freedom - hating madmen but perhaps had some actual motive for their crime , let ’s think a bit more about it .
It is a normal part of human experience that if you occupy , meddle , bully , and coerce , people who are affected by it all are going to get angry .
You do n’t have to be Muslim to get the point .
The problem is that most of the American people simply have no idea what has been happening in the last ten years .
Most Americans think that America the country is much like their own neighborhood : peaceful , happy , hard - working , law - abiding .
So when you tell people that the US is actually something completely different , they are shocked .

Why would anyone hate us ?
The problem is that the military wing of the US government is very different from your neighborhood .
After the Soviet Union crashed , US elites declared themselves masters of the universe , the only “ indispensable nation ” and the like .
All countries must ask the US for permission to have a nuclear program .
If we do n’t like your government , we can overthrow it .
Meanwhile , we sought a global empire unlike any in history : not just a sphere of interest but the entire world .
Laurence Vance has the details but here is the bottom line : one - third of a million deployed troops in 134 countries in 1000 locations in foreign countries .
All during the 1990s , the US attempted to starve the population of Iraq , with the result of hundreds of thousands of deaths .
Madeleine Albright said on national television that the deaths of 500,000 children ( the UN ’s number ) was “ worth it ” in order to achieve our aims , which were ostensibly the elimination of non-existent , non -US built weapons of mass destruction .
Yes , that annoyed a few people .
There were constant bombings in Iraq all these years .
And let us not forget how all this nonsense began : the first war in 1991 was waged in retaliation for a US - approved Iraqi invasion of its former province , Kuwait .
Saddam had good reason to think that the US ambassador was telling the truth about non-interference with Kuwait relations : Saddam was our ally all through the Iran - Iraq war and before .
Ron spoke about complications of the Middle East .
One of them is that the enemy we are now fighting , the Islamic extremists , are the very group that we supported and subsidized all through the 1980s in the name of fighting Communism .
That ’s the reason the US knows so much about their bunkers and hiding spots in Afghanistan : US tax dollars created them .
Now , I know this is a lot for the tender ears of Americans to take , who like to think that their government reflects their own values of faith , freedom , and friendliness .
But here is the point that libertarians have been trying to hammer home for many years : the US government is the enemy of the American people and their values .
It is not peaceful , it is not friendly , it is not motivated by the Christian faith but rather power and imperial lust .
Ron is such a wonderful person that I ’m sorry that he had to be the one to tell the truth .
One could sense in the debate that he was making an enormous sacrifice here .
After Giuliani spoke , the red -state fascists in the audience all started whooping up the bloodlust that the politicians have been encouraging for the last six years — a mindless display of Nazi - like nationalism that would cause the founding fathers to shudder with fear of what we ’ve become .
These people are frantic about terrorism and extremism abroad , but they need to take a good hard look in the mirror .
Thank you , Ron , for doing this .
We are all in your debt .

The Best of Llewellyn H. Rockwell , Jr.
He said Washington had already launched a non-military campaign using economic , psychological and political means to topple his socialist government and seize control of Venezuela 's vast oil reserves .
" We must continue developing the resistance war , that 's the anti-imperialist weapon .
We must think and prepare for the resistance war every day , " the president told hundreds of soldiers assembled at Tiuna Fort , a military base in the capital Caracas , on Sunday .
Wearing an olive - green uniform , red beret and presidential sash , Mr Chávez said Venezuela was locked in " asymmetrical warfare " with the US and that , if it led to combat , soldiers must be prepared to lay down their lives .
" It 's not just armed warfare , I 'm also referring to psychological warfare , media warfare , political warfare , economic warfare , " he said .
There was no immediate response from Washington , but the Bush administration has rejected previous claims that it was plotting to attack its outspoken South American foe .
Mr Chávez 's speech came on the eve of a trip to Russia , Belarus and Iran , hosts who share much of his antipathy towards Washington .
He said that while in Minsk he would put " the final touches " to a deal to buy an air defence system with long - range radar and missiles and in Moscow he would discuss the possible purchase of submarines .
Venezuela has recently purchased £ 1.5 bn worth of Russian weapons including 53 military helicopters , 24 SU - 30 Sukhoi fighter jets and 100,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles .
Mr Chávez stressed the build - up was a deterrent .
" We are strengthening Venezuela 's military power precisely to avoid imperial aggressions and assure peace , not to attack anybody . "
The air system was purely defensive , he said .
" But if somebody comes here , well then , ssssssshhh , " he said , imitating the sound of a missile .
The former paratrooper said US dirty tricks were evident in the student - led protests which greeted his decision last month not to renew the licence of RCTV , an opposition - aligned television station .
He also said Washington was trying to sabotage the Copa America , a pan-regional football tournament which Venezuela is due to host over the coming weeks .
The Bush administration tacitly backed a coup that briefly ousted Mr Chávez in 2002 and has made no secret of its distaste for a leader who has thrown an economic lifeline to Fidel Castro 's Cuba .
Mr Chávez claimed there have been numerous US - sponsored attempts on his life since the coup , but he has not provided details .
A major drug company is blocking access to a medicine that is cheaply and effectively saving thousands of people from going blind because it wants to launch a more expensive product on the market .
Ophthalmologists around the world , on their own initiative , are injecting tiny quantities of a colon cancer drug called Avastin into the eyes of patients with wet macular degeneration , a common condition of older age that can lead to severely impaired eyesight and blindness .
They report remarkable success at very low cost because one phial can be split and used for dozens of patients .
But Genentech , the company that invented Avastin , does not want it used in this way .
Instead it is applying to license a fragment of Avastin , called Lucentis , which is packaged in the tiny quantities suitable for eyes at a higher cost .
Speculation in the US suggests it could cost £ 1,000 per dose instead of less than £ 10 .
The company says Lucentis is specifically designed for eyes , with modifications over Avastin , and has been through 10 years of testing to prove it is safe .
Unless Avastin is approved in the UK by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence ( Nice ) it will not be universally available within the NHS .
But because Genentech declines to apply for a licence for this use of Avastin , Nice can not consider it .
In spite of the growing drugs bill of the NHS , it will appraise , and probably approve , Lucentis next year .
Although Nice 's role is to look at cost - effectiveness , it says it cannot appraise a drug and pass it for use in the NHS unless the drug is referred to it by the Department of Health .
The department says its hands are tied .
" The drug company has n't applied for it to be licensed for this use .
It would n't be referred to Nice until they have made the first move , " said a Department of Health spokeswoman .
" They need to step up and get a licence .
If they are not getting it licensed , why are n't they ? "
New drugs for the condition are badly needed : those we have now only slow the progression to blindness .
With Avastin , many patients get their sight back with just one or two injections .
Avastin was first used on human eyes by Philip Rosenfeld , an ophthalmologist in the US , who was aware of animal studies carried out by Genentech that showed potential in eye conditions .
This unlicensed use of Avastin has spread across continents entirely by word of mouth from one doctor to another .
It has now been injected into 7,000 eyes , with considerable success .
Professor Rosenfeld has published his results and a website has been launched in the US to collate the experiences of doctors from around the world .
But although the evidence is good , regulators require randomised controlled trials before they grant licences , which generally only the drug companies can afford to carry out .
Prof Rosenfeld said the real issue was drug company profits .
" This truly is a wonder drug , " he said .
" This shows both how good they [ the drug companies ] are and on the flip side , how greedy they are . "
He would like to see governments fund clinical trials of drugs such as Avastin in the public interest .
Rising drug bills are a big problem on both sides of the Atlantic .
In the UK , said David Wong , chairman of the scientific committee of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists , doctors are fighting battles to persuade primary care trusts to pay for drugs to stop their patients going blind while they wait for Nice to decide on Lucentis and another expensive drug called Macugen .
That decision is not expected before the end of next year .
About 20,000 people are diagnosed with age - related macular degeneration in the UK each year .
" From the patient 's point of view , if they have an eye condition that deteriorates very quickly , there is no question of waiting , " said Professor Wong .
" We 're talking about days and weeks , rather than months .
The question is should we do nothing and say there is no randomised controlled trial to prove Avastin is of value ? "
He called for primary care trusts to agree to pay for the planned phasing - in of new drugs for the condition .
Last night Genentech said its main concern over the use of Avastin to treat eye conditions was patient safety .
" While there are some small , single - centre , uncontrolled studies of Avastin being performed , safety data on patients who are treated with Avastin off - label is not being collected in a standard or organised fashion , " said a spokeswoman for the company .
Pharmaceutical firms say they need to launch drugs at high prices because of the hundreds of millions of pounds spent on developing them .
Critics point out that the company 's calculations also include the marketing budget .
Exclusive
When it comes to bot - infested PCs that spew spam , most of us assume the owners are newbie users too naive or careless to follow basic security measures .
Think again .
There 's a good chance that the penis enlargement email that just landed in your inbox is from a network maintained by Oracle , Hewlett - Packard or some other Fortune 1000 company .
We 've been poring over data collected by Support Intelligence , a firm that uses spam traps and other methods to trace the locations of infected computers .
Over two weeks in mid-February , it assembled evidence that computers connected to the networks of at least 28 large organizations sent unsolicited email .
These emails ran the spam gamut , from pump - and - dump scams to come-ons for Viagra .
One appearing to come from Oracle tried to phish recipients '
PayPal credentials .
HP was also on the list .
Best Buy , the giant electronics retailer , took the prize , having sent out more than 5,000 spams .
To its credit , Best Buy acknowledged the spam problem after we brought it to the company 's attention .
" We are repairing it as we speak , and we we 're mortified , " spokeswoman Paula Baldwin told us after IT administrators confirmed the Support - Intelligence findings .
" We had no idea of the severity .
We owe you our deepest gratitude . "
Other companies we contacted were significantly more opaque .
Both HP and Oracle declined to comment , refusing even to say if the data we provided was forwarded to security personnel in the companies ' IT departments .
Support Intelligence counted a little under 100 spams appearing to come from HP 's network and about 10 from Oracle's .
Support Intelligence is n't the only firm to implicate the business world in the malware scourge .
Webroot released a study today reporting that of 600 global businesses surveyed , 43 per cent suffered disruptions because of malware infections .
Sixty percent had no information security plan .
Rick Wesson , CEO of Support Intelligence , has worked tirelessly to alert companies that his data strongly suggests spam is being sent from their networks .
For the most part , company representatives in the front office are of little help in referring Wesson to the CISOs ( chief information security officers ) responsible .
( He has also brought evidence of thousands of compromised credit card accounts to the attention of bank and law enforcement officials , but frequently gets no response . )
Of course , spammers go to great lengths to cloak the identities of the computers they 've worked so hard to infect .
To circumvent these obfuscation measures , the Support Intelligence spam trap hosts more than 10,000 domains and monitors and records the IP address of each server that hands off the spam to the server being monitored .
Throughout this article , we say the spam " appears " to originate from these companies ' networks because Wesson acknowledges some false positives are inevitable when working with the volume of data he collects .
Indeed , one suspicious email we forwarded to a large software company turned out to be a legitimate email testing a new advertising system .
( The company shut it down after learning the emails were unintentionally appearing in inboxes not included in the pilot program . )
But there is reason to believe the results are generally accurate .
In addition to Best Buy 's confession , we received a validation from one the biggest technology companies in Silicon Valley .
After receiving Support Intelligence data , a spokesman for the company confirmed spam had been sent from its network , but said the network was separate from its employee system and was reserved for use by partners and customers who wanted internet access during visits .
We also turned to Randal Vaughn , a professor of information systems at Baylor University and a specialist in tracking and shutting down sources of spam .
He said the data " implies the mail does indeed correspond to internal generation [ from the companies ] and indicates bot infections inside the perimeter .
This is not at all a warm fuzzy feeling about the state of internet security . "
Wesson concurs .
" If all these Fortune 1000 companies can have bots running on their systems , " he says , " what do you think is happening to government [ systems ] in Kansas and Mississippi ? " ®
If ever there were a moment for serious discussion about the Iraq war , this is it .
Americans want President Bush to explain how he will extract the troops and contain the bloodletting and chaos the war has unleashed .
Washington ’s dwindling band of allies and Iraq ’s neighbors are also waiting to hear .
Pretty much everyone in the world wants answers except the president .
With the White House refusing to lead , lawmakers in both parties have begun to talk about the best way to end the war .
But instead of seizing the opening , Mr. Bush and his team continue to spout disinformation and vacuous slogans about victory and , of course , more character assassination .
This time , the hit man was Eric Edelman , the under secretary of defense for policy , and the target was Senator Hillary Clinton .
In May , Mrs. Clinton wrote Defense Secretary Robert Gates with a reasonable question : Had the Pentagon done any planning for withdrawal from Iraq ?
What she got back was a belligerent brush - off .
Mr. Edelman , who said he represented Mr. Gates , wrote that “ premature and public discussion of the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq reinforces enemy propaganda that the United States will abandon its allies in Iraq . ”

UPDATE : Now McCain is denying he ever said any of this , even though he said it on camera only yesterday AND in his denial today he repeats the claim that there are several " safe neighborhoods " in Baghdad , though he qualifies his statement by saying that they are very dangerous safe neighborhoods ( I 'm not kidding ) .
So name those very dangerous safe neighborhoods .
Not to mention , it 's not very straight - talking to deny something you said on camera 24 hours earlier , and something you repeated on Bill Bennett 's radio show .
This is a man who wants to be president , and he is basing his justification for the Iraq war on a lie .
Sound familiar ?
( NOTE TO MEDIA :
When presidential candidate John Kerry made a similar unsubstantiated claim - that several world leaders opposed Bush 's re-election - you dogged Kerry relentlessly to name those leaders .
Well fair is fair .
If you 're not all a bunch of conservative suck - ups , then do your job and demand the same answer from John McCain .
Name those neighborhoods . )
GOP Senator John McCain , who is running for president , said yesterday that it's an absolute lie to suggest that Baghdad is unsafe .
In fact , McCain says that there are several neighborhoods - more than one - in Baghdad ( outside of the Green Zone , of course ) , that are totally safe for an American to travel alone with no security .
Here 's what McCain said :
“ There are neighborhoods in Baghdad where you and I could walk through those neighborhoods , today . "
" Honestly , Wolf , you 'll barely last twenty minutes out there .
I dont know what part of ' Neverland ' Senator McCain is talking about when he says we can go strolling in Baghdad . "
Call John McCain now , and ask him to name that neighborhood .
CNN 's Baghdad correspondent , Michael Ware , who is actually IN BAGHDAD , says that McCain is flat - out wrong But John McCain was quite emphatic about it .
There are " some neighborhoods " in Baghdad that you can travel around by yourself with no security and be perfectly safe .
The only reason you do n't know this , McCain told CNN yesterday , is because the media is lying to you .
Wow .
Hell of a charge .
McCain must know something that we do n't .
If McCain is right , if the media is lying to me , I want to know what the media is hiding .
Wo n't you join me in asking Senator McCain to reveal to us the names of these non-Green - Zone Baghdad neighborhoods that are so darn safe that an American can travel alone with no security whatsoever .( 202 ) 224-2235
Then let us know what he said in the comments .
THE paperless hospital has long been a goal of health - care reformers .
Plenty of studies have shown that America 's bureaucratic approach to handling patient records inflates costs , wastes time and increases medical errors .
A number of digital initiatives have even popped up in places like Indianapolis and Massachusetts , but these are tiny ripples in the ocean of medical data .
A national , fully interoperable system of electronic medical records has remained a distant dream .
But that may be about to change .
On December 6th Wal - Mart announced plans to launch Dossia , an online patient - information service , next year .
The retail giant was joined by other big firms including Intel and BP's American division , representing some 2.5 m employees , dependants and pensioners in total .
Curiously , they are relying not on some Silicon Valley powerhouse but on the Omnimedix Institute , a non-profit firm based in Oregon , to build and run the new system .
Separately , Google has been making noises about entering this market , too .
“ Today it is much too difficult to get access to one 's health records ... our industry should help solve this problem , ” wrote Adam Bosworth , who is developing Google 's health - sector strategy , on his firm 's blog last week .
When Wal - Mart , Intel and Google start sniffing around a market , the time has probably come to take it seriously .
Why are all these big firms interested in injecting a dose of computing into health care ?
In part , because it offers the prospect of a big new market .
Pitney Bowes , a member of the Dossia consortium , hopes to sell more software ; Intel hopes to sell more chips .
And Google may be hoping to grab a slice of the pharmaceutical industry 's huge marketing budget , via online advertisements tied into medical systems .
A narrow focus on sales does not explain everything , however .
Electronic medical records will not increase sales at BP or Wal - Mart .
Why are these big firms joining hands to embrace this untested and previously unsuccessful idea ?
BP's Pat Miller says that many of her firm 's employees move frequently , so portable records would be more convenient for them .
Wal - Mart 's Linda Dillman says her firm likes the independent and non-profit status of Dossia .
“ The data will come out of the commercial space and become the property of the individual , ” she says .
Those are laudable goals , but some believe the main motivation for this new effort is simpler : containing costs .
“ Employers are completely frustrated by the health industry 's slow adoption of information technology , ” explains David Matheson of the Boston Consulting Group , a management consultancy .
The Dossia group acknowledges as much , pointing out that “ with employers paying almost half of all US healthcare costs , Dossia will be an important component in making the health - care system more efficient and effective , eliminating waste and duplication . ”
Previous efforts have failed , but could Wal - Mart 's rallying cry lead to an electronic revolution in health care ?
Perhaps .
After all , the retailer 's embrace of RFID wireless - barcode technology forced reluctant suppliers to adopt it .
However , Mr Matheson points out that America 's health - care system is fragmented and huge — far bigger even than Wal - Mart — which could limit the firm 's ability to force change .
Durjoy Bhattacharjya , the founder of medicalrecords.com , a now - defunct start - up , adds that worries about such things as privacy and security could also scupper the initiative .
“ Previous failures were rarely about technology , ” he says .
Perhaps that sober reality explains the uncharacteristically conciliatory stance struck by Wal - Mart this week .
Ms Dillman says she hopes that if Google enters the market , it will compete “ on the software and functionality of the front end ” and not over control of the patient data .
And she rejects the notion that there might be a “ Wal - Mart effect ” as there was with RFID .
“ We can not fix it on our own — we want to be a catalyst and a convenor , ” she says .
Considering what may be underneath , it 's darkly ironic that Berlin 's highest artificial hill is called " Teufelsberg , " or " Devil 's Mountain . "
" We know for sure that there 's a massive multi-story bunker complex underneath , " Dietmar Arnold , co-founder of the Berlin Underground Society , a group dedicated to researching subterranean urban history , said in an interview with German news agency dpa .
Arnold and his colleagues are eager to explore what he called " the last undiscovered secret that underground Berlin has to offer . "
Rubble mountain
When World War
Two came to an end in 1945 , the devastated German capital began to clean up and rebuild .
Berliners had to do something with the millions of tons of rubble their city had become , so they piled it up just outside the city .
The result was a nearly 120 - meter ( 390 - foot ) peak , covering up what would have been a key element in Adolf Hitler 's plan to create the powerful " Germania " superpower .
The Americans listened to GDR radio communication from Teufelsberg during the Cold War
In the late 1930s , Nazi architect Albert Speer was commissioned to design an elite military academy on the site of what used to be a popular lake - side vacation destination near Berlin .
Though construction of the academy began , the Nazis had to interrupt the building plans a few years later as the war heated up and resources were needed elsewhere .
It was never completed .
Uncovering history
During the Cold War , the Americans set up a radar unit on what had then become Teufelsberg to listen in on radio communications in East Germany .
The buried Nazi academy was quickly forgotten -- until the Berlin Underground Society recently discovered documents pertaining to the site .
Arnold said close to 1,000 underground bunkers had been built in Berlin during the Nazi era , though many were later destroyed .
Founded in 1997 , his organization has already uncovered 50 of them .
One of their most significant projects was a digital reconstruction of the bunker where Hitler took his own life in April 1945 .
Although efforts were supposedly made to blow up the half - built military academy at the end of the war , Arnold is convinced that his group will find it intact -- a find that would not only be a significant feather in their caps , but also an important lead for World War Two historians .
Theresa and Michael Cedillo , the parents of an autistic child , sat behind their three attorneys on one side of the courtroom .
On the other side were three federal lawyers armed with a shelf full of scientific studies and legal briefs .
Behind them were more rows of lawyers and scientists , some of them representing the biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world .
It was a lopsided gathering , but the Cedillos had been waiting for the confrontation since they came to believe years ago that their daughter ’s autism may have been triggered by a combination of childhood vaccines and a mercury preservative used in them .
“ For so long no one wanted to hear , ” said Theresa , 45 .
“ Now someone wants to listen . ”

The case of Cedillo vs. Secretary of Health and Human Services is the culmination of one of the most wrenching episodes of modern public health .
For more than a decade , thousands of families of autistic children have clamored to gain legitimacy for their claim that childhood vaccines are to blame for their children ’s plight .
Now they are having their day in court .
“ We ’re hoping we can ... open the gates for other children who are ill , ” said Michael Cedillo , 51 , a meter reader and bill collector for an electric company in Arizona .
Arguments in the Cedillos ’ case began June 11 .
Theirs is the first of nine families that will appear over the next year in an obscure federal court that rules on injuries possibly caused by vaccines .
The cases were chosen to represent 4,800 autism claims that have flooded the vaccine court in recent years .

The stakes are high .
The court oversees a $ 2.5 - billion trust fund that could be drained if the parents win their claim .
Public health officials have warned that a finding favorable to the parents could deter other parents from vaccinating their children , a potential health calamity .
The government position is backed by the overwhelming weight of scientific evidence , which has repeatedly found the vaccines safe .
But what the Cedillos and other parents lack in hard data , they have made up for with a stubborn passion and sorrow that science cannot dispute .

“ It is parents versus science , ” said Kevin Conway , one of the attorneys for the Cedillos .
Preservative blamed
At the center of the case is Michelle Cedillo .
At 12 , she still sleeps in diapers .
She mostly communicates by waving her hands or tapping on a table .
She can count to 2 but no higher .
Her parents say Michelle was a happy , normal 15 - month - old until she received the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine , commonly known as MMR , on Dec. 20 , 1995 .

A week later , she began to have a fever that soared to 105.8 degrees .
“ She was a whole different child ” after the fever broke , her mother said .
Michelle pushed her father away when he tried to nuzzle her .
She stopped talking and did n’t answer to her name .
She became obsessed with watching the same “ Sesame Street ” videos .
Michelle was soon diagnosed with autism .
“ We were totally numb , ” said her mother .
The disorder leaves its victims isolated from the world around them .
Autistic children typically are unable to understand others ’ emotions , have difficulty speaking and are prone to repetitive actions .

Some autistics are able to function almost normally ; others are severely impaired .
There are no nationwide data documenting the historical incidence of autism .
Twenty years ago , psychiatrists estimated the rate at 1 in every 2,000 to 5,000 children .
Last year , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 1 in 150 schoolchildren had been diagnosed with it .
Some parents think autism can be caused by a vaccine preservative called thimerosal , which contains ethyl mercury .
Partly on the precautionary urging of the U.S. Public Health Service , the use of thimerosal was abandoned in 2001 in childhood vaccines , except for influenza vaccines .
Mercury can cause neurological problems , and some studies have concluded there is a link with autism .

Parents groups frequently cite a 2006 study by French and British researchers that found indications of elevated mercury and other heavy - metal levels in children with developmental and neurological disorders , including autism .
But at least 14 separate mainstream studies have rejected the connection , showing that the rate of autism is the same in children who received thimerosal and those who did not .
The growth of the disorder also has not abated since thimerosal was removed from vaccines .
The results are “ clear and consistent and reproducible , ” said Dr. Paul Offit of the Philadelphia Children ’s Hospital .

Many researchers believe that genetics is behind autism .
Dr. Peter Hotez , president of the Sabin Vaccine Institute in Washington , noted that when one identical twin has the disorder or other serious social impairment , there is a 90 % chance that the second twin will as well .
But , parents ask , how can an epidemic be caused by genes ?
Some researchers argue that there is no autism epidemic .
An analysis of data from 44 states , led by researchers at Washington University and the University of Wisconsin , found that the increase in autism was completely offset by a decrease in the prevalence of children considered cognitively or learning disabled .
In other words , they say , children simply have been shuffled from one category to another .

The Cedillos have read reams of studies .
Theresa , a stay - at - home mother , spends most of her time caring for Michelle or scouring the Internet .
She does n’t doubt the science , but she questions whether it has searched deep enough to find the key that explains Michelle .
“ I know what they ’ve said , but I believe it happened the way it happened , ” she said .
In the courtroom

Amid a sea of business suits , Michelle sat struggling in her wheelchair in a white dolphin T - shirt on the first day of the trial .
Even though she wore noise - canceling headphones to screen out the courtroom hubbub , she was overwhelmed by the new surroundings .
She jerked in her wheelchair , groaned and hit herself in the face until her parents took her out .
The Cedillos mortgaged their home in Yuma , Ariz. , to stay in Washington for the three weeks of the trial .
Special Master George L. Hastings Jr. , who is presiding over the case with two others , thanked the family for being at the trial .

Even in the labyrinthine bureaucracy of Washington , vaccine court is an obscure venue .
In the past , civil courts would have handled cases like Michelle’s .
That situation changed in the 1980s when the vaccine industry faced a rash of lawsuits over brain damage caused by the childhood diphtheria - pertussis - tetanus vaccine .
After the price of the vaccine rose 2,000 % over a two - year period and at least one manufacturer abandoned the business , Congress established the National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program in 1988 .
Through congressional funding and a 75 - cent surcharge on each vaccine dose , it created a fund that now totals $ 2.5 billion .

Given the millions of people who receive vaccinations each year , the number of claims is tiny .
Since 1990 , the court has granted awards totaling $ 725.7 million in 857 nonautism cases .
The nine autism test cases are divided into three groups -- one blaming autism on the MMR vaccine , one blaming mercury and one blaming both .
In many ways , Michelle seems a strange choice for the first test case , because she is not a typical autistic child .
She has also been diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease , arthritis , osteopenia , uveitis and epilepsy .
But her case , which is based on the combination MMR - mercury claim , was deemed one of the strongest .
Medical tests have found measles virus in her body that matched the strain in the MMR vaccine .
Advertisement
Dr. Marcel Kinsbourne , a pediatric neurologist from the New School University in New York , cited previous studies in testifying that it was plausible Michelle ’s immune system had been damaged by thimerosal in the nine childhood vaccines she had received .
The measles virus in her body could then have spread to her brain and triggered autism , Kinsbourne testified .
The government ’s case is no surprise .
It arrays scientific studies like chess pieces across a playing board .
“ Good science does apply , ” said lead attorney Vince Matanoski in opening arguments .
“ What has no place here or in any federal court is junk science . ”
The Cedillos have their scientists arrayed as well .
They also have Michelle .

In the early days of the trial , the Cedillos ’ attorney showed videos of Michelle before she received the MMR vaccine .
To the Cedillos , it was so clear .
Michelle squealed with laughter , called out to her mother , played peekaboo and spoke the name of Bert from “ Sesame Street . ”
The government showed scenes from the same videos .
Dr. Eric Fombonne , a child psychiatrist from McGill University in Canada , pointed out Michelle ’s lack of speaking , her fixation on objects , and an absence of joy on her face when her mother spoke to her -- before Michelle received the MMR vaccine .

“ She is very abnormal , ” Fombonne said .
The Cedillos were prepared for this .
They knew it would be hard for others to see Michelle as they saw her .
“ There was more to her life than what was shown in the videotapes , ” Theresa said .
The Cedillos sat quietly through the testimony .
It was a long day , and when it was over , they headed back to their hotel to take care of Michelle .

Here in the US , the RIAA can issue a John Doe subpoena to any ISP demanding to know which of its subscribers was using a given IP address to share copyrighted music at a certain time .
Although the RIAA has tried to circumvent this system , it forms a cornerstone of the organization 's legal strategy against those it suspects of infringement .
Labels and their legal representatives could have a harder time employing a similar strategy across the pond .
An advocate general for the European Court of Justice has issued an opinion stating that ISPs targeted by civil copyright cases in the European Union should not have to identify allegedly - infringing subscribers when pressured to do so by label representatives .
The Spanish version of the RIAA – Promusicae – had sued the Telefonica ISP , demanding that it release the identities of allegedly infringing subscribers , but Telefonica refused , claiming that it could only turn over such information as part of a criminal prosecution .
This could be a big hurdle for the record industry P2P litigation strategy in Europe , but we wo n't know until later this year .
According to MarketWatch ,
" The adviser 's opinion will be reviewed by the court 's panel of judgesbefore a final ruling sometime later this year .
The judges follow theiradvisers ' opinions about 80 % of the time . "
( on marketwatch ; via ars technica )
Darpa , the Pentagon 's wide - eyed research arm , is betting big on " metamaterials " – composites that canseemingly - impossible new properties , thanks to their molecular structure .
But even for Darpa , and even for metamaterials , this seems like a long shot : a $ 15 million program to build shoot - through , one - way - invisible , self - healing shields for soldiers in urban battlefields .
Metamaterials are already showing promise , as the building blocks to real - life invisibility cloaks ; that 's because the composites let electromagnetic waves flow around them , instead of reflecting 'em back .
Darpa 's " Asymmetric Materials for the Urban Battlespace " program goes way , way beyond mere invisibility , however .
" Asymmetric , or ' one - way , ' materials will support basic unit operations such as raids , cordon and search activities , snap checkpoints , and fire fights , " according to military budget documents .
" Friendly forces will be able to see through [ one of these new materials ] and shoot through it , but hostile forces will not . "
Such shields will also have " the ability to ' self - heal ' if necessary .
The materials must be lightweight , respond instantly , and be easy to deploy and retract in confined spaces . "
Darpa does n't give much guidance on how this might be done .
But the agency does offer a clue , buried in an earlier budget document :
" Initial studies have shown optical analogs of secure digital communication hold great promise for providing a ' coded ' obscurant system .
The optical properties of obscurant can be tailored such that they develop transparency at narrow , tunable wavelengths .
This narrow band optical bleaching phenomena could be realized through optical threshold sensitive switching materials akin to some developed for laser protection goggles . "
Of course , producing stuff like this wo n't be easy , Darpa admits .
There are " significant technical obstacles , " the agency notes , including " the design and fabrication of composite or meta - materials with true one - way capabilities . "
Which is pretty much the whole program .
TerraCycle
TerraCycle is one of those tiny start - up brands that get so much free publicity that it can forgo advertising .
And it ’s easy to see why there ’s interest .
The founder is a 25 - year - old Princeton dropout .
Its flagship fertilizer products are packaged in used plastic bottles , many collected through a nationwide recycling program the company itself has organized .
And a key ingredient in the fertilizer itself , as the label announces , is “ liquefied WORM POOP . ”
Waste packaged in waste makes TerraCycle the “ ultimate eco- friendly ” product , the company asserts , putting it in line with organic and earth - aware consumption trends .
“ We kind of ride on the fact that all these things get a lot of press , and get people interested in the product ” and the “ young , hip company ” that makes it , explains Albe Zakes , the company spokesman .
Eco-hipness notwithstanding , you do n’t hear much about worms , or their waste , from the various big - box retailers , globe - trotting pundits and good - looking guests of Oprah Winfrey who appear to be leading the conversation about environmental concern these days .
But TerraCycle ’s plant food is actually a mass - oriented variation on something that hard - core eco-people talk about all the time : the worm bin .
Containers filled with shredded newspaper and worms , such bins are used for composting food scraps .
Worms eat this waste and digest it , and “ compost exits the worm through its tail end , ” one online guide explains .
These “ castings , ” the result of vermicomposting ( to use more formal gardening terms ) , happen make good plant food .
Flowerfield Enterprises even sells “ Worm - a - way ” home composting kits ( a pound of red worms included ) and the book “ Worms Eat My Garbage ” through its Web site , WormWoman.com .
It was a worm bin that Tom Szaky started in his college apartment that eventually led to his founding TerraCycle .
He was trying to grow “ certain plants ” in order to “ harvest the buds , ” as one account put it .
High on the effects that vermicomposting had on his gardening project , he and a fellow student wrote a business plan that turned on making effective and earth - friendly products for gardeners who did n’t happen to have worm bins of their own .
TerraCycle began to appear on store shelves in late 2004 .
The packaging explains that the stuff comes courtesy of “ millions of worms ” that are fed “ premium organic waste ” — and slags “ synthetic chemical ” rivals .
By 2006 , Inc. magazine judged TerraCycle “ The Coolest Little Start - Up in America . ”
The plant food is now available at Home Depot , Wal - Mart and Target .
Producing mass amounts of worm waste proved less difficult than figuring out what to put it in .
This has led to the company ’s “ Bottle Brigade Program , ” which involves sending boxes to people and organizations ( about 3,100 so far , according to Zakes ) across the country , to be filled with empty 20 - ounce soda bottles and shipped to TerraCycle .
Its bottle shapes are thus inconsistent on retail shelves — but that has become part of the brand ’s look , and the company is trying to trademark the packaging style .
At RailsConf2007 there was a lot of excitement over JRuby .
This small team had taken a moribund project and turned it into what looks like a first class implementation of the Ruby platform on the JVM .
They got a lot of cheers and deserved them all .
So with JRuby pretty much here , the spotlight moves onto the other common managed code runtime - . NET .
Microsoft 's intentions for Ruby are currently much less clear .
They have announced Ruby as a language for scripting Silverlight - but that still leaves a lot of open questions .
Is this a full implementation of the ruby language , or is some form of Ruby ++ - an enhanced subset of Ruby ?
JRuby serves two distinct but complementary purposes .
On the one hand it 's a powerful scripting language for the JVM , allowing you to weave a dynamic language into a Java application .
It 's second purpose is an implementation of the Ruby platform in the JVM , which allows a Ruby application , in particular a Ruby on Rails application , to run on the JVM just as well as it runs on the MRI ( Matz 's Ruby Interpreter , the current C runtime ) .
The big question for Microsoft 's " Iron Ruby " is how compatible will it be ?
Will it be a full implementation on the CLR ?
All the signals I hear tell me that John Lam , the main force behind Iron Ruby , is determined to get a fully compatible implementation .
However this may be very difficult to do as things stand .
Soon - to - be - ThoughtWorker Ola Bini , a JRuby committer , reckons that it 's almost impossible to figure out how to implement a Ruby runtime without looking at source code of the MRI - but Microsoft imposes drastic limitations on its employees ' ability to download open source software , let alone look at the source .
The open - source community does much of its communication through source code - so this makes collaboration with an open - source community very difficult .
Overshadowing this , of course , is Microsoft 's historically difficult relationship with the open source world .
In the past Microsoft has gone out of its way to vilify and threaten the open source community .
In recent years things have improved , but there 's a real question about Microsoft 's core intentions .
The recent patent threats are seen by many as proof that Microsoft is still intent on fighting open source to the death .
Unlike most other technology companies , Microsoft has struggled to find a way to co-exist with the open source world .
It is harder for Microsoft - unlike Sun , Apple , or IBM they are overwhelmingly a software company .
Open source projects like Linux , GNU , and Open Office are directly competing with Microsoft 's crown jewels .
However I 've never felt that declaring war on open - source , trying to stamp it out , was a viable long - term solution .
Open - source is here to stay , the question is how to accommodate it .
With Ruby Microsoft is in a different position to the more visible death match .
Ruby does n't compete with the core revenue generators in Microsoft 's line up .
What 's more there is a real desire in the Ruby community to co-operate with Microsoft .
Most people I talked to at RailsConf were very keen to see a full range of support for Ruby on Microsoft - and there were a lot of creative ideas floating around on how we could try to come with an approach that could make it work .
The overwhelming sense I heard in the community was not " Ruby will kill evil Microsoft " but " how can we overcome the problems to get Ruby on Microsoft . "
As Chris Sells pointed out , we do have to consider the question " what 's in this for Microsoft " .
I see a couple of reasons .
First off is the role of .NET and Windows in the data center .
If Microsoft does n't support the Ruby platform , it runs the risk of people moving away from .
NET ( and Windows ) on server farms if Ruby on Rails becomes successful .
Another reason is people .
Microsoft does n't like to acknowledge this in public , but there is a real concern that AlphaGeeks are moving away from the Microsoft platform .
There 's a growing sense that Microsoft 's vision is armies of Morts in command - and - control organizations .
There often seems to be outright discouragement of tools to enable talented enterprise developers , or of agile development processes .
A few years ago my ( limited ) contacts in Redmond told me that they were seeing a real drift of technical leaders away from the Windows platform .
More recently these signs seem to be increasing .
Reading the ' softie part of my blogroll I got a sense of real disillusionment amongst people who have been long - time Microsoft supporters .
Agile - oriented developers have been frustrated with the direction of Microsoft tools .
Microsoft conferences barely mentioning agile processes , leaning much more to waterfall approaches .
The tools , with their rigid role - separations , actively discourage the blurry boundaries that agilists prefer .
At RailsConf , Tim Bray contended that the key decisions on technology are made by the programming community .
I partly agree with this .
The reason we have so much bloatware in IT is because IT purchasing decisions are usually made on golf courses by people who have lost meaningful contact with the realities of software development .
However golf - course decisions may dominate the short - term , but as time rolls on I think Tim 's contention is true .
So losing the alpha geeks may not matter this year or next , but will inexorably harm Microsoft over time .
Indeed it 's already past next year for Microsoft .
We 've seen a noticeable drop - off in interest from our clients for Microsoft projects , particularly in the US .
In Australia , .NET has n't got any foothold at all amongst our clients .
I 'm not sure what to make of this data .
We are n't so big to be a statistically valid sample on our own .
But it 's a useful data point nonetheless particularly since we like to think our clients are the " alpha IT shops " .
Perhaps more significant is the story within ThoughtWorks .
When .NET appeared there was a lot of interest in the platform .
Many people were pleased to see a strong competitor to the Java platform and were keen to get involved on .NET projects .
Yet over the last year or so there 's been a big turn away from .
NET .
This is despite the fact that there is some really interesting things coming out of Redmond .
Mike
Two is very keen on the windows workflow tools , I 've been very impressed by Linq and other language developments .
But the general view of Microsoft technologies is a loud yawn .
This is important because , as Tim O'Reilly believes , the alpha geeks point to what everyone else will be doing in a few years time .
And the crucial point is that the attitude to Microsoft is n't hatred ( a common attitude amongst many geeks ) but boredom .
This is what Paul Graham means when he says that Microsoft is dead because it's no longer dangerous .
The attitude to open - source is a large part of this problem .
When Java appeared there were yawning gaps in its portfolio , and worse some dreadful standard tools in its API ( visions of Entity Beans spring to mind ) .
Those gaps and bad ideas were fixed by the open - source community .
Ant gave us a build tool , EJB was displaced by Spring and Hibernate .
. NET has also got its gaps , and again the open source community has stepped up to fill them .
Yet Microsoft refuses to collaborate with these efforts , even seems to go out of its way to undermine them .
I was particularly sickened by Microsoft 's reaction to NUnit - an excellent XUnit testing tool , elements of whose design were lauded by Anders Hejlsberg at OOPSLA .
Microsoft ended not just bringing out a competitive library , but deliberately making it incompatible .
That 's not the kind of reaction that encourages people to invest their time in the platform .
To be fair , that debacle was a couple of years ago .
Actions like hiring Jim Hugunin and John Lam have helped counter that impression .
Technologists like Chris Sells , Don Box , and Jim Newkirk are working to make Microsoft are a more open environment .
But like any large organization , Microsoft is full of contradictory forces and we do n't know which ones will prevail .
My colleague John Kordyback pointed out that at the heart of all this is realizing that Ruby is not Yet Another .NET Language but a whole community and attitude to software development .
Ruby is a community where open source , agile thinking , and lightweight solutions are deeply ingrained values .
He says a common problem in Redmond is that " They ask me ' Why is this language important ' rather than ' Why is this thinking important ? ' "
So what I see for Ruby and Microsoft is an opportunity .
The Ruby community seems eager to work with Microsoft .
This provides an opportunity for Redmond to figure out how to deal with the problems of working with open source and for this effort to serve as an exemplar for future collaboration .
A first class implementation of the full Ruby platform on .NET would be a wonderful product of this collaboration .
Perhaps an even better result would be for this work to serve as an example of how Microsoft can collaborate with a community that 's centered on openness and agility ; an example that can be a springboard for further spreading of attitudes that can further help programmers and their customers throughout the Microsoft world .
There 's been quite a few reactions to this ( see Technorati for a full list ) .
Particularly worth reading are the ones from : Sam Gentile , Cory Foy , Luke Melia , Jeremy Miller , Rockford Lhotka , John Lam , Evan Hoff , Karl Seguin , Ola Bini , Miro Adamy , Charles Nutter , Peter Laudati , Nick Malik
Update : Recently ( august 2007 ) we 've seen some very encourging signs coming out of Redmond .
In particular , IronRuby will be hosted on RubyForge with what looks like a very permissive licence - Ola approves .
WASHINGTON  American diplomats are quietly urging the Kurdistan Regional Government in Iraq to take steps that would help ease the alarm over the Turkish troops amassed on Iraq 's border .
Ankara , Washington , and Baghdad all rushed yesterday to deny an Associated Press dispatch that the Turks had begun an invasion of northern Iraq in pursuit of the Kurdistan Workers ' Party , or PKK , a group listed as a terrorist organization by the State Department and blamed by the Turks for suicide blasts in their capital this year .
An Iraqi official who spoke on condition of anonymity explained the delicate American diplomacy as follows : " The Americans want the Kurds to make their lives easier .
They need the Kurdish government to show they are willing to do something to tackle terrorism in the north .
They are asking for them to be creative .
They do n't expect them to go after every cell , but maybe alert Turkey of a threat , act on intelligence , arrest some people , make an effort . "
A State Department spokesman , Sean McCormack , said America 's ambassador to Ankara met with the Turkish General Staff , who confirmed that the initial reports of the invasion were not accurate .
Later , wire reports said the activity amounted to cross - border raids .
Nonetheless , the director of the Turkish research program at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Soner Cagaptay , estimates that there are now 250,000 soldiers , most of whom have gathered in the last four weeks , massed at the Qandil mountain range on the border with northern Iraq .
Those troops , according to Mr. Cagaptay , include heavy artillery and tanks , the most significant troop buildup by the Turks since they nearly invaded Syria in 1998 while accusing Damascus of harboring the PKK leader , Abdullah Ocalan .
The Iraqi official yesterday said the figure of Turkish troops was closer to 100,000 .
Should Turkey invade Iraqi Kurdistan , it would pit two American allies in the wider war against Islamic terror against each other .
The troop buildup on the Iraqi border has worried the highest levels of the Bush administration , prompting Defense Secretary Gates over the weekend to warn the Turks not to go through with an invasion .
Yesterday Mr. McCormack reiterated that view from the podium at the State Department .
After stating that America supports the Turks in their own battle against terrorism and that it considers the PKK a terrorist entity , Mr. McCormack said , " Turkey and Iraq are neighbors , that 's not going to change .
And we do n't think it is in the interest of either state that there would be a military incursion into Iraq . "
A representative of the Kurdistan Regional Government , Qubad Talabani , who is the son of Iraq 's president , yesterday said he was worried about the rising tensions .
" Of course we are concerned the tensions are rising between Turkey and the Iraqi Kurdistan region .
We have constantly sought to deal with our issues through political and diplomatic channels , " he said .
" We feel the current build up of Turkish troops on our border is not helping either side reach a peaceful and political settlement . "
Mr. Talabani also said that no border posts on the Iraqi side had reported any Turkish incursions , and said the Turkish raids were confined to Turkish territory .
Mr. Cagaptay yesterday said that since 2002 the PKK has had an effective safe haven inside Iraqi Kurdistan , noting that 2002 when was when the Turks stopped most of their raids into northern Iraq against the PKK .
" Most of its members are in bases outside of Qandil and they have gone into Turkey , this is something I confirmed with Turkish military , " he said .
" When the PKK attacked Turkey from Iraq , the Turks would strike back , what is important about today 's incursion , is that it tells us the relationship and that the restraint might be coming to an end . "
Mr. Cagaptay said that he predicted the Turks would be sending more soldiers into the area in the near future .
For America , the high tensions on Iraq 's border with Turkey is a testament to how the current process headed by a former Air Force General , Joseph Ralston , to ease these tensions has not been working .

Water striders , insects that walk on the surface of the water , may never set foot on land in their lives , and yet they ’re not swimmers .
Over the past million or so years , this insect — sometimes called a water skater — has optimized its use of surface tension to balance its 0.01 - gram body on lakes , ponds , and even oceans .
Researchers Yun Seong Song , a PhD student in mechanical engineering , and Metin Sitti , assistant professor in mechanical engineering , both from Carnegie Mellon University , have recently built a robot that mimics the water strider ’s natural abilities .
The first water striding robot , with an appearance and design closely resembling its insect counterpart , does n’t ever break the surface tension of the water , and is highly maneuverable .
Song and Sitti ’s small robot is different from other floating robots in that its small mass and long legs enable it to utilize the surface tension force to stay afloat .
In contrast , macroscale bodies must rely on buoyancy , which is based on their large volumes .
The researchers predict that such a robot might be used for environmental monitoring via wireless communication , as well as for educational and entertainment purposes .
“ Water strider robots — we call them STRIDEs ( Surface Tension Robotic Insect Dynamic Explorer ) — can walk on water only 3 - 4 mm deep ( shallow water ) , ” Sitti explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ Their power efficiency and agility ( speed and maneuverability ) are much superior for relatively small water vehicles since the STRIDE legs have much less drag than any buoyancy based robot . ”
Of course , as Sitti explained , this advantage is eliminated when the STRIDE becomes meter - scale , since surface tension force scaling is not favorable at large scales .
From models and calculations , the researchers found that an optimal robot would have hydrophobic wire legs coated with Teflon , each 5 cm long .
Twelve of these legs attached to the 1 - gram body of the robot could support a payload of up to 9.3 grams in their experiments .
The key to avoiding the breaking of the water surface is in maintaining a water - air interface that is more horizontal than vertical .
For locomotion , the water strider insect creates a sculling motion with specialized sculling legs .
The robot functions the same way .
Three piezoelectric actuators , when attached to the legs in a T shape , create both vertical and horizontal motion to cause the elliptical sculling motion required to move .
Because the piezoelectric actuators provided only a small deflection , an amplifier was needed to create large strokes .
To achieve this , the researchers used a resonant frequency with a vibration mode favorable to generating the sculling motion to drive the actuators .
While a water strider insect can move at speeds of up to 1.5 m/s , the first robot still achieved a forward speed of 3 cm/s , and could also turn , rotate and move backwards .
Currently , rough water may present a hazard to the robot striders .
However , Sitti hoped that by improving the lift capability and water sealing of the current STRIDE , the robot would be able to withstand waves and storms .
Song and Sitti are working on other ways to improve the robot in future prototypes .
For example , the T - shape actuator mechanism accounts for more than half the weight of the robot , which could possibly be hindering the robot ’s speed .
In a more recent prototype , for instance , the researchers designed a STRIDE that used two battery - powered micromotors to walk on water .
Although this set - up had an increased mass of 6 grams , the robot also achieved an increased speed of 8.7 cm / s .
The group plans to continue experimenting with different options .
“ STRIDE is 10 - 15 times slower than the insect , since the current prototype is almost 10 times larger than the insect , ” Sitti explained .
“ Therefore , we would miniaturize the STRIDE more .
Moreover , we are integrating wireless communication , sensors , and teleoperated and autonomous control capability to the new STRIDE prototypes .
Thus , we could deploy tens or hundreds of these robots to the water surface for environment monitoring . ”

It would be a dream come true for the airline industry : A plane that uses up to 30 percent less gas to reach its destination , compared with today 's jets .
That 's the promise of the blended - wing , a radically new kind of aircraft set to take to the skies for the first time this month .
Originally conceived by McDonnell Douglas and developed by NASA , the blended - wing merges fuselage and wings and eliminates the tail , reducing drag .
That makes it vastly more fuel - efficient than regular " tube - and - wing " jets , according to Boeing ( Charts ) engineer Norm Princen .
His X - 48B blended - wing prototype , now on the runway at Edwards Air Force Base , is only about a 10th the size of the 240 - foot - wingspan craft he hopes to build .
But the Pentagon is watching keenly .
" Blended - wing technology can cost - effectively fill many roles required by the Air Force , " says Capt .
Scott Van-Hoogen of the Air Vehicles Directorate .
As a tanker , for example , it could refuel two planes in midair at the same time .
For now Boeing is focused on making a military version of the plane by 2022 .
But by 2030 blended - wing aircraft could be carrying commercial passengers .
Last November a team from MIT and Cambridge University unveiled the SAX - 40 , a blended - wing design that promises to be more fuel - efficient than a Toyota ( Charts ) Prius - and thanks in part to the engine placement , just as quiet ( at 63 decibels ) .
These designs still have a bumpy ride before they 'll be accepted by airlines :

I was talking with a friend the other day and he started complaining about how everyone that was for the war in Iraq is now against it , mainly because the media is against it .
To him , the way the media was able to control the opinions ofis wrong .
Which it is .
Really though you have to wonder who is actually in control of the beast .
It is kind of , as a person who has always been against the war ( and Bush for that matter ) watching opinion turn against him .
If you look at the polls there has been a fairly constant and steady decline in Bush 's approval ratings ever since 9/11 .
It would be great fun to fit an exponential decay curve to the data .
I sense that there is some sort oftruth wrapped up in the decay constant of the curve .
In fact , lets do this .
There was a fairly big bump around the 2004 election butafterword it continued downward and is only now starting to level out .
Immediately following 9/11 his approval rating was roughly 87 % .
It reached 45 % on 5/20/2004 .
That is roughly 2.75 years for roughly one half decrease in popularity giving a decay constant of 0.25 ( years ^ - 1 ) .
Following the election his popularity again started falling starting at about 50 % on 1/20/2005 and reaching an average of 28 % on 5/20/2007 giving a drop of 22 % over 2.4 years .
The calculation ismore difficult but it leads to a decay constant of .24 ( years ^ - 1 ) .
Pretty dang close .
Whats great is that we now have a model for the average approval rating over time which is given by the following equation : A = 50*e ^( -( date - 1/20/2005 ) *.25 ) .
And with a model we can predict future approval ratings .
Lets look at his approval rating in November when Generalis giving his report on the effectiveness of the Surge in Iraq A = 50*e ^( - 2.8*. 25 ) = 25 % .
Looking even further towards the primary season would give an approval rating of only 23 % .
The question is , will this trend continue ?
To answer this we have to look at our model and ask what could be driving thisand if it will continue .
What the models are great for is giving an abstract way of looking at relationships between quantities .
What is interesting about exponential decay is it corresponds to a differential equation where the rate of change of a quantity is equal to the the quantity times a constant .
In , the rate at which Bush 's popularity is decreasing is directly proportional to his current popularity .
What popularity is a measure of is the number of people who approve of his performance .
So in this sense it makes sense that the rate of change of his popularity is proportional to the number of people who approve .
The more people there are who doof him means the more people who are able switch and disprove of him .
What is hidden in this discovery is that , in reality , there is no one whoapprove of president Bush .
Given enough time , everyone will come around to the fact that he is a bad president and his approval rating will approach 0 % .
Indeed , this is likely the case .
Bush 's popularity is almost entirely derived from his perception as the boss .
I remember a good friend who is very smart saying prior to the Iraq war that we must support our president .
And , in a sense he was right .
The country thought we were at war with a dangerous andenemy .
Divided as a country we may fall to this threat and Bush did anjob of placing himself as a rallying point for people with his strong language , determination , and apparent self confidence .
Ultimately though , this is a feeling based on the perception of a threat which has not materialized .
Our way of life has continued and indeed has been more threatened by things that Bush has done nothing about such as increasing oil prices , global warming , Katrina , health care costs , apparent increasing gap between rich and poor , and so on .
It is hard to name a group of people that actually havefrom his presidency .
These next few months then should be interesting .
Barring any major event that will cause fear of an external enemy his poll numbers will serve as a test of our model .
Specifically , if his poll numbers continue to fall at this rate then we can become more confident that ultimately everyone , even the thick headed ones , will come to believe that Bush isthe worst president we have ever had .
A COMPLEX wine is a good thing .
A complex wine label is death to sales — at least , some of the time .
Take German wines , for example .
Too often , consumers are confronted with the choking union of German words and Gothic script .
Add to that arcane wine rules that offer too much information on a label but convey little of what ’s in a bottle , and the net effect is to deaden demand for some of the world ’s greatest wines .
But the Burgundy label ?
Now , that ’s a thing of intricate beauty .
With a profusion of details concerning producers , geography , vineyard and vineyard rating , the Burgundy label , too , can appear complicated and intimidating .
Unlike the German label , though , the Burgundy label conveys precise information and is well worth the effort to understand .
Burgundy lovers can only wish that the label would have the same dampening effect on sales as the German one .
Alas , good Burgundy is always in demand .
There ’s never enough to go around .
The issue with a bottle of Burgundy is generally not what style of wine it will be .
You know it will be a dry red wine .
You just do n’t know how good it will be .
While the overall level of quality in Burgundy has improved significantly in the last 25 years , it is still hard to know where you will end up on the spectrum , from something thin , sharp and mean to a wine that comes as close to heaven as is possible for a mere liquid .
Lately I have been blogging that I am an Ubuntu Fan and after a major crash with my Lenovo with Windows XP I left Microsoft for a combination of Ubuntu and Mac .
I use Ubuntu for e mail with Thunderbird and regular Open Office for regular tasks related to the management of Fon .
On the other hand , I use Mac for music , videos , pictures and entertainment in general .
While most people know Mac few know Ubuntu .
Ubuntu is best described as a very simple and stable Linux based operating system .
It ´s Linux for the rest of us .
Ubuntu is for people like me who love technology but are not engineers .
Interestingly I just got an e mail from Michael Dell in which he says he also uses Ubuntu .
As the link shows he went as far as to say so in his official bio in the Dell web site .
Now if Dell , the corporation goes the way of Michael Dell , the CEO the Ubuntu distro will rise from relative obscurity to the big league of Vista , Windows XP and MacOSX .
Fans of Ubuntu should watch this opportunity carefully Michael Dell may be coming your way just as the new Ubuntu is about to be released .
In the following clip Kucinich not only says he is interested in a 9/11 inquiry - but solidly states that there will be one done by the Domestic Policy Committee which he chairs - perhaps beginning around September of this year .
Constitution in Crisis questions Dennis Kucinich on 9/11
Thanks to constitutionincrisis.org for posting this video , here is their description as taken from their website :
SINCE THE ARRIVAL of the white settlers , the American West has been shaped by the discovery and extraction of natural resources , beginning in the 19th century with silver and gold and then extending to timber , copper , uranium and fossil fuels such as oil , natural gas and coal .
For decades , the industries that grew around these resources mined state capitals as thoroughly as they did the riches beneath the earth .
As recently as three decades ago , the Mountain West states erupted in what was known as the “ sagebrush rebellion ” -- a loud and sustained clamor from the extraction industries and their political allies for the federal government to open millions of acres of public land for resource exploration and development .
But that has changed .
In less than a generation , the sagebrush rebellion has given way across the West to a renewable revolution .
Today , from the Rockies to the Pacific , a new political axis is emerging that could transform the national debate over energy , the environment and global warming .
“ It ’s a massive shift in not just policy but ... voter attitudes , ” said Bill Richardson , the Democratic governor of New Mexico and presidential candidate .

Across the West , governors from both parties are advancing the nation ’s most ambitious policies to promote clean energy , encourage conservation and reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
On each of these fronts , leaders in the West are racing far beyond the gridlocked energy debate in Washington -- and drawing support from ideologically diverse local coalitions that include new residents concerned about preserving an attractive environment and agricultural and tourism interests fearful that global warming may undermine their industries .
Even major utilities across the West have enlisted .
Some critics predict that these initiatives eventually could provoke a voter backlash if they result in higher costs for energy , especially electricity .
But if , on the other hand , the interlocked efforts in the West demonstrate economic , environmental and political viability , they will provide enormous momentum for faltering national efforts to build a clean - energy economy less reliant on fossil fuels .
“ We ’ve had really very little support from the Bush administration even to analyze this in a thoughtful way , ” complained Bill Ritter , a Democrat who centered his successful gubernatorial campaign in Colorado last year on a promise of promoting alternative energy .
“ We really need [ action ] on a national basis . ”

Some states elsewhere , particularly in the Northeast , have adopted similar policies , but the push in the West is especially dramatic given the region ’s historic connection to the fossil - fuel economy .
Western Democrats now control seven of the region ’s 11 governorships , and their gains are both a reflection and a cause of the shift in priorities .
The West ’s new energy axis rests on a deepening partnership between those Democratic governors and California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , a centrist Republican .
In some cases , California is leveraging its market power -- as what Montana ’s Democratic Gov. Brian Schweitzer calls the “ 900 - pound gorilla ” in the region ’s energy economy -- to propel change .
California exercised that influence most effectively last fall when Schwarzenegger signed a law barring state utilities from entering long - term contracts to import electricity from power plants that emit more carbon dioxide than the cleanest natural gas facilities -- a standard that excludes conventional coal - fired plants .

That decision already is sending ripples through the region as governors from energy - exporting states use it to build support for cleaner alternatives to conventional coal .
“ We see it as an opportunity to build and construct new clean and green facilities , ” said Schweitzer , who is promoting power plants that would generate electricity by converting coal into natural gas and then sequester the carbon dioxide emissions in underground facilities , such as depleted oil fields .
In other instances , California and other Western states are moving independently along parallel paths .
Six of the 11 states , for example , have approved “ renewable portfolio standards ” that require utilities to generate a fixed percentage of electricity from renewable power sources such as wind , solar and geothermal ; Oregon is on track to join them this year .
In the last few weeks , New Mexico and Colorado mandated that utilities generate 20 % of their power from renewable sources by 2020 -- double the existing requirements ; California last fall stiffened its rules by advancing the deadline on a 20 % requirement from 2017 to 2010 .

Washington , Oregon and Arizona have committed to adopting a California regulation requiring huge reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from passenger vehicles -- a standard that would essentially require improved fuel economy -- if the rule receives a federal waiver and survives a court challenge from the auto industry .
New Mexico will join too if the Environmental Protection Agency and the courts approve the rule , which appears more likely after last week ’s Supreme Court ruling pressuring the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions .
In the most dramatic example of regional coordination , California and its neighbors are pursuing a formal agreement on climate change .
In February , Schwarzenegger and the Democratic governors of Arizona , New Mexico , Washington and Oregon agreed to devise a regional plan for mandatory reductions in greenhouse gas emissions , most likely through a cap - and - trade system .
That effort , the most sweeping attempt in the U.S. so far to combat the emissions linked to global warming , germinated from discussions that began at last summer ’s Western Governors ’ Assn. meeting in Arizona , and blossomed after Richardson and Schwarzenegger exchanged letters in January about their state - level efforts on the problem .
The participating states have agreed to devise a market - based regulation system by fall 2008 , and sources involved in the design say they hope to entice into the plan not only other Western states but the Canadian province of British Columbia .
Advertisement
Nevada , Idaho and Utah , the three Mountain states with Republican governors , have n’t joined these efforts , but neither have they been completely immune to the trend .
Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman is pursuing an ambitious conservation program .
Idaho ’s Public Utilities Commission in March approved an order decoupling local utility profits from the amount of electricity consumed in the state -- a pro-conservation reform already in place in California and Utah .
The political coalition for these sweeping changes begins with the influx to the rapidly growing Mountain states of new residents unattached to the traditional resource industries -- and in fact inclined to view those interests as threats to the outdoor lifestyle that in many instances prompted them to relocate .
Industries concerned about the potential economic effects of global warming -- such as farmers worried about the effects of declining snowmelt on water supplies and ski towns fearful of warmer winters -- are amplifying those voices .
And many Western utility companies that initially resisted the renewable requirements now see alternative energy as popular with consumers -- and as a valuable hedge against the likelihood that Washington will mandate reduced carbon emissions after President Bush leaves office .
Advertisement
Resistance to this agenda has n’t vanished , especially in the Mountain states traditionally skeptical of government .
Jon Caldara , president of the Independence Institute , a conservative Colorado think tank , maintains that the new energy consensus across the region “ could be potentially devastating for the states ” that adopt it , raising energy costs and suppressing economic growth .
Even supporters who dismiss such a gloomy forecast acknowledge other impediments .
Schweitzer and Ritter , while supporting national action to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , expressed reluctance to join the regional carbon compact for fear of ceding an economic advantage to neighboring states that do n’t .
Solar facilities and the clean - coal technologies that Schweitzer and other governors are promoting may take many years to develop at economically competitive costs .
But the overall shift in the region ’s energy priorities appears irreversible .
Production of oil and natural gas has boomed under Bush and will remain important to the West ’s economy .
But through the Mountain and coastal states alike , the focus of public policy and private investment is moving toward the technologies that were spotlighted at a state conference on alternative energy in Denver last month : wind farms , solar , geothermal heating , biofuels and the next - generation coal power plants that separate carbon emissions and sequester them underground .
“ There is definitely a potential for a backlash , ” said the University of Denver ’s Richard Lamm , who served as Colorado ’s Democratic governor during the raging height of the sagebrush rebellion .
“ But history is on the side of these governors . ”
The goats produce the enzyme in their milk
These poisons are known collectively as organophosphates - a group of chemicals that also includes some pesticides used in farming .
So far , the GM goats have made almost 15kg of a drug which binds to and neutralises organophosphate molecules .
Details appear in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences journal .
The drug , called recombinant butyrylcholinesterase , could be used as a protective " prophylactic " drug and also to treat people after exposure to nerve gas .
None of them have been able to produce anything beyond milligramme amounts .
In the goat , we can make two or three grams per litre
Solomon Langermann , PharmAthene
The US Department of Defense is funding the development effort by biotech firm PharmAthene to the tune of $ 213 m ( £ 105 m ) .
It regards the drug as a promising way to protect its troops against exposure to nerve agents on the battlefield .
Butyrylcholinesterase could also be stockpiled for use in the event of a terrorist attack on a city with chemical weapons .
It is an enzyme that is made in small quantities by the human body .
The compound can be purified from blood , but the yields are poor .
However , the team at PharmAthene has been able to produce butyrylcholinesterase in large , commercial quantities and , the company says , at a reasonable cost .
Tough task
" It is a very difficult molecule to produce .
There is a long history of people trying to produce this in everything from insects to yeast to bacteria and mammalian cells , " said Dr Solomon Langermann of PharmAthene , a co-author on the PNAS paper .
" None of them has been able to produce anything beyond milligram amounts .
In the goat , we can make two or three grams per litre . "
The researchers inserted DNA for making the human form of butyrylcholinesterase into a " vector " molecule .
This vector is then introduced into a goat embryo .
This allows the human gene to be incorporated into the goat 's DNA sequence .
The resulting female animals , all healthy , produced large quantities of butyrylcholinesterase in their milk .
The high yields are partly down to " control elements " - stretches of DNA added , along with the human gene , to the vector molecule .
These control elements regulate how much of the enzyme the goat produces and ensure that most of it is produced in the milk , rather than in other tissues .
Safety trial
Once the enzyme was purified from milk , the scientists injected it into guinea pigs , and saw that it remained active in the bloodstream .
The commercial name given to the butyrylcholinesterase enzyme is Protexia .
Dr Langermann said that Protexia was more effective than the combination of the drugs atropine and 2 - PAM currently carried by soldiers for protection against nerve agents .
" Those ( older ) drugs get cleared from the blood very rapidly .
Even if the soldier were to survive , they would have very severe neurological damage , " he told BBC News .
" With Protexia , you would survive and be able to go back on the battlefield . "
It is also effective against a variety of different organophosphate poisons .
The product is still several years from entering use ; it needs to pass a safety trial and seek approvals from the US government .
Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick , who has been indicted on felony charges of sponsoring a dogfighting business , has been ordered by N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell not to report to the Falcons ’ training camp on Thursday while the league completes a review of his case .
The Falcons ’ first practice is Thursday afternoon , about the same time that Vick is scheduled to be arraigned in Richmond , Va .
Vick will not lose his preseason pay during his absence from camp .
Goodell also told the Falcons to withhold any team discipline for Vick until the N.F.L. review was completed .
The Falcons may try to persuade Vick to take a leave of absence until his case is resolved .
“ While it is for the criminal justice system to determine your guilt or innocence , it is my responsibility as commissioner of the National Football League to determine whether your conduct , even if not criminal , nonetheless violated league policies , including the Personal Conduct Policy , ” Goodell wrote to Vick yesterday .

BAGHDAD , June 1 —
The number of unidentified corpses discovered in Baghdad soared more than 70 percent during May , according to new statistics from the Iraqi Ministry of Interior , an indication that sectarian killings are rising sharply as militias return to the streets after lying low during the first few months of the troop “ surge . ”
In May , 726 unidentified bodies were found in Baghdad , many bound and shot in the head or showing signs of torture and execution , compared with 411 during April , according to figures provided by a ministry official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information .
The Bush administration and military have cited a decline in sectarian killings as proof that the troop escalation is working .
And despite May ’s increase in corpses , the numbers remain far below the peak of sectarian executions last year .
In July and August , for example , a total of 5,106 people died violent deaths in Baghdad alone , according to the United Nations , including 3,391 reported by the city ’s morgue .
The new figures also show a decline in the number of deaths of identifiable victims in Baghdad to 344 in May from 495 in April .
While victims of car bombs , homemade bombs and mortar strikes can usually be identified , those who are kidnapped , tortured and executed are normally stripped of identification before their bodies are dumped .
Story Highlights • Former English department chair pulled Cho Seung - Hui out of class
• Professor tried teaching student one - on - one
• Gun shop owner says Glock 19 was legally purchased 36 days ago
• Police say one of the guns recovered was used in both shooting incidents
Adjust font size :
BLACKSBURG , Virginia ( CNN ) --
A year and a half before before Cho Seung - Hui went on a deadly shooting spree on the campus of Virginia Tech , a professor was so concerned about his anger that she took him out of another teacher 's creative writing class and taught him one - on - one .
The former chairwoman of Virginia Tech 's English department , Lucinda Roy , said the anger Cho expressed was palpable if not explicit .
Cho , an English major , never wrote about guns or killing people , she said .
But his writing was disturbing enough that she went to police and other university officials to seek help .
( Watch the professor tell how her student frightened her )
" The threats seemed to be underneath the surface , " she said .
" They were not explicit , and that was the difficulty the police had . "
" My argument was that he seemed so disturbed that we needed to do something about this . "
Without a clear threat , nothing could be done , however , and Roy made the decision to instruct him away from other students .
" I just felt I was between a rock and a hard place , " she said .
" It seemed the only alternative was to send him back to the classroom , and I would n't do it . "
While teaching Cho one - on - one , Roy said she " made it clear that that kind of writing was unacceptable and he needed to write in another voice . "
She also said that she encouraged Cho to go to counseling , and believed that he may have " gotten tired of hearing it " and begun to tell her he had been going when , perhaps , he had not .
Cho was an intelligent student , Roy said , but he left students and professors alike unnerved in his presence .
Police say Cho killed at least 30 people and wounded 17 others before killing himself in Norris Hall , an engineering classroom building , Monday .
According to a search warrant , police found a note in Norris Hall containing a bomb threat directed at engineering buildings on the campus .
During a three - week period before the shootings , the university received two other bomb threat notes , and police are investigating to see if those threats were related to the shooting .
( Watch how the note threatens engineering buildings )
It 's also believed the 23 - year - old student killed two other people earlier that day in a dormitory on campus .
Virginia Tech Police Chief Wendell Flinchum said ballistics tests show that one of the two guns recovered at Norris Hall was used at the dorm .
' Twisted , macabre violence '
Ian MacFarlane , who said he had class with Cho , called two plays Cho wrote " very graphic " and " extremely disturbing . "
MacFarlane provided a copy of the writings to AOL , where he is an employee .
( Read MacFarlane 's blog and the two plays )
" It was like something out of a nightmare , " MacFarlane wrote in a blog .
" The plays had really twisted , macabre violence that used weapons I would n't have even thought of .
" Before Cho got to class that day , we students were talking to each other with serious worry about whether he could be a school shooter . "
Cho paid $ 571 for a 9 mm Glock 19 pistol just over a month ago , the owner of Roanoke Firearms told CNN Tuesday .
He also used a .22 - caliber
Walther pistol in the attack , police said .
( Interactive :
The weapons used in the shootings )
John Markell said Cho was very low - key when he purchased the Glock and 50 rounds of ammunition with a credit card in an " unremarkable " purchase .
Cho presented three forms of identification and did not say why he wanted the gun , Markell said .
( Watch how quickly these guns can be fired , reloaded )
State police conducted an instant background check that probably took about a minute , the store owner said .
Markell said he was shocked when three agents from the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms arrived at his store Monday with the receipt for the weapon .
Shooter 's note
Cho did not leave a suicide note , according to Col .
Steve Flaherty , superintendent of the Virginia State Police .
( Watch Flaherty describe the scene after the shootings )
However , ABC News reported that other law enforcement sources said Cho did leave some kind of note in his dorm room .
It contained an explanation of his actions and states , " You caused me to do this , " ABC News reported .
It also railed against " rich kids , " " debauchery " and " deceitful charlatans " on campus , according to the Chicago Tribune .
( Note indicates Cho was angry at " rich kids " )
Authorities are still investigating whether Cho had any accomplices in planning or executing Monday 's rampage , Flaherty said .
Cho , a resident alien from South Korea , lived at the university 's Harper Hall , Flinchum said .
" He was a loner , and we 're having difficulty finding information about him , " said Larry Hincker , associate vice president for university relations .
Governor not ready to talk gun control
Tuesday , after an emotional convocation service on campus attended by President Bush , Virginia Gov.
Tim Kaine announced that at the university 's request , he was appointing an independent panel to review Monday 's tragedy .
" It is a very important thing , and a standard thing , that a thorough after - action review be done , both on the event and the response , so that we can learn all we can about them . "
However , Kaine said he was n't interested in arguments about gun control .
" People who want to take this within 24 hours of the event and make it their political hobby horse to ride , I 've got nothing but loathing for them , " Kaine said at a Tuesday evening news conference .
( Watch how crime rates affect public support for gun laws )
" To those who want to try to make this into some little crusade , I say : Take that elsewhere .
Let this community deal with grieving individuals and be sensitive to those needs . "
As questions continued to arise about how police reacted to the first shooting at the dorm , university President Charles Steger on Tuesday defended the response , saying police believed it to be " a domestic fight , perhaps a murder - suicide " that was contained to one dorm room .
Police cordoned off the 895 - student West Ambler Johnston dorm and all residents were told about the shooting as police looked for witnesses , Steger said .
Authorities were still investigating what they believed was an " isolated incident " when the slaughter started at Norris Hall .
" I do n't think anyone could have predicted that another event was going to take place two hours later , " Steger said , adding that it would 've been difficult to warn every student because most were off campus at the time .

With all the advances in software development in the past few years , I would have to point to Google and Google Groups as the two tools that provide the biggest productivity enhancements for me as a software developer .
This fact is probably nothing new to any of you .
Search as a development tool is a phenomena some are starting to refer to asSearch Driven Development ( Not to be confused with Test Driven Development ) .
Let ’s face it , at the rate that new technology is being churned out these days , and given the huge size of many of these frameworks we use , it is impossible to learn everything up front .
At some point , we have to stop RTFM’ing , put the documentation down , and start coding .
And when we run into trouble , we thank our lucky stars that Google is there to save the day .
Would n’t it be great to have some of that search power integrated in your IDE ?
It turns out that Koders.com have done just that .
They provide two free IDE plugins available , one for Eclipse and one for Visual Studio .
NET , on their website in the downloads section .
When you go to the site , there ’s a little animation demonstrating the plugin .
Click the View Again button if you missed it .
Here ’s a screenshot I took of SmartSearch ^TM^ in action .
After typing out the method name , a moment later , the result shows up .
The Smart Search feature is a bit Clippy like at times and sometimes exhibits a bit of lag , making it less useful than it could be .
You may just want to turn it off and choose to use the plugin search box directly .
Though there is room for improvement , I think SmartSearch ^TM^ is really a really interesting application of context based search and could be quite useful as a double check while writing code .
Oh hey , there are already 100 implementations of this method .
Let ’s see how mine stacks up .
Avert my eyes from the GPL licensed code !
Under the hood , these plugins make use of the Koders.com search engine .
This engine directly indexes source control repositories and allows users to quickly search and browse through Open Source code .
It ’s includes a nice interface and provides all the information necessary ( such as the license ) so you can make an informed decision on whether to use it or not .
You can also choose to filter by language and license .
Given my interest in Open Source software , I had heard of Koders.com but did n’t know about their plugins till today , when I had lunch with Darren Rush , the CEO of Koders.com .
Little did I know until Darren contacted me via my blog , Koders.com is based in Los Angeles !
Darren turned me on to the term Search Driven Development .
Finally !
A Los Angeles based company doing something really interesting in the Open Source space that is n’t part of “ The Industry ” .
Very Cool !
As an aside , during our conversation , we wondered why L.A. does n’t have anywhere close to the tech industry that the Bay Area does .
We seem to have all the elements here , but not the community .
I seem to think it ’s because this area is dominated by the film industry .
He pointed out that geography due to the horrible traffic creates pockets of communities .
Probably a bit of both .
But I digress .
In any case , lest you think I ’m shilling ( Yeah , he bought lunch , but I ca n’t be bought that cheaply ! ) , the other player in this field that I ’ve heard about ( apart from the obvious 800 lb gorilla ) is Krugle.com .
While their site has a nice color scheme and look and feel , I found Koders easier to use because of its similarity in layout to Google ( did I mention Koders is L.A. based ? ) .
I think sticking to the Google Search look ( searchbox in the middle ) is a smart move for any search site .
As soon as I see such a site , I know what to do and where to type .
Krugle has a beta plugin to Eclipse , but does n’t seem to have anything for Visual Studio .

Lamborghini still holds a mythic charm for some , as does Maserati and even Rolls Royce or Bentley .
But if you want to talk exotic sports cars that will make you the envy of every other car on the road , there is only Bugatti .
While the company name has come and gone and is now under the umbrella of Volkswagen , the Bugatti mystique has never lagged .
Now , with the introduction of the Veyron , Bugatti has silenced any critics by producing one of the most incredible automobiles in history .
To say that the Veyron is unique is an understatement .
At the time of this article , the Veyron is the most expensive , most powerful and fastest street legal road production car in the world .
The Veyron has been tested at over 253 miles per hour , or 407 km /h .
The Veyron is named after the famed Grand Prix driver of the same name who won the 24 hours of Le Mans in 1939 in a Bugatti .
The Veyron boats 16 cylinders , only the second car after the Cizeta - Moroder V16 T to have 16 cylinders .
The engine has four banks of four cylinders each and is the equivalent of twin narrow - angle V8 ’s , side by side .
This monster engine is fueled by four turbochargers and it displaces eight liters .
One of the most amazing statistics about the Veyron is the fact that it has ten separate radiators : three to cool the engine , two for the air conditioning , four different ones for the oil system and one for the intercoolers .
If you ’re wondering how much horsepower that huge engine can put out , the answer is : a lot .
Testing of the Veyron showed its hp output at 1020 or so but the car is marketed as putting out 1001 .
Even at that rate , the Veyron is still the most powerful street legal car in the world .

If your palms are n’t sweating yet , some of the initial test numbers should do the trick .
Not only can the Veyron reach over 250 mph , but it can go from zero to sixty in only 2.5 seconds .
One of the interesting features of the Veyron is that once it reaches a speed of 137 miles per hour , hydraulics in the car automatically lower it to the ground so that you do n’t end up taking off .
And how much can you expect to pay for this once in a lifetime vehicle ?
The price at the unveiling was 1.4 million dollars , or 737,000 British Pounds .
So , is it worth it ?
It really depends on your financial situation .
If you can drop 1.4 million on a car and not notice a dent in your bank account , then sure , why not ?
Reviewers have called the Veyron one of the greatest achievements in automotive history , and if you can afford to have a piece of that , than by all means , go for it .
But you better bring extra money for gas , the Veyron gets only 8 mpg city and 15 mpg highway .

The Washington Post has assembled a database of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales being notified – repeatedly – of FBI violations of the law governing the use of national security letters .
But here ’s what Gonzales told the Senate Intelligence committee on April 27 , 2005 : “ There has not been one verified case of civil liberties abuse . ”
According to the files obtained by the Post , Gonzales had in fact been notified at that point already six times in his short tenure as AG that the FBI had violated department guidelines to the degree that the FBI general counsel determined the violations needed to be reported to the Inspector General and the Intelligence Oversight Board .
Here are a couple of examples of notifications Gonzales received ( pdf and pdf ) .
Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse parses the gap between the truth and what Gonzales testified to with what ’s become a growing collection of unfathomable statements .
( “ … When Gonzales testified , he was speaking ‘ in the context ’ of reports by the department ’s inspector general … that found no misconduct or specific civil liberties abuses related to the Patriot Act ” ) .
It ’s hard to imagine that the department Gonzales leads is comfortable with his record of misleading testimony to Congress and statements to the American public .
Almost anticipating today ’s Post ‘s revelations , Justice Department attorney John Koppel outlined his frustration in a cry of outrage that ran in the Denver Post over the weekend :
… The administration has attempted to minimize the significance of its malfeasance and misfeasance , reciting its now - customary “ mistakes were made ” mantra , accepting purely abstract responsibility without consequences for its actions , and making hollow vows to do better .
However , the DOJ Inspector General ’s Patriot Act report ( which would not even have existed if the administration had not been forced to grudgingly accept a very modest legislative reporting requirement , instead of being allowed to operate in its preferred secrecy ) , the White House - DOJ e-mails , and now the Libby commutation merely highlight yet again the lawlessness , incompetence and dishonesty of the present executive branch leadership .
They also underscore Congress ’ lack of wisdom in blindly trusting the administration , largely rubber - stamping its legislative proposals , and essentially abandoning the congressional oversight function for most of the last six years .
These are , after all , the same leaders who brought us the WMD fiasco , the unnecessary and disastrous Iraq war , Guantanamo , Abu Ghraib , warrantless domestic NSA surveillance , the Valerie Wilson leak , the arrest of Brandon Mayfield , and the Katrina response failure .
The last thing they deserve is trust .
The sweeping , judicially unchecked powers granted under the Patriot Act should neither have been created in the first place nor permanently renewed thereafter , and the Act – which also contributed to the ongoing contretemps regarding the replacement of U.S. attorneys , by changing the appointment process to invite political abuse – should be substantially modified , if not scrapped outright .
And real , rather than symbolic , responsibility should be assigned for the manifold abuses .
Koppel demonstrates that there ’s at least one person from the Justice Department willing to tell the truth — publicly , and on the record .
It has been a great season for plums , so I ’ve updated the lemon plum jam recipe that I ’ve been gradually refining over the years .
The new basic recipe is below along with other tips I ’ve gathered .
8 cups cut up pieces of plums , pits removed , skins left on , fresh or frozen
3 lemons , ( optionally peeled ) cut into small pieces , seeds removed
juice from 3 more lemons
6 cups sugar
Ingredients :
Procedure :
Put the plums , lemon pieces and lemon juice in a sauce pot and cook , stirring occasionally , until the fruit starts to soften .
At this point , you can use a potato masher to crush the fruit pieces for a more even consistency .
Add sugar and cook , stirring regularly , until it thickens .
You can test the consistency for doneness by putting a spoonful in a cold dish in the fridge for a few minutes .
After chilling , it ’s ready if it holds its shape a bit when you move a spoon or finger through it .
You can also follow your favorite canning procedure for longer term storage .
Makes about 4 - 5 pints .
Tips and techniques :
For cutting up the fruit , I like to put a small cutting board inside a baking sheet .
This catches the juice much better than any cutting board with a moat that I ’ve ever used .
It makes cleanup much easier , and you can pour the juice from the baking sheet into the cooking pot .
Most jam recipes call for approximately equal quantities of sugar and fruit .
I prefer my jam a little more tart , so I ’ve revised down the sugar .
I ’ve stopped adding water to my preserves .
It cooks a little faster without as much liquid , and there ’s enough liquid in the lemon juice to get it started cooking even if the fruit is n’t covered .
I also often leave the lemon peel out for the preserves I make ( other than marmalade ) .
The peel gives it a stronger lemon flavor , but keeps the jam from gelling as well .
If you want a thicker consistency that gels a little earlier , you can leave the peel out .
If you want zingier lemon flavor , leave the peel on and cook a little longer .
During fruit season , I try to preserve as much as I can by making jams and chutneys , but I usually run out of time and end up cutting up the last of the crop and freezing it .
Using frozen fruit for jams seems to work just as well as fresh .
I measure out 8 cups and store it in a one gallon freezer bag .
Then it ’s ready to pull out start a batch of jam .
I also recently revised my Plum Chutney recipe , and it starts with 8 cups of fruit as well .
" Prior to the conference , it was widely believed that the transaction commit problem faced by distributed systems is a degenerate form of the Byzantine Generals Problem studied by academe .
Perhaps the most useful consequence of the conference was to show that these two problems have little in common . "
This is a potted history of consensus , transactions and 2 PC .
Reading the literature on consensus is difficult because the language changes ( consensus was originally called agreement ) , the results come in an order that is n't logical , and the whole framework for describing distributed algorithms evolved in parallel with the work .
Also , there are few books other than Lynch 's Distributed Algorithms that cover the subject .
Papers are discussed in the order that makes most sense , not in the order they were published .
The first instance of the consensus problem that I am aware of is in Lamport 's " Time , Clocks and the Ordering of Events in a Distributed System " ( 1978 ) , though it is not explicitly declared as a consensus or agreement problem .
In this paper Lamport discusses how messages take a finite time to travel between processors and draws an analogy with Einstein 's special relativity .
Discussing Einstein's theory with respect to distributed systems is popular recently in the blogsphere , but in 1978 Lamport give a complete analysis with space - time diagrams and all .
The issue is that in a distributed system you cannot tell if event A happened before event B , unless A caused B in some way .
Each observer can see events happen in a different order , except for events that cause each other , ie there is only a partial ordering of events in a distributed system .
Lamport defines the " happens before " relationship and operator , and goes on to give an algorithm that provides a total ordering of events in a distributed system , so that each process sees events in the same order as every other process .
Lamport also introduces the concept of a distributed state machine : start a set of deterministic state machines in the same state and then make sure they process the same messages in the same order .
Each machine is now a replica of the others .
The key problem is making each replica agree what is the next message to process : a consensus problem .
This is what the algorithm for creating a total ordering of events does , it provides an agreed ordering for the delivery of messages .
However , the system is not fault tolerant ; if one process fails that others have to wait for it to recover .
Around the same time as this paper , Gray described 2 PC in " Notes on Database Operating Systems " ( 1979 ) .
Unfortunately 2 PC would block if the TM ( Transaction Manager ) fails at the wrong time .
Skeen showed in " NonBlocking Commit Protocols " ( 1981 ) that for a distributed transactions you needed a 3 phrase commit algorithm to avoid the blocking problems associated with 2 PC .
The problem was coming up with a nice 3 PC algorithm , this would only take nearly 25 years !
Fischer , Lynch and Paterson showed that distributed consensus was impossible in an asynchronous system with just one faulty process in " Impossibility of distributed consensus with one faulty process " ( 1985 ) , this famous result is known as the " FLP " result .
By this time " consensus " was the name given to the problem of getting a bunch of processors to agree a value .
In an asynchronous system ( where processors run at arbitrary speeds and messages can take an arbitrarily long time to travel between processors ) with a perfect network ( all messages are delivered , messages arrive in order and can not be duplicated ) distributed consensus is impossible with just one faulty process ( even just a fail - stop ) .
The kernel of the problem is that you cannot tell the difference between a process that has stopped and one that is running very slowly , making dealing with faults in an asynchronous system almost impossible .
The paper was also important because it demonstrated how to show something was impossible : show that all algorithms that solve the problem must have some property , then show that this property is impossible , ie proof by contradiction .
( This approach was only re-learned as Turing used it in the halting problem )
By this stage people realized that a distributed algorithm has two properties : safety and liveness .
Safety means nothing bad happens , while liveness means that something good eventually happens .
2 PC is an asynchronous consensus algorithm , all processes must agree on either commit or abort for a transaction .
2 PC is safe : no bad data is ever written to the databases , but its liveness properties are n't great : if the TM fails at the wrong point the system will block .
Also by this stage people thought of distributed systems as being synchronous ( processes run at known rates , and messages are delivered in known bounds of time ) or asynchronous ( processes run at unknown and arbitrary rates , and messages can take unbounded time to be delivered ) .
The asynchronous case is more general than the synchronous case : an algorithm that works for an asynchronous system will also work for a synchronous system , but not vice versa .
You can treat a synchronous system as a special case of an asynchronous system that just happens to have bounds on the time it takes to deliver a message .
Before FLP , there was the " The Byzantine Generals Problem " ( 1982 ) paper .
In this form of the consensus problem the processes can lie , and they can actively try to deceive other processes .
This problem looks harder than the FLP result , but it does have a solution for the synchronous case ( though when the Byzantine Generals paper was written the distinction between asynchronous and synchronous systems was not explicit ) .
The solution is expensive in the number of messages exchanged , and the number of rounds of messages required .
The problem originally came from the aerospace industry : what would happen if sensors gave false information on an plane ( clearly the system could be treated as synchronous ) .
In 1986 there was a get together of the distributed systems people who were interested in consensus and the transaction people .
At the time the best consensus algorithm was the Byzantine Generals , but this was too expensive to use for transactions .
Jim Gray wrote up a note on the meeting : " A Comparison of the Byzantine Agreement Problem and the Transaction Commit Problem . " ( 1987 ) The paper contains this in the introduction :-) Eventually distributed transactions would be seen as a version of consensus , called uniform consensus ( see " Uniform consensus is harder than consensus " ( 2000 ) ) .
With uniform consensus all processes must agree on a value , even the faulty ones - a transaction should only commit if all RMs are prepared to commit .
Most forms of consensus are only concerned with having the non-faulty processes agree .
Uniform consensus is more difficult than general consensus .
Eventually Lamport came up with the Paxos consensus algorithm , described in " The Part - Time Parliament " ( submitted in 1990 , published 1998 ) .
Unfortunately the analogy with Greek democracy failed badly with people finding the paper very difficult to understand , and the paper was ignored until its case was taken up by Butler Lampson in " How to Build a Highly Availability System using Consensus " ( 1996 ) .
This paper provides a good introduction to building fault tolerant systems and Paxos .
Later Lamport would publish " Paxos Made Simple ( 2001 )
The kernel of Paxos is that given a fixed number of processes , any majority of them must have at least one process in common .
For example given three processes A , B and C the possible majorities are : AB , AC , or BC .
If a decision is made when one majority is present eg AB , then at any time in the future when another majority is available at least one of the processes can remember what the previous majority decided .
If the majority is AB then both processes will remember , if AC is present then A will remember and if BC is present then B will remember .
Paxos can tolerate lost messages , delayed messages , repeated messages , and messages delivered out of order .
It will reach consensus if there is a single leader for long enough that the leader can talk to a majority of processes twice .
Any process , including leaders , can fail and restart ; in fact all processes can fail at the same time , the algorithm is still safe .
There can be more than one leader at a time .
Paxos is an asynchronous algorithm ; there are no explicit timeouts .
However , it only reaches consensus when the system is behaving in a synchronous way , ie messages are delivered in a bounded period of time ; otherwise it is safe .
There is a pathological case where Paxos will not reach consensus , in accordance to FLP , but this scenario is relatively easy to avoid in practice .
Clearly dividing systems into synchronous and asynchronous is too broad a distinction , and Dwork , Lynch and Stockmeyer defined partially synchronous systems in " Consensus in the presence of partial synchrony " ( 1988 ) .
There are two versions of partial synchronous system : in one processes run at speeds within a known range and messages are delivered in bounded time but the actual values are not known a priori ; in the other version the range of speeds of the processes and the upper bound for message deliver are known a priori , but they will only start holding at some unknown time in the future .
The partial synchronous model is a better model for the real world than either the synchronous or asynchronous model ; networks function in a predicatable way most of the time , but occasionally go crazy .
Lamport and Gray went on to apply Paxos to the distributed transaction commit problem in " Consensus on Transaction Commit " ( 2005 ) .
They used Paxos to effectively replicate the TM of 2PC , and used an instance of Paxos for each RM involved in the transaction to agree whether that RM could commit the transaction .
On the face of it , using an instance of Paxos per RM looks expensive , but it turns out that it is not .
Paxos Commit will complete in two phases for the fault free case , ie it has the same message delay as 2 PC , though more messages are exchanged .
A third phase is only required if there is a fault , in accordance to the Skeen result .
Given 2n+1 TM replicas Paxos Commit will complete with up to n faulty replicas .
Paxos Commit does not use Paxos to solve the transaction commit problem directly , ie it is not used to solve uniform consensus , rather it is used to make the system fault tolerant .
Any argument that distributed transactions should not be used because 2 PC is blocking is a void , because Paxos Commit addresses the blocking issue .
Recently there has been some discussion of the CAP conjecture : Consistency , Availability and Partition .
The conjecture asserts that you cannot have all three in a distributed system : a system that is consistent , that can have faulty processes and that can handle a network partition .
We can examine CAP by equating consistency with consensus .
For an asynchronous system we cannot reach consensus with one faulty process , FLP , so we cannot have consistency and availability for an asynchronous system !
Now take a Paxos system with three nodes : A , B and C .
We can reach consensus if two nodes are working , ie we can have consistency and availability .
Now if C becomes partitioned and C is queried , it cannot respond because it cannot communicate with the other nodes ; it does n't know whether it has been partitioned , or if the other two nodes are down , or if the network is being very slow .
The other two nodes can carry on , because they can talk to each other and they form a majority .
So for the CAP conjecture , Paxos does not handle a partition because C cannot respond to queries .
However , we could engineer our way around this .
If we are inside a data center we can use two independent networks ( Paxos does n't mind if messages are repeated ) .
If we are on the internet , then we could have our client query all nodes A , B and C , and if C is partitioned the client can query A or B unless it is partitioned in a similar way to C.
For a synchronous network , if C is partitioned it can learn that it is partitioned if it does not receive messages in a fixed period of time , and thus can declare itself down to the client .
Paxos , Paxos Commit and HTTP / REST have been combined to build a highly available co-allocation system for Grid computing , details of which can be found here HARC , there are also more references in this paper : " Co- Allocation , Fault Tolerance and Grid Computing " ( 2006 )
I HAVE reached a curious point in life .
Although I feel like the same precocious know - it - all cynic I always was , I suddenly am surrounded by younger precocious know - it - all cynics whose main purpose appears to be to remind me that I ’ve lost my edge .
Many of these people are teenagers .
Some of them I gave birth to .
One was in a breech position .
And the other day , as I drove home with one of my tormenters in the passenger seat , she started laughing at the way I pronounced “ Henri Cartier - Bresson . ”
“ Ha ha ha , is that how you think his name sounds ? ” my daughter said .
“ Oh , my God .
Who told you that ? ”
It was my college photography professor .
Twenty - six years ago .
Rather than draw attention to my age , I tried to trick her into thinking of me as someone cool , as we said 26 years ago .
“ I hope you do n’t think this gives you the right to make fun of me on your Facebook page , ” I said .

I am just finishing up my paper " A Skeptical Layman 's Guide to Anthropogenic Global Warming , " and one thing I encounter a lot with sources and websites that are strong supporters of Anthropogenic Global Warming ( AGW ) theory is that they will often say such - and - such argument by skeptics was just disproved by so - and - so .
For example , skeptics often argue that historical temperature records do not correct enough for the effects of urbanization on long - term measurement points .
The IPCC , in fact , has taken the position that what is called the urban heat island effect is trivial , and does not account for much or any of measured warming over the last 100 years .
To this end , one of the pro-AGW sites ( either RealClimate.org or the New Scientist , I can't remember which ) said that " Parker in 2006 has disproved the urban heat island effect . "
Now , if you were going to set out to do such a thing , how would you do it ?
The logical way , to me , would be to draw a line from the center of the city to the rural areas surrounding it , and take a bunch of identical thermometers and have people record temperatures every couple of miles along this line .
Then you could draw a graph of temperature vs. nearness to the city center , and see what you would find .
Is that what Parker did ?
Uh , no .
I turn it over to Steve McIntyre , one of the two men who helped highlight all the problems with the Mann hockey stick several years ago .
If you are not a climate scientist ( or a realclimate reader ) , you
would almost certainly believe , from your own experience , that cities
are warmer than the surrounding countryside - the " urban heat island " .
From that , it 's easy to conclude that as cities become bigger and as
towns become cities and villages become towns , that there is a
widespread impact on urban records from changes in landscape , which
have to be considered before you can back out what portion is due to
increased GHG .
One of the main IPCC creeds is that the urban heat island effect has
a negligible impact on large - scale averages such as CRU or GISS .
The
obvious way of proving this would seem to be taking measurements on an
urban transect and showing that there is no urban heat island .
Of
course , Jones and his associates can't do that because such transects
always show a substantial urban heat island .
So they have to resort to
indirect methods to provide evidence of " things unseen " , such as Jones
et al 1990 , which we 've discussed in the past .
The newest entry in the theological literature is Parker ( 2004 , 2006 ) ,
who , once again , does not show the absence of an urban heat island by
direct measurements , but purports to show the absence of an effect on
large - scale averages by showing that the temperature trends on calm
days is comparable to that on windy days .
My first reaction to this ,
and I 'm sure that others had the same reaction was : well , so what ?
Why
would anyone interpret that as evidence one way or the other on UHI ?
He goes on to take the study apart in detail , but I think most of you can see that the methodology makes absolutely zero sense unless one is desperately trying to toe the party line and win points with AGW supporters by finding some fig leaf to cover up this urban heat island problem .
By the way , plenty of people have performed the analysis the logical way we discussed first , and have shown huge heat island effects :
( Click for a larger view )
The bottom axis by the way is a " sky - view " metric I had not seen before , but is a measurement of urban topology .
Effectively the more urbanized and the more tall buildings around you that create a canyon effect , the lower the sky view fraction .
Note that no one gets a number for the Urban Heat Island effect less than 1 degree C , and many hover around 6 degrees ( delta temperature from urban location to surrounding rural countryside ) .
Just a bit higher than the 0.2C assumed by the IPCC .
Why would they assume such a low number in the face of strong evidence ?
Because assuming a higher number would reduce historical warming numbers , silly .
Oh , and the IPCC argues that the measurement points it uses around the world are all rural locations so urban heat island corrections are irrelevant .
Below are some sample photos of USHCN sites , which are these supposedly rural sites that are used in the official historical warming numbers .
By the way , these US sites are probably better than what you would find anywhere else in the world .

The eye of the tiger , or perhaps more importantly the teeth , are a little too close for comfort .
But Arnd Drossel appears to have at least baffled the beasts , if not tamed them , with his spherical steel enclosure .
The German performance artist turned the conventions of the zoo on their head by putting himself inside a cage and allowing the big cats to view him as a curiosity .
His stunt was one stop on a 220 - mile roll through the German state of North - Rhine Westphalia to raise money for , and awareness about , psychiatric patients .
He accepts that some observers will judge him ' a stripe short of a tiger ' for including this particular area of the Stukenbrock Safari Park on his route .
But he insists his protective capsule - 250 high - grade steel strands welded into something resembling a massive ball of wool - is strong enough to keep him safe .
Drossel , 38 , who designs furniture for a living when not suffering for his art , will eat , sleep and move in the ball .
He propels it by simply shifting his weight in a walking motion , and aims to cover 13 miles a day .
' I got the idea for this because , about a year ago , I hit a low and
realised how little help there was out there , ' he said .
' I set about thinking of a way to publicise those who need pyschiatric help and came up with this .
' Basically , the whole concept is about finding the courage to do something and inspire courage in those who have lost their confidence along with much else . '
Psychiatric patients from clinics in the region helped him create the rolling globe and some were present to see Drossel roll into the tiger enclosure .
After his encounter with the cats he was trundling on through the state , aiming eventually to finish in his home town of Warburg on April 28 .
Karl - Josef Laumann , the health minister for the state , is backing the stunt .
He said : ' Psychiatric patients are often stigmatised and ostracised in our society .
This must change .'

" If we run into such [ government ] debts , as that we must be taxed in our meat and in our drink , in our necessaries and our comforts , in our labors and our amusements , for our callings and our creeds , as the people of England are , our people , like them , must come to labor sixteen hours in twenty - four , give the earnings of fifteen of these to the government for their debts and daily expenses , and the sixteenth being insufficient to afford us bread , we must live , as they now do , on oatmeal and potatoes , have no time to think , no means of calling the mismanagers to account ; but be glad to obtain subsistence by hiring ourselves to rivet their chains on the necks of our fellow - suffers .

How about ' Helicopter ' Ben Bernake , Federal Reserve Chairman and his take on the economy ?
February 12 , 2007 : WASHINGTON : " When Ben Bernake testifies before the new Democratic majorities of the U.S. Congress this week , it may be hard to tell that he and his questioners are talking about the same economy .
Bernake , the Federal Reserve chairman , will use his semiannual appearances before the banking panels of the Senate and the House of Representatives to describe a healthy economy and a strong job market .
Democrats like Representative Paul Hodes of New Hampshire will paint a much different picture - of stagnant incomes and jobs lost to foreign competition .
Sherrod Brown , a newly elected Democratic senator from Ohio who serves on the banking committee , said , " While the economy is good for people at the top , it 's not so good for a steelworker in Lorain , Ohio , or a small - business owner in Dayton " .

They 're checking the help - wanted ads . "
July 18 , 2007 : US weathering housing slump ; inflation still biggest risk : " WASHINGTON ( AFP ) -
The US economy is slowly emerging from a worse - than - expected housing slump but will manage to post " moderate " growth in 2007 and 2008 , Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernake said Wednesday ....
The central bank cut its forecast for 2007 growth to a range of 2.25 to 2.5 percent , down from a 2.5 to 3.0 percent range in the Fed 's outlook in February ....
Addressing the troubles of subprime mortgage loans hit by rising defaults and foreclosures , Bernake said this has led to " personal , economic and social distress " for many homeowners and communities and that these problems " likely will get worse before they get better . "
While Bernake diddles around reassuring everyone that the road to economic prosperity is just around the corner , with a few bumps that will never affect him , what 's really happening out there ?
Bear Stearns Says Hedge Fund Worthless : NEW YORK - " Bear Stearns Cos. told clients Tuesday that a meltdown in the subprime mortgage market has made the assets from two of its flagship hedge funds almost worthless .
Both funds were squeezed after Bear Stearns made wrong - way bets on the home mortgage market and was caught as loans to risky investors began to default .
The assets in one of the funds are essentially worthless , while another is worth 9 percent of its value at the end of April , according to a document obtained by The Associated Press .
Bear Stearns , the nation 's fifth - largest investment bank , began disclosing in March that the two hedge funds had sustained heavy losses tied to subprime loans extended to risky borrowers .
At the time , its High - Grade Structured Credit Enhanced Leveraged Fund was worth about $ 638 million _ and now has no value .
Meanwhile , the larger and less - leveraged High - Grade Structured Credit Fund lost 91 percent of its value .
It was worth about $ 925 million before taking on losses in March . "
July 10 , 2007 : US mortgages
Easy money hits home with lenders facing ï¿ ½250bn losses . "
The collapse in sub - prime loans threatens the big banks that financed brokers
While the crisis in the loans market has had devastating effects in many US households , it now risks reverberating throughout the financial system ..... Many of the low - grade loans are believed to be held by US lenders caught up in the collapse of the sub - prime mortgage market .
Some of the world 's biggest banks supported the loans sold by Mr. Sadek and other brokers .
Citigroup , Morgan Stanley , Lehman Brothers and JP Morgan Chase in the US and HSBC and Barclays are just some of the lenders sitting on huge losses .
A report by analysts at Lombard Street Research has estimated that the crisis could knock a hole in the banks ' assets of up to ï¿ ½250bn .
Few banks have so far assessed the extent of their losses , but they could soon be forced to address this issue . "
May 16 , 2007 : LEAP / E2020 Alert -
The US economy went into recession in the first quarter of 2007 : " Thus , as anticipated by LEAP / E2020 in February 2007 , the month of April 2007 marks the tipping point of the phase of impact of the global systemic crisis , and signals the objective entry of the US into recession , even though official US figures are still trying to conceal the trend .
Besides , in relation to this fundamental piece of information , April 2007 was also a turning point on a number of key - factors of the global systemic crisis whose evolution will experience a new acceleration .
In this month 's issue of GEAB , LEAP / E2020 enters into the details of the two following analyses : - Aggravation of the US consumer 's insolvency , profit reduction for companies depending on the US market and massive layoffs contribute to a negative retroactive loop - Acceleration of dollar collapse , imported inflation , increase in balance of payment deficit and trade tensions with Asia and Europe smash the Fed 's consensus and thrust the US into the very great depression .

How to spoil a good party .
" Mr. Turk says central banks almost daily talk about diversifying away from the dollar or creating their own currency zones .
In a recent interview with a Russian journalist , the journalist said even Russians , which have long coveted greenbacks , are now beginning to question the supremacy of the U.S. dollar .
Investors , too , are beginning to shun it , with none other than Warren Buffett leading the pack .
" Look , too , at the stock market , " he says .
" The stock market is not going up because of economic fundamentals .
People would rather own a million dollars of Exxon than have a million dollars in the bank .
It 's also true people would own a million dollars of copper than have a million dollars sitting in the bank .
All these things cumulatively are suggesting to me we are probably on the final slippery slope for the dollar .
I do think the next several months are going to be very , very tumultuous .
" We 're buying from China , " he says .
" They 're lending us back the money .
It 's unsustainable .
It can not go on forever because we 're eroding our net worth .
Just like individuals can have too much debt , companies can have too much debt , nations can have too much debt . "
July 5 , 2007 : American dream sours as housing market collapses .
" For Cathy Busby , May 1 marked a personal " Mayday ! " as she was sucked into the housing crisis sweeping the United States .
On Tuesday , she went into arrears on her mortgage after her monthly repayments soared by 40 per cent .
The 47 - year - old hospital administrator will lose the three - bedroom home in the Denver suburb of Montebello that she bought 11 years ago , unless she can reach a deal with her lender .
Cathy Busby is unable to meet the repayments on her home of 11 years after interest rates rocketed by 40 per cent .
" I raised my sons here and I planted these aspens and landscaped this garden .
It 's a terrible thought that I could lose it all , " she said on the first day that she failed to pay her interest - only - mortgage .
Miss Busby is far from alone : the American dream of home ownership is turning sour for many .
Up to two million people with so - called subprime , or high risk , - mortgages have already had their homes repossessed , or will default on their loans in the coming months , according to industry estimates .
Such houses are generally sold at auction , for less than the full market price .
Home owners ' losses will total an estimated $ 164 billion ( ï¿½82 billion ) , according to the Centre for Responsible Lending , an independent research group . "

International Forecaster : " Now for the classic : Mr. Bernake said he did not know whether the so - called " financial accelerator effect on household spending via access to credit was big enough to affect the overall economy . "
Of course he knows .
Any college freshman knows .
If equity is falling and interest rates are rising and lending standards are tightened less equity and cash out loans will be made .
Those loans have already fallen more than 50 % over the last 1 - 1/ 2 years , and that means some $ 300 billion is no longer available to fuel the economy .
This is the money the public used over the past four years to continue their lifestyles and spending sprees , because their wages and salaries did not come anywhere near covering the increases in inflation , which our government tells us is 2.4 % .
As a result of free trade , globalization , off shoring and outsourcing have produced productivity gains of only 0.6 % , while higher interest rates erode and reduce the value of personal and corporate assets and cash flows .
Ben gets it be just does n't want you to know the economy is in serious trouble and it is going to get much worse . "

Gold rallies on Bernake 's US sub - prime concerns for US economy .
" LONDON ( Thomson Financial ) - Gold rallied after the dollar weakened when Fed Chairman Ben Bernake highlighted the dangers of the sub - prime fallout to the US economy in his semi-annual testimony to Congress .
Gold tends to move counter to the dollar , as it is seen as an alternative asset to the world 's most common currency reserve ....
Some analysts believe gold is asserting its position as a wealth guarantor in times of market volatility , following Bear Stearn 's announcement that two of their stressed hedge funds are now essentially worthless after investing heavily in the US sub - prime market . "
When people do n't spend , the economy goes flat .
Our economy is based on debt and debt is NOT prosperity .
The congressionally created national debt currently means that every household in America owes the privately owned " Federal " Reserve banking system $ 516,348 and that number will continue to grow .
For what ?
Endless wars based on a mountain of lies from Bush , his cabinet and members of Congress .
Foreign welfare , the raiding of the people 's treasury with ZERO authority from the U.S. Constitution to enrich foreign countries , potentates and dictators alike , and to to fund wars between countries thousands of miles from U.S. soil .
The savings rate in this country is in the minus column , millions are living paycheck to paycheck .
As the cost of food and energy rises , the less disposable income people have to spend into the economy .
The more foreign made products Americans purchase , the trade imbalance increases and Americans continue to lose ground for good paying productive jobs .
What does this mean for Americans ?
When you factor in the death trap Congress has snared the American people into with these devastating and unconstitutional trade treaties , anti-American companies outsourcing the best jobs , stealing via withholding taxes , the federal income tax rip off , the plans underway to erase the U.S. and merge us with Canada and Mexico and the coming financial tsunami when that first wave of baby boomers hits next year , look forward to at least three if not four paychecks needed to support your household .
Let 's also not forget the oil / energy situation and if anyone thinks they will ever see $ 2.00 / per gallon gas again .
And , yes , I am fully aware of Lindsey Williams ' work , The Non-Energy Crisis .
After my last column on America 's gold reserves , I received a couple of e-mails from individuals who told me I was stupid , ignorant and did n't have a clue about our monetary system .
They are supporters of Richard C. Cook 's convoluted and unworkable solution to the central bank and his desire to get back to FDR 's communist New Deal .
Of course I 'm stupid and everyone else is a genius !
Where on earth do I get my understanding of our monetary system , fiat currency and reform ?
Back in 1991 when I first came upon the claim that the Federal Reserve Banking System was a privately owned cartel , I began my research .
I gave up my career and studied and studied - for years as I began my activism .
I read everything I could get my hands on by Dr. Edwin Vieira .
I 've read all his books , Pieces of Eight , CrashMaker , How to Dethrone the Imperial Judiciary and Constitutional Homeland Security : A Call for Americans to Revitalize the Militia of the Several States .
Volume I , The Nation in Arms .
I studied the writings of monetary scholars from the Von Mises Institute and dozens of books by those who are far more intelligent than I am on this issue ; see my Reading Room .
Click here for this section in particular which has a load of congressional record and state archives documents that are of great historical importance .
One e-mailer sent the usual snotty and childish text telling me I work real hard at selling gold .
I do n't sell gold .
I 'm not a precious metals dealer , retailer or anything else .
I know what 's coming because you can only put so much air in a bubble before to bursts .
I feel so bad for Americans who really do n't realize just how dangerous and unstable the situation really is .
That 's why I recommend El Dorado Gold if people are looking to protect their assets .
Americans can't even get access to their own money , i.e. , 401 ( k ) accounts without the government stealing from them in the form of penalties !
How anyone can say they 're free in this country when a corrupt government has allowed a private cartel to control the fruits of your labor and doom all of us to poverty , is beyond me .
For those who think Barack Obama , Hillary Clinton , Fred Thompson ( member of the treasonous CFR ) , Rudy Julie - Annie or Mitt Romney are going to save their bacon , they are making a big mistake .
None of these candidates are making any effort to warn the American people .
In the case of Obama and Rudy , I doubt they even have a clue regarding the central bank and the danger of a fiat currency .
Obama is stuck on free abortions and sex education for kindergartners , while Rudy busy is fending off the attack from the firefighters in NYC who are blowing the whistle on Giuliani 's incompetence re 911 .
The bells will toll because Congress continues to turn a blind eye to the seriousness of the overall situation , but they waste time on stupid and unnecessary legislation while America burns .
( " Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that there should be established a National Letter Carriers Appreciation Day . " ( Introduced in House ) [ H.RES.49 .IH ] .
In two weeks Congress will AGAIN head for another vacation while the clock ticks .
Survival is the name of the game and I hope folks will take the time to sit down and assess their individual situation .
Get out of debt if you can ; assist elderly parents who need help .
Prepare for the worst because FED Chairman Ben Bernake , is either delusional or he 's being deliberately deceptive .

This may sound eerily familiar : oil prices are spiking , sending shivers from Wall Street to Main Street .
Since the new year began , crude oil has soared more than $ 7 a barrel to $ 68.35 - the highest level since late August when hurricane Katrina roiled energy markets .
This time , the main impetus appears to be a bad case of international jitters , ranging from Iran to Nigeria to Osama bin Laden .
If the tensions do n't cool off , energy analysts warn , consumers should brace themselves to pay more at the gas pump in weeks ahead .
" It 's been one thing after another , " says Phil Flynn of Alaron Trading in Chicago .
On Friday , rising oil prices and disappointing earnings sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average into a 213 point dive , one of the sharpest declines since spring 2003 .
One reason for Wall Street 's concern : if the price of oil stays high , it will take money out of people 's pockets in a year when consumers are expected to moderate spending anyway .
" Consumer spending may slow down a bit more than thought , " says David Wyss , chief economist at Standard & Poor 's in New York .
" But , it wo n't drive us into a recession - that would probably take oil going well over $ 100 a barrel . "
Rising oil prices could increase the prices Americans pay for everything from pizza delivery - yes , there is an extra $ 1 fuel surcharge - to how much money it will cost to get the kids back and forth to hockey practice .
So far , however , many companies have absorbed their higher energy costs .
Last year , food and energy added just 1.2 percentage points to the inflation rate , which averaged 3.4 percent .
Still , energy costs are one of the factors the Federal Reserve monitors .
The Fed will meet next Tuesday and is expected to raise rates for the fourteenth consecutive time by a quarter percentage point .
Beyond that , how the Fed acts will depend on inflation prospects and its own analysis of the economy .
Typically , oil prices start to retreat by this time in January since there are only about six weeks left to the worst part of the home heating oil season .
Other than early December , this winter has been milder in the US than some meteorologists expected .
Last Friday , the temperature reached 61 degrees in New York .
While winter in the US has been relatively mild , parts of Europe have faced bitter conditions .
This has lead to much higher use of heating oil and natural gas .
Last week , fierce winter conditions led Russia to curtail production of oil in its Arctic regions .
But geopolitical uncertainty has shaken up energy markets even more than cold weather in Europe .
Iran , faced with the prospect of economic sanctions for restarting its nuclear program , has warned that the price of oil might rise if the West intervenes .
The country 's leaders have been vague in explaining how that might happen .
Iran exports 2.5 million barrels of oil per day , a significant amount going to Asia .
The other trouble spot is Nigeria which exports about 2.25 million barrels of crude per day , most of it suitable for producing gasoline .
Tribal frictions have cut production by about 100,000 to 200,000 barrels of oil per day .
" It 's not sizable but any amount has gotten people nervous , " says John Felmy , chief economist at the American Petroleum Institute in Washington .
Sunday , the situation in Nigeria remained murky , at best .
Four foreign oil workers have been kidnapped by guerrilla forces demanding the release of some tribal leaders .
Nigerian newspapers are warning that there could be more attacks in the Niger Delta but the government says it is negotiating in order to calm the region .
Some analysts say the markets will retreat in the weeks ahead .
" Once the market realizes there is no real threat of an immediate conflict , the market will calm down and we will see oil prices back in the $ 50s or $ 60s per barrel , " says Eugenio Aleman , a senior economist at Wells Fargo Banks in Minneapolis .
" This is highly political . "
Before the jitters in the market , some analysts thought the price would head lower .
OPEC oil ministers are still talking about reducing oil production this spring , to avoid a supply glut .
The Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) is forecasting the average price for oil will be $ 63.30 this year .
" If there was no anxiety about Iran and Nigeria and other countries , we think prices would be much lower than they are now , " says Mark Rodekohr , an EIA analyst .
Even though Mr. Rodekohr says that the price of oil should be going lower during the year , he says he would not be surprised to see the price rise to the $ 70 range , back where it was soon after hurricane Katrina struck .
" The key is how long - will it be a day or two or is there enough anxiety to drive it for a little while longer ? "
If the price of oil stays high in the weeks ahead , it will likely be reflected in the price at the pump .
So far , gasoline price gains have remained relatively modest given the rise in oil prices .
Nationally , gasoline is about $ 2.30 a gallon , up from $ 2.09 a gallon only a few months ago .
" Oil prices at this level are not factored into the price of gasoline , " says Rodekohr .
For 2006 , EIA expects a price range of $ 2.25 to $ 2.50 a gallon .
" We do n't see any reason to think it will go below $ 2 , " he says .
And , if oil moves above $ 70 a barrel for a sustained period , he says , prices at the pump will move quite a bit higher - even before the spring driving season begins .
" We proudly say ' no ' - we proudly shout ' no ' - to the outrageous abuses of power , the violations of law and the heinous violations of human rights committed by George Bush and his administration . "
The mayor then invited his fellow demonstrators to shout " no " as he rattled off a litany of alleged abuses by the president , Congress , even the news media .

James Gordon Bennett ( right ) and his playboy son , Gordon Bennett
It 's not an epitaph one would wish for - to become the physical embodiment of a swear word .
But how else do you explain Gordon Bennett , the expression of surprise that , in lewder company , would take four - letter form ?
But who was the original Gordon Bennett , and how did he come to be immortalised in the English language ?
No one knows for sure , which is why the country 's leading language experts are consulting the public on the origins of this and dozens of other vexing words and phrases ,
In tracking the origins of Gordon Bennett , these - to employ the parlance of a notable linguistic conjurer of our times - are the known unknowns :
• There were two famous Gordon Bennetts who might have been the source - a father and son
• James Gordon Bennett
Snr was a Scottish - born journalist , famous in the US for founding the New York Herald and conducting the first ever newspaper interview
• His son , of the same name , was more interested in fast cars , planes and women .
He used his inheritance to sponsor the Bennett Trophy in motor racing from 1900 to 1905 , and in 1906 established a hot - air balloon race that is still held today .
In fact , Gordon Bennett Jnr was probably the first international playboy
Nora Batty : The original Flaming Nora ... unlikely
But there 's one big hitch - there is no evidence to link the phrase " Gordon Bennett " with either man .
Indeed , the first time the expression appears in print in the Oxford English Dictionary is in 1967 , a long time after their heyday .
Gordon Bennett , along with his sisters Flaming Nora and Bleeding Adam , are just three of a large number of eponyms - a person whose name becomes a synonym for something - in the English language .
Many are mysteries , and as with all etymological detective work , there are a legion of theories - from the plausible to the downright ludicrous .
Sadly , perhaps , the Gordon Bennett who became enshrined in the English language , might never have existed , says John Simpson , chief editor of the Oxford English Dictionary .
" The expression is probably just a euphemistic extension of ' God ! ' or ' Gawd ! ' , turned into a proper name to weaken the swear - word . "
Eponyms often present a particularly slippery challenge for word sleuths , says Mr Simpson , who cites " Taking the Mickey " as another good example .
" There does n't have to be a specific person behind a phrase .
' Mickey ' here is probably being used to represent a type of person , rather than as a specific name . "
The origin of words can be found tucked away in football fanzines , LPs , school newspapers - the sort of sources we can't easily get our hands on
John Simpson , chief editor OED
The OED bills itself as the " definitive record of the English language " , and aims to find the earliest verifiable usage of every single word within it .
That 's currently 600,000 words and counting , so it 's not surprising that it has a longstanding tradition of turning to the public for help .
In the lead up to the new series of BBC Two 's Balderdash and Piffle , lexicographers at the OED are staging their second so - called Wordhunt - asking for the public 's help in tracing the history of 40 well - known words and phrases .
The results will feature in the BBC show when it returns in the spring .
To help , amateur word sleuths must find an earlier example of one of the 40 words and phrases , although this does n't have to be in a book .
" Wordhunters made some remarkable discoveries in the last series , " says Mr Simpson .
" They found evidence tucked away in football fanzines , LPs , school newspapers : just the sort of sources we can't easily get our hands on . "
Other sources worth checking would be unpublished papers , letters and post - marked postcards .
Words like " identity theft " , also on the Wordhunt list , might well first have appeared online .
From diary to dictionary

Sure enough , when Michele Grange hunted through her diaries she found it written in her schoolgirl hand .
The diary entry is now immortalised in the OED .
As for Gordon Bennett , it remains to be seen whether the saying owes itself to a real person .
As for Gordon Bennett Jnr , son of the newspaper magnate , he certainly holds one honour - holder of the Guinness Book of Records entry for " Greatest Engagement Faux Pas " .
One very drunken evening he turned up late to a posh party held by his future in - laws , and ended up urinating into a fireplace in full view of everyone .
The engagement , unsurprisingly , was broken off , and Mr Bennett left New York to pursue his playboy habits in Paris .
Ref the word " Phwore " , I remember the comic Terry Scott in his " schoolboy role " saying it , but I cannot remember the name of the T.V. show .
However , his use of the word certainly predates the dates shown in the new O.E.D.
Did HE invent it ?

I was led to believe that Gordon Bennett was in the army in the second world war and had something to do with the Allied failure in South East Asia , I think he made some form of mistake and his troops were captured or he deserted his troops and tried to escape to Australia .

I remember reading as a small child that Gordon Bennett was the leader of a foxhunt around the turn of the last century , and would announce his name as a sort of clarion call to other hunters .
Thinking back , it was probably total hogwash ... but it made sense to me at the time .
Certainly far more quaint - and quintessentially English - than the two other candidates mentioned here ...

I heard Gordon Bennett was a " hanging " judge , in Victorian London .
However I would prefer it to have originated from the hairdresser of that name from East Coews , Isle of Wight in the 1970s .
The country 's best known hairdresser then !
I would like to know where the term " Tom " - for a prostitute - came from ( e.g from " Tom , Dick and Harry " perhaps ... but where did that originate ? ) .

I had always thought Gordon Bennett referred to Gen Gordon Bennett of the Australian Forces in Malaya prior to the fall of Singapore .
He is chiefly remembered for having abandoned his forces to their fate , slipping back to Australia immediately prior to Singapore 's surrender .

The story I 've read is as follows :- The Gordon Bennett Cup for motor racing was won by a British Driver and car ( Selwyn Edge in a Napier ) in 1902 .

A circuit was laid out on closed public roads in Co. Kildare , Ireland .

Gordon Bennett -
Although I cannot verify this I remember my mother using the expression in the 1940s and I have used it frequently ever since as a nearly - but - not - quite swearword .

In his book ' Made In America ' , Bill Bryson suggests that James Gordon Bennett was the originator of the term ' Gordon Bennett ' because of his habit of annoucing his arrival in restaurants by ' yanking the tablecloths from all the tables he passed .
He would then hand the manager a wad of cash with which to compensate his victims for their lost meals and spattered attire ' .

I would have thought that " phorr " ( and the alternate spellings ) came into use in UK English following the popularity of Terry Scott 's recording of " My Brother " in the early 1960's ( 1962 ? ) .
Whether the song actually originated the word , I do n't know .
" Phorr , there 's something funny round 'ere .
What is it ?
Oh , it 's you ... come 'ere and sit down .
You 're gonna 'ave the truth told about you and put on record .
' Ere , please do not sit too close to me , I 've just 'ad my breakfast , thank you . "

I 'm afraid your researcher is mistaken , the Gordon Bennett balloon race is for hydrogen / helium balloons , not the hot air variety .
This year the contestants took off from Belgium and the leaders landed in Finland and northern Norway having passed over the UK .

I have always thought that Gordon was God and Bennett was a version of Benedict making a religious oath similar to God bless us and such as zounds - short for God 's wounds .
For evidence there is Bene't St. in Cambridge - short for Benedict .

The explanation of ' Gordon Bennett ' that Bill Bryson came up with in one of his books was GB Jnr would make an entrance at restaurants in New York by attempting the table cloth trick on other diners tables - to which they would shout ' Gordon Bennett ' as the cutlery and crockery went clattering onto the floor .

Dear Beeb :
Your help , please , with one expression to which I have never received a sensible explanation : Talking " NINETEEN TO THE DOZEN " .....
Why Nineteen ? ;
Why not Thirteen ( as in the Baker 's famous dozen ) ?
Why , oh !
why ?
Thank you in advance for solving a problem that haunted me for 50 + years !
Sincerely , Antony Jones .

I 'm not sure if it 's just urban legend , but apparently Gordon Bennett was a bit of an all - round nutter .
He had a habit of attempting the trick of whipping tablecoths away from diners ' tables without warning .
The well - known exclaimation followed his regular failure .

I too am fascinated by the origin of certain terms and expressions .
On a visit to the historic sites in Stratford on Avon one of the guides explaind a number of them eg one over the eight , and keep it under your hat .
I think the premise of the TV series is excellent and amusing .
Sadly the reality was less so .
I and my family found the last series very dry and boring .
the bizarre interviewing scenes with crusty OED dons and the need for contanst written evidence of usage and date rather than explaining more of the commonly used sayings and their beleived meanings made it very tedious .
I heard the new series previewed on this morning 's Today programme and will try again to watch , in the hope you might have ' re - invented the wheel ' , attempted ' to build a better mousetrap ' or simply ' lightened up dudes ! '

There was a French teacher at our school called Gordon Bennett .
Naturally , he had a sense of humour ...

I would like to propose " Mediocracy " - Rule of a country or nation by the media .
I do n't know whether it 's already in the OED , but I like to think I invented it !

From : max.harris@ace-ina.com
My understanding of " Gordon Bennett " is that it relates to the playboy son , who 's ' Bennett Trophy ' races ended up decending into farce , with withspread cheating and rule breaking - the resultant mockery being directed at Bennett himself .
Hence the name became a phrase , derogatory in nature .
I have this mentioned in 2 separate motor racing history books , so believe it to be genuine !

A more likely Gordon Bennet ( full name Henry Gordon Bennet but always known as Gordon ) was the Australian military officer of that name who was at first praised but later pilloried for escaping from the Japanese occupation of Singapore in February 1942 , leaving behind the men he commanded to their fate .
This effectively ended his career and after the war he was officially censured for disobeying orders .
Adrian Baron , Kinsgtown , St. Vincent and the Grenadines
I believe this is attributed to General Henry Gordon Bennett of the Australian Army who was in command of the Australian Forces at the surrended of Singapore in the Second World War .
Having surrendered the force to the Japanese he then left his troops and escaped back to Australia and was never forgiven for this act .

Do n't be part of the Web 2.SLOW
The concept of “ Web 2.0 ” captured the imagination of web developers worldwide less than two years ago .
But the promise of better user experiences and customer - centric content is regularly silenced by downtime and plagued by poor performance .
Why is this the case ?
Servers have never offered so much power so affordably , and the software that underpins web applications has matured and is generally very reliable .
In part one of this analysis we examine the factors leading to slow website performance – both on the client and server - side .
In part two we look at the causes and impacts of website downtime , and what you can do to minimize them .
JavaScript & CSS : Bloat is Back
Modern websites make extensive use of CSS & JavaScript to deliver highly responsive user interfaces .
With high - powered desktop PCs equipped with fast broadband connections , one can sift vast swathes of scripting and style with carefree abandon .
Dialup users , be damned – this is Web 2.0 .
It ’s not uncommon to view the page source of a web application and find more than ten separate .CSS and .
JS resources included .
Every external resource required by a page means another HTTP request is needed to fetch it .
Considering that browsers need to fetch all CSS & JavaScript resources before they begin to render a page this spells serious trouble for performance .
Case Study : digg.com
Let ’s examine one of the poster - children of Web 2.0 , digg.com
Our testing environment is a 180 ms round trip away from the web server hosting digg.com .
This is a comparatively good situation – we rarely see less than 200ms of latency to US hosted websites on our 10 M bit broadband connection in Australia .
Clearing the browser cache and calling up the Digg homepage , we used Tamper Data to examine every HTTP request made along the way .
The results are not encouraging .
We observe over seven seconds of furious HTTP requests before the page even begins to render .
These requests fetch thirteen JavaScript includes plus one CSS include .
The total size of the HTTP responses thus far is only 213 kB – showing an effective transfer rate of around 35 kB / second .
This is well below what we could reasonably expect of a broadband connection .
The bottleneck is caused by behavior common to both FireFox and IE – neither browser will , by default , open more than four ( just two in IE ) connections to a web server simultaneously .
So each CSS & JS include must be requested sequentially , and given we have a minimum latency of 200 ms every request , the time adds up quickly .
Digg.com compounds this problem by forcing all .
JS resources to expire from the cache after just one hour , even though many of them remain unchanged for weeks or even months .
Worse still , even if resources are cacheable for long periods of time , FireFox periodically checks the validity of still - fresh resources by re-requesting them with an “ If - Modified - Since ” header .
Even if the resource remains unchanged , we still incur a minimum 200 ms wait for the negative response – again multiplied by the number of separate resources in use .
Solution : Consolidate and Cache
Fortunately the solution to this performance problem is simple – consolidate your style sheets and JavaScript includes , preferably into a single .CSS file and a single .
JS file .
By requiring just two resources before page rendering can begin , you ensure that most browsers will fetch them simultaneously , and avoid hitting their “ maximum connections per server ” limit .
Once consolidated , complex web applications might well find themselves with a 200 kB or larger JavaScript resource .
In and of itself , this is not a major problem – we would expect to see such a file arrive within two seconds on a modern broadband connection .
But by serving the necessary HTTP headers alongside your .
JS and .CSS resources , you can encourage them to be cached aggressively – both by users ’ browsers and their ISP ’s proxy servers .
Given that your CSS and JS includes are unlikely to be changed on a daily basis , this technique will achieve further performance gains .
Application Performance Counts
Another attribute of modern web applications is their heavy reliance on database generated content and , increasingly , data retrieved from 3rd party sources .
This brings about two outcomes , firstly that more server - side processing is required to deliver a page to the user , and secondly that pages are tailored for delivery to a specific user .
The upshot of this is that poorly constructed or inefficient server - side software will slow website performance far more now than it once did , and simple caching approaches wo n’t help you .
Once again using digg.com as our case study , take a look at the following graph showing the home page response time over a 24 - hour period , broken down into each component of the HTTP request :
First note the TCP connection time , which remains very constant at 75 ms .
The transfer time , which measures the time taken to transfer the HTML data comprising digg.com ’s home page , is also a constant 75 ms .
These measurements indicate that Digg ’s web server has adequate network bandwidth to easily cope with fluctuating traffic levels throughout the day .
This is a good sign , and suggests that Digg operates within a well - equipped data center .
However the picture is not so rosy when you examine the execution time , shown on the graph in purple .
This measurement reveals the amount of time between the moment the HTTP request is delivered to Digg ’s web server , and the moment when we receive the first byte of the HTTP response .
We can interpret this as the amount of time it took the web server to process the request and prepare a response – in other words how long the server - side application took to execute .
The graph shows that this figure fluctuates quite widely , ranging from around 300 ms to well over 1500 ms during peak times .
It ’s clear that fluctuating traffic levels have a significant impact on the speed at which Digg ’s can serve up the home page .
This is , of course , not surprising when you consider the large quantity of traffic Digg receives , combined with its ’ computationally intensive story ranking algorithms .
Consider , too , that the Digg home page is constantly updated and that there is no shortage of visitors regularly refreshing the page to see what ’s changed .
When examining a longer - term graph , though , we can see that application speed has improved markedly in the last couple of weeks :
It ’s clear that the performance of your web applications is critical to your users ’ experience .
These graphs highlight the importance of monitoring web application performance over time and interpreting the trends in this data .
It is insufficient simply to measure instantaneous response times , or performance within your development environment .
To fully understand – and improve – the performance of your web applications you must examine how your site reacts to fluctuating traffic levels over time .

On a visit to Honolulu on May 31 , Robert Gates , the defence secretary , said that the United States was looking for a " long and enduring presence " , under an arrangement with the Iraq government .
" The Korea model is one , the security relationship we have with Japan is another , " he said .
US troops have been in South Korea since the end of the Korean war and in Japan since 1945 .
Last week the White House spokesman Tony Snow confirmed that President Bush wanted a lengthy troop presence in Iraq .
" The situation in Iraq , and indeed , the larger war on terror , are things that are going to take a long time , " he said .
Such statements , and the planning that goes with them , make nonsense of the current debate - in Congress , the press and the public - about a date for withdrawal from Iraq , and whether the surge is producing results .
The administration is looking way beyond that .
What are the motives driving such long - term ambitions ?
The wish to retain control of energy resources , bearing in mind potential rivals such as China , is clearly one .
If there were no oil in Iraq , the US would not be there .
Another is the ability to project US power over the whole of the oil - rich Gulf and beyond , a vast area from central Asia to east Africa .
Other motives include confronting hostile Iran and Syria ; making up in Iraq for the loss of bases in Saudi Arabia ; and , not least , being on hand to protect Israel .
Indeed , these were the main reasons for the invasion four years ago .
Seen in this light , the US enterprise - for all the talk of democracy - is an unmistakable neo-colonial or imperial project such as the region suffered at the hands of Britain and France in an earlier age .
Jimmy Carter was prescient when he declared last year : " There are people in Washington ... who never intend to withdraw military forces from Iraq ... the reason that we went into Iraq was to establish a permanent military base in the Gulf region . "
Are these ambitions realistic ?
Or will they simply pile up problems for the US 's already deplorable relations with much of the Arab and Muslim world ?
General Anthony Zinni , formerly in charge at US central command , has described permanent bases as " a stupid idea and clearly politically unacceptable .
It would damage our image in the region where people would decide that this was our original intent . "
As early as 2004 , Jessica Mathews , the president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , in Washington , said permanent bases would reinforce Iraqi suspicions that the US launched the war to get a hand on Iraqi oil , with a puppet government in Baghdad .
Yet the building of US military bases in Iraq continues apace , at a cost of over $ 1bn a year .
Shortly after the invasion , the US established 110 bases in Iraq .
The present plan appears to consolidate these into 14 " enduring bases " in Iraqi Kurdistan , at Baghdad airport , in Anbar province , and in the southern approaches to Baghdad .
This does not point to an early US disengagement .
And nor does the construction of a US embassy able to house 1,000 staff on a 100 - acre site on the banks of the Tigris - the biggest US embassy in the world .

Generalized Function Pointers
The function facility , recently adopted by the C++ standards committee , provides a generalized way of working with arbitrary functions when all you know ( or need to know ) is their signature .
In fact , as it turns out , you do n't even need to know the target function 's exact signature -- any target function with a compatible signature , meaning one where the parameter and return types are appropriately covertible , will work just fine .
Last time [ 1 ] , I gave an overview of tuple types , one of the first two library extensions that were approved in October 2002 for the standard library extensions technical report ( the " Library TR " ) .
In this article , I 'll cover the other : Doug Gregor 's proposal for polymorphic function object wrappers . [ 2 ]
Note that both of these facilities come directly from the Boost project [ 3 ] , an important ( and free ) collection of C++ libraries available for you to download and try out today .
In brief , the function facility provides a generalized way of working with arbitrary functions when all you know ( or need to know ) is their signature .
In fact , as it turns out , you do n't even need to know the target function 's exact signature - any target function with a compatible signature , meaning one where the parameter and return types are appropriately convertible , will work just fine .
A Motivating Example
Functions and functionlike things are everywhere : C++ has member functions , static member functions , and nonmember ( namespace scope ) functions , and on top of that it has functors ( objects having an overloaded operator ( ) ) that can be invoked as though they were functions .
( I 'm going to use the term " functors " for the latter , instead of the alternative " function objects , " to avoid confusion with " function objects " which means objects of the function library we 're discussing . )
Calling a plain old function is easy :
// Example 1 ( a ) : Calling a nonmember function // string AppendA ( string s ) { return s + ' a ' ; } string test = " test " ; //
Making an immediate call is easy : // cout << AppendA ( test ) << endl ; // immediate call
When it comes to using a function , however , it turns out that what and when to call are n't always decided at the same time .
That is , a program may determine early on exactly which function needs to be called , long before it is ready to actually make the call ; as noted in [ 2 ] , a prime and common example is registering a callback function .
In cases like that , we routinely know to squirrel away a reference to the function , typically by using a function pointer :
// Example 1 ( a ) , continued // //
Making a delayed call involves storing a pointer // ( or reference ) to the function : // < font color= " # 009900 " > typedef string ( * F ) ( string ) ; F f = & AppendA ; // select function ...</ font > // ... later ... cout << < font color= " #009900 " >f ( test )</ font > << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " >// ... make delayed call </ font >
This is handy and pretty flexible , in that f can be made to point to any nonmember function that takes and returns a string .
But of course the above method does n't work for all functions and functionlike things .
For example , what if we instead wanted to do this with a member function ?
" That 's easy , " someone might say , " we just have to store a member function pointer instead of a free function pointer , and then use it appropriately . "
That 's true , and it means we would write code that looks something like this :
// Example 1 ( b ) : Calling a member function // class B { public : virtual string AppendB ( string s ) { return s + ' b ' ; } } ; class Derived : public B { string AppendB ( string s ) { return s + " bDerived " ; } } ; string test = " test " ; B b ; Derived der ; //
Making an immediate call is easy : // cout << b. AppendB ( test ) << endl ; // immediate call //
Making a delayed call involves storing a pointer // ( or reference ) to the member function , and requires // some appropriate object to call it on : // < font color= " # 009900 " > typedef string ( B::* F ) ( string ) ; F f = &B :: AppendB ; // select function ...</ font > // ... later ... cout << < font color= " #009900 " >( b.*f ) ( test )</ font > << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " >// ... make delayed call < / font > cout << < font color= " #009900 " >( der . *f ) ( test )</ font > << endl ; // ... another delayed call , // virtual dispatch works
That 's fine , and this works , but note that it 's already considerably less flexible than in Example 1 ( a ) .
Why ?
Because the f in Example 1 ( b ) can only be made to point to member functions of class B that take and return a string ; this f can't be used to point to a member function of any other class , even if it otherwise has the right signature .
While we 're at it , note one more limitation :
This f also does n't carry around with it the knowledge of which B object to invoke .
We can get rid of this last limitation , remembering the object on which the call should be made , by using the standard function binders :
// Example 1 ( b ) , continued : Alternative , using binders // < font color= " #009900 " > typedef binder1st< mem_fun1_t<string , B, string > > F2 ; F2 f2 = bind1st ( mem_fun ( &B:: AppendB ) , &b ) ;</ font > // ... later ... cout << < font color= " #009900 " > f2 ( test )</ font > << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " >// ... make delayed call </ font > f2 = bind1st ( mem_fun ( &B:: AppendB ) , < font color= " #009900 " > &der </ font > ) ; // ... later ... cout << < font color= " #009900 " > f2 ( test )</ font > << endl ; // ... another delayed call , // virtual dispatch works
The type of F2 is unfortunately ugly , and it still is limited to binding to member functions of class B having an exact signature .
Of course , if the thing we wanted to call was actually a functor object , then none of the above options would work , this despite the fact that for immediate calls the functor can indeed be used seamlessly as though it were a function :
// Example 1 ( c ) : Calling a functor // class C { public : string operator ( ) ( string s ) { return s + ' c ' ; } } ; string test = " test " ; C c ; //
Making an immediate call is easy : // cout << c ( test ) << endl ; // immediate call //
Making a delayed call is trickier .
There 's no easy way without // fixing the type of the object as a C , such as by taking a C&... : // < font color= " #009900 " > typedef C& F ; F f = c ; // select functor ...</ font > // ... later ... cout << < font color= " #009900 " >f ( test )</ font > << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " >// ... make delayed call </ font > // ... or by arranging for C to inherit from some common base class // with a virtual operator ( ) and then taking a pointer or reference // to that base .
That covers nonmember functions , member functions , and functors .
Finally , on a note that applies to all of these , what if you have a function ( or functor ) that you could call directly just fine , but the parameter types , although compatible , are n't quite identical ?
Consider a variant of Example 1( a ) :
// Example 1 ( d ) : 1 ( a ) with slightly different types // //
A little class just to get some conversions happening class Name { public : Name ( string s ) : s_( s ) { } string Get ( ) const { return s_ ; } private : string s_ ; } ; // Stubbed - in function to demonstrate varying // parameter and return types : < font color= " #009900 " > const char*</ font > AppendD ( < font color= " #009900 " > const Name& </ font > s ) { static string x ; x = s. Get ( ) + ' d ' ; return x.c_str ( ) ; } string test = " test " ; //
Making an immediate call is still easy : // cout << AppendD ( test ) << endl ; // immediate call //
But the typedef from Example 1 ( a ) no longer works , // even though the rest of the call is unchanged : // < font color= " # 009900 " > typedef string ( * F ) ( string ) ; F f = & AppendD ; // error : type mismatch </ font > // ... later ( in our dreams ) ... cout << < font color= " #009900 " >f ( test )</ font > << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " >// ... never get here </ font >
Enter function
What if we had a facility that let you form a " function pointer " to any function or functionlike thing ?
That would be genuinely useful .
Enough people think it would be genuinely useful , in fact , that many have gone off and written their own using C++'s powerful templates , and today several versions of such facilities exist ; see [ 2 ] for some references .
And function in the draft standard library technical report is just such a facility , so " That 's great , these already exist , " one might think .
" Why write yet another one for the library technical report ? "
Because these existing facilities are interesting ( good ) , useful ( even better ) , and not always portable or compatible ( oops ) .
When something is genuinely and widely useful , and people keep reinventing the same wheel in slightly different variations , we have a prime candidate for standardization .
After all , just imagine what the world would be like if , instead of one standard std:: string , every vendor supplied their own incompatible string ( or CString , or RWString , or blah_string ) type with different names and different interfaces and features to learn and relearn on every system .
Those of you who 've been around C++ since about 1995 or earlier do n't need to imagine the horror of lots of incompatible string types ; you 've lived it .
Even today with a standard string , we still have some of those variant vendor - specific string types floating around , but at least there are far fewer of them than there used to be .
Similarly now with generalized function pointers , the standards committee felt it was time we had a single general - purpose fucntion wrapper that we can rely on portably , and the one that the committee has chosen to bless is function .
The function template takes a function signature as its only required template parameter .
( Following the practice of much of the rest of the standard library , it also takes an optional allocator template parameter , which I 'm going to ignore henceforth . )
Its declaration looks like this :
template < typename Function , typename Allocator = std::allocator<void > > class function ;
How do you pass a function signature as a template parameter ?
The syntax may seem slightly odd at first , but once you 've seen it it 's just what you 'd think :
function < < font color= " #009900 " > string ( string ) </ font > > f ; // can bind to anything that // takes and returns a string
Any function or functor that is callable with the specified signature can be bound to the function object .
In particular , the function object above can bind to all of the functions shown in the earlier examples , as demonstrated in Example 1(e ) :
// Example 1(e ) : One function <> to bring them all , // and flexibly to bind them // //
This code uses the same class and function definitions // from Examples 1 ( a ) through ( d ) // string test = " test " ; B b ; Derived der ; C c ; < font color= " #009900 " > function < string ( string ) > f;</font > // can bind to anything that // takes and returns a string < font color= " #009900 " >f = & AppendA ;</ font > // bind to a free function cout << f ( test ) << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " > f = bind1st ( mem_fun ( &B:: AppendB ) , &b ) ;</ font > cout << f ( test ) << endl ; // bind to a member function < font color= " #009900 " >f = bind1st ( mem_fun ( &B:: AppendB ) , &der ) ;</ font > cout << f ( test ) << endl ; // with virtual dispatch < font color= " #009900 " >f = c;</font > // bind to a functor cout << f ( test ) << endl ; < font color= " #009900 " >f = & AppendD ;</ font > // bind to a function with a cout << f ( test ) << endl ; // different but compatible signature
" Wow , " you say ?
Wow indeed .
Note in particular the implicit conversions going on in the last case , for which we did n't even have legal code in Example 1( d ) - AppendD 's actual parameter and return types are not string , but can be converted from and to a string , respectively , and that 's good enough for function < string ( string ) >.
Another Motivating Example : Higher - Order Functions
Let 's say you want to write an arithmetic_operation function whose purpose in life is to return a functor that can perform some appropriate operation on two ints , so that the calling code can store it and later invoke it at the appropriate time .
The catch :
It has to decide at runtime what kind of operation will be needed ; perhaps you want to add , or perhaps you want to subtract , or multiply , or divide , and so on .
The arithmetic_operation function should decide which is needed , create an appropriate functor ( e.g , std:: plus < > , std::minus <> , etc. ) , and return it - but then how do you write the return type of arithmetic_operation , when the functors being returned all have different types ?
What you need is a return type that can be constructed from any of those types of objects -- in this case , a function < int ( int , int ) > :
// Example 2 : Higher - order functions // ( reproduced from [ 2 ] , section Ib ) // function < int ( int x , int y ) > arithmetic_operation ( char k ) { switch ( k ) { case '+' : return plus<int >( ) ; case '-' : return minus < int >( ) ; case '*' : return multiplies < int >( ) ; case '/' : return divides < int >( ) ; case ' %' : return modulus < int >( ) ; default : assert ( 0 ) ; } }
Note what 's going on here :
At runtime , the arithmetic_operation function decides what kind of operation will be needed .
Since each type can be bound to a function < int ( int , int ) > , we 're done ; no fuss , no muss .
More To Come : Observer , Comparisons , and Multicast , Oh My !
Comparison :
The only significant limitation of function is that function objects can't be compared , not even for equality .
As I will argue in depth in the upcoming companion column , there are compelling reasons why function should provide at least equality comparison ( == and != ) .
This is possible and usefully implementable , albeit with a ripple effect into the standard function binders ( e.g. , std: : mem_fun ) .
Multicast : Another , but fortunately less significant , limitation of function is that a function object can only be bound to one thing at a time .
The reason this is not too significant a limitation is that there 's a perfectly good workaround :
It 's possible to build a multi_function on top of function pretty easily and effectively , and I will motivate and demonstrate that as well in the companion column , including a sample ( i.e. , working , but rough ) implementation .
Summary
For all of its power , function is n't all that expensive to use .
Gregor notes : " A boost : : function <> object is 3 pointers large ( it could be optimized to 2 in most cases ) , and requires one extra indirect call ( through a function pointer ) for each invocation of the boost : : function <> object .
If one is careful , you can make sure that no big arguments are copied by the bridge to further reduce the penalty for large objects , although I have n't implemented this .
( It 's a simple application of , e.g. , boost : : call_traits to the parameter list ) . " [ 6 ]
Further , it 's again a testament to the power of C++ that a function that works with all functions and functors can be implemented purely as a library facility , without any extensions to the existing standard C++ core languages .
Do n't try this at home in less - flexible languages .
In the next The New C++ column , I 'll give a trip report on the April 2003 C++ standards meeting , held in Oxford , UK .
The big news :
Whereas in the October 2002 meeting the first two extensions were adopted for the standard library extensions technical report , in April no fewer than ten more were added .
What were they , and which ones might you particularly care about ?
Stay tuned .

In reality , it is the INTENTION of FDA management that is the problem , combined with the simple fact that multiple drugs are extremely toxic and do n't work as advertised .
Giving the FDA more power and money will only cause the agency to speed more drugs onto the market faster with even less safety testing ­ while abusing its power and actively stamping out competition to drugs .
FDA management is in bed with Big Pharma and this new legislation makes matters significantly worse through the creation of the Reagan - Udall Foundation for the FDA .
This new entity places the FDA in charge of drug design , drug patents , drug licenses , and the creation of new marketing entities / companies .
Such a relationship with private industry is an unprecedented conflict of interest , totally at odds with drug safety .
The current commissioner of the FDA , Andrew von Eschenbach , M.D. is little more than a Big Biotech sales rep with massive industry connections .
The House , like the Senate , will continue to allow direct to consumer advertising of new drugs with unknown risks ­ a flagrant safety risk that will cost many people their lives .
Congressional leaders said they could n't prevent this advertisement for fear of violating the first amendment rights of drug companies .
What a joke .
The FDA routinely squashes the first amendment rights of American citizens to understand natural health options and the science that explains how they can prevent and treat disease .
Thus , the first amendment argument is simply a matter of convenience .
The FDA wants to actively suppress information that will help people , yet allow highly risky and misleading promotion of toxic substances often for untested uses .
The FDA even wants to prevent citizens from suing drug companies when they are injured , thus protecting Big Pharma .
FDA tyranny , based on this type of arbitrary and unrestrained exercise of power , is used to promote and protect the pharmaceutical industry while at the same time undermining the dietary supplement industry .
Both the House and Senate think it is completely fine that the drug industry pay the FDA fees so that the FDA can approve new drugs faster .
Indeed , the FDA and Big Pharma met 112 times to work out their partnership before the FDA let Congress know what it wanted to see in HR.2900 and S.1082 .
This is like paying the mob for protection .
A careful look at the history of the FDA shows it is little more than a bully that protects vested interests at the expense of human health .
It is a pitiful agency .
It is little wonder than the majority of Americans do n't trust the FDA .
Big Pharma owns the FDA and Congress .
The drug industry sees FDA management and Congressional leaders as a training pool for future Big Pharma jobs ­ based on how well Big Pharma is supported .
There will certainly be plenty of rewards to pass out after this legislation becomes law .
It is a sick situation that this new fake safety legislation provides the FDA with unprecedented new power to stamp out competition to drug companies as well as expose Americans to far greater safety risks than ever before .
Provisions within the legislation that creates the Reagan - Udall Foundation for the FDA will allow the FDA to remove any dietary supplement from the market based on its whim .
It is now only a matter of time and a formality before HR.2900 and S.1082 become law .
There will be a little bit of haggling in the conference committee , as Big Pharma will takes its last chance at watering down any meaningful reform ( of which there is very little ) .
Big Pharma will whine that this legislation is too tough on them , which is a fallacy .
This legislation is the Big Pharma dream come true .
In a football analogy the only question is the final score .
Will Big Pharma win by 28 - 7 or will it win by 42 - 7 .
Big Pharma has just cleaned the clock of Americans .
We should not forget the gutless Congressional puppets that made it happen .
A new tone has been set .
A new chart has been plotted .
Congress has transformed the FDA into a quasi drug company with unprecedented new regulatory power to control all health options in America .
How many deaths and injuries will it take for a comatose and medicinally - overdosed public to wake up ?

The Real Lesson of Flex
by Frank Sommers
March 17 , 2007
Summary
In addition to being a rich - client development toolkit that targets the Flash virtual machine , an interesting aspect of Flex is that it relies on code - generation to reduce the amount of code a developer has to write by hand .
Advertisement
Inspired by some of the recent buzz about filthy rich clients , I decided to take a more thorough look at one of the more interesting rich - client technologies , Flex .
Flex is a client development library , and while not open - source , the Flex SDK is available as a free download from Adobe .
Flex applications are compiled into a bytecode format that runs inside a virtual machine that 's part of Adobe 's ( formerly Macromedia's )
Flash player .
Thus , Flex applications come closest to the original vision of Java applets .
As a long - time Swing fan , I always thought that the applet model 's promise was never fulfilled .
Thus , I looked with envy at the VM - based Flash runtime , a feeling further exacerbated by some of the more snazzy Flex applications that incorporate multimedia in a way I had seldom seen in Java applets or applications .
Recent articles pointed out installation difficulty of the Java runtime as the main reason applets never took off as a popular rich - client medium .
While a valid point , installation complexity alone does n't explain the relative obscurity of applets .
JRE installation became much easier since at last JDK 1.4 , and while installing the JRE is certainly more involved than installing the latest Flash runtime , Sun has made great inroads into having the top PC vendors pre-install recent versions of the JRE .
Although I was not able to obtain any market share numbers from Sun or from other sources , there are plenty of desktops well - equipped to run Java 5 - compatible applets .
A more plausible reason for why few developers think of Java applets as an attractive rich - client technology has , I think , more to do with the fact that developing applets , and developing with Swing in particular , is very labor intensive :
A lot of code needs to be written to affect basic tasks required of even modest Swing applications or applets .
Those tasks go beyond drawing a user interface — most applications must access back - end data , for instance , manipulate data in some way , and provide the user with visual cues or capture input in ways that make sense in the context of an application 's data .
To be sure , the Swing APIs to accomplish all that are there .
And , indeed , stunning Swing applications have been built .
But the price of benefiting from the latest Java client APIs is the need to write a lot of code by hand .
I contend that a developer wanting to develop a non-trivial applet or Swing application has to write more code than a server - side UI framework would require for an application with similar features .
In comparison with Swing , Flex feels much like Ruby on Rails feels in comparison to J2EE ( especially pre-J2EE 5 ) .
While recent server - side Java frameworks have been making great strides towards increased developer productivity , client - side frameworks , and Swing in particular , have been slow to follow suite .
Some months ago , Bill Venners noted in his blog post , Code Generation : The Real Lesson of Rails , that Rails ' real lesson is that it makes extensive use of code generation in order to minimize the amount of code a developer has to write by hand .
In some respects , Rails can be viewed as a domain - specific language for building Web applications .
In a similar vein , Flex can be viewed as a domain - specific language for rich - client user interfaces .
While one can argue with the decisions
Flex 's designers followed in implementing a declarative user interface markup language in XML , and especially with the decision to rely on a mix of XML and ActionScript code as a way to customize user interfaces , at its core , Flex defines a language targeted at building client applications with minimal code .
Once a user interface is defined in that DSL , the Flex compiler generates ActionScript code from the DSL markup , and then compiles that generated code into Flash bytecode in a second compilation phase .
To paraphrase Bill Venners ' earlier blog post , the real lesson of Flex is just how potent code generation is as a tool to increase programmer productivity .
A common client - side programming task , for instance , is binding user interface components to object properties ( so that when a user types a string into a text box , an underlying data model 's appropriate property changes to that newly entered text ) .
While various Java frameworks exist to help with that task , and even a new JSR is in the works to address data binding , none of the proposed Java solutions are as simple for the developer as Flex 's data binding .
The reason is that Flex uses code generation from a DSL to implement data binding .
A developer can simply mark a class , or properties of a class , as Bindable , and the Flex compiler 's first pass will generate the voluminous boilerplate code needed to observe changes in that object or property .
Flex introduces code generation into higher - level user interface features as well , such as , for instance , the definition of various view states , data validation , and even network communication .
The effect of those is that a feature - rich user interface can be constructed with minimal hand - written code .
To be sure , every DSL - based framework has its limitations and rough edges , and Flex is perhaps no exception .
But if Swing can learn one thing from Flex , it is that domain - specific - languages can work well for user interfaces .
And Flex is not the only user interface framework to prove that point : Chris Oliver 's Form Follows Function ( F3 ) is a promising attempt at an even higher - level UI DSL .
As I learn more about Flex , I will post more tidbits about its code - generation features .
For now , though , what do you think of the role DSLs can play in user interfaces ?
If you had a concise way to define Swing UIs , would you be more likely to develop rich - client Java applications ?

Unfortunately for Bush , his own intelligence community vehemently disagrees .

This is the tragic irony of our foreign policy over the past six years .
Instead of permanently destroying al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- where they are currently regrouping and emerging even stronger -- we decided to invade a country that did not attack us nor have the capability to attack us , thereby creating a failed state in which the new terrorists we 've created can station themselves .

PoCが難航するのはなぜ？ SIerと現場 の “ ズレ ” が生 む 「 データ分析」の難し さ
第7回：現場から見たPoCの理想と現実
The " morning after pill " for HIV is given to rape victims via police referral
The two men have been granted legal aid on public interest grounds to take the government to court over the policy on post - exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) .
A month - long course of PEP , which uses anti-retroviral drugs , can cut the risk of infection after exposure .
One of the pair passed the virus to the other after a condom split , but they say they were unaware of the treatment .
PEP is routinely given to healthcare workers accidentally exposed to HIV at work and is made available to rape victims through police referral .
To be most effective , it must be given immediately after exposure .
The problem is people do not know about it and if they did they would struggle to find a doctor who would give it to them
Frances Swaine , solicitor
It is also available on a case - by - case basis for those exposed through consensual sex , although the couple argue the public and doctors are not aware of this .
The pair , aged 35 and 26 , from the south east of England , are expected to call for a major campaign to raise awareness about the treatment .
Their solicitor , Frances Swaine , of Leigh , Day and Co , said : " The case is being brought to raise awareness about PEP .
" The problem is people do not know about it and if they did they would struggle to find a doctor who would give it to them .
" What we are saying is that there needs to be guidelines on PEP and a campaign to tell people about it .
That is not to say everyone should have access to it , it would be up to clinical judgement to decide that . "
The drugs are extremely toxic and the side - effects can include nausea , headache , diarrhoea and vomiting , but Ms Swaine said most people would prefer to put up with that rather than risk infection with HIV .
The Department of Health said there was little evidence that PEP was effective in cases other than " needle - stick " injuries to health care workers , but individual doctors could still prescribe the drugs .
A spokeswoman added : " PEP is not a substitute for safer sex and condom use continues to be the main HIV prevention message . "
The case is likely to be heard at the High Court in the new year .

On a foggy October day in 2002 , Basil Seggos first saw the sheen on the surface of the water .
He and his colleagues had launched an old wooden - hulled oyster boat from the Dyckman marina in Inwood , and headed south , down the Harlem and East rivers .
They were on a mission to document fishing and crabbing spots on the riverfront so that local anglers could be warned not to eat their catch .
When Seggos ’s boat reached the mouth of Newtown Creek , the finger of water that separates Brooklyn from Queens , they decided to sail into the creek to check out its unnatural landscape — miles of waste - processing plants , gasoline - storage facilities , and abandoned refineries .
The boat passed floating auto parts , crumbling bulkheads , and rusting pipes spewing filthy - looking water .
Then , about a mile in , Seggos saw it : oil coating the surface of the water from shore to shore and extending upstream for another half - mile or so .
“ It was everywhere , all over the shoreline . ”
Officially , Seggos was running an outreach program for Riverkeeper , RFK Jr. ’s environmental organization , and the organization ’s protocol in situations like these is to stop and call the state Department of Environmental Conservation hotline .
The call is supposed to provoke an immediate reaction , but no one showed up .
The next day , Seggos called again .
“ We ’d never even heard of a spill there before , ” says Seggos .
“ But they told me they already had an open case on it and they were handling it . ”
What Seggos discovered — or rediscovered — was n’t an oil spill , exactly .
Rather , it was a mix of gasoline , solvents , and associated poisons bubbling up from the very ground : a thin dribble that betrays the presence of a supertanker ’s worth of the stuff submerged in the age - old geology of Greenpoint .
It ’s actually more than a century ’s worth of spills , leaks , and waste dumped by oil companies that has pooled into a vast underground lake , more than 55 acres wide and up to 25 feet thick .
First discovered by the U.S. Coast Guard in 1978 , the Greenpoint spill has been estimated at anywhere between 17 million and 30 million gallons — three times more oil than the Exxon Valdez spill .
That makes it the largest known oil spill in American history .
Seggos had stumbled upon a long - forgotten industrial accident , decades in the making .
It soon became an obsession .
Over the next thirteen months , he dug through old news clippings and contacted state and local officials .
He attended community meetings and organized local activists into the Newtown Creek Alliance .
And he tried to understand how it was that a giant oil spill remained so little known in the thriving neighborhood right above it .
What he learned , mostly through Freedom of Information Act requests , was that Mobil — the company that had likely spilled most of the oil — had quietly agreed with state officials to assume responsibility for the necessary cleanup .
In return , the state would n’t make any more demands : no timetables , no fines , no set outcomes .
Both sides could avoid a bitter , costly , and potentially embarrassing court battle .
And by keeping it quiet , there would be no public panic — or costly liability .
Alarmed , Riverkeeper initiated a lawsuit in January 2004 against ExxonMobil ( Mobil merged with Exxon in 1999 ) in order to force the company to clean faster and more thoroughly .
This triggered a round of private lawsuits :
Two of the nation ’s best - known tort lawyers trekked to Greenpoint to represent the Polish immigrants , secretaries , carpenters , and police officers who live there — not to mention the young creative class that has been gentrifying the area for over a decade .
Even the state , which tolerated the situation for almost 30 years , has gotten into the act :
It is threatening to sue now , too .
At the crux of all the lawsuits is the impact of this huge subterranean reservoir — on human health , on the environment , and on Greenpoint ’s property values .
In ExxonMobil ’s view , the pile - on is mere opportunism by lawyers and politicians beating up on a company that ’s already committed to cleaning up a mess that may not even be its fault :
After all , it ’s not clear where all the oil came from , and whenever this happened , environmental standards were different then .
On the other side of the aisle are the activists , tort lawyers , and now the attorney general .
The activists and the A.G. insist there are better and faster ways to clean it up .
The tort lawyers , meanwhile , are working to put a price on the damage it might be causing : $ 58 billion , by one law firm ’s estimate .
To see the extent of the problem , imagine a viscous tar - colored blob stretching amoebalike through the Earth .
It starts where Meeker Avenue hits Newtown Creek , seeping out into the waterway .
From there it extends south and steadily deeper under the Brooklyn soil , reaching a depth of about 40 feet .
It ’s contained from below by the groundwater in the Brooklyn - Queens aquifer :
The oil is repelled by the water , so the muck “ floats ” on top .
Like the Blob in the eponymous Steve McQueen movie , it keeps changing shape and moving — bulging south beyond the Brooklyn - Queens Expressway , slithering north toward Greenpoint Avenue , ballooning west to at least Monitor Street .
This black lagoon fills the nooks and crannies in the gravel , sand , and silt that characterize the soil of the area , pooling in pockets that range from just centimeters thick to natural vats that are 25 feet deep .
The contaminated zone encompasses at least 55 acres of northern Brooklyn — an area roughly the size of Tribeca .

The thick , dark ooze is a hydrocarbon cocktail : part degraded gasoline , part fuel oil , part naphtha — the chemical from which napalm takes its name .
All of it is toxic .
Dig seven or eight feet down — the typical depth of a basement — and in some parts you ’ll find benzene vapor , a known carcinogen , at concentrations as high as 1,560 parts per million .
That ’s more than 100 times the short - term ( fifteen - minute ) exposure limits set by OSHA for industrial workers .
More recently , PCEs ( perchloroethylenes ) and TCEs ( trichloroethylenes ) , suspected carcinogens that are able to dissolve in water , have been found in the underground oil plume — not to mention the Queens water supply .
Whether the plume is the source of the contamination is a matter of dispute .
The good news is that the toxic goop saturating the sandy soil is at least partly capped by a semi-permeable clay layer , the natural legacy of Brooklyn ’s 10,000 - year - old geology .
But the oil can still travel laterally .
Experts advising some of the residents suing say they ’ve found the stuff beyond the contaminated zone , leading them to believe the lagoon may be much larger — up to 30 million gallons — and encroaching deep into the residential side of Greenpoint .
The oil companies have removed 9 million gallons so far .
So depending on whose experts you believe , there could still be more than 20 million gallons of toxins sloshing around down below .
The disputed facts are the centerpiece of a lawsuit filed against ExxonMobil in 2004 by Riverkeeper and eight members of the Newtown Creek Alliance .
But while Seggos has been instrumental in pushing the issue back into the public consciousness — mostly by highlighting the health risks the spill poses — he ’s not the first to have noticed that something was amiss on the shores of Newtown Creek .
The problem ’s roots stretch back over a hundred years .
During the industrial boom of the 1890s , local activists calling themselves the Fifteenth Ward Smelling Committee paddled up the creek seeking the polluters responsible for the foul stenches wafting from the once - pristine waterway .
They had plenty to choose from : glue - makers and fertilizer processors produced plenty of noxious by - product .
But the oil refineries were the worst offenders : Workers transferring oil and solvents from one part of the plant to another inevitably spilled ; storage tanks leaked ; and the process of distilling oil to make kerosene , paraffin wax , naphtha , gasoline , and fuel oil left all sorts of junk .
“ If roughly 5 percent of the initial crude petroleum consumed by the refineries ended up as coke residue , gas , or other loss , as the contemporary literature suggested , ” writes historian Andrew Hurley , “ each of New York ’s petroleum districts would have produced the equivalent of 300,000 gallons of waste material each week during the 1880s . ”
What could n’t be resold or burned up was simply dumped on the ground or into the water .
There were more than 50 refineries in Greenpoint in 1870 , and by 1892 , Standard Oil owned most of them .
At the time , Newtown Creek was one of the busiest waterways in the country , and the most hazardous :
Fires routinely broke out at the refineries , sometimes burning down entire factories and leaving the chemical remains to soak into the soil .
In 1919 , twenty acres of the Standard Oil refinery , storing 110 million gallons of oil , went up in smoke .
The oil that did n’t burn sunk into the ground .
Given the natural order of things , one would expect this oil eventually to drain into the creek and escape into the ocean — but it did n’t .
Instead , it slowly moved away from the creek and backed up into Brooklyn .
That ’s because until about 60 years ago , Brooklyn relied on its own wells for drinking water .
And the borough pumped so much of its groundwater to the surface that it reversed the natural slope of its underground water table , tilting it away from the creek and toward the Brooklyn Navy Yard , near where the municipal water pumps were diligently sucking .
And so the oil , slinking above the water table , flowed with it , filling the interstitial spaces where the groundwater had once been .
By the forties , the aquifer was so depleted that seawater had begun to infiltrate it , making it useless .
So in 1949 Brooklyn switched to water piped down from the Catskills .
One year later , on October 5 , a vast underground explosion centered at Huron Street and Manhattan Avenue sent 25 manhole covers shooting into the Greenpoint sky , where they reached elevations as high as three stories .
This was the first clue that anything was amiss .
An investigation revealed that gasoline was leaking into the neighborhood ’s sewer system , but at the time no one thought to measure the amount of manhole propellant that had not ignited .
Meanwhile , with the municipal water pumps in mothballs , Brooklyn ’s aquifer slowly started filling back up .
By the late seventies , the water table had rebounded to its natural level .
And the oil that floated on top of it reversed its flow .
It now moved toward what was once again the lowest point : Newtown Creek .

Then , in September 1978 , a U.S. Coast Guard helicopter noticed an iridescent glaze spreading out over the narrow waterway .
The oil under Greenpoint had reemerged .
That sparked the first investigation into how much oil from the refineries had leaked into the ground over the years .
The Coast Guard ’s 1979 study is the source of the 17 million–gallon , 55 - acre estimate .
From the condition of the oil , the Coast Guard also figured that most of it dated to around 1948 , and its high concentration of naphtha , a solvent used at the Mobil refinery until it closed in 1965 but not used by other oil companies in the area , suggested that the primary source of the spill was Mobil Oil .
Mobil is a direct descendent of Standard .
In 1979 , the Coast Guard recovered close to 100,000 gallons of oil and solvents from the creek , declared its job of protecting the national waterway complete , and then handed over the cleanup responsibility to the city and the state .
Those authorities then pressured Mobil and the other oil companies with storage facilities in the area ( Amoco , which is now BP , and Paragon Oil , which is now Chevron ) to do something — anything — about the oil still surfacing in Newtown Creek .
So the companies worked with the Coast Guard to create a simple system of containment booms and recovery basins to catch the oil still seeping into the water .
But no one was required to do anything about the vast lake of oil underground until 1990 , when Mobil formally agreed to start pumping it out — albeit very slowly .
Best - case scenario :
The reservoir would n’t be dry until 2026 .
And until Seggos came along , that was the most anyone could expect .
A vast underground explosion sent 25 manhole covers shooting into the Greenpoint sky .
The lawsuits that ExxonMobil is fighting right now are the result of a perfect storm of rising environmental awareness , rising real - estate values in Greenpoint , and Seggos ’s diligence .
He spent much of 2003 sending Freedom of Information Act requests to the DEC .
He learned that , despite a danger that seemed obvious to Seggos , no one had ever tested the neighborhood to find out whether toxins from the oil had made their way up through the soil .
So in 2005 , Riverkeeper drilled a test hole in industrial Greenpoint and analyzed the soil itself .
They found dirt so polluted with methane and benzene that had they dug it out with a shovel and tossed it on the ground , they could have been found guilty of the illegal dumping of toxic waste .
Riverkeeper immediately informed the state .
“ They were furious , ” says Seggos of the state officials .
“ They told us never to drill again . ”
Finding carcinogens just a few feet down was , for Seggos , the smoking gun .
It connected the anecdotes he was hearing about cancer clusters in Greenpoint to the blob below .
But he also realized that the fight was more than a small nonprofit was equipped to handle .
So he alerted the Los Angeles–based firm of Girardi & Keese , which flew in Erin Brockovich to whip up about 60 Greenpoint residents at the Swinging Sixties Senior Center .
“ I ’m here to get people motivated , ” she told the crowd in December 2005 .
“ Nothing but good can come from this . ”
Marc Bern of the Manhattan - based personal - injury firm Napoli Bern Ripka apparently agreed .
He also made the pilgrimage to Greenpoint , pitching to about 100 people at an American Legion hall , a short stack of retainer contracts at his side .
He is claiming $ 58 billion in damages .
The giant numbers made the papers and focused the state ’s attention on the problem :
The DEC also made the trek out to Greenpoint , but the department came with representatives of the oil company at its side .
In January 2006 , in the packed Princess Manor catering hall on Nassau Avenue , DEC officials assured a raucous crowd that the companies were doing everything possible to clean up the neighborhood .
Health studies were n’t necessary ; residents had no cause to worry .
That did n’t satisfy the audience .
“ If this was anywhere in Manhattan , you would be acting much quicker , I ’m sure , ” scolded Irene Klementowicz , the president of Concerned Citizens of Greenpoint , during the question - and - answer period .
But the most searing comment came at the very end : “ About 30 times tonight , people have asked questions of the oil companies , and you , the state , have answered them , ” a well - dressed man called out angrily .
“ We get the impression that the DEC works for the oil companies , not for the people , ” he shouted to exclamations and applause .
The dramatic show of public outrage — not to mention an election — did the trick .
When state officials returned to Greenpoint in September , it was evident that the state had been shamed into changing its tune .
Lawyers from the attorney general ’s office , which in June had started its own investigation , all but apologized for past inaction and assured the crowd that a brand - new team was on the job .
The DEC admitted there were toxic vapors below buildings , pavement , and soil and that they could migrate into indoor air .
The department implored residents to let the state test their homes for toxins .
This time , the A.G. ’s lawyers promised , they would make ExxonMobil fix any problems they found .
“ I work for Eliot Spitzer , ” said Bob Hernan , an assistant attorney general who had been recently assigned to the case .
“ As some of you know , we ’re not shy about suing people . ”

Two main issues form the backbone of today ’s disputes over Greenpoint ’s oil spill .
The first is the oil ’s effect on the health and safety of Greenpoint residents .
Although people do n’t drink the groundwater in Brooklyn anymore , in recent years scientists have come to understand that carcinogenic vapors can rise up through soil and into the air and enter buildings through cracks in their foundations .
What is that doing to the people who live and work in them ?
Then there ’s the related question of what it does to the value of the property sitting on top of all that vaporous oil .
“ One of our big concerns is the danger to the community from the contamination , ” says Dan Estrin , of the Pace Environmental Litigation Clinic , which is representing Riverkeeper and local activists in their lawsuit .
“ Vapor intrusion is a major issue .
Benzene is just really nasty stuff .
We know if you breathe this stuff in over a period of time , you ’re going to get cancer .
Along with concerns about the environment and endangering wildlife , there are lots of concerns about people breathing in these vapors . ”
In fact , the Williamsburg - Greenpoint area has an overall lower cancer rate than much of the rest of New York City .
Still , the neighborhood has historically had among the highest incidence of certain cancers , including leukemia in children and stomach cancer in adults .
( Benzene is a known cause of leukemia . )
And there is anecdotal evidence of cancer clusters : Sebastian Pirozzi , who grew up in Greenpoint , lost his leg to bone cancer at 14 .
Several of his old neighbors have had the same disease .
“ It ’s not a coincidence , ” Pirozzi says .
“ It ca n ’t be .
There are many cancers that can be caused by different things , but bone cancer is different .
It ’s rare . ”
Tom Stagg , a retired detective on the border of the contaminated zone , is also convinced .
He ’s been tracking the number of people with cancer on the block he grew up on .
So far , he ’s counted 36 .
Twenty - five , including several children , have passed away .
Stagg ’s own father died of pancreatic cancer at 53 .
“ It ’s not normal , ” he says .
“ I ’m sure it ’s because of the oil spill . ”
The thick , dark ooze is a hydrocarbon cocktail : part degraded gasoline , part fuel oil , part naphtha — the chemical from which napalm takes its name .
ExxonMobil , in its defense , points to a layer of clay underneath the residential portion of Greenpoint that , the company argues , stops the toxic vapors from migrating to the surface .
The theory is hotly disputed by other geologists , who argue that the clay is not continuous , and thus is permeable .
At this point , the evidence favors ExxonMobil .
Last summer , ExxonMobil - funded geologists drilled test wells in Greenpoint , seven to eight feet deep .
According to their data , the soil at that level is toxic only in the industrial section , near the creek .
The attorney general ’s office is also looking for evidence of toxic vapor , but so far has not found benzene inside any of the 52 homes it ’s tested ( although it did find TCEs in at least one , and PCEs in another ) .
There ’s a third batch of tests in the works , this one paid for by attorneys for the plaintiffs :
Their results are n’t in yet .
However , California - based hydrogeologist Mark Zeko , who is doing that testing , is confident he ’ll find the vapor he ’s looking for : “ Just driving by the excavations down the street , I could smell the hydrocarbons , ” he says .
For now , the tests and studies and analyses are ongoing .
The A.G. is in discussions with ExxonMobil and will decide whether to go forward with a lawsuit in the next few weeks .
Riverkeeper ’s suit is largely on hold until that ’s decided .
But the tort lawyers are pressing on , because even if there is no good evidence that subsoil toxins have migrated into people ’s homes , there ’s still real money involved :
Just the fear of cancer can damage property values .
There are plaintiffs like Deborah Spiroff , a 36 - year - old artist who invested her life savings in a three - family townhouse on Morgan Avenue .
She later learned that her house was smack in the middle of the oil plume .
“ You ca n’t tell me that my property value has not decreased , ” she says .
In a sense , she ’s the perfect plaintiff : articulate and afraid .
But here too , ExxonMobil counters forcefully .
As ExxonMobil ’s lawyer , Peter Sacripanti , put it : “ If I told you we were going to drill down to the groundwater under Park Avenue , you would n’t want to drink that water .
But does that affect the value of property on Park Avenue ?
I do n’t think so . ”
Apartment prices grew faster in Greenpoint than anywhere else in Brooklyn last year — jumping 65 percent .
Officially , ExxonMobil claims there has n’t been any real harm done .
It ’s a negotiating stance , but it seems to be backed up by the steadfast belief of ExxonMobil officials that there is no moral crime here .
They are being asked to undo the actions ( or inactions ) of their distant predecessors , some of which date back to a time when industrial waste was barely regulated and people did n’t necessarily know its contents were toxic .
After all , the aromatic and fiercely carcinogenic benzene that may now be vaporizing into Greenpoint basements was used as aftershave lotion until the early - twentieth century .
Sacripanti reminded me , “ A century ago , no one monitored releases or oil spills .
So no one really knows where this oil came from . ”
ExxonMobil did n’t become the most profitable company in the country by handing tort lawyers a blank check .
But if it did , could anyone honestly fill in the dollar amount ?
No one really knows what the consequences of Greenpoint ’s oil spill have been — or will be .
It ’s like the dust from 9/11 , the chemicals dumped at Love Canal , the nuclear meltdown at Three Mile Island , or even global warming .
Do we ever really know their costs ?
Perhaps twenty years from now epidemiological studies will reveal a link between living in Greenpoint and dying of cancer .
But even that is merely correlation , not causality .
The result is a generalized state of fear that has come to characterize our time .
It ’s as if the more information we have , the more we realize how little we know for sure .
So even if the impact of Greenpoint ’s oil spill turns out to be fairly benign , the fear it ’s already generated is an impact in itself — an anxiety that might even be monetized by clever lawyers .
But in the long run , what is going to happen to Greenpoint will probably be similar to what has already happened to that other great dumping ground , New York Harbor .
The fish have returned , but they ’re still not safe to eat .
Mercury , PCBs , and other poisons still remain entombed in the riverbed , slowly leaching into the environment .
Twelve years after ExxonMobil finally completed its oil - sucking infrastructure , the company says it ’s Hoovered 7 million gallons out of the ground .
In February , I took a tour of the extraction system — the elaborate maze of underground pipes , eleven petroleum recovery wells , fifteen storage tanks , and 200 groundwater monitors set out across Greenpoint .
It ’s a pretty impressive setup , a “ dual - pump free - product recovery system ” that works like this :
A groundwater pump extracts water from the aquifer , lowering the water table and creating a “ cone of depression . ”
Then the “ free ” oil — meaning oil that has escaped the refinery ’s clutches — drains into the “ cone ” to get pumped out and ultimately re-refined , while the groundwater extracted in the process is filtered and discharged into Newtown Creek .
The containment system designed to recover the oil that continues to leak into the creek is less impressive .
Just as the Coast Guard discovered in 1978 , and Seggos rediscovered in 2002 , there is still a rainbow sheen swirling atop the water — but now it ’s lassoed by what looks like a deflated yellow plastic tube snaking its way along the shore , and a short black fencelike barrier floating beyond that .
Oil absorbers , like a chain of floating white socks , bob on the surface just behind them .
They ’ve turned muck - brown from the petroleum .
Critics like Seggos want ExxonMobil to step up its pumping in order to create cones of depression large enough to reverse the oil spill ’s direction of flow and stop the seepage into Newtown Creek completely .
ExxonMobil ’s experts disagree , saying that the current setup works just fine .
Furthermore , they argue , there is a law of diminishing returns at work :
The greater the number of cones of depression created , the less efficient any single cone gets .
( Right now , though , that question is moot , because ExxonMobil has temporarily shut down the whole pumping operation after the attorney general claimed the company was n’t sufficiently cleaning the groundwater before discharging it . )
At the expected rate of pumping , it will take at least twenty years to suck out the rest of Exxon ’s “ free product ” from the ground .
And even then , there will still be the problem of the soil left behind : a layer of sandy earth saturated with benzene , toluene , xylenes , methane , tetrachloroethene , and the like .
There ’s another pumping technique — “ air sparging ” — that ’s proved to reduce benzene and other vaporous contaminants .
Air is injected below the saturated soil in order to vaporize trapped hydrocarbons , and is then vacuumed out through strategically placed wells .
It ’s very expensive , but ExxonMobil argues that it ’s not using that technology because it ’s not the right method .
“ Vapor extraction is not appropriate at this time because we do n’t want to leave a residual , ” says Barry Wood , a spokesman .
“ Our objective is to first recover as much product as technically possible . ”
The truth is that it will be impossible to remove all of the nasty chemicals lurking under Greenpoint .
In 1979 , the Coast Guard ’s engineers concluded that only about 50 percent of the oil and solvents from this spill could ever be cleaned up , though another 20 percent might dissolve or wash away over time .
That would leave 30 percent of it trapped under the neighborhood forever .
Of course , remediation technology has improved in the past 30 years .
But the only way to really scrub the contaminated zone is to dig the whole mess up and replace it with fresh dirt .
And you ca n’t really do that in Greenpoint without condemning the neighborhood .
Researchers at the University of Portsmouth , UK , have developed an electronic switch based on DNA - a world - first bio-nanotechnology breakthrough that provides the foundation for the interface between living organisms and the computer world .
The new technology is called a ‘ nanoactuator ’ or a molecular dynamo .
The device is invisible to the naked eye - about one thousandth of a strand of human hair .
The DNA switch has been developed by British Molecular Biotechnology expert Dr Keith Firman at the University of Portsmouth working in collaboration with other European researchers .
Dr Firman and his international team have been awarded a € 2 million European Commission grant to further develop this ground - breaking new technology .
But the DNA switch has immediate practical application in toxin detection , and could be used in a biodefence role as a biological sensor to detect airborne pathogens .
The future applications are also considerable , including molecular scale mechanical devices for interfacing to computer - controlled artificial limbs .
‘ The possibilities are very exciting .
The nanoactuator we have developed can be used as a communicator between the biological and silicon worlds , ’ Dr Firman said .
‘ I could see it providing an interface between muscle and external devices , but it has to be pointed out that such an application is still 20 or 30 years away . ’
The molecular switch comprises of a strand of DNA anchored in a miniscule channel of a microchip , a magnetic bead , and a biological motor powered by the naturally occurring energy source found in living cells , adenosine triphosphate ( ATP ) .
These elements working together create a dynamo effect which in turn generates electricity .
The result is a device that emits electrical signals - signals that can be sent to a computer .
The switch , therefore , links the biological world with the silicon world of electronic signals .
The nanoactuator has been patented by the University of Portsmouth , and a patent application for the basic concepts of biosensing is pending .

' Technical virginity ' becomes part of teens ' equation By Sharon Jayson , USA TODAY
Ten years after Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky 's relationship made oral sex a mainstream topic , there 's still plenty of debate over whether oral sex is really sex .
" There 's not only confusion ; there 's fighting over it , " says J. Dennis Fortenberry , a physician who specializes in adolescent medicine at the Indiana University School of Medicine .
" People disagree fairly vehemently . "
The latest fuss is spurred by new federal data that found that more than half of 15 - to 19 - year - olds have received or given oral sex .
Although the study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not ask the particulars of these encounters , research conducted in pre-Clinton times , along with more recent studies , suggests that teens largely fall on the " it 's not sex " side .
( Related story : Teens define sex in new ways )
" Some adults say it is a form of sex , but kids do n't really see it that way , " says Natalie Fuller , 19 , a sophomore at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa , Calif .
" For most teens , the only form of sex is penetration , and anything else does n't count .
You can have oral sex and be a virgin . "
Fuller was 16 when she , her brother and her mother co-wrote the book Promise You Wo n't Freak Out , which includes discussion of teen oral sex .
The report released last month by the CDC shows that one - quarter of teens who have not had intercourse have had oral sex .
The survey questions , administered via headphones and computer for maximum anonymity , clearly defined the actions to eliminate any ambiguity about the meaning of the term " oral sex . "
" The implications are that teens who define themselves as abstinent may be engaging in oral sex , " says Jennifer Manlove , a senior research associate with the non-profit group Child Trends , which analyzed the federal data .
Kyle Tarver , 17 , a high school senior from Pikesville , Md. , who was among an informal USA TODAY focus group of Maryland teenagers , says most teens who have had oral sex think of themselves as virgins .
" If you were to ask someone if they were a virgin , they would n't include that they had given or gotten oral sex , " he says .
What students say sex means to them Opinions varied widely in a Kinsey Institute study of 599 college students from 29 states were asked : " Would you say you 've had sex with someone if the first intimate behavior you engaged in was ... "

A study published in 1999 in the Journal of the American Medical Association examines the definition of sex based on a 1991 random sample of 599 college students from 29 states .
Sixty percent said oral - genital contact did not constitute having sex .
" That 's the ' technical virginity ' thing that 's going on , " says Stephanie Sanders , associate director of the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex , Gender , and Reproduction at Indiana University and co-author of the study , which the researchers titled " Would You Say You ' Had Sex ' If ...? "
" There is not nearly as much conversation between two people and as much thought put into engaging in oral sex .
That , in my mind , makes it a lot different , " says Michael Levy , 17 , a senior from Owings Mills , Md . What constitutes sex tends to be defined in a culture and varies with the times , Fortenberry says .
" In certain times in the history of the world , certain kinds of kissing would be considered sex , " he says .
" Not too many years ago , a woman would have been considered a ' loose woman ' if she kissed a person before marriage . "
But a new book from the Medical Institute for Sexual Health , an Austin - based non-profit that has worked for abstinence education with the Bush administration , does n't waffle .
In Questions Kids Ask About Sex , oral sex is clearly sex .
" Sex occurs when one person touches another person 's genitals and causes that person to get sexually excited , " the book states .
" A girl or boy who 's had oral sex does n't feel or think like a virgin anymore , because he or she has had a form of sex . "
Melissa Cox , who edited and contributed to the book , is a Denver - based medical writer who also edited a publication for Focus on the Family , an organization devoted to Christian family values .
She says a medical panel for the institute determined that oral sex is sex because it places young people at risk for sexually transmitted diseases and infections , puts them at risk for long - term emotional harm and opens the door for other sexual activity .
Not everyone agrees .
" If you look at the information that they have , you might find it difficult to cite a basis for that , other than someone 's opinion , " says adolescent - medicine specialist Fortenberry .
Teenagers say messages from the media make them feel that casual oral sex is normal and suggest that all teens are preoccupied with sex .
" I feel like I see more commercials about casual sex than I do about how important it is to have a family and how important it is to be in a marriage instead of having sex with people from a bar , " says Shanae Sheppard , a 17 - year - old senior from Owings Mills , Md. Last week , the federal government announced $ 37 million in awards to 63 programs across the country aimed at encouraging young people to abstain from intercourse until marriage .
But abstinence - only education may inadvertently reinforce the belief that oral sex is n't real sex , says John DeLamater , a sociology professor at the University of Wisconsin and editor of the Journal of Sex Research , a scholarly journal published by the Society for the Scientific Study of Sexuality .
" We should be sending a message that sexual activity is much broader , " he says .
Because teens are focused on that narrow definition of sexual intercourse and the message is to postpone it until they are older , they tend to equate intercourse with adulthood , Tarver says .
" Oral sex is not on a pedestal the way that regular sexual intercourse is , " he says .
From Morning Edition on NPR :
This is the morning that kids were invited to the White House for the Easter egg roll .
The roll for Laura Bush includes reading a children ’s book .
It ’s called , “ Duck for President . ”
The first lady will read the story of a duck who takes over the farm , then runs for governor , and then runs for the White House .
He wins after a recount , but Duck gives it all up to go back to the farm .
The duck concludes , “ Running a country is no fun at all . ”
According to the book ’s publisher , “ President Duck , ” who did n’t realize being president would require a lot of “ very hard work , ” ends up with “ a very bad headache ” before passing his duties off to his Vice President .
Sometimes , the jokes write themselves .
[ Editor ’s note :
This is the next - to - last piece in our series on the Prop. 87 “ oil tax . ”
Tad Patzek discusses the problems with biomass , which is one of the alternative energy sources the oil tax would fund with research . ]
Today it is commonly believed that burning freshly cut plants is morally superior to burning old fossil plants .
Even more curiously , some are convinced that stripping ecosystems of gigantic quantities of biomass can go on year - after - year , forever , and with no consequences .
This attitude is best exemplified by the DOE / USDA 2005 report by Perlack et al. : “ â€ ¦An annual biomass supply of more than 1.3 billion dry tons can be accomplished with relatively modest changes in land use and agricultural and forestry practices . ”
Much of Proposition 87 is built around this delusionary DOE / USDA vision .
In his April 2006 presentation , Mr. Khosla proclaimed that US would produce 130 billion gallons of ethanol per year from the imaginary 1.3 billion tons of biomass .
Unfortunately , this is impossible regardless of technology .
To arrive at its conclusions , the DOE / USDA report made the following assumptions :
1. Yields of corn , wheat , and other small grains were increased by 50 percent ;
2 . The residue - to - grain ratio for soybeans was increased to 2:1 ;
3 . The harvest technology was capable of recovering 75 percent of annual crop residues ;
4 . All cropland was managed with no -till methods ;
5. 55 million acres of cropland , idle cropland and cropland pasture were dedicated to the production of perennial bioenergy crops ;
6 . All manure in excess of that which can applied on - farm for soil improvement under anticipated EPA restrictions was used for biofuel ; and
7 . All other available residues were utilized .
If these assumptions were not so frightening , they would be laughable :
1 . The permanent 50 pecent increase of all crop yields is impossible .
The all - time record yield of corn in 2004 , 160.1 bushels / acre , was followed by 147.9 bu/acre in 2005 , and an estimated 153 bu / acre in 2006 .
The real yields have been decreasing instead of jumping up by 50 percent .
2 . The 2:1 residue - to - grain ratio for soybeans would require a 45 percent increase of the current average harvest index of 0.42 , and is not quite achievable .
3 . Taking most residues from the fields would leave little or no plant matter to protect the soil from excessive wind and water erosion .
The rate of erosion in US agriculture generally exceeds the rate of soil mineral deposition and humus generation .
4 . Total no till agriculture would require astronomical quantities of herbicides and pesticides to kill off the “ spurious ” life competing with the resource - greedy , but otherwise delicate hybrid crop monocultures .
Because of the comprehensive loss and poisoning of the natural environment and imported parasites , the honeybee population declined by 60 % between 1947 and 2005 .
Honeybees had to be imported from outside North America last year for the first time since 1922 .
Bees pollinate an estimated 10 - 20 billion dollars worth of crops every year .
5. US corn grows on 70 million acres .
Dedicating 55 million acres to switchgrass would eliminate plenty of other crops .
The total area of the soil Conservation Reserve Program ( CRP ) in the US is a modest 34 million acres .
6 . The EPA requirements are perceived as restrictions .
In other words , a modicum of conservation is viewed as an obstacle to feeding our thirsty cars and all remaining land ( see Item 5 ) must go .
7 . To utilize all residues , I suggest to also process fresh corpses into biofuels .
One simply cannot remove biomass and nutrients from an ecosystem without putting these nutrients back , protecting the soil structure , and suffering from lower yields in later crop rotations in industrial plantations .
The high heating value ( HHV ) of 1.3 billion tons of biomass is roughly 22 EJ ; and the HHV of 130 billion gallons of ethanol is 11.4 EJ .
The fictitious DOE energy efficiency of converting biomass to ethanol , 11.4/22 = 0.52 , corresponds to Fischer - Tropsch synthesis and is two times higher than efficiency of the current corn-ethanol process .
If one were to produce cellulosic ethanol with a 26 % efficiency , one would have to use all above - ground biomass of all US crops , pastureland and rangeland , and annual biomass growth over 2/3 of all US forestland and timber plantations .
In summary , the DOE - USDA - Proposition 87 vision is to capture in real time most of net growth of all biomass in the US , while at the same time mining soil , water , and air over 72 percent of our land area , including Alaska , Hawaii , and Puerto Rico .
This biomass would then be devoured to feed our inefficient cars .
We would have little food production , as well as little wood for paper and construction .
In effect , the new brave US economy would be dedicated to feeding cars , not people .
This vision has been enthusiastically embraced by some in the US science and industrial establishment .
If one does not buy such obvious delusions and one wants to live better while not destroying the Earth , what is one to do ?
Instead of stumbling into Proposition 87 , it might be better to ask the following questions :
1 . What changes of our social and urban infrastructure will be necessary to decrease energy use in the US by a factor of 4 -6 ?
2 . How can the public be educated about the inevitable changes of our lifestyles ?
3 . How can one talk in a sensible way about the complex issues of environment / human interactions ?
In particular :
( a) How can one formulate the thermodynamics of living ecosystems and bring their descriptions into economic accounting ?
( b) How can one consistently compare most energy resources and energy extraction schemes ?
( c) How can one quantify the impact of energy supply schemes and life choices on the ecosystems in which we are embedded ?
(d) Will there be enough clean air , water , and soil to sustain our society ?
(e) How will the progressing global climate change impact energy consumption and production ?
The formulation of answers to these questions might start another proposition .
That future proposition would be for the people , not their cars .

Gene Shalit is the worlds ugliest film critic , also vying for one of the worlds most unsightly images a pair of eyes could stand without quite liquefying .
Jim Martin , around the time we saw him in the  Epic video , is even uglier , though he owes a heavy debt to whatever Gene decided to do with his hair ( both facial and on the head ) that didnt involve a brush , comb , razor , or even chimp - like grooming habits .
Jim was like a zany hippy who didnt care about the fashionable or the presentable , but he became genuinely scary at a time when bands like Faith No More tried to change the metal landscape .
That Jim left the band after their next album is instructive , and proves that the metal world can tolerate the weird — Mike Patton , in spades — but not the disturbingly unattractive .

Even his name is ugly , and I never did learn what happened to the poor drummers nose , but Id like to think it was smashed in by the now forgotten Clive Burr after being informed that the Piece of Mind recording sessions would not require his services .
In every video by the legendary British metal gods , he always appeared to be a fevered little imp ; so oblivious to his own physical deformities that he couldnt help but smile for cheering crowds .
And yet , despite his infectious grin , hes a nightmare to behold , perhaps the only clue well ever have as to what inspired Derek Riggs  most famous creation .
The Maiden video 12 Wasted Years says otherwise , but Id prefer to believe in the cruel in - joke .

King Diamond , Mercyful Fate / King Diamond
No middle - age man with a worthwhile mug continues to wear pounds of make - up , so his ugliness , while not as obvious as others , is still rightfully assumed .
And surely the top hats , capes , and endless strings of Satanic jewelry dont help his cause one bit .
I was a big fan of the Abigail and Them albums back in my youth , but his attire always seemed like overkill to me , as if the macabre lyrics and hellfire imagery werent enough to establish his devilish credentials .
More than anything , though , hes on any respectable list of ugly rockers because no one can imagine him being brought to orgasm by a woman — at least not a live one , anyway .
Bonus !!!
Stash of Ugly Fucking King Diamond Photos !!

Ian Hill , Judas Priest
Ian Hill was , from the very first time I saw him , a creepy , pederast uncle — the guy who would come to Thanksgiving drunk off his ass , likely shirtless , screaming about  that cunt you call Aunt Judy  and promising to make everyones world a living hell .
He always remained in the background — at a 1991 concert I attended he appeared to be literally nailed to the stage in a far corner — and only recently did I conclude that it was Rob Halfords vanity that wouldnt allow him more face time .
Hill always appears pissed off , balding , and on the edge of a bender , likely because he never realized that metal maniacs dont sport porn king moustaches .
Hes giving us a goatee these days , but now that hes old , fat , and likely suffering from congestive heart failure , its more sad than infuriating .

Mick Mars , Motley Crue
Being a fan of both Threes Company and Motley Crue in the early 80s , I couldnt help but wonder if Mars was deliberately channeling Joyce DeWitt during those years .
Or , like Vinnie Vincent , trying to approximate Joan Jett in male form .
The Crue was a notorious magnet for pussy , but only Mars can be imagined sitting in the tour bus by his lonesome with tears welling in his mascara - enveloped eyes .
Awful , never - quite - metal hair , thin as a fucking scarecrow , and so pale and emaciated that he never quite seemed alive , even in the midst of a spectacularly mediocre solo .
Plus , from certain angles , he looked like an old woman .
If chicks went for Tommys cock , or Vinces pretty boy allure , or Nikkis aura of danger , surely the babes reluctantly drifted over to Micks corner of the hotel suite only to poke his arm with a stick to make sure he hadnt stopped breathing .

Billy Milano , S.O.D./M.O.D.
Befitting a man who grunted and howled about clubbing seals and his hatred of immigrants , Billy Milano is enormous , moose - like , unclean , and foul to the touch .
Hes a man youd expect to consume a rib - eye on stage , but only after railing for twenty , cookie crumb - spewing minutes about the alleged hilarity of starvation in Africa .
That hes still alive at this late date is at least the 623,000th piece of evidence proving we inhabit a godless universe , but we can have a last laugh knowing that his song  No Glove No Love was not spoken out of experience .
Or was it ?
Enormously mangy racists dont get laid , even during decades where cocaine ensured even the least among us would taste the forbidden fruit , do they ?
Depending on the picture — and Ive seen dozens 
Milano could easily be the worlds ugliest individual — period — not just a laughable specimen from the rock world .
Heres one bloated wreck of a man crying out for a cold slab .

Lemmy Kilmister , Motorhead
We all know the warts , the filthy jean jackets , and the greasy hair that last saw a showerhead when  Ace of Spades was still spinning on record players , but the defiantly loveable Lemmy slips to # 4 because it is a confirmed fact that hes bedded hundreds of dames over his long career .
Perhaps thousands .
Plus , he ’s good - looking for an Englishman .
When one realizes what intercourse with such a man as Lemmy would have to entail — and even granting that hes quick , efficient , and a little selfless — men everywhere can stand tall knowing that no one among them will ever sink to so disastrous a state of low self - esteem .
It also proves that women are so seduced by fame — even fame among low - lifes and scoundrels — that they would allow a man with less allure than your average auto mechanic to probe their genitalia with musty abandon .
A man whose very appearance confirms that Robert Shaw did in fact consume himself and vomit upon a freshly minted corpse , thereby bringing it to life , has seen more pussy than you ever will .
Fellas , the fight for womens rights is over .

Steve Grimmett , Grim Reaper
Back in high school when my close friend and I could only dream of dates and sexual exploration , one of us ( ahem ) landed a chick who could have substituted for Steve Grimmett on his day off without anyone missing a beat .
Had I been speaking of Poison or any number of glam bands , this might not have been so bad , but as Grim Reapers front man was an even fatter , more unkempt version of Meatloaf , that infamous date those many years ago is still a difficult pill to swallow .
For my , uh my friend .
Grimmett is a mystery to many , but for all those in the know , his pounds of bushy hair , bloated , sweat - filled face , and mountainous physique will never be forgotten .
His  See You in Hell was a classic anthem , but even the most unfortunate creature among us will never know Steves own special version of the underworld .
Yes , you re a virgin , and awkward , and pathetic , but youll never , ever be Mr. Grimmett .
# 2
Udo Dirkschneider , Accept / Udo
The pudgy , stout little German has survived a heart attack on stage and years of undeserved obscurity , but no amount of sympathy will ever grant him a face that can be viewed for more than three uninterrupted seconds .
This is one fucker who would surely fell the Kraken .
Id say he hasnt aged well , but he always seemed on the far side of 60 to me , even when he had the strength to ride a wrecking ball in one of his videos .
With a voice like shredded glass blasted from a cannon , his vocals fit the crime , but by insisting on tacky fatigues and all known forms of sleeveless , he never acquired the masculine power wed expect from a heavy metal hero .
Interestingly , hes the ugliest man ever to flirt with homoerotic imagery in the rock arena .
# 1
Vinnie Vincent , Kiss / Vinnie Vincent Invasion
If you have any doubts about Vinnie taking the top spot from more obvious choices like Lemmy and Herr Udo , check out 1983 ’s  Lick it Up video for final confirmation .
Or better yet , try to sit through the 1986 vanity project  Boyz are Gonna Rock , which is quite possibly the most unintentionally hilarious rock video ever produced .
In either case , the 5 ’ 7 ″ axe - man struts and puffs out his chest like a giant among mortals , which always makes the decidedly ugly that much worse to face .
Ive seen him look like a chick , an Asian , an Italian , and even a zombified Joan Jett , but never , ever a man who could show a female a good time .
Napoleonic complexes dont come any more obnoxious and to this day , I cant look at him without thinking about that first time he appeared sans make - up , menacing the world with that vile smirk .
And Jesus Fucking Piss , can we even begin to measure how Herculean a task it is to be the ugliest member of Kiss ?
Bonus !!!
Vinnie , Fucking Live !!!

What are the moral implications of an act that is subjectively justified — within the actor 's rights given what he reasonably believes the facts to be — but objectively wrong ?
Suppose , for example , I correctly believe someone is trying to kill me .
You , a stranger , take some entirely innocent act which I reasonably interpret as the beginning of an assassination attempt .
I attack you , injure you , and then discover my mistake .
What ought to happen to me ?
The answer that fits my intuition — I think I could justify it in terms of the economic analysis of law , but that is n't the approach I 'm interested in at the moment — is that I am guilty of a tort but not a crime .
I have injured you and so owe compensation but did not intend to violate your rights and so do not deserve punishment .
Now , to make the question more interesting , replace me by the government .
You are arrested for a murder you did not commit , convicted on convincing evidence , and jailed awaiting execution .
The only way in which you can save your life is by escaping , killing a guard in the process ; you do so .
A month later — after you would have been executed if you had not escaped — someone else confesses to the murder , providing absolutely convincing evidence of your innocence .
What now is your status ?
Are you a murderer because you killed a guard ?
Or are you innocent on grounds of self defense , with perhaps a claim against the government for false imprisonment ?
The government and the guard were subjectively innocent , since they reasonably believed you were a murderer and so deserved to be executed ( I 'm not interested , at the moment , in whether capital punishment itself is morally justified — it just makes the example simpler ) .
But they were objectively guilty , since in fact you were not a murderer and they were thus attempting to kill you when you did not deserved to be killed .
You are both subjectively and objectively innocent of killing someone without justification , since they were in fact trying to kill you and you had no other way of defending yourself — unless their subjective innocence makes their actions morally correct .
Do other people agree with my intuition — that you are innocent , the government and its agents liable to you for damages but not deserving of punishment ?
If not , do you have a different approach to such situations , preferably one that applies to both private and state actors ?
Four Women Fired for Gossiping
Idle Chatter Cost Four Seasoned Employees Their Jobs
What happened in the town of Hooksett , N.H. , is no rumor .
Four town employees with 46 years of service between them were fired , in part for gossiping and discussing rumors of an improper relationship between the town administrator and another employee that Hooksett residents now agree were not true .
The administrator complained , and after an investigation the town council fired the women , finding , " Gossip , whispering , and an unfriendly environment are causing poor morale and interfering with the efficient performance of town business . "
" When I was given my termination papers , I just looked at the gentlemen that were present in the room and I said , ' You 've got to be kidding ! ' " said fired worker Sandy Piper , who insisted her comments were n't out of line .
" We discussed it on a lunch break , and then it ended . "
" It kind of sort of was , ' Oh did you hear that too , ' " said Michelle Bonsteel , Piper 's fired co-worker .
Gossip is ingrained in American culture , from the elementary school playground to the office water cooler .
But Tory Johnson , " Good Morning America 's " workplace contributor , said people should be careful about what they say when they 're on the clock .
" Free speech only goes so far , " Johnson said .
" An employer definitely has the right to defend his reputation . "
In Hooksett the four firings are ironically now the talk of the town .
But for the women out of work , the controversy is not a matter of idle chatter -- they want to get back to work .
" I did love my job .
And do I want to return ?
Absolutely , " Piper said .
Lawyers for the Town Council of Hooksett told ABC News they have " no comment " at this time , but there could be a decision this week on whether to reinstate some or all of the women .
The instructor strode into the classroom empty handed .
He nodded to the class and checked his watch .
Seven P.M.
Every chair was occupied , fifty in all .
Many students wore business suits , ties pulled loose .
A dozen stood against the back wall .
Murmuring stopped .
Donning his spectacles , the instructor groped in his pocket for a scrap of paper .
Without saying a word , he clicked his pen and wrote briefly .
Students exchanged glances .
The instructor folded the paper and returned it to his pocket .
Parenthesis : Customarily , at the beginning of the first lecture , a professor will take up chalk , write the name of the course on the blackboard , then turn to face the class .
This is the time instructors use to deal with obligatory administrative matters : the title of the textbook , the date of the midterm , the policy on homework .
All quite collegiate .
Not this time .
The instructor , an oversized , stern - looking character in his thirties , grasped the lectern with both hands and gazed intently at his new charges .
" I have just written a number on a piece of paper , " he said .
" What is the number ? "
The sound of scuffing feet .
" I 'll give you a hint , " the instructor spoke solemnly .
" The number is between one and a thousand . "
A few in the back are heard to chuckle aloud .
Then only the muted sounds of university life beyond the classroom windows .
" Do you understand the question ? "
No answer .
" I have written a number between one and a thousand on a piece of paper , " said the instructor .
" What is the number ? " A bearded chap , probably a graduate student , hesitated .
" One ninety - eight ? " A companion laughed .
The instructor cupped his hand behind his ear .
" Did you say ' one hundred ninety - eight ' ? "
The laughing stopped .
Bearded Chap shrugged .
" It 's the number of the course . "
" One moment please . "
The instructor pulled the slip of paper from his pocket and unfolded it .
He shook his head .
" Wrong . " " One ? " asked a student wearing a gray suit after a long pause .
" Was that a guess , too ? " Gray Suit grinned .
" No , that was a guess : One . "
A collective groan rolled over the class .
" How about 999 ? " someone asked .
The instructor squinted .
" Who said that ? "
A young man in checkered shirt raised his hand timidly .
" Why did n't you say ' two ' ? "
" Thought I 'd save some time , " chuckled Checkered Shirt .
" Sorry to disappoint you but the number is not 999 .
Perhaps you would like to explain how your guess saves time . "
Checkered Shirt cleared his throat .
Before he could speak , however , a student wearing tattered jeans blurted : " Is it less than 500 ? " Someone on the other side of the room cried out , " Aha ! "
All eyes focussed eagerly on the instructor .
" No . " " Is it less than 750 ? " asked Tattered Jeans triumphantly .
" Yes . "
A cheer rang out .
Other students joined in : " Less than 600 ? " No .
" Less than 700 ? " Yes .
A handful of questions later and the answer was found : 666 .
Tattered Jeans stood and took a bow .
The applause subsided .
The scene described here took place in the middle sixties .
The course was called " Logic Design . "
By the tenth time I taught it , I hit upon that number exercise as a means to introduce ' heuristics . '
That 's the fancy word for ' discovery . '
{ Definition}
About that time , a subversive movement in education emerged , called ' discovery method . '
Not new , really , it 's what infants do on their own .
What teachers do to children in ordinary classrooms is called ' prescriptive teaching . '
As a dabbler in self - reference , I found especially pleasing the idea of using discovery methods for teaching -- well , teaching discovery methods .
The instructor removed his jacket .
" Before you leave this evening and every time I see you , I will assign a problem .
During each classroom session , we will work together to analyze your solutions .
You may find information in the textbook useful .
Often , however , you will have to develop your own methods .
Discovery is like that . "
At about this point , an uneasiness arises among the doctoral candidates scattered about the room .
They viewed this course as one of the Stations of the Cross .
To graduate students , grades mean everything .
" However , " continued the instructor , " you might just as well know , we will be using ' discovery methods ' here for all aspects of the course .
Shall I explain ? "
Eager nodding identified the would - be PhD's .
" Getting the right answer assures you a grade of C , " said the instructor .
" Now , I am not unmindful that in graduate school , a C is tantamount to failure .
So , for a grade of B , you must discover a method for solving all problems of the same type as that assigned . "
The instructor paused for effect .
" And to get an A ? -- well , that requires the discovery of a new problem . "
Dozens of working engineers car - pooled to the campus from as far away as Vandenberg Air Force Base , 80 miles to the North , from San Diego near the Mexican Border , and from Palmdale in the High Desert .
They came to learn discovery methods for their immediate work needs -- logic design of controllers , automatic machines , computers .
Mixed in were grumbling graduate students getting their tickets punched for advanced degrees , invariably right - answer habituated .
Every semester , a standing - room - only crowd showed up for the first lecture .
Most did not stay the distance , though .
By the third session , there were two chairs for each student .
And I never graded more than twenty finals .
My favorite moment was about to begin .
The instructor pulled the slip of paper from his pocket and held it up .
" Earlier you succeeded in solving our little number problem .
What was the first thing that came to your mind ? "
The Class Jester revealed himself with a rendition of the opening theme from " The Twilight Zone . "
Every class has its Humorless Expressive , the best straight - man one could hope for .
" You did n't give us enough data , " he will complain .
" Not enough data ?
That was your first thought ?
Prepare for a surprise .
Many of the problems I will assign during the coming weeks do not have enough data .
Better get used to that .
Oh yes , and some will have too much data -- more than you need . "
The instructor managed an amiable smile .
" Which is worse , not enough or too much ? "
" Not enough , " someone called out .
" What about contradictory data ? " the instructor asked .
The class inhaled .
" That 's another cruel fact : Some of your problems in this course will have contradictory data -- for which I make no apology . "
" How will we know we have the right answer ? " asked Humorless Expressive .
" You wo n't .
But it 's only worth a C anyway .
Indeed , there may not be a right answer .
Try to remember :
In this course , the answer -- right or wrong -- is not the end of anything .
It 's the beginning of something else .
Usually the hard part .
Back to our little analysis :
So , you did not have enough data -- yet you solved the problem anyway .
How did you manage that ? "
" Guessing , " said one of the working engineers .
The instructor turned and wrote " Guessing " on the blackboard .
" Contrary to what you have been taught all your life , guessing is not bad .
How many times have you been reproached for guessing ? -- at home , at school , in examinations -- ' subtract the number wrong from the number right ' -- that 's how to punish guessing . '
Some of you , I 'm afraid , are afraid to guess .
Well , in this class , guessing is rewarded .
But watch out .
For the number problem , you had only one chance in a thousand , did n't you .
Unless you are exceptionally lucky , guessing can waste a lot of time .
In this case , how much ? " Checkered Shirt raised his hand .
" On the average : 500 tries . " Bearded Chap spoke up brightly .
" Mine was an educated guess : The course number . "
" It sure was .
On the other hand , you might have guessed that I had heard that one before .
In previous classes , people have used the number of students in the room as their educated guess .
Also , ' 77 Sunset Strip , ' ' Route 66 , ' and ' 101 Dalmatians . '
If those are educated guesses , welcome indeed to the ' The Twilight Zone ' . "
A full - lung laugh lingered in the room , the first such of the evening .
The instructor nodded toward Checkered Shirt .
" Your 500 guesses would take a long time . "
" Would n't my method have been better ? " asked Gray Suit .
He grinned and pressed his thumb to his chest .
" I 'm the one who started with ' one ' . "
Checkered Shirt waved his hand .
" No different than guessing . "
Eyes turned toward the instructor .
" There is a fancy name for his method , though .
Anybody know what it is ? "
The instructor turned and printed the word " Determinism " on the blackboard .
{ Definition} " Some might call it ' brute force . '
For many problems , however , it may be the only practical way to struggle through , from known to unknown .
You do n't look like a brute to me . "
" My method is best , " said Tattered Jeans .
Class Jester clapped his hands sarcastically .
" Give that man his B . "
The instructor became serious .
" As an exercise , now , try to recall that part of the experiment .
Re-run it in slow motion .
Jot down the sequence of events exactly as you witnessed them . "
The instructor waited for the scribbling to stop .
" What was the first thing you wrote down ? " he asked , pointing at Gray Suit .
" That guy over there asked you , ' Is it less than 500 ? ' "
" Sure enough .
What happened next ? "
" You said , ' No . '
Then he asked if it was less than 750 -- " " Wrong ! " exclaimed the instructor .
The class froze .
Here and there , a nervous smile .
" Excuse me , but that is not what happened next .
Anyone ! " Silence .
The instructor banged the lectern .
" Aha ! " he shouted .
" Someone said that .
Did n't any of you hear ! "
More silence .
" It was you , was it not ? " he gestured toward a blushing student .
" Did n't you cry out ' Aha ! ' "
Blushing Student nodded .
" That , my new friends , is the sound of discovery .
It comes from deep inside somewhere .
St. Thomas Aquinas nearly 700 years ago described the feeling as 'a sudden release in the tensions of inquiry . '
How many of you felt it ? "
The instructor waited for an answer , which was slow to come .
A few hands are raised , including Tattered Jeans ' .
" You better raise your hand .
You were the one who made the discovery .
What is your name ? "
" Aquinas .
Call me Tom . "
" Is everybody here a comedian or what !
All right , Aquinas , what was your discovery ? "
" Process of elimination , " replied Thomas Aquinas , trying to erase a smirk .
" Successive approximation , " Bearded Chap corrected .
" Ever hear of one of these ? " the instructor asked while printing " Algorithm " on the blackboard .
" You discovered an algorithm , Mr. Aquinas .
As Casey Stengel would say , ' You could look it up . ' "
{ Definition} " Just more guessing , " protested Humorless Expressive .
" The discovery was the algorithm -- the procedure , " explained the instructor .
" Hot dog !
Something new was discovered .
Getting the answer , 666 , after that was -- why , it was downhill all the way . "
It is environments which do the selecting of attributes , not vice versa , according to Charles Robert Darwin .
The holes pick the pegs .
Richard Hamming of Bell Labs once told me that education fits the Darwinian model : Schools select more than teach .
" If , " asserted Hamming with a smile , " if you take the students who pass the entrance exam to , say , MIT and simply lock them up in a gymnasium for four years , occasionally tossing books in through the windows , they would graduate with the same qualifications as if you subjected them to the ministrations of the classroom . "
Hardly encouraging to the conscientious educator .
Moreover , conventional wisdom proclaims the unlikelihood of ever teaching some things : aesthetics , creativity , judgment , sophistication , wisdom -- hah ! -- and discovery .
To be sure , from the courses I taught , only a scant few students emerged with discovery skills , doubtless assured by congenital traits -- or , at least , attributes possessed long before showing up in my classroom .
That first , bizarre lecture probably afforded the most selective value .
The instructor passed out a sign - up sheet and collected registration cards .
He wrote the name of the textbook on the blackboard , then turned suddenly to face the class .
" What has two wheels , seven letters , and starts with the letter B ? " he asked .
Too obvious .
There had to be a catch .
" Buffalo , " said the instructor solemnly .
" I lied about the wheels . "
In the middle sixties , that joke repaid its telling with a reluctant laugh .
Most students joined in -- except , of course , Humorless Expressive .
" Do you ever wonder about what makes things funny ? " the instructor inquired .
" Our course , by the way , is entitled ' Logic Design ' not ' Fundamentals of Funny Things . '
Just the same , can you think of one word that most explains what makes people laugh ? "
Class Jester frowned in concentration .
The best kidders have a gift for synthesis -- more than analysis -- of the absurd .
The first suggestion came from Checkered Shirt .
" Surprise . "
The instructor wrote the word on the blackboard .
" What does it take to be surprised ? " he asked .
" A crooked joke , " grumped Humorless Expressive .
" On the part of the listener , I mean , " prompted the instructor .
No answer .
" How about ... "
He printed in large letters the word " ASSUMPTIONS " and tossed the chalk into the tray .
" What did you , the listeners , assume ? "
" That you were honest , " someone said .
" Sorry to betray your trust about the wheels .
Fact of the matter , every person in this room makes assumptions all the time .
It 's part of being human .
We are automatic assumption machines .
How far would you drive if you could n't assume that on - coming cars are going to stay on the other side of the road ?
Strolling across an intersection on a green light requires an assumption , too , does n't it .
Same for when you buy something .
Or marry somebody .
Only we do n't always think about our assumptions .
Ever hear of ' hidden assumptions ' ?
Our thought - lives are bathed in assumptions .
Authors , playwrights , artists -- and yes , comedians -- exploit our assumptions , set us up and then surprise us .
Sometimes we laugh , but not always . "
The instructor pulled the folded paper from his pocket .
" Every one of you assumed I was honest when I posed the number problem .
Crazy , maybe , but honest . "
He handed the paper to Humorless Expressive .
" Was I ? "
The student nodded and passed the paper along the front row .
" Discovery is nourished by assumptions .
If you do n't have enough data , you what ? -- assume something .
When there is too much of the stuff or it 's riddled with contradictions , what else can you do ?
Assume something . "
" But ! " bellowed the instructor while commencing an exaggerated scrawl across the top of the blackboard : " Make your assumptions explicit ! "
Invariably the class would be too stunned to write .
Damn , what fun !
I relished the moment then and have savored the memory for decades .
The instructor lowered his voice .
" Make your assumptions explicit .
Now , as an exercise , please write down all the assumptions you made . "
" In finding the number , you mean , " confirmed Bearded Chap .
" You may assume that , yes , " replied the instructor , winking at no one in particular .
He strolled around the room patiently .
" Who wants to lead off ? "
The instructor handed the chalk to St. Thomas Aquinas in tattered jeans .
The student rose reluctantly , head bowed over his notebook .
" That you wanted us to ask questions , " he wrote on the board .
Checkered Shirt raised his hand and took the chalk .
He inserted a carat and the words " Yes or No " in the statement .
" Like the game ' Twenty Questions ' ? " the instructor mused .
Checkered Shirt nodded .
" But you assumed I would answer them , too , did you not ?
Another hidden assumption .
Did anyone write that down ? "
No answer .
" I thought not . "
The instructor wrote " Instructor will answer " on the board .
" Incidentally , how many questions would it take , using the Aquinas Algorithm , to solve the problem ?
Anyone ! " Gray Suit raised his hand .
" No more than ten .
There are 1,024 combinations of 10 yes / no answers . "
" So you did n't need 20 questions , you 're telling us . "
" With 20 questions , " said Gray Suit , " we could have isolated any number between one and over a million ! "
He buffed his nails on his vest " That so ? " asked the instructor .
" Tell the class what you mean by the word ' number ' . "
" Uh-oh . " Gray Suit 's expression darkened .
He stepped to the blackboard and wrote " Integer ! "
An audible gasp came from the front row .
" What 's your problem ? " the instructor taunted .
" How many of you assumed ' integer ' ?
Whole number ? "
All hands rise slowly .
" Obviously Saint Thomas Smarty Pants over there did .
But did anybody write it down ? "
Humorless Expressive was not amused .
" The problem would have been impossible if you did n't mean whole numbers . "
There were good - natured " Yeah 's ! " from all over the room .
The instructor 's eyebrows rose toward his hairline , his eyelids drooped .
" Impossible ? "
In all the years I performed the experiment perhaps only a half dozen students made explicit that assumption about whole numbers without prompting .
But there is a more critical assumption , a preconceived notion so deeply hidden in the basement of foregone conclusions , that nobody ever found it .
Nobody .
The instructor chalked up a list of the course highlights and delivered an introductory lecture that ended with a problem assignment .
He checked his watch .
Nine P.M.
" See you next week . "
He slapped the chalk dust from his hands .
" Some of you . "
The instructor donned his jacket and strode toward the door .
" If you did n't mean ' whole number , ' -- " It was St. Thomas Aquinas .
He was just about to ask the question which was most earnestly hoped for by the instructor .
" -- how would tonight 's problem ever have been solved ? "
" Assumptions !
The key was right there in the assumptions . "
Not one student moved to leave the room .
" You assumed I would only answer ' yes or no ' questions .
If , in fact , you had asked me for the first digit of the number , I would have answered ' 6 ' . "
Long silence .
" Same for the second digit ? " inquired Checkered Shirt .
" Yes .
And the third -- and any number of digits after the decimal point . "
" Aha ! " cried Blushing Student , grinning .
The instructor stood in the doorway , face iridescent .
" For that matter , if anyone had asked me for the number itself , I would have told him . "
The only sound was that of palms slapping foreheads .
" Do me a favor , " said the instructor over his shoulder .
" Do n't tell anybody . "
What do increased sales of Dark Side of The Moon tell us ?
That there 's a new audio format to buy it in .
Pink Floyd 's 1973 album has become the unofficial metric by which one measures a new audio format 's likely takeup , as there 's an apparently insatiable supply of people ready to buy and re-buy it whenever it is re-issued .
The latest version is the iTunes Plus version on Apple 's iTunes Store , encoded in AAC at 256 Kbps without DRM restrictions .
Previously , the album has also been released on stereo vinyl , quadraphonic vinyl , 8 - track , CD ( several times , with different mixes and packaging ) , Super Audio CD , Windows Media Audio , and standard iTunes ( 128 KBps AAC with copying restrictions ) .
According to the band 's site ( tinyurl.com / d4ua7 ) , the album " has sold approximately 34 m copies worldwide " .
Though to say that is to skim over the fact that it remained in the US top 100 for 1,558 weeks - just two weeks short of three decades .

It is time once again for that touching annual ritual , in which the world 's most powerful people move themselves to tears .
At Heiligendamm they will emote with the wretched of the earth .
They will beat their breasts and say many worthy and necessary things - about climate change , Africa , poverty , trade - but one word will not leave their lips .
Power .
Amid the patrician goodwill , there will be no acknowledgement that the power they wield over other nations destroys everything they claim to stand for .
The leaders of the G8 nations present themselves as a force for unmitigated good .
Sometimes they fail , but they seek only to make the world a kinder place .
Bob Geldof and Bono give oxygen to this deception , speaking of the good works the leaders might perform , or of the good works they have failed to perform - but not mentioning the active harm .
They refuse to acknowledge that what the rich nations give with one finger they take with both hands .
Look at what is happening , right now , in the Philippines .
This country has many problems , but one stands out : just 16 % of children between four and five months old are exclusively breastfed .
This is one of the lowest documented rates on earth , and it has fallen by a third since 1998 .
As 70 % of Filipinos have inadequate access to clean water , the result is a public health disaster .
Every year , according to the World Health Organisation , some 16,000 Filipino children die as a result of " inappropriate feeding practices " .
These are the deaths caused only by acute results of feeding children with substitutes for breastmilk .
A summary of peer - reviewed studies compiled by the campaigning groups Infact and Ibfan suggests that breastfeeding also reduces the incidence of asthma , allergies , childhood cancers , diabetes , coeliac disease , Crohn 's , colitis , poor cognitive development , obesity , cardiovascular disease , ear infections and poor dentition .
Switching from bottle to breast could prevent 13 % of all childhood deaths - a greater impact than any other measure .
Panaceas are rare in medicine , but the mammary gland is one .
Both the government of the Philippines and the UN blame the manufacturers of baby formula for much of the decline in breastfeeding .
These companies spend over $ 100 m a year on advertising breastmilk substitutes in the Philippines , which equates to more than half the department of health 's annual budget .
Those who appear most susceptible to this advertising are the poor , who are also the most likely to be using contaminated water to make up the feed .
Some spend as much as one third of their household income on formula .
Powdered milk now accounts for more sales than any other consumer product in the Philippines .
Almost all of it is produced by companies based in the rich nations .
Since Ferdinand Marcos was deposed in 1986 , the government of the Philippines has been trying to stand between these corporations and vulnerable mothers .
It has failed .
It plugs one loophole ; the formula companies find another .
Baby Milk Action , one of the world 's most impressive public health campaigns , has compiled a dossier of breaches of the marketing code drawn up by the World Health Organisation .
Formula companies have been dispensing gifts to both health workers and mothers , running promotional classes and meetings and advertising their wares on television and in magazines and papers .
These practices , though mostly legal in the Philippines , are all discouraged by the code .
In February this year , the Pharmaceutical and Healthcare Association of the Philippines ( Phap ) , which represents multinational companies , ran a series of advertisements expressing concern for women unable to breastfeed their children .
The campaign was described by Jean Ziegler , the UN 's special rapporteur on the right to food , as " misleading , deceptive , and malicious in intent " .
He claimed the adverts " manipulate data emanating from UN specialised agencies such as WHO and Unicef ... with the sole purpose to protect the milk companies ' huge profits , regardless of the best interest of Filipino mothers and children " .
Last year , in the hope of arresting this public health disaster , the Philippines ' department of health drew up a new set of rules .
It prohibited all advertising and promotion of infant formula for children up to two years old .
It forbade the formula companies from giving away gifts or samples , and from providing assistance to health workers or classes to mothers .
The new rules seem stiff , but they all come straight from the WHO 's code .
Phap , whose members include most of the world 's largest pharmaceutical companies , went to the supreme court to try to obtain a restraining order .
When it failed the big guns arrived .
The US embassy and the US regional trade representative started lobbying the Philippines government .
Then the chief executive of the US Chamber of Commerce in Washington - which represents 3 m businesses - wrote a letter to the president of the Philippines , Gloria Arroyo .
The new rules , he claimed , would have " unintended negative consequences for investors ' confidence " .
The country 's reputation " as a stable and viable destination for investment is at risk " .
Four days later , the supreme court reversed its decision and imposed the restraining order Phap had requested .
It remains in force today .
The government is currently unable to prevent companies from breaking the international code .
So the department of health asked a senior government lawyer , Nestor Ballocillo , to contest the order .
In December Ballocillo and his son were shot dead while walking from their home .
The case remains unsolved ; Ballocillo was working on several contentious cases at the time .
Last month the US regional trade representative paid another visit to the Philippines government .
The department of health appears to be wavering .
In two weeks the campaigners promoting breastfeeding will present their arguments to the supreme court to try to get the order lifted , and the formula companies will try to stop them .
If the companies win , thousands of children will continue to die of preventable diseases .
The pressure to which the US government and the US Chamber of Commerce has subjected the government of the Philippines is at odds with almost everything the G8 now claims to stand for : the millennium health and education goals , the eradication of poverty , fair terms of trade .
But the G8 nations will pursue their stated objectives only to the point at which they collide with their own interests .
Away from their sentimental summits , they pull down everything they claim to be building .
The G8 demands action on climate change ; the World Bank , controlled by the G8 nations , funds coal burning power stations and deforestation projects .
The G8 requests better terms of trade for Africa ; Europe and the United States use the world trade talks to make sure this does n't happen .
The G8 leaders call for the debt to be reduced ; the IMF demands that poor nations remove barriers to the capital flows that leave them in hock .
The G8 leaders simultaneously wring their hands and wash their hands : we have done what we can ; if we have failed , it is only because of the corruption of third world elites .
The question is no longer whether the undemocratic power the G8 nations exert over the rest of the world can be used for good or ill .
The question is whether it will cease to be used .

Was Hamas 's seizure of Fatah security offices in Gaza unprovoked , or a pre-emptive strike to forestall a coup by Fatah ?
After last week 's turmoil , it becomes increasingly important to uncover its origins .
The fundamental cause is , of course , well known .
Israel , aided by the US , was not prepared to accept Hamas 's victory in last year 's Palestinian elections .
Backed by a supine EU , the two governments decided to boycott their new Palestinian counterparts politically and punish Palestinian voters by blocking economic aid .
Their policies had a dramatic effect , turning Gaza even more starkly into an open prison and creating human misery on a massive scale .
The aim was to turn voters against Hamas - a strategy of stupidity as well as cynicism , since outside pressure usually produces resistance rather than surrender .
The policy shocked even moderate western officials like James Wolfensohn , the former World Bank chief , whom the Americans had appointed to help Gaza 's economy before the Hamas election victory .
" The result was not to build more economic activity but to build more barriers , " he said this week while explaining why he resigned in disagreement with US and Israeli strategy .
It is also well known that Hamas was as surprised by its election victory as everyone else and that it offered its rival , Fatah , a coalition government of national unity .
The offer was refused .
If this was done initially out of wounded pride , Fatah 's rejection of Hamas 's regularly repeated overtures increasingly appeared to be coordinated with Washington as part of the boycott strategy .
Reports have been circulating for months of a more sinister side to the boycott .
According to them , the US decided last year on a plan to arm and train Mahmoud Abbas 's presidential guard in a deliberate effort to confront and defeat Hamas militarily .
Israel has already locked up several dozen Hamas legislators and mayors from the West Bank .
The next stage was to do the same in Gaza but have Palestinians , rather than Israelis , run the crackdown .
Arming insurgents against elected governments has a long US pedigree and it is no accident that Elliott Abrams , the deputy national security adviser and apparent architect of the anti-Hamas subversion , was a key player in Ronald Reagan 's supply of weapons to the Contras who fought Nicaragua 's elected government in the 1980s .
Documents doing the rounds in the Middle East purport to have evidence for Abrams 's " hard coup " strategy .
One text recounts Washington 's objectives as expressed in US officials ' conversations with an Arab government .
These are , among others , " to maintain President Abbas and Fatah as the centre of gravity on the Palestinian scene " , " avoid wasting time in accommodating Hamas 's ideological conditions " , " undermine Hamas 's political status through providing for Palestinian economic needs " , and " strengthen the Palestinian president 's authority to be able to call and conduct early elections by autumn 2007 " .
The document is dated March 2 , less than a month after Saudi Arabia brokered the Mecca agreement under which Abbas finally agreed with Hamas on a unity government .
The deal upset the Israelis and Washington because it left Hamas 's prime minister Ismail Haniyeh in charge .
The document suggests the US wanted to sabotage it .
Certainly , according to Hamas officials whom a depressed Abbas later briefed , Abbas was told to scrap Mecca at every subsequent meeting he has had with Israeli prime minister Ehud Olmert or with US secretary of state Condoleezza Rice and Abrams .
Most ominously , the document of US objectives outlined a $ 1.27 bn programme that would add seven special battalions , totalling 4,700 men , to the 15,000 Abbas already has in his presidential guard and other security forces , which were also to be given extra training and arms .
" The desired outcome will be the transformation of Palestinian security forces and provide for the president of the Palestinian Authority to able to safeguard decisions such as dismissing the cabinet and forming an emergency cabinet , " the document says .
Alastair Crooke , a former Middle East adviser to the EU foreign policy chief , Javier Solana , and current head of a research institute in Beirut , points out that Israel blocked some arms deliveries .
It was wary of sending too many into Gaza for fear Fatah might lose them , as indeed has happened .
In this sense , only part of the plan went ahead .
( Britain has played a small part in helping Abbas 's security forces .
It has provided about £ 350,000 of " non-lethal " equipment this year for protecting the Karni freight crossing between Gaza and Israel . )
But Crooke says Hamas was irritated that the Mecca deal was being sabotaged , notably by the refusal of Mohammed Dahlan , Fatah 's long - time Gaza strongman and head of the Preventive Security Forces , to accept the authority of the independent interior minister appointed to the unity government .
" Dahlan refused to deal with him , and put his troops on the streets in defiance of the interior minister .
Hamas felt they had little option but to take control of security away from forces which were in fact creating insecurity , " Crooke says .
Ahmed Yousef , a Hamas spokesman , confirms the movement thought it had to move fast .
In his words , last week 's events were " precipitated by the American and Israeli policy of arming elements of the Fatah opposition who want to attack Hamas and force us from office " .
While Hamas has successfully blocked the US - Fatah plans for Gaza , Abbas is trying to implement them in the West Bank by forming an emergency government .
The policy is doomed since the constitution says such a government can only last 30 days .
Parliament has to renew it by a two - thirds majority , and parliament is controlled by Hamas .
The only sensible policy for Abbas must be to end the effort to marginalise Hamas .
He should go back to the Mecca agreement and support a unity government .
Even now , Hamas says it is willing to do so .
Where does all this leave the White House idea to involve Tony Blair as a Middle Eastern envoy ?
It creates a " coalition of the discredited " - Bush , Olmert and Blair - and sounds like something from a satire since Blair has no credibility with Hamas or most other Palestinians .
Better to leave it to the Saudis to revive the Mecca deal , or wait until Abbas realises he has fallen into a trap .
Neither common sense nor democratic principles , let alone time , are on Fatah 's side .

The number two guy in Al Qaeda , Ayman al Zawahiri , says he does n't like the Democrats ' bill to get us out of Iraq .
Why ?
Because he wants the US to remain in a quagmire where our troops are killed and killed and killed , i.e. , he likes the Republican plan for Iraq .
From ABC
News :
In a new video posted today on the Internet , al Qaeda 's number two man , Ayman al Zawahiri , mocks the bill passed by Congress setting a timetable for the pullout of U.S. troops in Iraq .
" This bill will deprive us of the opportunity to destroy the American forces which we have caught in a historic trap , " Zawahiri says in answer to a question posed to him an interviewer .
Continuing in the same tone , Zawahiri says , " We ask Allah that they only get out of it after losing 200,000 to 300,000 killed , in order that we give the spillers of blood in Washington and Europe an unforgettable lesson . "
Yes , Al Qaeda just endorsed George Bush 's plan for Iraq .
Funny how George Bush and the Republicans now sound exactly like Al Qaeda .

The Old Testament Book of Ecclesiastes has a few words to say about novelty , fashion and innovation .
" The thing that hath been , it is that which shall be :
And that which is done is that which shall be done :
And there is no new thing under the sun . "
The Regency TR - 1 transistor radio , made in 1954 , had a decent claim to be a genuine piece of innovation , however .
It was , by popular agreement , the world 's first commercially sold transistor pocket radio .
Small enough to hold in your hand , and powered by batteries , it came in a variety of delicious colours , including green , pearlescent blue , lavender , white and red .
The device went on sale just in time for hip young gadget freaks to hear Elvis Presley singing That 's All Right - recognised by many as the moment at which rock 'n ' roll was born .
The TR - 1 was marketed under the slogan " See it !
Hear it !
Get it ! "
I think Apple are very good at designing and a lot of their products are quite retro .
I think it 's just a coincidence
John Ousby
AKA Fat Controller
Hi-tech , trendy colours , rock music , punchy slogans ... remind anyone of anything ?
When technology watcher John Ousby , who is head of distribution technology at the BBC , realised the modern day parallels , he knew he had to do something .
" I did a bit of digging around , " he says , " and found a good website on vintage electronics .
I then matched photos of the transistor with photos of the iPod Mini . "
He then posted the above picture on the photo - sharing website Flickr .
" Normally my photos there are viewed less than 100 times .
But I was away for couple of days and came back to see there had been more than 15,000 , " he says .
The similarity between the two has " created quite a stir " , he says , particularly in the Mac community .
He is , however , at pains to point out that he believes the similarity between the 50s radio and the iPod mini is purely coincidental .
Apple declined to comment ; some of those stirred by the debate definitely see the parallels .
" I 'd say a good engineer learns from a good thing , not to say they copy it , " says one member of community discussion site Digg .

Another adds : " Even Picasso was influenced by artists before him . "
Other readers might simply conclude that however new something seems - and even the iPod mini has now been replaced by a newer model - everything has its roots somewhere .

It seems that this says more about human aesthetics than copying old designs .

All ideas are really ' piggybacked ' from other existing ones , inovation occurs when you can add a new spin on an old product and bring it back to popularity .
Apple has taken the existing , and lasting , want of portablility , and made it digital .
I 'm not really suprised this other device existed .
Elliot Erickson , Menomonie , WI USA
Further proof that there is , in reality , no truely original ideas .
Everything has been done before , and in most cases the way something new has been done was thought of many years ago before it became possible .

The Audi TT car design is strongly influenced by their racing products of the 1930's and the Bauhaus school .
It will still look good in ten years time because of the simplicity of line .
If you look at Hi-Fi design of the 1970's from Japan the idea of putting more buttons and lights on the facia than anyone else sold the product , but as a design it now looks very dated .
Who said something about form following function ?
JAMES STYLES , Whitstable England
Has there actually been any new inventions in the last 15 years ?
All " new " inventions are just upgrades of existing pieces of equipment .
The mobile phone is an upgrade of your normal landline phone , the laptop computer is a normal computer only much smaller , even the I - Pod is a fancy walkman !!
I think the age of invention has passed and there will be nothing " new " invented for a long time yet .
Art Vandelay , Darkest Peru
Innovation is the key to re-invention
Megan Evans , Hitchin
As a product designer myself , I find it quite sad that no - one seems to be curious as to who actually designed the casing of the Regency TR - 1 ( to be honest no - one seems to ask themselves the names of the people who designed the i-Pod either ! ) .
Products do n't just " happen " - a designer sits down and creates them - not an engineer as the Digg correspondent wrongly suggested ( engineers do all the clever bits inside of course , but not the external casing ) .
Judging by the photo it was a talented designer who worked on the TR - 1 and it seems a shame that no - one 's interested in who he / she was .
It would be regarded as odd to discuss a piece of architectural heritage without bothering to ask who the architect was , so why do us British ignore designers so readily ?
Graeme Bell , Bristol
All good design is an evolution of past success .
The artists and architects of the enlightenment looked to Ejypt , Greece and Rome for their prototypes to base their work on .
Far from this being a negative association i think Apple should be applauded for encouraging such a good design process in their ranks .
No one can deny that the execution of these designs are outstanding , with a level of thought in detail and materials that is second to none .
Martin Sorensen , Edinburgh
The last few years has seen a ' retro ' styling in many areas of consumer technology .
Could the preference for a nostalgic veneer signal a change in attitudes to gizmos and gadgets ?
We still want the benefits of new developments , but without the techno - anorak stigma .

In the land that launched the cartoons war between Islam and the west , Asmaa Abdol - Hamid finds herself on the frontline , gearing up for a new battle .
The 25 - year - old social worker , student and town councillor describes herself as a feminist , a democrat , and a socialist .
She has gay friends , opposes the death penalty , supports abortion rights , and could not care less what goes on in other people 's bedrooms .
In short , a tolerant Scandinavian and European .
She is also a Palestinian and a devout Muslim who insists on wearing a headscarf , who refuses , on religious grounds , to shake hands with males , and who is bidding fair to be the first Muslim woman ever to enter the Folketing , the Danish parliament in Copenhagen .
For the extreme right , the young activist is a political provocateur , an agent of Islamic fundamentalism bent on infiltrating the seat of Danish democracy .
To many on the left , Ms Abdol - Hamid is also problematic , personifying through her dress the reactionary repression of women and an illiberal religious agenda that should have no place in her leftwing " red- green " alliance of socialists and environmentalists .
As a result of announcing her parliamentary candidacy earlier this month , the young Muslim and Danish citizen has been thrust to the centre of a debate tormenting Denmark and the rest of western Europe - on the place and values of Islam in modern Europe and the treatment of large Muslim minorities .
Ms Abdol - Hamid is unfazed .
" I see more Islam here in Denmark than in Iran or in other places in the Middle East , " she says .
" It 's easier to be a Muslim in Denmark than in Saudi Arabia .
I do n't feel a stranger here .
I 'm interested in politics .
I want to talk about this society , about political issues .
But I 'm not in politics because I'm a Muslim . "
Her ambition , combined with her insistence on flaunting her religious affiliation , have outraged the Danish political establishment and triggered a new bout of soul - searching almost two years after the publication of cartoons of the Prophet ignited violence and protest across the Islamic world .
" This goes far beyond the extreme right , " says Toger Seidenfaden , editor of the Politiken daily newspaper .
" Asmaa is insisting on the right to be a religious Muslim and that 's provoking broad debate among the public . "
The key issue is the headscarf and whether it can be accommodated in parliament .
This month Ms Abdol - Hamid gained the candidacy for a safe Copenhagen seat for the leftwing Unity List .
The Danish People 's Party or DFP , the far - right movement that unofficially props up the weak centre - right government of the prime minister , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , is on the warpath .
A couple of DFP politicians compared the headscarf to the Nazi swastika .
One described the prospective MP as " brainwashed " .
" We do n't like the idea of her performing as an Islamist in the parliament , " says DFP spokesman Kim Eskildsen .
" We find it wrong that she 'll use the parliament as a tool for Islamism ...
We do n't consider this woman a Nazi .
But the way the headscarf is used is comparable to other totalitarian symbols . "
The happiest country in the world , according to one detailed survey of international living standards and public attitudes , Denmark is economically highly successful , with the lowest unemployment in the EU .
For the country 's 200,000 Muslims and immigrants , however , that happiness is increasingly somewhere else .
By virtue of the DFP 's influence on the centre - right government , Denmark has enacted the tightest anti-immigration legislation in Europe in recent years .
Many Danes married to foreigners now commute into Copenhagen every day from the southern Swedish town of Malmo across the bridge linking the two cities because they cannot obtain residence for their spouses at home .
Ms Abdol - Hamid , who shares a one - room council flat with one of her six sisters in the " ghetto " of Vollsmose , in the town of Odense , says her political mission is to fight for this underclass .
" This is such a rich country .
But we have people in Denmark in deep poverty and nobody helps them .
For me the welfare system is very close to Islam .
But we need to change the government . "
But conservative Muslim leaders are also disapproving of her activism .
" Some Muslims do n't think it 's right for a female to act like this .
They go to my father and tell him , get her married , get her married , " she laughs .
" Others think you can't be Muslim and Danish at the same time .
Some of the Muslims and the extreme right are just the same .
" And there are women in my party who say that anyone who wears the headscarf is oppressed .
It 's like they think I 'm dumb .
They 're taking away my individuality .
We need the right to choose .
It 's up to us whether or not we wear headscarves .
" They think I 'm a woman from the Middle East .
No. I'm a Danish Muslim . "

MTV have n't had a change of heart since Billy Bragg pointed out their wide - ranging rights granted when people upload their videos to help them fill out time on MTV Flux .
Indeed , judging by the Technology Guardian report today , they really do n't understand what all the fuss is about :
" I do n't think our Ts & Cs are any more strict than anyone else 's out there , " says Nayeem Syed , vice president of legal for MTV Networks UK & Ireland .
When pushed , Syed admits people who upload to MTV Flux forfeit payment and relinquish their rights " in perpetuity " .
That is , forever .
Removing your content does n't revoke MTV 's right to use it .
Which is fairly strict , when you stop to think about it .
But MTV says you do n't need to worry about that , because you can trust it :
MTV does n't plan to be quite so tough as its terms allow .
It does identify content creators , and if you leave MTV Flux , you need only give MTV seven days ' notice , as content might have been scheduled to air on an MTV TV channel or mobile service .
But while that 's slightly better , it still means that MTV will have the right to happily pad out their programming with your content , sell advertising off the back of it , worldwide , and forever , without you ever seeing a penny .
More importantly , while it 's fine for MTV to say it wo n't use the full force of its legal rights under these terms and conditions , the rights are still there .
So , if MTV is sold to someone else , or suddenly became in some way evil , their vague promises not to use the material or keep perpetual rights wo n't mean a thing .
" We want to make sure we have the rights we need and we are also trying to future proof them for stuff we do n't know about yet , but we are not the bad guys , " says Syed .
This is n't about if MTV is currently evil - and just because it 's part of a multinational corporation does n't mean it is , you know - but about the land - grab implicit in their terms and conditions , and what that would mean if they were suddenly replaced by bad guys .
It 's a rubbish deal , and that 's what the problem is , Syed .
His colleague makes matters worse by holding out an even vaguer promise that you should n't worry about losing your rights on the videos you upload , as they might make you a star :
" We are trying to raise the bar on UGC , taking our 25 years ' experience in television and music TV and tying the UGC clips together with real music videos to make more interesting television , " says Angel Gambino , vice president of digital media for MTV Networks UK & Ireland .
" We 'd like to get to the stage where we can commission content from people and pay them directly . "
But Gambino is clear that it is MTV 's decision when and if the company decides to commission someone to make content .
" We wo n't change our T's & C's , but we could contact those people directly and enter into a separate negotiation with them . "
Apart from the vaguely insulting suggestion that videos being uploaded to UGC ( user - generated content ) sites is pretty shit right now , and lacking the high production values of MTV , is there anything more hollow than this ?
Dangling the vague chance of some cash at some time in the future , if the clips come up to some undefined standard .
But if the content is that poor , why does MTV want to claim all rights to it ?
There 's another interesting little feature tucked away in those terms and conditions , which is equally worrying :
You must ensure that nothing in your Material infringes any trade mark or copyright or otherwise violates anyone 's right of privacy or publicity , or contains anything that is defamatory or offensive .[...]
You agree to indemnify and hold MTVNE harmless from any claims , suits , losses ( whether foreseeable or not ) , damages and expenses ( including reasonable legal fees ) that arise from any breach of these Submission Conditions regarding your Material .
MTV could fairly argue that this is a standard clause for this sort of relationship , but what does it mean ?
If you make a knockabout video which contains an inadvertent libel , or something offensive , for example , and sent it to Channel 4 , they'd have their legal team look at it before they aired it .
Presumably MTV would do the same .
But what if their lawyers made a slip or waved it through , or the clip aired by mistake ?
MTV have a bit of form for airing things by mistake - bungling a caption with the word " fuckers " on MTV Dance during an afternoon in November 2003 ; slipping up and putting out an unedited Dirty Sanchez on its Polish service while children were watching in April 2004 ; MTV Dance wobbling ( again ) and airing a show intended for late - night viewing during an afternoon one May ; full - frontal daytime nudity on MTV Hits and a MTV2 " fuck " at 10 am in the morning and ... well , you get the drift .
MTV sometimes makes mistakes and broadcasts things other than it was expecting to be broadcasting .
All TV networks , no matter how well run , can sometimes slip .
However , if it does that in the future , with something you 've uploaded unders its terms and conditions , it can pass the buck to you - because you 've agreed to take the full heat for anything in your video which is " offensive " or libellious .
This is potentially worse than you might think at first - because it does n't just mean they 'll tell the lawyers to sue you instead of them ; it means that if they get sued , they can pass the full value of a judgement against them or out - of - court settlement against them , onto you .
What this could mean is that you could mount a full and successful legal defence of an alleged libel in a video you made and MTV showed , even having costs awarded against the person who has sued you , but still end up having to fork out because MTV could have settled separately , out of court ; a settlement you have agreed to underwrite .
Sounds far - fetched ?
The New Statesman was nearly made bankrupt when John Major sued not just the magazine for mentioning Westminster gossip about an alleged affair , but also John Menzies and WH Smiths , the companies which distributed the magazine .
Because the distributors had an agreement that the Statesman would cover any costs incurred as a result of content in their title , they were happy to settle with Major , promptly , out of court .
And why not ?
They were n't going to have to pay the money out ; they knew the magazine would have to pick up the bill .
So , regardless of the rights and wrongs of the magazine 's case , the Statesman was lumbered with paying out a huge sum .
It 's surprising how generously one will settle out - of - court when one does n't have to write the cheque .
We do n't imagine that MTV has drafted these terms and conditions with the intention of leaving some bloke with having to pay a multi-million dollar FCC fine if it uses a clip with his girlfriend 's nipple in it on CBS one evening .
However , the potential for such a scenario is built - in to what it 's asking people to sign - up to when they poke a video into its system .
You might want to think if you want to make a deal where you 're never going to see any penny from a video that does well , but could , in extremis , find yourself having to pay out unlimited sums for a video that goes wrong .
