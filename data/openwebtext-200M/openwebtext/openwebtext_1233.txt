Some of you may know that I am an aficionado of American political rhetoric .
There was a time in this country where speeches actually made a difference in politics and policy , and the great orators were known to sway voters , members of Congress , prince , potentate , and history itself with their thundering orations .
Think Patrick Henry .
Think Lincoln at Gettysburg , or Bryan ’s “ Cross of Gold ” speech that catapulted him to the Democratic nomination for president .
Think of FDR throwing down the gauntlet of war to the mighty Japanese empire .
Think of a smallish man addressing half a million souls in front of the Great Emancipator ’s statue , and demanding that his dream of racial equality become a reality .
Those days are gone now .
Reagan briefly revived the spoken word as a powerful weapon for the presidency .
But his successors have been decidedly lacking in the consistent application of political rhetoric to dramatically alter the status quo .
It ’s not their fault .
None were of a political tradition that prized the spoken word over the soundbite culture of political communication that arose in the last quarter of the 20th century .
Except in times of national tragedy .
Here , where man , moment , and the spoken word all combined to lift us up , to assuage our grief , and to restore the American spirit , each of Reagan ’s successor ’s rose to the occasion in their own way , performing magnificently on the largest of stages .
Clinton ’s speech at Oklahoma City was agonizingly good - a personal , elevated remembrance and national pep talk all in one .
Bush at Washington Cathedral and in front of a joint session of Congress after 9/11 ( I liked his Cathedral speech a lot better ) , overcame his limitations as a communicator and achieved heights of rhetorical and stylistic splendor he was never to reach again .
President Obama ’s magnificently delivered , marvelously written , heartfelt speech at Fort Hood yesterday was , to my mind , the best piece of American political rhetoric since Reagan ’s Challenger address in the aftermath of that tragedy .
It was by far and away the best speech he ’s given as president , and it bests two other superior efforts of his that preceded his election ; his keynote address to the 2004 Democratic convention , and his speech on race in Philadelphia during the campaign .
Technically , the speech was extremely well crafted .
Reading it , you are struck by its humble simplicity , it ’s logical progression , its smooth , effortless transitions , and soaring peroration .
We do n’t know enough about the president to see his imprint on the written words .
But by the way he imbued the speech with his living spirit , you could tell that even if he did n’t have much of a hand in writing it , he was feeling it intensely .
There has been much criticism on the right for it ’s tone of “ political correctness ” in not mentioning the word “ terrorism ” or “ jihad . ”
I understand where my fellow righties are coming from , but I think they are a little off base .
This was not a time for a call to action ; it was a time to grieve .
The president walked right up to saying the “ T ” word and , while he did n’t say it , everyone knew what he was talking about :
It may be hard to comprehend the twisted logic that led to this tragedy .
But this much we do know - no faith justifies these murderous and craven acts ; no just and loving God looks upon them with favor .
And for what he has done , we know that the killer will be met with justice - in this world , and the next .
These are trying times for our country .
In Afghanistan and Pakistan , the same extremists who killed nearly 3,000 Americans continue to endanger America , our allies , and innocent Afghans and Pakistanis .
In Iraq , we are working to bring a war to a successful end , as there are still those who would deny the Iraqi people the future that Americans and Iraqis have sacrificed so much for .
We had a discussion on the debate over how to define Hasan ’s act last night on my radio show .
Yes , I believe the government is overly sensitive to offending Muslim sensitivities , and it is possible that the military paid for this walking on eggshells attitude when they ignored Hasan ’s obvious radicalism .
But calling the shooter a “ terrorist ” animated by radical Islam to carry out jihad against those who he perceived to be an enemy would n’t have helped the families in their grief nor would it have said anything profound to the nation .
Obama rightly said that there was no justification - religious or otherwise - for the shooting .
In this venue , it was exactly the right thing to say and I believe it a little bit of a stretch to criticize him for not going farther .
There may be a time for criticism as more becomes known about what our government knew about this killer and why they did nothing to deal with him .
But that time was not yesterday .
Not discussed very much as far as I can tell is the overall theme of the president ’s address ; that this generation is second to none as it relates to self - sacrificing service to our country .
The president expertly connected each of the dead - reading their names and giving a short snippet of personality to go along with the identification of the fallen - to this idea that these were among the best of their generation :
As we face these challenges , the stories of those at Fort Hood reaffirm the core values that we are fighting for , and the strength that we must draw upon .
Theirs are tales of American men and women answering an extraordinary call - the call to serve their comrades , their communities , and their country .
In an age of selfishness , they embody responsibility .
In an era of division , they call upon us to come together .
In a time of cynicism , they remind us of who we are as Americans .
We are a nation that endures because of the courage of those who defend it .
We saw that valor in those who braved bullets here at Fort Hood , just as surely as we see it in those who signed up knowing that they would serve in harm ’s way .
Again and again , the president returns to this theme , and connects those who served in the past with our present day heroes :
For history is filled with heroes .
You may remember the stories of a grandfather who marched across Europe ; an uncle who fought in Vietnam ; a sister who served in the Gulf .
But as we honor the many generations who have served , I think all of us - every single American - must acknowledge that this generation has more than proved itself the equal of those who have come before .
We need not look to the past for greatness , because it is before our very eyes .
This generation of soldiers , sailors , airmen , Marines and Coast Guardsmen have volunteered in a time of certain danger .
They are part of the finest fighting force that the world has ever known .
They have served tour after tour of duty in distant , different and difficult places .
They have stood watch in blinding deserts and on snowy mountains .
They have extended the opportunity of self - government to peoples that have suffered tyranny and war .
They are man and woman ; white , black , and brown ; of all faiths and stations - all Americans , serving together to protect our people , while giving others half a world away the chance to lead a better life .
Absolutely translucent rhetoric , delivered in Obama ’s inimical , well modulated voice with expert phrasing .
Many a good speech has crashed on the shoals of a bad peroration .
It is said that Edward Everett ’s 2 hour memorial speech that preceded Lincoln ’s at Gettysburg suffered from a weak , and forgettable climax .
I do n’t see it myself and it ’s hard for us who are unfamiliar with 19th century rhetoric to critique such things intelligently .
But when Obama reached his own high point yesterday , you heard echoes of John Kennedy and Martin Luther King :
Here , at Fort Hood , we pay tribute to thirteen men and women who were not able to escape the horror of war , even in the comfort of home .
Later today , at Fort Lewis , one community will gather to remember so many in one Stryker Brigade who have fallen in Afghanistan .
Long after they are laid to rest - when the fighting has finished , and our nation has endured ; when today ’s servicemen and women are veterans , and their children have grown - it will be said of this generation that they believed under the most trying of tests ; that they persevered not just when it was easy , but when it was hard ; and that they paid the price and bore the burden to secure this nation , and stood up for the values that live in the hearts of all free peoples .
So we say goodbye to those who now belong to eternity .
We press ahead in pursuit of the peace that guided their service .
May
God bless the memory of those we lost .
And may God bless the United States of America .
It does n’t beat , “ … slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of God , ” but then , those were n’t Reagan ’s words anyway .
Nevertheless , the same “ mystic chords of memory ” are elicited in both speeches .
It was n’t until I both saw and read the speech that it hit me ; it is the first major address that Obama has given where he did not try to cycle the moment back to himself with the use of personal pronouns - a rather jarring habit of Obama ’s that subtracts from what he is trying to say .
In total , this was a triumph for the president .
The moment , the venue , and the words all came together in what will certainly be remembered as the best speech of this young century .
Travel Hacking for Noobs : How We Save Hundreds on Airfare , Get Free Lodging , & Make Money Overseas
Tweet
Advanced travel hacking is an art form .
I have no doubts about that .
But , contrary to popular belief , getting started is actually quite simple .
So easy even a toddler could do it .
Literally .
But I ’ll share a little secret with you … it ’s not as glamorous as most people think .
At least not for us .
We certainly are n’t professional travel hackers .
We are n’t the family you hear in those stories about traveling Southeast Asia for a year on only $ 127 dollars .
I speak only 1 language ( Courtney speaks 2 ) .
And we have nowhere close to 676,583 frequent flier miles like Chris Guillebeau .
We are n’t total noobs , though .
We ’ve had an in - your - face crash course over the last year and learned a ton .
I ’m convinced that 80 % of travel hacking is just opening your mind to possibilities you did n’t know existed .
I just made that statistic up on the spot … but I ’m fairly sure other intense travelers will agree .
Anyway , here are some tips and tricks to take you from naysayer to noob in as short of time frame as possible .
Once you graduate to advanced ( or if you are already there ) , I ’d appreciate you teaching me everything you know in the comments below !
How We Find Airfare : A Video Walkthrough of How to Save $ 521 +
The video below is just over 20 minutes long .
In it I detail the basic process we use when trying to tackle a potential flight from scratch using a theoretical example .
If you ’re an airfare noob ( someone who only uses the Priceline.com ) , I really think you ’ll find value in it :

GrabASeat.co.nz is a great on for New Zealand .
( Certain flights for $ 1 every day )
Other suggestions I ’ve learned when booking airfare :
Always call the airline direct before purchasing online .
In rare cases , they actually have better deals ( we have to do this anyway most of the time with an infant ) .

The more flexible you are willing to be , the more money you can save .
Look at flying on different days of the week .
Or staying an extra day in a connecting ‘ hub ’ in order to take advantage of a huge drop in flight prices .

Search all airports for a city or destination .
For us , Chicago , Melbourne , and Brisbane / Gold Coast are all places where we ’ve found deals at separate airports in the same area .

Be willing to take bumps if offered .
On our Honeymoon , Courtney and I purposely gave ourselves room to take flight bumps if needed .
On the way home , we took one that resulted in free flights , meal vouchers , free overnight hotel , and a direct flight the next day ( when our original flight had another connection left ) .
It was awesome !
Even under my current system , I know this is just the very tip of the iceberg .
There is much more that Courtney and I could be doing in this area .
For example , we are not taking nearly as big of advantage of frequent flier miles as we could be .
I did n’t realize just how bad we were , until I was blown away by Chris Guillebeau ’s new Frequent Flyer Master eBook .
It ’s actually embarrassing how much money we ’ve left on the table from not doing very simple things .
I ’ll provide more info on this at the bottom of the article for those interested .
Couchsurfing , Hostels , & Wwoofing … Oh My !
Another area where Courtney and I have been able to save a lot of money has been in accommodation .
( Well , at least until we rented the apartment ) .
First , we ’ve fully shot - gunned the Couchsurfing kool - aid .
When we first arrived , we were very skeptical .
We had n’t planned on using the service , although we had heard great things .
But after our first experience with it , we were blown away .
For any of you that do n’t know , CouchSurfing.com is essentially a social networking site for travelers and people willing to host travelers .
Think of it as a Facebook for backpackers and world travelers .
I wrote an extensive article covering the basics of CouchSurfing over at Get Rich Slowly .
If you want more information check out my thoughts there .
I ’ve also written here on our amazing experiences with our hosts in Townsville , AUS and Auckland , NZ .
The value of Couchsurfing extends far , far beyond a free place to sleep .
Our hosts have provided many of our most memorable moments and saved us hundreds of dollars with their recommendations , expertise , and knowledge of the local area .
Here are my top 5 CouchSurfing tips from the Get Rich Slowly post :
Spend quality time on filling out your profile honestly !
Put up as many pictures as you can !
Utilize the filters when searching for hosts !
Completely read the profile and references of potential hosts !
Reference parts of the host ’s profile when requesting to “ surf ” !
I electorate more specifically on these points in the post , as well .
CouchSurfing is just one of several networks like this .
However , it ’s been the only one we ’ve actually used .
Willing Work On Organic Farms
Wwoofing for short , is a website / community of people who ( in general ) provide a room and meals in exchange for work .
In many cases , this work is on some sort of farm , vineyard , orchard or similar set - up .
However , like CouchSurfing , there is plenty of variety if you search around .
Courtney and I paid for a membership to the New Zealand community and even went as far as to contact several of the opportunities that were listed .
This was our back - up plan if obtaining a sponsored visa was going to carry a longer waiting period .
Through wwoofing we would have been able to stretch our money much further .
Most of the arrangements we contacted involved 5 - 6 hours of work a day for the room and included 3 home cooked meals .
There were places that welcomed families and those that did n’t .
Usually these are longer commitments than say Couchsurfing .
Most last anywhere from a week to several months , which is perfect for extending your trip in places you ’d like to explore more !
Tapping into your social network !
This is another technique that we ’ve used and that I plan on using more and more going forward .
As social networks like Twitter , Facebook , and others continue to rise , the world is growing smaller and smaller .
These days , a simple tweet or posting an update on Facebook can gain lots of feedback .
For example , if you are reading this …
I am in your extended network .
If you wanted to travel to Argentina , Barbados , Japan , India , Ireland or nearly anywhere in the world , I just so happen to know a friendly face who would love to help provide you with information .
Do n’t hesitate to use your social networks or to e-mail me to ask for help when planning an extended trip .
Through friends of friends it ’s easier than ever to get in touch with locals who know the area like the back of their hand .
They might provide an actual place to stay or may know a suggestion for discounted accommodation .
They might be able to tip you off on budget airlines or country specific airfare sites like grabaseat .
co.nz here in New Zealand .
Hostels are n’t just for singles looking to party .
Hostels seem to have bad raps due to movies and popular culture references .
There ’s no doubt in my mind that some of them suck .
Most travelers have been into dirty , noisy hostels ( and stayed in them ) at some point .
But we ’ve also been able to find perfectly reasonable hostels that were clean and free of late night noise .
In our experience , hostels overseas have been much like Motels in the States .
Some you would n’t step foot in , but many are perfectly fine .
Our custom hostel hunting tips from recent experience :
Look for hostels that are n’t right downtown or right on the strip .
The ones a couple blocks away are often less noisy and have fewer of the ‘ party ’ crowd .
The ones a couple blocks away are often less noisy and have fewer of the ‘ party ’ crowd .
Look for smaller , quaint mom-and - pop type hostels .
These often have a bit more pride of ownership than some of the massive discount chains .
We ’ve had some very positive experiences with smaller local hostels .

Walk around the entire hostel .
Check the bathrooms and the kitchen areas and see how clean they are kept .

Look for rooms with fans and / or air conditioners ( non coin operated ) .
With a fan or air conditioner on , you can seriously negate any outside noise ( plus it ’s cooler ) .

With a fan or air conditioner on , you can seriously negate any outside noise ( plus it ’s cooler ) .
Do n’t be afraid to ask for discounted rates or to offer some sort of cleaning and or work in trade for discounts .
In nearly all of the hostels we ’ve stayed a portion of the people in the rooms helped out in some way for a cheaper rate .
Using some of the above tips , we ’ve been able to find very reasonable lodging at great rates .
We ’ve been 100 % comfortable staying in hostels even with a 1 - year old and have experienced no problems ( other than maybe a harder - than - average bed occasionally ) .
House - sitting
We ’ve only had limited experience with this , however it is a realistic option , especially if you can tap into your connections .
Our house - sitting experience came about through CouchSurfing .
A couple that had hosted us was leaving overseas for a month themselves .
It was cheaper for us to stay in the home and take care of their cat than it was for them to pay to board her .
This helped us have a rent - free month while we were awaiting Courtney ’s work permit .
Income On the Road : Visas , Job Hunting , & Freelancing
The last major area we ’ve been able to find limited success is in creating some sort of income while traveling .
This is essential for travel hacking noobs as it can help fund the journey into ‘ elite ’ status .
My biggest advice here is to fully study the visa options upfront .
We ’ve gotten into trouble several times in this category , nearly all of which have been my own personal fault .
If you are young and without dependents , many countries offer a working - holiday arrangement .
It ’s easy to use Google and find out the specific of your target destinations .
It ’s common to be able to use this visa for up to a year and many of the countries require you to work for no longer than 6 months at any single job .
This is great if you have experience waiting tables , bartending , cleaning , or any other commonly needed skill .
Even in this ‘ horrible global economy ’ there seems to be an overwhelming amount of opportunities in every city we ’ve encountered for this type of basic work .
In our case , Milligan disqualifies us from obtaining this sort of easy working option .
Even so , Courtney was able to obtain find a school willing to sponsor her to teach here in New Zealand .
She even qualified for a $ 2000 NZD relocation grant to help with expenses .
This was a fairly intensive process and we made a lot of mistakes , but have proven it ’s very possible .
If you have a marketable degree , you can bump into all sorts of opportunities while traveling .
Freelance
This !
Another popular option for travel hackers is to do freelance work .
This can be in a variety of areas , including writing , blogging , graphic design , consulting , and data entry .
Until recently , I would n’t have considered this a viable possibility .
But in a short amount of time , I ’ve been able to build up the ability to generate $ 2000 - $ 2500 per month in freelance income if I were to devote myself full - time to freelancing .
That ’s not in the cards right now for me , however it ’s a great back - up plan for traveling in cheap countries .
But you do n’t have to be a formal writer to freelance even in the blogging world .
Prior to march , I had n’t written anything .
I ’d never been exposed to blogging or even consider writing as a hobby or career .
My point is that many of these fields are very easy to get into it .
For starters , you can search some of the most popular job posting sites for online writers :
Of course , writing is just one example .
Many people have some sort of skill they can market online if they are willing to spend the time researching all of the emerging possibilities !
Other Travel Tips We ’ve Experience First - Hand
Stop buying stupid trinkets .
Seriously , 99 % of souvenirs are an absolute waste .
If you must buy something on your trip , make it functional .
Buying unique clothes , for example , is something that will provide a memory , but also give direct value .
Also , you can consider buying travel gear you are sure to use , such as a handy flashlight , water canteen , a sturdy watch , etc …
Other than those things , just take pictures .
The pictures will end up being your most valuable asset .
So take all the money you say from buying useless crap and get a decent camera !

Pack as light as possible !
Once you ’ve packed light , throw out half of what you ’ve packed and you should be ready .
Everyone I know that travels points out that they started with too much stuff .
I know we did , even though it seemed like we brought nothing .
Light packing can save you direct money on items like baggage fees , but the real value is in the time and stress it saves you .
When in doubt , just buy it when you get there .
Chances are you wo n’t need it anyway .

Consider Public Transportation .
You do n’t have to rent a car everywhere you go .
For long - term travel sometimes this can be a bigger burden than benefit .
We had a great bus trip ( up until the last 15 minutes ) from Cairns to Townsville down Australia ’s eastern coast .
I ’ve had friends report having a blast taking the rail through Europe instead of renting a car or hoping on and off planes .
It ’s a great way to travel slowly , save money ( most of the time ) , and see different parts of the country .
Obviously , you have to use common sense and sometimes a car is the best option .
Just make sure you are open to multiple avenues of getting around .
Chris Guillebeau ’s Frequent Flyer Master Endorsement
Let me just say this …
I had no idea how deep the rabbit hole really went on this frequent flyer stuff .
For example :
Chris went to get a free hair - loss consultation because there was a 20,000 bonus miles promotion just for showing up .
( Haha )
just for showing up .
( Haha )

How to get 10 k miles just for graduating college ( C’mon Courtney ! )
just for graduating college ( C’mon Courtney ! )
The costs that you do incur even with ‘ free ’ trips and how to minimize them
And the best and worst programs for collecting miles .
Chris names names .
But , my personal favorite was the name of the bank that actually has a DEBIT card that earns miles .
Woot !
Woot !
I ’m personally checking into this local bank next week .
As always you get a full e-book , a 20 - minute audio , a 4 - page Priceline specific guide and month ’s worth of continual updates on new changes in 2010 as they emerge .
Most importantly , Chris has gotten pretty bold this time .
He has guaranteed that you will earn at least 25,000 air miles in the first 90 days with the guide , which is enough for one free domestic flight .
If you do n’t earn the free flight in the first 3 - months , just ask for a refund .
Like I said … a bold offer .
What about you ?
At what stage of the travel hacking journey are you ?
Are you a bonafide travel ninja or just another noob getting started ?
What are your top tips for saving money while on the road ?
What about making money ?
I ’m looking forward on taking your tips and taking my game to the next level !
CHRIS Rumble sighed loudly as Warren McGaw slipped a heavily jewelled ring onto his wedding finger .
'' Blingy , like our personalities , '' Mr Rumble said .
The men participated in Australia 's first legally recognised civil ceremony in Canberra yesterday , paving the way for other gay and lesbian couples to have their partnerships validated outside the functionality of a registry office .

'' Finally we 're equal and we 're not treated as second - class citizens , '' Mr Rumble , a 38 - year - old real estate agent , said .
The pair met at a pub , just as New Year 's Eve , 1989 , ticked over into the '90s .
Fresh from studying in Paris , Mr Rumble decided barely an hour into the new year that Mr McGaw , a gym instructor from a wool station in Goulburn , was the man for him .
SANTA ANA – A play depicting Jesus as a gay man played to an appreciative audience in a packed church sanctuary tonight while a handful of protesters outside called it blasphemous .
<– Click on the photo at left or the photo tab above to view more pictures .
It was the second showing of “ Corpus Christi ” in Orange County in about two years .
The show sparked protests and bomb threats at its 1998 opening at the Manhattan Theatre Club in New York .
The play depicts Jesus as a gay man living in 1950s Corpus Christi , Texas , playwright Terrence McNally ’s hometown .
The cast of 13 portray Jesus and the 12 Apostles .
The Church of the Foothills in Santa Ana received hate calls and letters in the past few days since media publicity of the performance .
Pastor Michael Holland said about 20 e-mails , about the same number of telephone calls , including one Saturday from a man claiming to be a priest from Ireland , and four or five letters denounced the performance .
There was also an e-mail from a local couple with a gay son who thanked the church for hosting the show .
“ That ’s why we ’re doing this , ” Holland said , “ for all those families out there who do n’t feel accepted .
The Bible does not condemn homosexuality as an orientation , it condemns certain homoerotic acts which had nothing to do with people being in love , like we ’re doing today . ”
During the last scene of the play , the actors light a final candle together and exit the stage , leaving the audience with the image of a single flame .
Outside the church , before the play was to start shortly after 7 p.m. , Todd Jernigan , a construction worker from Tustin , joined about three other protesters , calling what was taking place inside an “ abomination . ”
Depicting Jesus as gay , he said , “ is the biggest disgrace there is . ”
Don Stewart of Riverside got on a bullhorn and shouted at those going into the performance : “ Why did God destroy Sodom and Gomorrah ?
Can anyone in that church come out and explain it to me in God ’s words ? ”
Stewart , an electrical contractor who described himself as belonging to a community of street preachers , accused the church ’s pastor of teaching a faulty doctrine “ that ’s going to lead them to hell . ”
Pastor Holland said the protesters were misinformed .
“ Jesus was about love and inclusion and affirming people as children of God , and that ’s what we ’re doing tonight , ” he said , adding that the publicity preceding the performance had been a mixed blessing .
Two years ago , a production of the play at Chapman University did not happen because of a scheduling conflict .
The play instead took place at the First Christian Church of Orange Disciples of Christ , Holland said .
There was no publicity surrounding the play then , so it did not generate any controversy , he said .
Tonight , 250 packed the Church of the Foothill ’s sanctuary for the show .
Among them was Claire Richardson , a graduate of the Pacific School of Religion in Berkeley , who said she wants to be an ordained minister in Disciples of Christ faith community .
“ I support art and I support interpreting the Bible for oneself , ” said Richardson , who attended with her parents from Orange .
The Church of the Foothills in the past has hosted same - sex marriage rallies and held the first same - sex wedding in the Tustin area in June .
The one - night showing of “ Corpus Christi ” was performed by Los Angeles - based 108 Productions .
Proceeds benefit the church and a documentary on “ Corpus Christi ” by 108 Productions .
The group plans to take the show to Corpus Christi , Texas , next year .

The report , to be published later this year , has reportedly found that heavy mobile use is linked to brain tumours .
The survey of 12,800 people in 13 countries has been overseen by the World Health Organisation .
Preliminary results of the inquiry , which is looking at whether mobile phone exposure is linked to three types of brain tumour and a tumour of the salivary gland , have been sent to a scientific journal .
The findings are expected to put pressure on the British Government – which has insisted that mobile phones are safe – to issue stronger warnings to users .

Society can be judged as much by what it abandons as by what it builds .
If one hears ghostlike murmurs while looking through Christopher Payne ‘s photographs in “ Asylum : Inside the Closed World of State Mental Hospitals , ” it may be because the people who once occupied these imposing and forbidding places are still among us .
But they no longer dwell within the fortresses — or were they sanctuaries ?
— into which Mr. Payne now guides the reader .
“ One must not be too romantic about madness , or the madhouses in which the insane were confined , ” the neurologist Oliver Sacks wrote in his introduction to Mr. Payne ’s book , published in September by the M.I.T.
Press .
He added , however , that Mr. Payne ’s pictures “ evoke for me not only the tumultuous life of such places , but the protected and special atmosphere they offered . ”
Mr. Payne , 41 , lives in Brooklyn .
He is both an architect and a photographer .
His romance with America ’s jettisoned architectural patrimony was evident in “ New York ’s Forgotten Substations : The Power Behind the Subway , ” published by the Princeton Architectural Press in 2002 .
That year , he began what would become a six - year , 30 - state tour of more than 70 hospitals , many of them still functioning , though at a fraction of their capacity .
He was surprised to find little resistance to his project from the administrators and workers at the hospitals , who were instead proud of their institutions ’ history and eager to see it documented .
His affection — for surely it is affection that permits Mr. Payne to photograph architecture so intimately — must have impressed them .
They literally opened doors for him .
Mr. Payne shared a few examples with Lens .
For instance , he described the abandoned autopsy theater at St. Elizabeth ’s Hospital in Washington ( Slide 1 ) :
St. Elizabeth ’s is still in operation , therefore requiring an escort at all times .
As we toured these spaces and grounds , the guard realized I was n’t finding anything that interested me .
He stopped , scratched his chin and said with a slight smile , “ I think I know what you ’ll like . ”
He unlocked a door and I stood frozen , gazing on the autopsy theater .
Everything remained intact , with log books and autopsy jars neatly arranged in rows on shelves .
The lights and morgue freezer still worked .
Another abandoned space within a functioning institution was to be found at the Kankakee State Hospital in Illinois ( Slide 3 ) , one of many structures laid out along the lines prescribed in the 19th century by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride .
These were typically a long series of linked pavilions , arranged symmetrically in a shallow V , at the juncture of which was the administrative building .
As hospitals downsized , it was not uncommon to abandon the outer wards on the top floors , while still occupying the lower floors .
Such is the case with Kankakee , one of the few “ Kirkbrides ” still in use as a psychiatric facility .
I made a special trip just to see this place , a long drive from New York to Illinois , and did n’t know what to expect .
On the phone , the director said no one had been up to the top floors for years , but added that the wards were “ unrenovated ” and typical of what the older ones once looked like .
The gamble paid off .
This ward is unique for its vaulted ceiling and unusually wide , solid wooden doors to the patient bedrooms .
What distinguishes Mr. Payne ’s work is not only his knowing documentation of architectural features but his eye for the telling human detail .
He found one such moment at the Hudson River State Hospital in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. ( Slide 2 ) .
So I was perusing YouTube in search of G.I Joe toy commercials for my 8 - year old son and I to watch .
See , he ’s not that big into army men , and really does n’t have too firm a grasp ( a ‘ Kung - Fu ’ grip , if you will ) on what a G.I Joe is ( oh , do n’t worry , he loves Batman , Castle Knights , and Transformers , lest you think less of the boy ) other than a mention or two or seeing a few in the toy store .
Anyway , I told him that these toy soldiers represented the cornerstone of roughly three full years of my childhood and he wanted to see what the big deal was .
So , there we were eyeing old ads when he spotted a link to an 80 ’s Transformer commercial for the toys and wanted to see it .
I clicked , we watched , and we both just lost it when the kid appears in the half - way point mouthing , “ ROBOTS IN DISGUISE ” .
The kid was so creepy and so stunning that we had to go on a new pilgrimage to ferret out any more ads like it .
Oh , and were there .
And so the list idea was born .
Each one of these features a different kid prominently in the commercial showing off his Demonic eyes and ravenous , Chicklet - like teeth wailing the above mentioned line .
Laugh along , wo n’t you ?
It ’s fun !

Matt Wieters was one of the most anticipated players heading into 2009 , with fantasy owners waiting with bated breath for him to make his presence felt .
Of course , the results fell short of the lofty expectations , being kept in the minors until May 29 before being recalled and posting the following line :
354 At Bats
. 288 Batting Average ( 102 Hits )
9 Home Runs
43 RBI
35 Runs
0 Stolen Bases
. 340 On Base Percentage
. 412 Slugging Percentage
.359 Batting Average on Balls in Play
With those numbers in the book and the talent still prevalent , what can we expect from him in 2010 ?
Before I get into my projections , please keep in mind that these are extremely preliminary numbers .
I will be adjusting them throughout the offseason , depending on multiple factors .
The Average :
While everyone wants to point to his minor league career average of .341 and expect him to be able to repeat that in the major leagues , there are definitive red flags .
That ’s not to say that he is not going to be able to hit for a solid average in 2010 , but I would not enter the season expecting him to post numbers reasonably close to that .
His minor league average came courtesy of a BABIP of .375 , a completely unrealistic number .
While he was able to post a similarly high number last season at the major league level , it is just ill - advised to be expected to continue .
Only one catcher ( Joe Mauer ) with more than 450 at bats last season had a BABIP of .329 or better .
Secondly , the strikeout rate .
When you look at his 2009 campaign and see 24.3 % rate compared to his 18.43 % minor league career mark , it is easy to scream aberration .
Unfortunately , at two of his career minor league stops , he was above 20 % , including a 21.3 % mark in 141 Triple - A at bats .
While he should improve a bit , a decrease in luck and that many strikeouts is going to make it nearly impossible to maintain an elite level average .
The Power :
Last season he posted nine home runs , courtesy of a flyball rate of nearly 40 % .
That was slightly higher than his minor league career mark of 34.2 % , but at 23 - years old , it is not unreasonable to consider that he could be adding power to his repertoire .
With a HR / FB rate of 8.4 % , there certainly is room for him to continue to grow and hit the long ball .
While I would n’t expect an explosion to the 30 HR mark , breaking the 20 HR barrier is quite likely .
Run Production :
It ’s really too early to tell how the Orioles line - up is going to be built and where he is going to fit into the mix .
Catchers and runs scored , however , are not terms that are synonymous with each other .
As long as he can get into the 65 - 70 range , which he should , he is not going to be a hindrance to your team there .
As far as RBI goes , he proved last season that he has the ability when given the opportunity .
He ’s going to be an asset here , with just six catchers exceeding 80 RBI in 2009 .
That ’s right around the area I ’d expect him to reach , especially if he finds himself in the fifth or sixth hole in the line - up .
The Projection :
.280 ( 147-525 ) , 20 HR , 85 RBI , 70 R , 0 SB , .322 BABIP , .353 OBP , .463 SLG
Parting Thoughts :
I ’m sure these numbers are little bit more conservative than many would like to see , but you have to be a little cautious with Wieters .
It ’s not that he does n’t have the talent , because we all know he does , but there are some warning signs that he has to prove he can overcome before you should expect elite numbers .
As it is , these projections likely would put him among the Top 7 catchers in the league , which goes along with expectations .
What do you think of these early projections ?
Are they reasonable ?
Are you expecting significantly better or worse numbers ?

Michael Moorcock edited the Tarzan Adventures and Sexton Blake Library in the 1950s
The BBC is in talks with the fantasy author Michael Moorcock to write a Doctor Who novel , it has confirmed .
Moorcock , who has written dozens of books including the Elric of Melnibone novels , said on his website that the Doctor Who book would appear in 2010 .
" Looks like it 's official , " he said .
" I 'll be doing a new Doctor Who novel ( not a tie - in ) for appearance , I understand , by next Christmas . "
A BBC Worldwide spokesman said that nothing had yet been signed .
Moorcock said : " Still have to have talks etc with producers and publishers , but we should be signing shortly .
Should be fun . "
The 69 - year - old author is also known for his regular collaborations over several decades with the space rock band Hawkwind , and his own musical project The Deep Fix .
" BBC books approached my agent , " Moorcock revealed on his website forum .
" I did n't realise David T[ennant ] was , as it were , still the Dr [ sic ] .
I thought the new ones were already showing . "
Original novel Writer Richard Curtis is penning an episode for Matt Smith 's new Doctor Tennant has played the Doctor for the past five years but announced last year he was leaving .
He will be replaced by actor Matt Smith next year .
One Moorcock fan posted the question : " If it gets adapted to TV or film , will there be a Hawkwind / The Deep Fix cover of the theme music ? "
Moorcock also said he had watched the BBC show since it began in 1963 .
" Have n't liked all the Doctors and after Peter Davison stopped watching regularly until the new BBC Wales series .
" Since the Tom Baker series , a lot of my ideas crept into the stories and so in many ways I 'll be writing a story which already echoes my own work . "
He added : " I do have to submit it to editors so they can make sure it fits into the canon and this , of course , is understandable .
By saying it was n't a tie - in I did , of course , mean that it would be an original novel , not one which was linked to previous stories . "
In September , film director and Blackadder creator Richard Curtis revealed that he would write an episode of the new series of Doctor Who in 2010 .
The 52 - year - old is better known for romantic comedies like Four Weddings And A Funeral than for science fiction .

A federal judge ruled late Tuesday that the government can continue to gag an internet servicer provider who received a National Security Letter from the FBI — five years ago .
Under the Patriot Act , the FBI can use such letters to demand personal records about customers from internet providers , financial institutions and credit card companies without a warrant , and then keep the companies from disclosing even that they ’d received such a letter .
ADVERTISEMENT
The ruling came in a lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union and the New York Civil Liberties Union on behalf of the ISP .
The government maintains that revealing information about the letter could compromise ongoing investigations , even though the letter itself was sent five years ago and has been the subject of press accounts .
“ We ’re deeply disappointed that the court ruled that the FBI can continue to gag our John Doe client , who has been silenced for more than five years , ” Melissa Goodman , staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project , said in a release .
“ This gag – which we continue to believe is unnecessary and unconstitutional – has prohibited Doe from participating in the public debate about the Patriot Act and has been used to suppress key information about the FBI ’s misuse of NSLs .
The FBI ’s overuse of the NSL gag power has allowed the FBI to manipulate the surveillance debate and to deprive Congress and the public of crucial information that would inform the ongoing congressional debate about this intrusive surveillance power . ”
The court also ruled that the FBI can continue to suppress an “ attachment ” to the NSL Doe received , the ACLU said .
The ACLU “ argued that the attachment , if disclosed , would show that the FBI tried to obtain records that it was not entitled to obtain under the NSL statute . ”
The ACLU is prevented under the order from even disclosing their client ’s identity .
“ The FBI continues to maintain the gag order even though the underlying investigation is more than five years old and even though the FBI abandoned its demand for records from the ISP over two years ago , ” the ACLU said .
ADVERTISEMENT
“ In December 2008 , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that parts of the NSL statute ’s gag provisions were unconstitutional , specifically the sections that wrongly placed the burden on NSL recipients to challenge gag orders , narrowly limited judicial review of gag orders and required courts to defer entirely to the executive branch , ” they continued .
“ The court of appeals sent the case back to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and ordered the government to justify the constitutionality of the gag on Doe .
In June 2009 , the government submitted its justification for the gag on Doe entirely in secret , in a classified declaration that even Doe ’s ACLU attorneys could n’t see .
While the district court ordered the government to produce an unclassified summary , most of the evidence used to justify the continued gag on the ISP remains a secret . ”
“ Continuing to impose a blanket gag order on our Doe client places a serious burden on his First Amendment rights .
It is important that NSL recipients – those with first - hand knowledge of the FBI ’s actual use and abuse of its NSL power – be allowed to speak out , ” Larry Schwartztol , a staff attorney with the ACLU National Security Project , said in a statement .
Wired notes that the ISP ’s president wrote an anonymous letter to the Washington Post in 2007 .
In it , he wrote :
ADVERTISEMENT
“ Three years ago , I received a national security letter ( NSL ) in my capacity as the president of a small Internet access and consulting business .
The letter ordered me to provide sensitive information about one of my clients .
There was no indication that a judge had reviewed or approved the letter , and it turned out that none had .
The letter came with a gag provision that prohibited me from telling anyone , including my client , that the FBI was seeking this information .
Based on the context of the demand — a context that the FBI still wo n’t let me discuss publicly — I suspected that the FBI was abusing its power and that the letter sought information to which the FBI was not entitled . ”
The ruling is available online here .

Supercomputer maker Cray today announced a reseller agreement with number two PC and server maker ( in terms of shipments )
Dell , which will see the latter company resell its own custom version of the entry - level Cray CX1 baby supercomputer .
The difference between the CX1 - LC that Cray itself announced in July revolve mainly around packaging of features in the deskside chassis .
The Cray CX1 - LC had configurations aimed at making the deskside cluster a powerful Xeon - based workstation with lots of storage or a small cluster or an expansion box for larger CX1 baby supers , which can cram 12 compute nodes in two chasses linked together .
Cray and Dell are positioning the CX1 - iWS as a workstation with a cluster behind it to boost the computational capability , with three different levels of workstation and compute performance .
All three configurations have a two - socket Xeon 5500 workstation blade with an Nvidia Quadro FX graphics card ; this workstation is set up to run a 64 - bit version of the just - announced Windows 7 Professional desktop operating system .
The CX1 - iWS chassis that Dell is selling also sports a 16 - port Gigabit Ethernet switch , offering lots of connectivity between nodes in the chassis and the outside world .
This extra connectivity allows other workstations to plug into the baby super , and using Nvidia 's CUDA HPC programming environment , remote workstations can dispatch computational work to the graphics cards in the CX1 - iWS .
The external Gigabit Ethernet links can also be used to attach to external network storage .
The so - called " good " configuration of the CX1 - iWS has a workstation blade that sports two 2.26 GHz Xeon L5520 processors , 24 GB of main memory , a 250 GB disk , and an Nvidia Quadro FX 380 video card .
The machine also has two compute blades , each with two of the L5520 processors , 12 GB of memory , and a 160 GB disk for local operating system and scratch storage , and a single storage blade , which has the same configuration as the compute blade but also adds four 1 TB SATA disks .
The compute and storage nodes run Microsoft 's Windows HPC Server 2008 SP2 , which is a variant of Windows with math libraries and clustering tools built in and with a lower price that the regular Windows Server 2008 .
This good configuration is presumably the one that has the $ 40,000 price tag Dell is talking about in its announcement .
The " better " configuration of the CX1 - iWS from Dell puts an Nvidia Quadro FX 4800 in the workstation blade and boosts the processors on the compute and storage blades to 2.66 GHz Xeon X5550s .
The " best " CX1 - iWS configuration puts an Nvidia Quadro FX 5800 graphics card on the workstation blade and pumps up the processors on the compute and storage nodes to the 2.93 GHz Xeon X5570s .
Unlike the Cray boxes , which support both Windows and Linux stacks , the Dell variants will only run the Windows stack . ®
It ’s easy to be a fan of Portland ’s Kenny and Zuke ’s – what ’s not to like about thick cut house - smoked pastrami , fresh baked bagels , and sundry other masterfully crafted deli classics ?
[ For those readers unfortunate enough not to have visited Kenny and Zuke ’s , check out these photos for a mere inkling of what you ’re missing . ]
Writer David Sax is a fan too , as he demonstrates in a recent Gourmet story , Meet the New Deli .
I blogged about the article previously : Gourmet Magazine visits Portland again , tries the pastrami at Kenny and Zuke’s .
As Extramsg explained in a comment on that post , David Sax also has a new book out called Save the Deli , in which he highlights the best delis across the country and laments their disappearance .
Extramsg also pointed out Kenny and Zuke ’s opened after the book was mostly written , so though it does n’t make the book , it ’s exactly what David Sax had been wishing for , as was evident in the aforementioned Gourmet magazine article .
Which brings me to an interview with David Sax by Dana Joy Altman posted on the Huffington Post yesterday ; David Sax has even more nice things to say about Portland ’s favorite new - style Jewish deli :
The most interesting one I saw is Kenny & Zuke ’s out of Portland , Oregon .
It ’s two guys , one was a food blogger , the other one owned a restaurant .
One said to the other , “ Hey , there ’s no good pastrami in Portland , whaddya say we make a good pastrami and sell it at the farmers ’ market and see if it sells . ”
So they did and it sold out in ten minutes .
The next week they came back with twice the amount of pastrami and they sold out in twenty minutes .
They were smoking it in a barbecue smoker and curing it in barrels .
So , then they started to do a Deli Brunch at his restaurant and it got so big they decided to do it full time .
They opened up their deli two years ago and it ’s doing incredibly well .
They bake their own bread and bagels every morning in house , they smoke their own pastrami in a smoker with oak that they split with an axe in the basement and even though Kenny is from New York , they do n’t call themselves a New York - style deli .
They ’re a Jewish delicatessen .
Read the rest of the interview at the Huffington Post : Real Food Rehab : Save The Deli .
You can follow David Sax ’s book tour ( he ’s blogging his adventures ) at the Save the Deli website .
And of course Save the Deli is available at Powell ’s and at the library .
TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Tokyo police plan to arrest four teenagers from U.S. military families living in Japan on suspicion of attempted murder , Kyodo news agency reported on Wednesday , as tensions simmered over U.S. bases in Japan .
The four , aged 15 - 18 , are suspected of involvement in an incident in August in which a Japanese woman riding a motorcycle ran into a rope stretched across a road in Tokyo near Yokota Air Base and fractured her skull , Kyodo said , citing investigative sources .
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department declined to comment on the case .
Mitsuru Takahashi , who is in charge of media relations at the public affairs office of Yokota Air Base , said the four have not been arrested and they have not been identified as suspects .
“ The U.S. military has heard from the Metropolitan Police Department that such an incident had taken place ...
We hope that the victim will recover as soon as possible , ” Takahashi said .
The alliance between the two countries has been jolted before by military accidents and crimes , including the 1995 rape of a 12 - year - old girl by U.S. soldiers based in Okinawa that prompted huge anti-base protests .
Japanese police have also questioned a U.S. soldier about a fatal hit - and - run accident on the southern island of Okinawa .
Under an agreement between the two governments , U.S. forces based in Japan are not obliged to hand over personnel suspected of a crime outside the base unless they are charged , though they have sometimes done so in serious criminal cases .
There is disagreement as to whether the agreement applies to dependents , but previous cases that saw a delay in handing over U.S. military personnel suspected of serious crimes have caused outrage in Japan .
The Japanese government , led by Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama who took power in September , and Washington are locked in a feud over the relocation of a U.S. Marine air base on Okinawa , which is home to about half of 47,000 U.S. troops stations in Japan .
Textile reinforced concrete , self - cleaning concrete , self - compacting concrete - innovations are definitely not in short supply .
The past decades have seen many new advances and improvements .
Concrete has , alongside steel , often been hailed as the material of Modernist architecture thanks to its use in the refined building designs of the 1950s as well as in the brutalist structures of the 1960s .
It features in minimalist designs just as it does in gigantic dams and bridges with incredible spans .
Given that the majority of these projects would have been inconceivable without it , concrete has always been regarded as a miracle material by many , yet it has likewise met with criticism for aesthetic reasons .
The new Material Edition will showcase selected types of concrete including , for example , glass - foam concrete , translucent concrete , colored and recycled concrete .
Be inspired by the sheer wealth of possible uses !

The Pope warned that Africa was prey to increasing religious fundamentalism Pope Benedict has warned that a form of colonialism continues to blight Africa .
Opening a three - week synod of African bishops , he said political colonialism was over .
But he said the developed world continued to export materialism - which he called " toxic spiritual rubbish " - to the continent .
Almost 200 bishops from 53 African states have gathered to discuss how the Catholic Church can help resolve the continent 's social injustices and wars .
The Pope says he will attend as many of the working sessions of the synod as possible , his other duties permitting .
African treasures HAVE YOUR SAY
Of course western materialism is affecting Africa .
Materialism is the greatest , most powerful religion known to man [ glescakeelie ]
Unaccustomed rhythms of Africa filled the huge St Peter 's Basilica in Rome , as Pope Benedict formally opened the special synod , reports the BBC's David Willey in Rome .
A choir from the Democratic Republic of Congo sang hymns in the Kikongo and Lingala languages , and prayers were also said in Swahili , Portuguese , Amharic , Hausa and Arabic .
More and more Africans are becoming Catholics Pope Benedict praised Africa 's rich cultural and spiritual treasures , caling them a " spiritual lung " for the world .
But he said the continent was afflicted by an export of the " so - called ' first world ' ... [ the ] toxic spiritual rubbish " of materialism .
" In this context , the political colonialism is never finished , " the Pope said .
He said Africa also suffered increasing religious fundamentalism , in the form of religious groups which " act on behalf of God " but " teach intolerance and violence " .
' Talking shop '
The Pope said evangelisation was " urgent " in Africa - though the Catholic Church is already growing faster there than in any other part of the world , nearly trebling in size to 150 million followers over 30 years .
This will be the second synod of bishops organised at the Vatican to be devoted specifically to the problems of Africa .
The first took place in 1994 at the very moment when the Rwandan genocide was beginning , but turned out to be little more than a talking shop , our correspondent says .
Among the experts invited by the Pope to address the synod - which has only advisory powers - will be the former head of the joint UN / African Union peacekeeping mission in Darfur .
A small number of women from religious orders have also been invited to attend .

A top Foreign Office official has accused high court judges of damaging Britain 's national security by insisting that CIA evidence of British involvement in torture must be revealed .
The extraordinary intervention in a fierce dispute between David Miliband , the foreign secretary , and the high court has come from Simon Manley , the FCO 's director of defence and strategic threats .
In an unprecedented assault on the judiciary , he claims that demands by two judges that the CIA material should be disclosed have already harmed Britain 's intelligence and diplomatic relations with the US .
In a statement , Manley says the judges have " served to undermine confidence within the US in the UK 's ability to protect the confidentiality of diplomatic exchanges and will inevitably have a negative impact on the candour of their exchanges with UK officials " .
The impact of the judges ' rulings " also undermines our relationships with other foreign services … and co-operation on operational matters in the field is also at stake " , he adds .
" What we are facing is an erosion of trust . "
The statement is a response to the fifth judgment by Lord Justice Thomas and Mr Justice Lloyd Jones in the long - running case of Binyam Mohamed , the British resident incarcerated by the CIA in secret prisons before being rendered to Guantánamo Bay .
Media groups , led by the Guardian , have joined the action , arguing that what the CIA told MI5 and MI6 about Mohamed 's ill - treatment , and the British government 's response , should be revealed .
What made the FCO ratchet up the dispute is the judges ' devastating ruling last month , when they accused Miliband of acting in a way that was harmful to the rule of law by suppressing evidence about what the government knew of the illegal treatment of Mohamed .
The judges rejected the foreign secretary 's claims that disclosing evidence of unlawful treatment would harm national security and threaten the UK 's vital intelligence - sharing arrangements with the US .
" The suppression of reports of wrongdoing by officials in circumstances which cannot in any way affect national security is inimical to the rule of law , " they ruled .
" In our view , as a court in the United Kingdom , a vital public interest requires … that a summary of the most important evidence relating to the involvement of the British security services in wrongdoing be placed in the public domain …
Championing the rule of law , not subordinating it , is the cornerstone of democracy . "
Ethiopian - born Mohamed , now living in the UK , says he was tortured with the knowledge of British security and intelligence agencies .
The CIA information includes an account given to British intelligence " whilst [ Mohamed ] was held in Pakistan … prior to his interview by an officer of the Security Service " , the judges revealed .
The officer , known only as Witness B , is being investigated for possible criminal wrongdoing .
The judges made it clear they were exasperated by the attitude of the foreign secretary and British officials .
There was no " rational basis " for claims made by Miliband and Hillary Clinton , the US secretary of state , that disclosure of the CIA material would put British lives at risk .
At the heart of the dispute is a seven - paragraph CIA document that the British government insists must remain secret .
The judges , who have seen the CIA document , have repeatedly said it does not contain any sensitive intelligence material .
" There is nothing in the redacted paragraphs that are in any way secret and the foreign secretary will have to justify [ his claims ] , " Thomas said after handing down last month 's judgment .
The issue will go to appeal .
However , the court is also embroiled in four other currently redacted passages in the fifth judgment .
One passage Miliband wants to keep secret comes immediately after the judges ' reference to memos released by the Obama administration , setting out " details of the treatment inflicted on detainees by the CIA " .
Another passage refers to what the judges call the need to " stand back and ask the question whether President Obama would curtail the supply of information to the United States ' oldest ally when what was put into the public domain was not intelligence " .
They continue : " It is difficult … to see any grounds for rejecting the submission of [ Mohamed ] , the UK media and the international media , that there is any evidence of any real risk of serious harm to the national security of the UK . "

Sherry Wolf , the author of Sexuality and Socialism and a leading organizer of the National Equality March last weekend , looks at what made the demonstration a success in the US online magazine Socialist Worker .
THE FIRST mass protest of the Obama era–the tea - bagging gatherings of bigots aside –was a colossal success .
In defiance of the corporate - run LGBT establishment , Gay Inc. , and with no major organizations , media or financing behind it , the National Equality March nevertheless drew more than 200,000 people to Washington , D.C. , to demand full equality in all matters governed by civil law in all 50 states .
The march was a vindication of the idea that mass protest is possible , necessary and desirable if the left is to challenge both the right and the politics of do n’t - rock - the - boat gradualism gripping the Democratic Party and its liberal defenders .
As a member of the march ’s leadership and an author and public speaker who has been on tour for several months , I had a bird ’s - eye view of how this march was organized , warts and all .
We were a rag - tag bunch–of veteran activists , but mostly developing young militants , who are more multiracial , anti-corporate and suspicious of the Democratic Party than previous generations of organizers .
Tanner Efinger , a Los Angeles bartender who labored for months without pay to build the march , introduced one of the march ’s initiators Cleve Jones at the rally , saying : “ I am no one of note , I am not a seasoned speaker , I have no published pieces of work or even a college degree .
I have no health insurance , I am in debt …
We are , all of us , an unrepresented motley crew of underdogs . ”
It was an eloquent description of the carpet of humanity laid out before the Capitol on that gorgeous fall day .
The mobilizing efforts for the march–which were derided by an anonymous Obama adviser as the work of fringe “ bloggers ” who need to take off their “ pajamas ” –included not only aggressive online promotion , but good old - fashioned street heat on campuses and in communities , where speak - outs , teach - ins , rallies and educational events drew anywhere from dozens to hundreds .
Twenty - seven - year - old Kip Williams from San Francisco ’s One Struggle , One Fight was the sole paid organizer for the march , earning minimum wage to work tirelessly , dashing across the country and getting groups and individuals onboard .
The march ’s student coordinator and socialist Keeanga - Yamahtta Taylor helped centralize a mammoth effort to organize students to hold days of action , phone bank and join the huge lead contingent of youth at the front of the march .
Robin McGehee , a Fresno , Calif. , mother who was kicked out from leading her local PTA after Prop 8 ’s passage in November , volunteered countless hours to orchestrate march logistics .
And Chloe Noble , who is marching cross-country to raise awareness of homeless LGBT youth , organized workshops with Chelsea Salem the day before the march , as did transgender activists and LGBT families who brought together hundreds of kids and same - sex couples at a milk - and - cookies event to make protest signs and schmooze among other families like their own .
Though UNITE HERE organizer and Harvey Milk protégé Cleve Jones was attacked for his audacity to build a march in less than four months and for countering the incrementalist approach of the dominant LGBT groups–and red-baited for his collaboration with me–none of these attacks stuck .
Openly gay Rep. Barney Frank ’s oft - expressed contempt for the march –“ The only thing they ’re going to be putting pressure on is the grass ” –earned him the derision of student protesters , who chanted : “ Barney Frank , fuck you ! ”
– – – – – – – – – – – – – – – –
THERE IS no direct correlation between the organizational abilities of march organizers and the massive size and strength of the turnout .
In other words , we succeeded because we struck a chord with a new generation of budding activists and a politically left - leaning swath of LGBT folks and our straight allies of every age .
The march cost far less than previous national demonstrations–under $ 250,000 –and there was zero corporate branding either requested or desired .
The march punctuated not just a turning point in the LGBT struggle , but kicked the door open for an unapologetically straight - and labor - allied civil rights movement that organizers hope to collect into a national network called Equality Across America ( EAA ) .
EAA has already called for a Week of Initiatives November 1 - 8 , during which activists in every locality possible should aim to call a meeting , show a film , hold an action or just take the first steps toward getting organized on the ground .
Joe Solmonese –effectively the CEO of Gay Inc. in his capacity as president of the Human Rights Campaign ( HRC ) –expressed a particularly brash opportunism .
HRC , which is the largest LGBT lobbying group in the country and pays Solmonese $ 338,400 annually , first denounced the march , and then endorsed it when pressure from below made it clear , they had nothing to lose by signing on and could benefit if the march was a success .
Though HRC never used its
Web site or 750,000 - person e-mail list to help promote the march , it leapt at the opportunity to parlay the march ’s success into raising $ 200,000 for themselves less than 48 hours after the protest .
Those fired up and raring to mobilize after the march would do better to focus their energies and funds on those who have both the vision and desire to organize EAA into a genuine grassroots effort to demand full equality now .
The forces that came together to strategize and mobilize did so on a basis of shifting the national discussion away from state - by - state , issue - by - issue incrementalism , and toward full civil equality for LGBT people .
Many organizers cut their teeth in the Obama campaign and feel , rightly , that without the mass pressure , President Obama never would have addressed LGBT issues as he did last weekend–and he never will act on those sentiments without an active and ongoing struggle .
Liberal activists are turning their gaze leftward , something that was clear to me in the enthusiastic response to my Sexuality and Socialism book tour , and the hundreds who packed into and around Busboys and Poets Café in D.C. , cheering wildly as they listened to Cleve Jones and me speak on LGBT liberation the day before the march .
And the turnout on October 11 was , of course , the ultimate expression of a new mood of militancy and a posture of defiance in the face of liberal hand - wringing and right - wing belligerence .
But this march is just a start .
We ’ve got to keep up the fight and build EAA into the grassroots movement so desperately needed to win civil rights for all .

At the beginning of the 20th century there were only 11 cities in the entire world with a population over one million people .
1950 there were 50 cities , in 1990 276 and today we have around 450 ( in 2015 there will probably be over 550 of those metropolis with over one million inhabitants ) .
This urbanization leads to a huge segregation of stripes of untouched nature that makes it impossible for flora and fauna to interact in its usual ways .
This has already started with agriculture and farming , which cut the land in stripes and meant the beginning of deforestation .
But urbanization is even more cruel , as it leaves even less living space to animals and plants .
One problem is that full land stripes are covered with concrete cities .
Another problem is the highways and roads that cut through landscapes making it virtually impossible for animals to move in their accustomed ways .
By 2020 there will probably be ten cities with over 20 million inhabitants !
Imagine the population concentration and its effects on nature in such areas !
Already , these megalopolises are famous for their sanitary problems , their slums , crime and problems of poverty ( which , as a effect often lead to more pollution due to bad policing ) .
Also , poverty leads to the “ better areas ” of the city seeking seclusion .
Even more concrete is built , but in this case vertically ( for dividing walls ) .
These so - called “ gated communities ” seek luxurious standards and are often completely unaware of the natural roots of the places they live in – these city dweller have been born into concrete , they live in concrete and all they know is concrete .
Their awareness for ecological problems is often quite small ( remember that most of these megalopolises are in poor countries ) and not much is being done to improve the situation .
Water supply is becoming increasingly difficult and waste disposal is often unorganised , thus leading to pollution and diseases .
Every fourth person on the planet does not currently have access to fresh water !
This is most often an urbanisation problem .
A further problem of large cities , of course , is traffic .
The faster they grow the more important private transportation becomes because public transport often fails at this point ( unless it has been planned based on long - term considerations ) .
So the cities that we live in and consider to be the height of our civilisation are actually threatening the standard of life we have gotten used to .
As soon as their growth becomes uncontrollable , they become an environmental threat that is hard to evaluate .
Let ’s stop and think and try to help educating those who are unaware of the uprooting and destructive effects of urbanization .

A day after the Obama administration proclaimed significant progress in its effort to spare troubled homeowners from foreclosure , an oversight panel on Friday sharply criticized the program and declared it would leave millions of Americans vulnerable to losing their homes .
In a report mild in language but pointed in substance , the Congressional Oversight Panel  a watchdog created last year to keep tabs on taxpayer bailout funds  said the administration ’s program would , “ in the best case , ” prevent “ fewer than half of the predicted foreclosures . ”
The report rebuked the administration for failing to shape a program that addressed the most significant engines of the foreclosure crisis  soaring joblessness and exotic mortgages with low introductory interest rates that give way to sharply higher payments over the next three years .
Many of those mortgages are too large to qualify for modification under the administration ’s plan .
People who lose their jobs often lack enough income to qualify for relief .
The administration ’s plan appears “ targeted at the housing crisis as it existed six months ago , rather than as it exists now , ” asserted the oversight panel in its report .
“ The panel urges Treasury to reconsider the scope , scalability and permanence of the programs designed to minimize the economic impact of foreclosures and consider whether new programs or program enhancements could be adopted . ”
Three more cars were torched in west Contra Costa County over the weekend , bringing to at least 14 the number of vehicles that have been set on fire since Wednesday , authorities said Monday .
The most recent fire was reported at about 10:50 p.m.
Saturday , when someone set a car ablaze in front of a home on the 5500 block of Oak Knoll Road in El Sobrante , sheriff 's spokesman Jimmy Lee said .
At about the same time , the Contra Costa County Fire Protection District put out two other car fires in Richmond , Lee said .
Investigators have at least one possible suspect in the rash of fires , a source close to the case said , but have not made any arrests .
Eleven cars were set on fire early Wednesday in El Sobrante , Richmond and San Pablo .
No one has been injured in any of the fires , but one of the blazes damaged a window to a home , said engineer Rico Rincon , a Richmond Fire Department spokesman .
" That just shows how close it was to threatening the home , " Rincon said .
" Obviously , there 's potential for further damage than the vehicles . "
Investigators told Steve and Elaine Ziem , whose car was torched Wednesday in El Sobrante , that whoever was responsible may have broken into the vehicles first and searched the interiors for combustible material .
Among the cars burned Saturday was the 1996 Toyota Camry belonging to Antoinette Holmes , 57 , of El Sobrante .
" It 's frustrating and shocking to look out the window to see your car on fire , " Holmes said .
Holmes ' neighbor Walter Hamner , 63 , said he and his wife had turned off the lights to go to sleep when they realized that there was still a bright light outside .
The flames from the Camry were " shooting up about 7 to 8 feet above the car , " he said .
" This is absolutely insane , " Hamner said .
" We have somebody out there that really has a problem . "
Quentin Tarantino's " Inglourious Basterds " hits theaters this Friday and there 's already a short comic preview of the film available .
Tarantino 's an admitted comics fan , often slipping both subtle and not so subtle references to classic comics characters into his work .
In his latest film he 's including a figure who has appeared in the pages of comics steadily for decades now : Adolf Hitler .
The rise of comics as popular reading in the U.S. coincided with the beginning of the Second World War and the regime of one of the most terrible human beings the world 's ever witnessed .
Even while he was still alive , Hitler 's appearances in comics books were usually done in a light - hearted manner .
But in the appearances that followed long after his death and the end of the war Hitler , the comic book character , became something unreal .
Sometimes a fearsome 20th century boogey - man , sometimes a punchline , sometimes both .
Here 's a sampling of but a few of those appearances , as there 's far too many to present them all :

[ Read the full list after the jump ... ] 1. WWII COMICS COVERS
Even before the United States of America officially entered the war in December 1941 , its costumed heroes were taking on Hitler .
March 1941 's Captain America # 1 , by Joe Simon and Jack Kirby , used this now famous image of Cap landing a heavy right hook into Hitler 's face for its cover .
Over the course of the World War II , comics publishers were eager to show their support of the war effort right on the front of their books , and Hitler , along with other Axis Power leaders , was an obvious target .
Superman and Batman soon followed Captain America 's example :
There 's a good run down of cover images collected here .
Honestly , this one 's probably my favorite :
( Interesting historical note - that 's the same expression Hitler used on British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain at the 1938 Munich Conference .
After five hours , an exasperated Chamberlain threw up his arms and exclaimed " Fine , take the Sudetenland ! " )
These images all left a lasting mark on more than just comics culture , particularly " Captain America " # 1 .
There 's an important scene in Michael Chabon 's Pulitzer - prize winning " The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay " in which the novel 's protagonists decide to have the first cover of their own Golden Age hero , The Escapist , giving Hitler a solid punch to the jaw .
Mike Mignola and Dave Stewart later recreated that cover for Dark Horse .
And the recently released issue # 2 of " Captain America Reborn " shows Cap with Hitler in a choke hold .
2. The Fantastic Four Vs. Hitler ( ? )
" Fantastic Four " # 21 , by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , was published in 1962 and introduced a new antagonist for the team : The Hate - Monger .
Employing a weapon called the " H - Ray " , the Hatemonger was able to cause the group to fight against one another until , with the help of Nick Fury , they were able to overcome the ray 's effects .
And when the H - Ray accidentally struck some of his own soldiers , the Hate - Monger ended up shot to death by his own men .
Reed Richards then removed the hood from the Hate - Monger 's body to reveal .
Yup .
It was Hitler all along .
In real life , the circumstances surrounding Hitler 's death were something of a mystery .
Because his body was cremated following his suicide and the only source of autopsy information was the Soviet government , some people chose not to believe the official view .
Conspiracy theories of his escape arose .
For some , Hitler had been like a kind of movie monster , and unless they saw the body they could n't be convinced something responsible for so much suffering and destruction could be killed so easily .
This being a comic book , it turned out the Fantastic Four had killed a clone .
Hitler , as far as the Marvel Universe was concerned , was just as dead as he was in reality .
But on a later occasion when the Fantastic Four encountered Hitler , circumstances were different .
This time , in a story by John Byrne and Al Gordon , the group found themselves somehow transported back in time prior to World War II , once again with Nick Fury along for the ride .
Fury quickly decided how he wanted to spend his trip to the past .
The rest , however , worried about the effect killing Hitler would have on history .
And in the end , when they 've all got another Hitler corpse on their hands , it turns out not to be a clone this time .
No , instead it was all a dream .
Not theirs , but an imagined past created by a powerful mutant .
3. " Marvel Age " # 109
" Marvel Age , " a magazine with articles , interviews , and artwork published by Marvel for Marvel fans , included a short comic in issue # 109 .
A special for the holiday 1992 issue , the comic had Captain America telling a story of his past Christmas - related adventures to a group of orphans visiting Avengers ' Mansion .
Here 's the highlight :
Your eyes do not deceive you .
That is indeed Adolf Hitler holding a gun to Santa Claus ' head .
With Hitler existing in comics as a personification of absolute evil , it 's not surprising Marvel had him attempt to destroy the one person children see as a being of absolute good : Santa himself .
It was only a matter of time until that story was told .
And by " it was only a matter of time " , I of course mean that it had already happened in a Superman story fifty years earlier during World War II .
The Marvel Age comic is notable for one other thing , though .
Its surprising level of self - awareness :
4. " Savage Dragon / Hellboy " # 34 and 35
These two issues of Savage Dragon , printed in late 1996 , were a crossover event that saw not one , but two battles with Hitler .
The first came in the prologue of the first issue , which told the events of a 1952 fight in Romania between Hellboy and a mechanical battle - armored Adolf Hitler .
Hellboy walked away victorious , leaving Hitler presumably dead in a fiery explosion .
Unfortunately , his brain survived the blast and was preserved .
In the body of a gorilla .
Because that is clearly what you do if you have Hitler 's brain in a jar .
Much like the Hate - Monger , Brainiape - Hitler possessed the ability to cause his enemies to fight against one another , which he makes Savage Dragon and Hellboy do until they 're able to shake it off and finish him off for good , this time .
5. I Killed Adolf Hitler
Norwegian cartoonist Jason won the 2008 Eisner for Best U.S. Edition of International Material with this tale of a hitman given an unusual request .
Drawn in his usual anthropomorphic style , Jason 's protagonist , a
hired killer existing in a world where his profession is entirely legal , is asked to take a time machine back to kill Hitler and prevent World War II .
It does n't quite work out as planned :
Hitler examines the time travel machine and ends up in the future himself , leaving the hitman stuck in the past .
He waits , ages , and when Hitler reappears in what was the hitman 's present he pursues him once again .
But he 's now a tired , old man in poor health and he turns to his ex-girlfriend for help .
And it's their relationship that drives the story , with Hitler in the case serving the role of the obsession that prevents the hitman from paying attention to her .
6. Adventures in the Rifle Brigade : Operation : Bollock
I am going to attempt to describe this in the most family - friendly way possible .
It is going to be quite difficult .
Garth Ennis and Carlos Ezquerra 's three - issue miniseries , published by Vertigo in 2001 , follows the adventure of a special brigade composed of British ( and one American ) soldiers sent to a small Middle Eastern kingdom to find . . . something .
Something that belonged to Hitler .
And he would like back .
Okay , let me come at this from another angle .
Ennis ' inspiration for the story comes from a certain song popular among Allied Troops during World War II .
You see , these were people whose lives were a combination of long stretches of intense boredom punctuated by brief moments of life - threatening danger , and so they did a lot of things to keep their spirits up .
And that included composing and singing filthy ( well , filthy by 1940s standards ) songs that insulted their enemies in the most juvenile way possible .
Now , this particular song was about a certain part of Hitler 's anatomy that was not present .
This particular part was something that most men had two of , but in Hitler 's case , so the song asserted , only half that number were present .
No , not sideburns .
Think more below the belt .
If you must , you can read the details by clicking here .
Now , that one particular bit of Hitler is the only part of him to appear in the story , but that 's enough of a threat seeing as it's a concentrated essence of evil capable of all but guaranteeing German victory if it returns back into Hitler 's . . . you know what , let 's just say " hands " for now and move on .
7. Dr. McNinja
When you 're dealing with a subject as sensitive as a dictator responsible for millions of deaths and treating it as a joke , eventually someone 's going to cross the line .
And it 's not terribly surprising that it happened on the Internet , which still barely edges out Washington , D.C. , as the location you 're most likely to find Hitler references that go too far .
In this case the involved parties were Chris Hastings , the creator of the Webcomic Dr. McNinja , and Rene Engström , creator of the Anders Loves Maria .
Hastings had commissioned a series of guest comics starring his stealthy , medical , Batman - esque hero , and Engström agreed to provide one .
In Engström 's comic , Dr. McNinja traveled back in time to kill Hitler before World War II , only to find the man happily painting a picture surrounded by smiling children .
Resolved to complete his mission , McNinja ultimately decided to kill Hitler after wavering for a moment .
And so he returned to his own time , satisfied in the knowledge of the millions of live he had saved .
Upon reaching the present he found his city being destroyed by a giant Rabbi .
There was some backlash to the comic , and fan reactions were mixed as to whether it was simply too offensive or not .
Hastings and Engström ultimately decided that it was understandable some could see it as crossing a line that should n't be crossed and removed it from the site .
No trace of it seems to remain anywhere on the Internet .
Hitler can still be seen in brief cameo in Dr. McNinja 's main storyline , where 's he kept on Dracula 's secret moon base as part of the vampire count 's personal collection of historical figures .
Nikal sez , " I wanted to draw your attention to a short webcomic history of the ongoing crisis in Honduras .
The comic puts the current situation in historical context and offers an interpretation of how the current de facto government has its roots in the US - Honduras relationship .
We believe our comic is artfully drawn , informative , and innovative in its treatment and explanation of the crisis .
The authors are Dan Archer , a comix journalist and instructor at Stanford University , and Nikil Saval , a PhD candidate in English at Stanford University and an assistant editor at n+1 magazine . "
The interface for this slideshow is diabolical ( a " next " button would be useful ! ) , but it 's still a great and informative read .
Striking Graphic Novel Tells Story of Honduras Coup and Unrest
How a road train could work
The driver 's sat - nav indicates that there is a road train ahead that is following some of his / her planned journey .
The driver approaches the road train , which is controlled by a professional driver at the front , and indicates that he / she wishes to join .
The road train takes control of the extra car , pulling it close to cut air drag and save about 20 % in fuel consumption .
The drivers can relax until they wish to leave the road train , at which point they signal their intention to the driver at the front .
A bigger gap will be made to allow the car to leave and control of the vehicle will be returned to that driver .
BACK {current} of {total} NEXT Road trains that link vehicles together using wireless sensors could soon be on European roads .
An EU - financed research project is looking at inexpensive ways of getting vehicles to travel in a ' platoon ' on Europe 's motorways .
Each road train could include up to eight separate vehicles - cars , buses and trucks will be mixed in each one .
The EU hopes to cut fuel consumption , journey times and congestion by linking vehicles together .
Early work on the idea suggests that fuel consumption could be cut by 20 % among those cars and trucks travelling behind the lead vehicle .
Spanish trials
The lead vehicle would be handled by a professional driver who would monitor the status of the road train .
Those in following vehicles could take their hands off the wheel , read a book or watch TV , while they travel along the motorway .
Their vehicle would be controlled by the lead vehicle .
Funded under the European Commission 's Framework 7 research plan , Sartre ( Safe Road Trains for the Environment ) is aimed at commuters in cars who travel long distances to work every day but will also look at ways to involve commercial vehicles .
Tom Robinson , project co-ordinator at engineering firm Ricardo , said the idea was to use off - the - shelf components to make it possible for cars , buses and trucks to join the road train .
Many researchers are developing cars that drive themselves " The goal is to try and introduce a step change in transport methods , " he said .
" We 're looking at what it would take to get platooning on public highways without making big changes to the public highways themselves , " said Mr Robinson .
A system that involved wiring up motorways with sensors to help control the road trains would be prohibitively expensive , he said .
" Each of the vehicles will have their own control and software monitoring system , " said Mr Robinson .
" There may well be a platoon sensor envelope that collates information and presents it to the lead vehicle so it can understand what is happening around all the vehicles . "
The idea is to make platoons active so vehicles can join and leave as they need .
Mr Robinson speculated that those joining a platoon or road train may one day pay for the privilege of someone else effectively driving them closer to their destination .
Sartre will run for three years .
The project partners are currently doing preliminary research to find out all the elements needed for a working system and the situations in which it might be used .
There were also behavioural elements to consider , said Mr Robinson , such as whether all the vehicles will need to have their hazard lights on while in a platoon .
Also , he said , there had to be a way to ensure the vehicles in a platoon are organised to make drivers feel safe .
" Car drivers do not want to be between trucks , " he said .
Towards the end of the research project trials will be held on test tracks in the UK , Spain and Sweden .
There are also plans for public road trials in Spain .
The first platoon will involve two trucks and three cars .

Findings by SBU Alert
Version : 1
Technology and target group
Hard - to - heal lower leg and foot ulcers are common .
This type of ulceration is a sign of underlying disease .
The largest subgroup , ie , venous leg ulcers , is caused by impaired function in the venous blood flow ( venous insufficiency ) and comprises approximately 50 percent of all leg ulcers .
Usually this type of leg ulcer continues to reappear over a longer period of time .
The dominating therapy is compression treatment .
Transplantation of the patients own tissue ( autologous transplantation ) is used to treat hard - to - heal ulcers , but new methods involving cultured skin have been developed that utilize other human tissue .
A major advantage of this method , compared to autologous transplantation , is sparing the patient from treatment demanding skin defects secondary to graft skin harvesting .
Apligraf® is one type of cultured human skin equivalent .
This material is cultured from foreskin removed in the circumcision of newborn males .
The process used to manufacture Apligraf® requires the method to be classified as a pharmaceutical product .
The end product is delivered in special packaging and has a shelf life of 5 days .
Treatment is provided on an outpatient basis and is generally repeated several times .
The potential target group for skin transplantation as a result of hard - to - heal leg and foot ulcers in Sweden is estimated to be approximately 2 000 patients per year .
At this time , Apligraf® has not been approved for use in Sweden .
Patient benefit and side effects
The effects of Apligraf® treatment have been studied in a randomized open study of 293 patients .
Apligraf® in combination with compression treatment was compared to compression treatment alone .
The study showed that the addition of Apligraf® resulted in both a higher percentage of healed wounds and a shorter median time for healing in patients who had large ulcers and / or have had ulcers for a longer period .
No significant differences were found between treatment alternatives in patients who had ulcers for periods shorter than 6 months .
No signs of immunological reactions or other side effects of transplantation have been reported .
As regards other side effects ( eg , infection , pain , development of necrosis , and inflammation ) no differences were observed in comparison to patients in the control group .
However , there is some uncertainty in interpreting the findings since wound size varied in the study and the control groups respectively ( larger wounds were less frequent in the group treated with Apligraf® ) .
Economic aspects
The cost to deliver a treatment using Apligraf® ( cost of the product and staff to perform the procedure ) for a venous leg ulcer has been estimated at approximately 12 000 Swedish kronor ( SEK ) .
Usually , 2 to 4 treatments are required .
Three model studies using different alternatives for comparison have presented estimates of cost effectiveness .
The results varied , ranging from a cost saving to an additional cost of approximately 85 000 SEK .
The studies are based on data from clinical studies with short followup periods .
Due to the short followup time in the studies , the strength of the scientific evidence is considered to be poor .
The relevance of the findings to Swedish conditions is unclear .
Scientific evidence
Currently , there is poor * documentation concerning the short - term effects of the method .
Likewise , there is poor * documentation concerning its cost effectiveness .
Further randomized and controlled studies are needed with longer followup times and standardized definitions of hard - to - heal venous ulcers .
Also , comparisons must be made with the alternative methods , eg , pinch grafts , to be able to claim that Apligraf® is more cost effective than other methods .
* This assessment by SBU Alert uses a 4 - point scale to grade the quality and evidence of the scientific documentation .
The grades indicate : ( 1 ) good , ( 2 ) moderate , ( 3 ) poor , or ( 4 ) no scientific evidence on the subject .
This summary is based on a report prepared at SBU in collaboration with Assoc. Prof. Mats Bjellerup , Helsingborg Hospital , Helsingborg .
It has been reviewed by Gunilla Sjölin - Forsberg , Head of the Pharmacovigilance Unit , Medical Products Agency .
The complete report is available only in Swedish .

After discovering the Pirate Bay logo had n't been registered with the patent office , a Swedish company took the opportunity to claim it as their own in order to commercially exploit it .
After bloodless negotiations , the company now seems prepared to play nice and let their application slide .
But they do n't go away empty - handed .
On Monday , we reported that after noticing the iconic Pirate Bay logo had no commercial protection , a Swedish company took the first steps towards hijacking it for their own .
“ The idea is to sell USB drives using this brand , ” said Sandryds Handel spokesman Bengt Wessborg .
“ We saw that it was not already allocated to someone else .
It was not registered . ”
The company went on to register an almost exact copy of the logo , differing only slightly in color and lacking a capital letter on the word ‘ Bay ’ .
The move was accepted by PRV , Sweden ’s Patent and Registration Office .
Ex -Pirate Bay spokesman Peter Sunde was not happy with the move .
“ They [ Sandryds ] knew that [ the logo ] was not owned or created by them and they [ registered the logo ] to attain a position of power against The Pirate Bay , ” he wrote in an email protest to PRV .
After earlier saying that they were prepared to strike a deal with The Pirate Bay over the logo , that offer appears to have come to pass .
Following discussions with Sunde , Sandryds have now backtracked and agreed to de-register the trademark .
But they do n’t come away empty - handed .
Company spokesman Bengt Wessborg told SR they are happy with their achievement , having secured permission to use the Pirate Bay logo on a new product .
“ We have had permission from The Pirate Bay to sell a media player with the logo on , ” said Wessborg .
Although the mechanism by which Sandryds achieved this permission was more than a little dubious , admittedly the choice of end - product to display the logo seems the perfect fit .

Critics say a Digital Rights Management ( DRM ) system for Freeview HD would effectively lock down free BBC content .
In its submission to Ofcom , the Open Rights Group argued that such a system was DRM by the " backdoor " and that it would prevent things such as recording HD content for personal use .
" Ofcom received a large number of responses to this consultation , in particular from consumers and consumer groups , who raised a number of potentially significant consumer ' fair use ' and competition issues that were not addressed in our original consultation , " the letter from Ofcom to the BBC read .
It asked the BBC to clarify the benefit to citizens , as well as outline how it proposes to address the " potential disadvantages " and offer alternative approaches to the issue .
In response to the letter , the BBC said it " remains committed to the launch of HD on Freeview as it will deliver choice in terms of platform and availability of HD content for audiences across the UK " .
Under original plans submitted to Ofcom , the broadcaster had requested that it be allowed to encrypt certain information on set - top boxes , using a method known as Huffman compression .
Consumer choice
Because licensing rules prevent the BBC from encrypting the actual video or audio streams , it instead requested that it be allowed to encrypt the data associated with TV listings without which set - top boxes are not able to decode the TV content .
The BBC argues it will prevent piracy .
The BBC said it made the request to Ofcom in response to pressure from rights holders to offer copy protection on all its high - definition broadcasts .
" We are committed to ensuring that public service content remains free to air i.e. unencrypted .
" However , HD content holders have begun to expect a degree of content management on the Freeview HD platform and therefore broadcasters have recognised that a form of copy protection is needed , " read a statement from the BBC .
Opponents , including Labour MP Tom Watson , say that , if the move is agreed , it will limit consumer choice .
Digital rights organisation the Open Rights Group , was one of those to submit objections to the the scheme to Ofcom .
It said the plans would give the BBC " absolute power to control who may access its HD services " .
It added that third - party equipment makers would find it difficult to comply to the new licensing regime and that its proposal also threatened disabled access .
It welcomed the move by Ofcom to seek more clarification .
" The fight is n't over .
We will continue to fight for peoples ' rights to record material off of the TV for personal use as they have done for decades , " said Jim Killock , executive director of the Open Rights Group .
There is a very limited amount of time left to agree the specifications for set - top boxes .
Freeview plans to launch its first HD services next month , from a transmitter which serves Liverpool , Manchester , Lancashire , Cheshire and north Staffordshire .

“ Death Panels ” ai n’t got nothing on this !
How can you be for the Death Penalty and be against the “ Corporate Death Penalty ” ?
ACORN was smeared to death , and that sucks .
So , how do we make the best of it ?
If ACORN must go , the rest of all the Bush Era Crooked Contractors you know and loathe will just have to go too .
On Friday ( Spet 25th ) , Rep. Alan Grayson ( D - Fla . ) inserted into the “ legislative history ” language spelling out that including all fraudulent organizations was , in fact , the intent of the Congress .
~ snip ~
“ The bill imposes , and is intended to impose , a corporate death penalty on contractors who fall within the scope of its prohibitions . ”

What ’s good for the goose , or , in this case , nut .
More political judo below the fold .
In their zeal to demonize ACORN , the wingnuts have tied the noose for their MIC contractor patrons .
We can thank idiots like Glenn Beck , FOX News and Republican House Minority leader John Boehner for DESTROYING Blackwater , KBR , Haliburton and every other crooked contractors ability to defraud the Government of Tax Payer money if this bill passes .
And , if the Republicans do n’t like it , they can vote against their own bill and let ACORN go free , a move that will make the die hard wingnuts spit their tea all over their NASCAR collectable plates .
Looks like Speaker Pelosi and House Dems have totally hornswoggled House Republicans into passing a bill that DESTROYS crooked Defense Contractors and others along with ACORN , who never was found guilty in a court of law , while making it look like that was the plan to begin with .
The original bill looked like it just went after ACORN , but a bit of maneuvering by House Dems has made it a little trickier than that .
As written , as of this moment , the move to go after ACORN would be an Unconstitutional Bill Of Attainder , except for these four suddenly beautiful words “ filed a fraudulent form ” , which makes the penalties universal for all Government contracts .
As the Ranking Member ’s report describes , however , the term “ filed a fraudulent form ” extends to all organizations that have filed such a form , whether or not such a filing has resulted in a conviction or judgment .
The Ranking Member issued a statement yesterday , which said : “ For far too long , recipients of federal dollars have been given free reign [ sic ] and some have acted in a reckless and cavalier way and whether it be ACORN or anyone else – abuse and fraud will not be tolerated . ”
He added , “ frankly , I do n’t know how anyone can successfully argue [ that ] those who actually perpetrate fraud and misuse taxpayer dollars should not be ” subject to these prohibitions .

Turns out that ranking committee member is Darrell Issa ( R - CA ) , who actually seems ( gasp ! ) concerned about something relevant like Corporate fraud that wastes taxpayers money .
I know , I know , I am shocked too .
A Republican who actually uses fiscal conservativism to fight fraud instead of creating it seems almost too good to be true .
Either way , I ’m still looking for loopholes on this , as I do n’t trust Issa any more than I trust a pet viper .
But I do n’t think Alan Grayson would work with Issa to screw us either .
( Not that such things have n’t happened before , but Grayson seems an unlikely candidate )
So , either the Bill is an Unconstitutional Bill of Attainder , or it has to apply to everyone .
WIN / WIN !
Either the GOP pushed an idiotic unconstitutional bill , or they have to vote AGAINST their own bill to protect Corporate Corruption with Tax Payer money !
You can still help out ACORN here in their fight against this idiot smear job .
Help ACORN here
And we can give some love to Rep. Alan Grayson ( Big D - FL ) with ActBlue.com here
And the answer to the question “ How bad does a Corporation have to screw us before they get theirs ? ” has an answer , and it is three words .
“ Corporate Death Penalty ”

As with Volume I , we shall start easy .
We 'll begin with a truth so forehead - smackingly obvious you might worry that its very presence will cause you some sort of concussion o' blatancy .
Which is , ironically , just about right ...
1 ) Your semi-rhetorical question du jour :
What do basketball , baseball , soccer , hockey , lumberjacking and " The Real Housewives of Atlanta " all have in common ?
That 's right , none of them causes nearly as much brain damage as America 's most beloved sport - of - thugs : football .
It is , without doubt , the most violent and sadistic gladiator game we have ever invented for giant , vaguely homoerotic males who weigh more than 250 pounds .
Except for boxing .
Witness Malcolm
Gladwell 's half - stunning , half - obvious piece in a recent New Yorker , summed up thusly : nearly every football player in America , from high school on up through the NFL -- especially there -- will suffer some level of brain damage and head trauma , from moderate to severe to early - onset dementia , even after just a year or two of play , even if he never turns pro at all .
Turns out the human skull simply cannot endure that many blows and concussions and not have the brain ripped , torn , bounced , pounded into a damaged lump of spasm and drooling and memory loss .
The game is just that brutal .
2 ) Gladwell goes on to talk about Michael Vick , and suggests football has a direct parallel with the morally nauseating " sport " of dogfighting .
It 's a tenuous analogy , I thought , until the end when he talks about the scene at your average dogfight : the bloodthirsty crowd , the intense passion of the dog owners , the wholehearted willingness of the dogs themselves to fight to the death for your entertainment .
Good luck making a distinction .
3 ) Are you aware that many desperate media honchos think the savior of fast - dying newspapers , magazines , even book publishing might just lie in the next must - have gizmo , like the Kindle ?
Well they do .
Then again , until about 2005 , most of them thought the Internet was run by tiny astronauts and magic rubber bands .
But never mind that now .
Here stumbles Barnes & Noble , not exactly a bastion of tech innovation or cultural relevance , actually releasing a decent eBook device of its very own , called the Nook , to compete directly with Amazon 's clunky , hideously ugly Kindle .
The amazing thing :
They improved upon it .
Not difficult , I realize .
But still .
Barnes & Noble ?
Translation :
If even B&N can make a decent slab , the bar is set very low indeed .
Somewhere , Steve Jobs is smiling .
Again .
4 ) Here 's an astonishing fact : China just surpassed the United States as the world 's largest automobile market .
Are you surprised ?
What 's more , they will easily outsell the U.S. this year in sheer units moved , upwards of 13 million cars ( the U.S. will move about 11 million ) .
But that 's not the amazing part .
It 's this :
They say that in a mere five or six years that number will almost double , to about 20 million cars per year , a simply staggering amount the wimpy little U.S. , once the car capital of the world , has never , ever matched , and never will .
And the Earth went , groan .
5 ) Wait , it gets better -- and scarier .
Behold , the single most stunning China - related stat I 've read in ages : " China is expected to build more square feet of real estate in the next 15 years than the United States has built in its entire history , and it has no green building codes or green building experience , " says everbleak Foreign Policy mag .
Yes , everything we have built in more than 200 years , surpassed by China by the time your newborn hits high school .
Amazing .
Disorienting .
Oddly disturbing .
6 ) Upshot : America is done .
Our once - great empire is cooked .
Not only is China ( and India , fast behind ) about to stomp all over everyone in economic power and resource abuse , they already own a huge chunk of our debt , manufacture most of our holidays and build almost everything we like to buy .
And that includes the device you are reading this on right now .
Oh well .
We 'll always have football .
7 ) Not frightening enough ?
Here , let these appalling photos of China 's rampant pollution drive it all home .
More masochism ?
Suck on Canada 's nauseating oilsands .
Still more ?
Fine ,
How about this :
A new poll suggests the number of Americans who believe global warming is a real and dangerous phenomenon brought on by pollutive human activity is actually decreasing .
It 's true .
My guess is that many clumsily educated Americans have been fully expecting some sort of wacky Hollywood - style apocalypse scenario as a result of all those dire prognostications , and are now feeling a little ripped off .
" Where is my wrathful hurricane ? " they demand in response to all the dire - but - boring scientific info about , say , melting ice caps and severe weather conditions in places most of them do n't actually live .
" Where are the screaming frogs ?
Where is the tidal wave crashing over the Himalayas with John Cusack yelling in panic ?
I still have to wear a jacket in December !
Global warming , my meat - loving American ass ! "
8 ) Mmm , meat .
Did you know upwards of 50 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions come not from SUVs , factories or all of the various chemicals injected into the " Real Housewives , " but from livestock at the world 's massive industrial feedlots , in the form of methane gas the very unhappy cows pump out like small factories , along with feed growin ' and transport ?
True .
In other words , at the heart of the climate change crisis that fewer people actually think we 're responsible for , lies our gluttonous desire for cheap , inhumane , hormone - injected , chemical - blasted meat .
Translation :
You really want to help the planet ?
Eat better .
And shut down all the McDonalds .
9 ) Attention , confused , unwed , undereducated American teen girl !
Want to assure you get pregnant and contribute nicely to the dire teen pregnancy stats the fundamentalists and moral crusaders are always trotting out as evidence of humanity 's debauched downfall ?
That 's easy : Just live in a state where fundamentalist religion dominates !
Turns out your odds of getting knocked up in one of America 's sanctimonious , sexually uninformed flyover states are much higher than , say , in an educated , godless liberal city , presumably because a higher percentage of folk who live there shun birth control , have god -awful / nonexistent sex education and are generally terrified of their bodies , sex , sticky slippery things that go bump in the night .
Is n't irony fun ?
10 ) But in the end , none of that really matters , because God gave us the Earth to burn , chop , consume , pollute as much as we damn well please .
Have you heard ?
To hell with reverence and integrity and treading lightly .
He supplied us with all these bountiful riches because
He wanted us to gobble it all up as fast as possible .
I mean , obviously .
You have but to ask any high - ranking Republican -- like , say , effeminate sea slug Lindsay Graham from South Carolina , who , when asked about energy policy , will tell you flat out , " We must use the coal God gave us . "
Is n't that touching ?
Make you proud to be a human ?
It 's still the mindset of millions .
Do not cherish or conserve or sit in humble awe .
Instead merely drill , nuke and devour .
Hey , it 's what Jesus wanted .
Unless it was n't .
Did n't you already suspect as much ?

spaceships , now with black hole reactors ?
Can we turn black holes into a way to explore space at relativistic speeds ?
A pair of physicists thinks it may be plausible if we have enough powerful lasers ...
Once upon a time , we took a look at why creating black holes in particle colliders and using them to generate energy for our power grids was fraught with problems .
However , if at sometime in the future we could scale up our lasers and use them to create a black hole with a mass energy equivalent of a million tons , relativistic rocketry would be within our reach .
Artificial black holes that small would evaporate away in about a century or so while radiating so much energy , they could power a spacecraft to near light speed in just a decades .
Or at least that ’s the big idea advanced in a paper by Louis Crane and Shawn Westmoreland , mathematicians with a passion for theoretical physics and inspired by science fiction novels which sought to provide exotic power sources for highly advanced alien civilizations crisscrossing the cosmos in giant spacecraft at their leisure .
The math seems to be in their favor .
While the resulting black hole would require a 8.99 × 1027 J burst from a laser array and be approximately the size of an atom across , it would be just big and stable enough to feed on matter around it , creating an accretion and a whole variety of energetic phenomena which could be harnessed to drive a spaceship forward .
Whether collecting gamma rays coming from the accretion process or antimatter and matter particles created in the turbulent environment around the tiny black hole annihilating each other , all it takes is the right design to harness all this power and convert it into exhaust .
Since this is all happening on an atomic scale , it ’s deceptively easy to think that you ’d just get a small trickle of energy , but remember , you ’re working with millions of tons of swirling energy .
And since its radius is so small , fuel close to the event horizon would be experiencing stunning gravitational tides .
Once you ’ve spent the black hole ’s usefulness , you could just throw it out into empty space where it would probably evaporate into nothing or take eons to grow into the size category we would expect from a stellar object .
Though before we start climbing into our very own black hole powered spacecraft , there are a few problems to resolve .
First is how to create the initial massive burst of energy .
Crane and Westmoreland propose a nuclear laser array which they concede would have to be of immense proportions , but could be powered up by a black hole of their creation to make the next one far more easily .
The second issue is black hole charge .
Inside the object , energy would be so dense , it would pass through even the densest ordinary matter with about the same ease as we pass through air .
Give it some charge and the electrostatic repulsion could propel it into space or right through a planet .
When traveling in a spacecraft , you do n’t necessarily want your power source to make a sudden break for it so the black hole itself would have to be static and completely neutral as far as charge .
To not only create a gravitational ghost , but to do it according to very specific parameters would take precision as well as the kind of advanced technology we could only conceive as a list of equations for now .

Are Black Hole Starships Possible ?

Many Americans were puzzled by the news , in 1902 , that United States soldiers were torturing Filipinos with water .
The United States , throughout its emergence as a world power , had spoken the language of liberation , rescue , and freedom .
This was the language that , when coupled with expanding military and commercial ambitions , had helped launch two very different wars .
The first had been in 1898 , against Spain , whose remaining empire was crumbling in the face of popular revolts in two of its colonies , Cuba and the Philippines .
The brief campaign was pitched to the American public in terms of freedom and national honor ( the U.S.S. Maine had blown up mysteriously in Havana Harbor ) , rather than of sugar and naval bases , and resulted in a formally independent Cuba .
A picture of a “ water detail , ” reportedly taken in May , 1901 , in Sual , the Philippines .
“ It is a terrible torture , ” one soldier wrote .
ATTRIBUTED TO CORPORAL GEORGE J. VENNAGE / OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY RARE BOOKS AND MANUSCRIPTS LIBRARY
The Americans were not done liberating .
Rising trade in East Asia suggested to imperialists that the Philippines , Spain ’s largest colony , might serve as an effective “ stepping stone ” to China ’s markets .
U.S. naval plans included provisions for an attack on the Spanish Navy in the event of war , and led to a decisive victory against the Spanish fleet at Manila Bay in May , 1898 .
Shortly afterward , Commodore George Dewey returned the exiled Filipino revolutionary Emilio Aguinaldo to the islands .
Aguinaldo defeated Spanish forces on land , declared the Philippines independent in June , and organized a government led by the Philippine élite .
During the next half year , it became clear that American and Filipino visions for the islands ’ future were at odds .
U.S. forces seized Manila from Spain — keeping the army of their ostensible ally Aguinaldo from entering the city — and President William McKinley refused to recognize Filipino claims to independence , pushing his negotiators to demand that Spain cede sovereignty over the islands to the United States , while talking about Filipinos ’ need for “ benevolent assimilation . ”
Aguinaldo and some of his advisers , who had been inspired by the United States as a model republic and had greeted its soldiers as liberators , became increasingly suspicious of American motivations .
When , after a period of mounting tensions , a U.S. sentry fired on Filipino soldiers outside Manila in February , 1899 , the second war erupted , just days before the Senate ratified a treaty with Spain securing American sovereignty over the islands in exchange for twenty million dollars .
In the next three years , U.S. troops waged a war to “ free ” the islands ’ population from the regime that Aguinaldo had established .
The conflict cost the lives of hundreds of thousands of Filipinos and about four thousand U.S. soldiers .
Within the first year of the war , news of atrocities by U.S. forces — the torching of villages , the killing of prisoners — began to appear in American newspapers .
Although the U.S. military censored outgoing cables , stories crossed the Pacific through the mail , which was n’t censored .
Soldiers , in their letters home , wrote about extreme violence against Filipinos , alongside complaints about the weather , the food , and their officers ; and some of these letters were published in home - town newspapers .
A letter by A. F. Miller , of the 32nd Volunteer Infantry Regiment , published in the Omaha World - Herald in May , 1900 , told of how Miller ’s unit uncovered hidden weapons by subjecting a prisoner to what he and others called the “ water cure . ”
“ Now , this is the way we give them the water cure , ” he explained .
“ Lay them on their backs , a man standing on each hand and each foot , then put a round stick in the mouth and pour a pail of water in the mouth and nose , and if they do n’t give up pour in another pail .
They swell up like toads .
I ’ll tell you it is a terrible torture . ”
On occasion , someone — a local antiwar activist , one suspects — forwarded these clippings to centers of anti-imperialist publishing in the Northeast .
But the war ’s critics were at first hesitant to do much with them : they were hard to substantiate , and they would , it was felt , subject the publishers to charges of anti-Americanism .
This was especially true as the politics of imperialism became entangled in the 1900 Presidential campaign .
As the Democratic candidate , William Jennings Bryan , clashed with the Republican incumbent over imperialism , which the Democrats called “ the paramount issue , ” critics of the war had to defend themselves against accusations of having treasonously inspired the insurgency , prolonged the conflict , and betrayed American soldiers .
But , after McKinley won a second term , the critics may have felt that they had little to lose .
Ultimately , outraged dissenters — chief among them the relentless Philadelphia - based reformer Herbert Welsh — forced the question of U.S. atrocities into the light .
Welsh , who was descended from a wealthy merchant family , might have seemed an unlikely investigator of military abuse at the edge of empire .
His main antagonists had previously been Philadelphia ’s party bosses , whose sordid machinations were extensively reported in Welsh ’s earnest upstart weekly , City and State .
Yet he had also been a founder of the “ Indian rights ” movement , which attempted to curtail white violence and fraud while pursuing Native American “ civilization ” through Christianity , U.S. citizenship , and individual land tenure .
An expansive concern with bloodshed and corruption at the nation ’s periphery is perhaps what drew Welsh ’s imagination from the Dakotas to Southeast Asia .
He had initially been skeptical of reports of misconduct by U.S. troops .
But by late 1901 , faced with what he considered “ overwhelming ” proof , Welsh emerged as a single - minded campaigner for the exposure and punishment of atrocities , running an idiosyncratic investigation out of his Philadelphia offices .
As one who “ professes to believe in the gospel of Christ , ” he declared , he felt obliged to condemn “ the cruelties and barbarities which have been perpetrated under our flag in the Philippines . ”
Only the vigorous pursuit of justice could restore “ the credit of the American nation in the eyes of the civilized world . ”
By early 1902 , three assistants to Welsh were chasing down returning soldiers for their testimony , and Philippine “ cruelties ” began to crowd Philadelphia ’s party bosses from the pages of City and State .
At about the same time , Senator George Frisbie Hoar , of Massachusetts , an eloquent speaker and one of the few Republican opponents of the war , was persuaded by “ letters in large numbers ” from soldiers to call for a special investigation .
He proposed the formation of an independent committee , but Senator Henry Cabot Lodge , another Massachusetts Republican , insisted that the hearings take place inside his own , majority - Republican Committee on the Philippines .
The investigation began at the end of January , 1902 , and , in the months that followed , two distinct visions of the hearings emerged .
Hoar had hoped for a broad examination of the conduct of the war ; Lodge , along with the Republican majority , wanted to keep the focus on the present , and was “ not convinced ” of the need to delve into “ some of the disputed questions of the past . ”
For the next ten weeks , prominent military and civilian officials expounded on the progress of American arms , the illegitimacy of Aguinaldo ’s government , its victimization of Filipinos , and the population ’s incapacity for self - government and hunger for American tutelage .
Still , the subject of what was called , with a late - Victorian delicacy , “ cruelties ” by U.S. troops arose a few days into the hearings , at the outset of three weeks ’ testimony by William Howard Taft .
A Republican judge from Ohio , Taft had been sent to the islands to head the Philippine Commission , the core of the still prospective “ postwar ” government .
He was speaking about the Federal Party , an élite body of collaborating Filipinos who were aiding “ pacification , ” when Senator Thomas Patterson , a Democrat from Colorado , abruptly inquired about “ the use of the so - called water cure in securing the surrender of guns . ”
Taft replied that he “ had intended to speak of the charges of torture which were made from time to time . ”
He then allowed himself to be redirected by the young Indiana senator Albert Beveridge , an ardent imperialist who wanted to discuss the deportation of Filipino “ irreconcilables ” to Guam .
But antiwar senators proved persistent .
Minutes later , Senator Charles A. Culberson , a Democrat from Texas , pushed again .
This time , Taft conceded :
That cruelties have been inflicted ; that people have been shot when they ought not to have been ; that there have been in individual instances of water cure , that torture which I believe involves pouring water down the throat so that the man swells and gets the impression that he is going to be suffocated and then tells what he knows , which was a frequent treatment under the Spaniards , I am told — all these things are true .
Taft then immediately tried to contain the moral and political implications of the admission .
Military officers had repeatedly issued statements condemning “ such methods , ” he claimed , backing up their warnings with investigations and courts - martial .
He also pointed to “ some rather amusing instances ” in which , he maintained , Filipinos had invited torture .
Eager to share intelligence with the Americans , but needing a plausible cover , these Filipinos , in Taft ’s recounting , had presented themselves and “ said they would not say anything until they were tortured . ”
In many cases , it appeared , American forces had been only too happy to oblige them .
Less than two weeks later , on February 17 , 1902 , the Administration delivered to the Lodge committee a fervent response that was tonally at odds with Taft ’s jocular testimony .
Submitted by Secretary of War Elihu Root , the report proclaimed that “ charges in the public press of cruelty and oppression exercised by our soldiers towards natives of the Philippines ” had been either “ unfounded or grossly exaggerated . ”
The document , entitled “ Charges of Cruelty , Etc. , to the Natives of the Philippines , ” was an unsubtle exercise in the politics of proportion .
A meagre forty - four pages related to allegations of torture and abuse of Filipinos by U.S. soldiers ; almost four hundred pages were devoted to records of military tribunals convened to try Filipinos for “ cruelties ” against their countrymen .
If the committee sought atrocities , Root suggested , it need look no further than the Filipino insurgency , which had been “ conducted with the barbarous cruelty common among uncivilized races . ”
The relatively slender ledger of courts - martial was not , for Root , evidence of the unevenness of U.S. military justice on the islands .
Rather , it showed that the American campaign had been carried out “ with scrupulous regard for the rules of civilized warfare , with careful and genuine consideration for the prisoner and the noncombatant , with self - restraint , and with humanity never surpassed , if ever equaled , in any conflict , worthy only of praise , and reflecting credit on the American people . ”
The scale of abuses in the Philippines remains unknowable , but , as early as March , rhetoric like Root ’s was being undercut by further revelations from the islands .
When Major Littleton Waller , of the Marines , appeared before a court - martial in Manila that month , unprecedented public attention fell on the brutal extremities of U.S. combat , specifically on the island of Samar in late 1901 .
In the wake of a surprise attack by Filipino revolutionaries on American troops in the town of Balangiga , which had killed forty - eight of seventy - four members of an American Army company , Waller and his forces were deployed on a search - and - destroy mission across the island .
During an ill - fated march into the island ’s uncharted interior , Waller had become lost , feverish , and paranoid .
Believing that Filipino guides and carriers in the service of his marines were guilty of treachery , he ordered eleven of them summarily shot .
During his court - martial , Waller testified that he had been under orders from the volatile , aging Brigadier General Jacob Smith ( “ Hell - Roaring Jake , ” to his comrades ) to transform the island into a “ howling wilderness , ” to “ kill and burn ” to the greatest degree possible —
“ The more you kill and burn , the better it will please me ” — and to shoot anyone “ capable of bearing arms . ”
According to Waller , when he asked Smith what this last stipulation meant in practical terms , Smith had clarified that he thought that ten - year - old Filipino boys were capable of bearing arms .
( In light of those orders , Waller was acquitted . )
The disclosures stirred indignation in the United States but also prompted rousing defenses .
Smith was court - martialled that spring , and was found guilty of “ conduct to the prejudice of good order and military discipline . ”
Yet the penalty was slight : he was simply reprimanded and made to retire early .
Root then used the opportunity to tout the restraint that the U.S. forces had shown , given their “ desperate struggle ” against “ a cruel and savage foe . ”
The Lodge committee , meanwhile , maintained its equanimity , with a steady procession of generals and officials recounting the success and benevolence of American operations .
That is what , on April 14th , made the testimony of Charles S. Riley , a clerk at a Massachusetts plumbing - and - steam - fitting company , so explosive .
A letter from Riley had been published in the Northampton Daily Herald in March of the previous year , describing the water - cure torture of Tobeniano Ealdama , the presidente of the town of Igbaras , where Riley , then a sergeant in the 26th Volunteer Infantry , had been stationed .
Herbert Welsh had learned of Riley , and enlisted him , among other soldiers , to testify before the committee .
Amid the bullying questions of pro-war senators , Riley ’s account of the events of November 27 , 1900 , unfolded , and it was startlingly at odds with most official accounts .
Upon entering the town ’s convent , which had been seized as a headquarters , Riley had witnessed Ealdama being bound and forced full of water , while supervised by a contract surgeon and Captain Edwin Glenn , a judge advocate .
Ealdama ’s throat had been “ held so he could not prevent swallowing the water , so that he had to allow the water to run into his stomach ” ; the water was then “ forced out of him by pressing a foot on his stomach or else with [ the soldiers ’ ] hands . ”
The ostensible goal of the water cure was to obtain intelligence : after a second round of torture , carried out in front of the convent by a “ water detail ” of five or six men , Ealdama confessed to serving as a captain in the insurgency .
He then led U.S. forces into the bush in search of insurgents .
After their return to Igbaras , that night , Glenn had ordered that the town , consisting of between four and five hundred houses , be burned to the ground , as Riley explained , “ on account of the condition of affairs exposed by the treatment . ”
Riley ’s testimony , which was confirmed by another member of the unit , was inconvenient , especially coming after official declarations about America ’s “ civilized ” warfare .
The next day , Secretary of War Root directed that a court - martial be held in San Francisco and cabled the general in charge of the Philippines to transport to the West Coast Glenn and any witnesses who could be located .
“ The President desires to know in the fullest and most circumstantial manner all the facts , nothing concealed and no man being for any reason favored or shielded , ” Root declared .
Yet in the cable Root assured the general , well in advance of the facts , that “ the violations of law and humanity , of which these cases , if true , are examples , will prove to be few and occasional , and not to characterize the conduct of the army generally in the Philippines . ”
Most significant , though , was the decision , possibly at Glenn ’s request , to shift the location of the court - martial from San Francisco to Catbalogan , in the Philippines , close to sympathetic officers fighting a war , and an ocean away from the accusing witnesses , whose units had returned home .
Glenn had objected to a trial in America because , he said , there was a “ high state of excitement in the United States upon the subject of the so - called water cure and the consequent misunderstanding of what was meant by that term . ”
The trial lasted a week .
When Ealdama testified about his experience —
“ My stomach and throat pained me , and also the nose where they passed the salt water through ” — Glenn interrupted , trying to minimize the man ’s suffering by claiming ( incorrectly ) that Ealdama had stated that he had experienced pain only “ as [ the water ] passed through . ”
Glenn defended his innocence by defending the water cure itself .
He maintained that the torture of Ealdama was “ a legitimate exercise of force under the laws of war , ” being “ justified by military necessity . ”
In making this case , Glenn shifted the focus to the enemy ’s tactics .
He emphasized the treachery of Ealdama , who had been tried and convicted by a military commission a year earlier as a “ war traitor , ” for aiding the insurgency .
Testimony was presented by U.S. military officers and Filipinos concerning the insurgency ’s guerrilla tactics , which violated the norms of “ civilized war . ”
Found guilty , Glenn was sentenced to a one - month suspension and a fifty - dollar fine .
“ The court is thus lenient , ” the sentence read , “ on account of the circumstances as shown in evidence . ”
( Glenn retired from the Army , in 1919 , as a brigadier general . )
Meanwhile , Ealdama , twice tortured by Glenn ’s forces , was serving a sentence of ten years ’ hard labor ; he had been temporarily released to enable him to testify against his torturer .
The vote of the court - martial at Catbalogan had been unanimous , but at least one prominent dissenter within the Army registered his disapproval .
Judge Advocate General George B. Davis , forwarding the trial records to Root , wrote an introductory memorandum that seethed with indignation .
Glenn ’s sentence , in his view , was “ inadequate to the offense established by the testimony of the witnesses and the admission of the accused . ”
Paragraph 16 of the General Orders , No. 100 , the Army ’s Civil War -era combat regulations , could not have been clearer : “ Military necessity does not admit of cruelty — that is , the infliction of suffering for the sake of suffering or for revenge , nor of maiming or wounding except in fight , nor of torture to extort confessions . ”
Davis conceded that , in a “ rare or isolated case , ” force might legitimately be used in “ obtaining the unwilling service ” of a guide , if justified as a “ measure of emergency . ”
But a careful examination of the events preceding the tortures at Igbaras revealed that “ no such case existed . ”
Furthermore , Glenn had described the water cure as “ the habitual method of obtaining information from individual insurgents ” — in other words , as “ a method of conducting operations . ”
But the operational use of torture , Davis stressed , was strictly forbidden .
Regarding a subsequent water - cure court - martial , he wrote , “ No modern state , which is a party to international law , can sanction , either expressly or by a silence which imports consent , a resort to torture with a view to obtain confessions , as an incident to its military operations . ”
Otherwise , he inquired , “ where is the line to be drawn ? ”
And he rehearsed an unsettling , judicial calibration of pain :

“ It is the sacred principles enshrined in the United Nations charter to which the American people will henceforth pledge their allegiance . ”
George H.W. Bush addressing the General Assembly of the U.N , February 1 , 1992
The machine of mass media is working overdrive now that the Copenhagen summit is approaching .
All major media outlets have by now obviously received their talking - points which have an strangely similar ring about them all across the board .
Even a superficial comparative study in the overall reporting reveals not only a stunning disregard for national sovereignty , but a willingness to support carbon - taxes imposed by a- as John P. Holdren puts it - “ planetary regime ” .
Oxford professor Dieter Helm : “ I ’m in favor of quite a low carbon tax to start with – for political economy reasons , to get it in place . ”
Last month experts told the Second Committee Panel Discussion of the UN General Assembly that “ a new regime of governance was under way in the global financial system . ”
The same is being said about global climate measures , global resource management and global development .
The mass media is not only setting the agenda themselves , they more often than not simply parrot the globalists that are being shoved in our face on a daily basis .
Many of whom have a Ph.D. behind their name .
Under the header ‘ Carbon Tax ’ is sensible , and perhaps inevitable , advocate says ‘ , the Los Angeles Times quotes Oxford professor Dieter Helm stating :
“ (..)
I ’m in favor of quite a low carbon tax to start with – for political economy reasons , to get it in place , ( … ) .
Across Europe , my guess is within five years everybody will have a carbon tax … ”
This , according to Helm , will make sure that the United States will eventually be forced into the global carbon tax policy as well :
“ (… ) is everybody else doing it ?
That ’s a very good protection for politicians .
The answer is yes , they are . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
Back in December of 2001 , the Africa division of the UN Development Programme apparently already seriously considered such a tax :
“ The main energy sources that would be affected by a carbon tax include coal , petroleum , kerosene and natural gas .
The tax would be reflected in an increase in their price , at a level based on the capacity of each type of fuel to emit carbon dioxide . ”
Answering the question who would collect the taxes and enforce such a global tax policy , the UN panel was quite clear :
“ The panel said a new international tax organization should be created to assume all functions performed by existing institutions .
It would serve as a global intergovernmental forum for international cooperation on all tax issues .
It would also help resolve conflicts between countries and help them to increase tax revenue by fostering information exchanges and measures that could reduce tax evasion on investment and personal income earned at home and abroad . ”
This sounds a lot like John P. Holdren does n’t it , exclaiming in Ecoscience that “ a Planetary Regime - sort of an international superagency for population , resources , and environment ” could impose global policy and enforce it .
“ Such a comprehensive Planetary Regime ” , said Holdren , “ could control the development , administration , conservation , and distribution of all natural resources , renewable or nonrenewable , at least insofar as international implications exist . ”
Furthermore , the UN panel advocated in 2001 :
“ We thus endorse the Commission ’s proposal to create a global council at the highest political level to provide leadership on issues of global governance .
The proposed council would be more broadly based than the G7 or the Bretton Woods institutions . ”
A d v e r t i s e m e n t
In 2007 , Reuters quoted Mr. Global Warming Himself , Al Gore as saying that a global carbon trading scheme could be “ quite efficient if the world ’s top polluters , the United States and China , fully joined . ”
Gore also stated that a direct tax on carbon would certainly be “ an even simpler and more direct measure . ”
It was the Bilderberg - appointed Herman Van Rompuy - the new EU - president - who stated recently that “ The Climate Conference in Copenhagen is another step towards the global management of our planet . ”
He also announced that 2009 would be the “ first year of global governance . ”
And he ’s not the first to call for such global management .
All people who occupy a position of power in the infrastructure of the New World Order have called for it since its very conception shortly after World War II .
As a preface to the coming Copenhagen summit in December , the United Nations Population Fund in a recently published ‘ State of the Population 2009 ‘ is pushing for global reproductive health services .
This means not only universal access to ‘ family planning ’ but also better access to abortion facilities .
Humans , after all , are supposed to be the prime driver of climate change and therefore : less humans means honouring Mother Earth .
In the foreword , the executive director of the UNFPA , Thoraya Obaid addresses the fake global warming hype , saying that “ floods , storms and rising seas ” will soon envelope the planet if not for quick , decisive and global efforts to combat these calamities .
“ A Copenhagen agreement that helps people to reduce greenhouse - gas emissions and adapt to climate change by harnessing the insight and creativity of women and men would launch a genuinely effective long - term global strategy to deal with climate change . ”
Global strategy .
That ’s the talking point we hear over and over again from all agencies , UN or otherwise , who have an interest in profiting from the deal they are proposing .
Never mind that all nation - states who sign on to the Copenhagen treaty will effectively forfeit their representative systems to this global authority , deciding which taxes will be paid by which nation - state .
In the end , all roads seem to lead to a “ planetary regime ” envisioned by the elite long before “ global warming ” was even heard of .

Comment on this article
With the launch of the PSPgo came the launch of PSP Minis as well .
For those do n’t know , Minis are considered “ bite sized ” games that are for quick on the go gaming .
It just so happens with the recent launch of these titles some of the games are also available on the App Store .
Several developers have been a success on the App Store know the good and bad of both the PSN and App Store .
Kimmo Vihola , the CEO of the developer Mountain Sheep ( the developer behind Minigore ) , was more than willing to give his views on the different experiences of publishing titles on the PSN and the App Store .
He had this to say about the different submission processes of the two services .
“ The QA process is much more predictable with Sony and their turnaround times are awesome .
The App Store , on the other hand , sees many more new applications a day going through their pipeline , ” Vihola added .
“ So many , in fact , that their process is starting to crack from the seams .
With approval times varying from a couple of days to up to six weeks , not getting your submission through can cost you a lot of time .
Apple should consider changing their process such that re-submissions take a priority over new submissions .
We are already a licensed developer for the PSP so we did n’t have to jump through any hoops to get into the Minis .
I ’d imagine the sign - up is fairly similar for both Apple and Sony — with the notable exception you need to be a business entity to develop for the Minis . ”
Vihola also has high hopes for the future of the PSN Mini Store .
He understands that it is still in the beginning stages , and that many improvements will come down the line .
“ Requiring the system to be updated to latest version to access the store can also be a little distracting at times .
When you want to access the store , you do n’t want to be waiting until the battery charges and an update is installed . ”
Some other things that Vihola said that he would like to see implemented down the line include screenshots , video previews , and even background downloading .
Regardless , the Minis are a big hit amongst PSP owners , and the future for these new titles is a bright one .
The ideas that Vihola has are definitely good ones , and Sony hopefully would be able to implement these somehow via store update or firmware update ( background downloading ) .

An openly anti-Semitic French comedian admitted Saturday that he received funds from Iran in order to wage a war of culture against Zionism .
Dieudonné M'bala M'bala told reporters of the meeting held a week ago between himself and Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad
" We received a substantial budget allowing us to make movies on par with Hollywood , which serves as the long arm of Zionist culture , " he said at a press conference in Paris .
Dieudonné admitted that he intended to produce two films on the subject of slavery and the war in Algiers in order to " show a different point of view on blacks than the one shown by Spielberg " .
The 43 - year old comedian from Cameroon , who has founded an anti-Zionist political party , has been indicted by French courts for his anti-Semitic outbursts on numerous occasions .
On one occasion , he referred to Holocaust remembrance as " pornographic " .
On another , he was fined 5,000 euros for comparing Jews to slave traders .
AFP reports that the press conference held Saturday was a stiff affair , and that journalists present there had to undergo invasive security checks .
Dieudonné told reporters that " Ahmadinejad is better loved in Iran than Sarkozy in France " .
He commended the Iranian leader for " surviving a media lynch " .
Dieudonné also called reformist sentiment against the hardline leader and the violent protests that followed his reelection " Zionist propaganda " .
What is Christian Fundamentalism ?
by Lewis Loflin
Quoting Grolier Electronic Publishing :
Fundamentalism is a term popularly used to describe strict adherence to Christian doctrines based on a literal interpretation of the Bible .
This usage derives from a late - 19th - and early - 20th - century transdenominational Protestant movement that opposed the accommodation of Christian doctrine to modern scientific theory and philosophy .
Are Christian fundamentalists just raving , Bible - thumping fanatics ?
The answer for many is no .
In fact , they are a very diverse and often divided group .
Here I will try to dispel myths and take up where the above dictionary definition leaves off .
Let 's look at some of the many issues surrounding " fundamentalism " as it is today .
I will strongly note here that " fundamentalism " as used here is a political and social movement .
This is not to question Jesus or the Bible .
Two - thirds of born again Christians reject the intolerance , bigotry , and social politics of groups often affiliated with the Religious Right .
Liberals , often hostile to all Christian beliefs , also distort the issue by an over emphasis on the small number of extremists and fanatics .
Other examples include some Orthodox and Hassidic Jews , most Shiite Muslims in Iran , and most Sunni Muslims elsewhere .
Christian but not Protestant examples would be ultra-conservatives within both Roman and Eastern Orthodox Catholicism , as well as some Mormons ( though non-Mormons often consider all members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints " non-Christian " ) .
Nontheistic examples would include many Marxists and Secular Humanists , as well as other fervent atheists .
This website defines " religious fundamentalism " of all kinds as political and social , not religious .
Do n't think for one minute Christian fundamentalists are a bunch dumb rednecks , they are n't .
Their main activists are rich , white , most are " baby - boomers , and their agenda is power and money .
Their leadership is college educated and not a bunch of country bumpkins .
In the 18th century the Enlightenment and Evangelical revivals would moderate each other .
By the 1870 's until today , fundamentalist Protestantism would be at war with both modern science and personal liberty .
( Modernism ) Today fundamentalists make up about 20 percent of the American population .
Most are law - abiding citizens but about one - fourth ( 5 % of the population ) belong to assorted fringe churches and operate a kind of low - level terrorism such as attacks on abortion clinics , racism and anti-Semitism , the militia movements , etc .
They are obsessed with conspiracy theories claiming Jews , Freemasons , Satan , etc. control America and an apocalypse due any day .
The five " fundamentals " of Christian belief that were enumerated in a series of 12 paperback volumes containing scholarly essays on the Bible that appeared between 1910 and 1915 , entitled The Fundamentals .
Those included :
Biblical inerrancy
The divinity of Jesus The Virgin Birth
The belief that Jesus died to redeem humankind An expectation of the Second Coming , or physical return , of Jesus Christ to initiate his thousand - year rule of the Earth , which came to be known as the Millennium .
1 ) A strong emphasis on the inerrancy of the Bible ;
2 ) a strong hostility to modern theology and to the methods , results and implications of modern critical study of the Bible , and
3 ) an assurance that those who do not share their religious viewpoint are not really " true Christians "
They also believe in " six - day " Creationism , the doctrine that the universe was created only a few thousand years ago , rather than the billions claimed by modern science , and that God created man and woman and all the species outright , rather than by a process of evolution .
Also included is the belief that only King James Version Bible of 1611 is the only correct text .
Christians who clung to the old belief that every word of the Bible was literally true -- called biblical inerrancy , claim only the belief , they do not follow or live by the rules or teachings of Jesus .
The Protestant belief of " faith alone " which Calvin and Luther took from Saint Augustine , makes all of that at best optional or morality of any kind , irrelevant .
The only things they really see as " sin " is , matters of sex , not following their religious teaching teachings , and questioning authority .
Because Calvin , Luther , and Augustine all see humans as " depraved " and " born into sin " produces a very negative outlook on humanity .
Also their idea of the " elect " creates an attitude that they are somehow " chosen " above all others .
This puts them at odds with " mainline " or liberal Protestant churches that reject the Augustinian notions of human depravity .
Saint Augustine His Christian World View by Lewis Loflin
Fundamentalists trace their roots back to the N.T. , but fundamentalism really arises at the end of the 19th century .
They see themselves as " keepers of both the Christian heritage of the first century and the American heritage of the Puritans and the Founding Fathers , " though ; the sense of religious mission associated with the Puritans disappeared even before the American Revolution .
They will quote Puritans this and that as the foundation of America , but the Puritans founded some backwater English colonies , not the United States of America .
In fact Protestantism had been undergoing massive changes prior to the American Revolution and continues to change to this day .
The majority of Americans in 1776 ( if we exclude Indians and Catholics ) were Protestant , forming a " Protestant empire . "
The first and second " Great Awakenings " seemed to insure the role of Evangelism in America .
Those days are what fundamentalists long for .
Yet even before the American Revolution , the European Enlightenment had made inroads into Protestantism .
Some fundamentalists have a loathing of democracy when it applies equally to others .
One bitter fundamentalist had this to say , " democracy is the cause of all world problems ... humans are under the law of God , and thus they CANNOT do anything they want or speak anything they wish to speak ... democracy ultimately started with Satan ... we can't rule ourselves .
God must rule us ... those who actually set up America , and drew up the laws were people who did not favor Christianity .
Christians living during that time disagreed with those in power or rather the founding fathers .
They saw them as ultra liberals , and of course , they were .
See Democracy Not Good Government .
The American Revolution was a conservative revolution unlike the violent French Revolution that set the stage for fascism and communism .
The American founders sought liberty and freedom of conscience within the framework of the established society .
They knew issues such as slavery and the status of women could n't be resolved in their time , so they left a way open for later changes .
They emphasized individualism , which already existed within Protestant culture to begin with .
The French Revolution sought immediate change by the use of force to destroy the entire culture and society of France .
( Communism would borrow from this model . )
In Catholic France there was no real sense of individualism as in Protestantism nor did they have the earlier , far less bloody English Revolution to build on .
But it was a belief in God that did guide the Founding Fathers , but not the raving bible - god of Augustine and Calvin .
To quote : " Jefferson and other founders were Deists , believing in a universal God and a scientific universe .
Since their writings constitute the legal foundation of the government , it is worth noting what they wrote and from where they derived their principles : Natural Law .
Drawing from Locke , the Declaration of Independence grounds its legitimacy in the people ; but why are the people the ultimate authority ?
Because " they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights " and institute governments to secure these rights .
In some ways the Civil War broke the back of Protestant America .
With thousands dead and one - third of the country in ruins , changes began to occur to form a modern industrial state .
Quoting Nancy Ammerman :
Science , technology , and business were taking over where tradition , prayer and faith had left off , streams of European immigrants arriving with Catholic and Jewish traditions , and religious pluralism was becoming a fact of American life .
" Old assumptions ( mostly Protestant ) were replaced by new dogmas of industrialism , historicism , and secularism ... Religion gradually became compartmentalized in the private , family , and leisure spheres , leaving political , scientific , and economic affairs to the secular experts . "
In the human sciences , psychology and sociology began to question the nature of human responsibility , destiny , and free will .
In the natural sciences , Charles Darwin 's ideas began to change the way scholars viewed the physical universe .
While evolution in no way disproves God , it does disprove a particular fundamentalist ' view of creation .
The claims of Six - Day Creationism are the largest single problem they have because it's so discredited in every major scientific field .
In the process they discredit the entire faith .
In theology , scholars began to analyze biblical material as if it were ordinary ancient literature that reported events that might also be explained in natural , human terms .
This included a shift in public education from church dominated curriculum to one that prepared students for an industrialized and democratic society .
While fundamentalism is a reaction against modernism , it also adopted all kinds of new beliefs and practices .
Most of these churches have been infiltrated by non-Christian modern theology themselves such as Christian Identity and Christian Reconstructionism .
Much of this is loaded with the occult , racism and anti-Semitism .
Christian Identity in particular is dangerous due to its apocalyptic theology that creates a mindset of paranoia and ease of infiltration into churches .

19th Century Beginnings
The tent revival was the mainstay of many early wondering evangelists and is still with us today .
In a way these became sideshows competing for the time ( and contributions ) of small town and frontier farms all across a growing America .
Starting about 1830 a great backlash against education and scholarship in many churches began and continues to this day .
Many of America 's cult churches began here .
Many of these preachers were at best semi-literate who rejected most mainstream churches and education in general .
They tended to rely on the fallacy of the Bible being the only source of inspiration and preached their own opinions .
This is how we got so many new cults / churches of today .
In this way anything could be " the word of God . "
The rise of modern Premillennialism ( end - times theology ) is common to a variety of religious splinter groups : the Plymouth Brethren ( developed Dispensationalism ) , the Millerites ( became the Adventists ) , Mormons , Jehovah 's Witnesses , and Pentecostals .
This nonsense has infiltrated many Baptist / other churches as well .
Most of these churches try to discredit historic Christianity by claiming that all the prominent commentaries , all the church fathers , and even the Reformers ( Luther , Calvin , Knox , etc. ) were deluded by " man-made doctrines . "
New revelation " is claimed and their leaders even claimed to have received " new truth " or at other times " rediscovered truth " that had been lost since the apostles .
Enthusiasm was whipped up on the false pretense that Christ 's coming was imminent .
Frequent false predictions did not seem to deter this enthusiasm .
Dispensational Premillennialism was marketed the same way as the cult - like groups .
For these groups the only Scriptures addressed specifically to Christians were the gospel of John , Acts , and the Epistles and Book of Revelation .
Their moral code is that of the most brutal sections of the Old Testament and the Ten Commandments .
One will hear " born again " ( John ) endlessly but little relevance is paid at all to the other Gospels of Matthew , Mark , and Luke that contain the core of Jesus ' most important moral teachings .
The moral teachings of Jesus thus become optional thus fundamentalists believe they are saved and their personal conduct , no matter how un-Christian , is forgiven .
This " faith alone " nonsense is salvation for nothing .
They construct God in their own image .
It should also be noted that these cult / splinter churches all hold Catholics and mainline Protestant churches as " spirits of the Antichrist . " ( Pat Robertson )
Most of their claims are totally non-Biblical such as " secret rapture " and the word " rapture " is n't even in the KJV Bible at all .
What they really preach is their own politics and the occult .
I do not consider these churches Protestant ( they are separate sects ) and really question if they are Christian at all .
All of their leaders such as Pat Robertson , Jerry Falwell , Oral Roberts , etc. have no recognized credentials as theologians .
Yet the damage they do to the emotional well being of others can't be calculated .
This comes through leaders such men as A. T. Pierson , A. J. Gordon , and C. I. Scofield ( Scofield Bible ) to A. C. Dixon and Reuben Torrey , William Jennings BRYAN , and J. Gresham Machen .
Make no mistake , their stated purpose is to impose , with force if necessary , a theocracy and eliminate all modern scientific theory and social philosophy .
This means entire scientific fields and research would be banned , restricted , or curtailed .
All civil law as we know it today would be replaced by Biblical Law based mainly on the most brutal sections of the Old Testament .
Even many Christian churches would be banned for their lack of " Christian correctness . "
The potentially lethal mix of politics , religious bigotry , and the belief in non-Biblical dispensationalism is a menace to our free society .
This was behind the Y2 K fiasco that had fundamentalist preachers wiping egg off their faces .

The above chart came from http://www.ifas.org/library/survey/index.html, which went down in 2001 .
The similar survey for Liberals included with this original article showed similar upper income activists but differed in three important ways .
The Liberal activists also tended to be older than Christian activists and also had higher net incomes above the general public .
Second , more non-whites , but the vast majority was white .
Third , liberals tended to be less owners and more professionals such as doctors and lawyers .
This would make sense because so many of these types tend to be socialist ( anti- business ) and anti-religious .
Neither group overall represents your typical working - class American , but many working - class people tend to be more religious then college - educated types .
( Do n't get the absurd idea these religious types are stupid . )
Most interesting is the 2004 presidential election where " moral values " seemed to carry the day .
While it 's easy to say a victory for the Religious Right , in my opinion it 's more a failure of the Left and Liberalism .
Bush got almost half the Hispanic vote and 56 % ( according to CNN ) of the Catholic vote .
So is this a victory for white , fundamentalist '
Protestants or changes across the board ?
Looking at other stats on this website , as of 2000 76.5 % of the US population identified themselves as Christians while estimates of the Evangelical ( Protestant ) part of the population is between 15 - 20 % .
Secular / nonreligious / atheist / agnostic is about 15 % .
Christianity grew by 5 % between 1990 and 2000 , secular by 110 % Evangelicals do a lot of missionary work , but tend to get people to change churches as opposed to reaching non-believers .
Another interesting stat is evolution .
Atheistic evolution claims about a 9 % following while belief in God claims 91 % .
But of that 91 % for God , It 's an almost even split that half of those that believe in God ( 40 % ) believe in evolution as the work of God .
I guess it depends on the definition of God .
The important thing to note is the shift away from evangelicalism ( including Six - Day Creationism ) seems to be as adults .
45 % of scientists believe in God .
The authors of a new study published in the Medical Journal of Australia are calling for all couples considering pregnancy or in the early stages of pregnancy to be offered cystic fibrosis carrier testing .
The research is based on a prenatal testing clinic at Newcastle in New South Wales , where couples were offered the test by extracting DNA mouthwash samples .
Of the 1,000 individuals that took the test , the four couples deemed to be high risk changed their reproductive decisions to avoid having a child with cystic fibrosis .
Author Louise Christie says couples should be offered the option of having the test .
" I think that it 's important for couples to have the information , for them to make the choices first off if they want to have the screening , because some couples do not want to know that information before they have a child , " she said .
" Couples do face quite a lot of decisions in early pregnancy or before they have a baby about what tests are out there and what tests they find acceptable . "
Long before he signed with the New Jersey Devils as an undrafted free agent , David Clarkson was learning the fundamentals under the tutelage of Brendan Shanahan Both Clarkson and Chicago Blackhawks forward Dave Bolland attended Brendan Shanahan 's Hockey School at the Lakeshore Arena in Canada in the mid-1990s as kids .
" I did if for three or four years and it was amazing , " Clarkson told NHL.com .
" It 's funny when I look back on it now because at the end of the hockey school each year , Shanny would hand out a stick to a kid that had the best week and I almost ended up getting a stick every year .
I still have those gold aluminum sticks at home today , so it 's pretty special .
" It had to feel just like old times last season with the Devils when Clarkson had an opportunity to play on the same forward line with Shanahan and Dainius Zubrus -- the team 's productive checking unit .
" Shanny has so many great stories and he's been through it all , " Clarkson said .
" There 's a lot you can learn from a guy like that .
He dishes and moves the puck so well and can see the ice ; he 's never lost that and it's a huge part of his game . "

Gordon Brown says the UK will send 500 more forces personnel to Afghanistan - but only if key conditions are met .
They will be sent as long as they have the necessary equipment , if other Nato allies boost their troop numbers and more Afghan soldiers are trained .
There are currently about 9,000 UK personnel in Afghanistan .
The US is expected to announce a substantial increase in its troops next week , the BBC's Newsnight reports .
The US says no decision has been made .
Newsnight says the Obama administration has already told the UK government it will soon announce a substantial increase to its military forces in Afghanistan .
The programme understands an announcement could come next week , in time for a Nato defence ministers meeting in Bratislava .
But White House press secretary Robert Gibbs dismissed the report , saying President Barack Obama had not yet made a decision on troop numbers .
As well as the 9,000 UK personnel , there are 150 reserve troops in the country which the Ministry of Defence said would be available for further temporary deployments .
ANALYSIS BBC defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt Some say there 's also a wider political reason for announcing this decision now - just as President Obama tries to decide whether to send more American forces or scale back and focus on a narrower mission .
Troops to boost UK presence Read Nick Robinson 's thoughts Military chiefs welcomed the UK troop reinforcement , insisting their requests had been fully met but opposition parties said more details about the timing of the deployment were needed .
Speaking in the Commons , Mr Brown paid tribute to each of the 37 British service personnel killed in Afghanistan since the end of July when Parliament began its summer recess .
Describing it as a " solemn moment " , he said their sacrifices would not be forgotten .
While nothing could " erase the pain " of bereaved families , Mr Brown added that they could be proud of the actions of their loved ones and know that their " influence " would live on .
Mr Brown said he was prepared , in principle , to send an extra 500 troops to Helmand Province in southern Afghanistan - where Nato troops are fighting fierce battles with the Taliban - in response to military advice .
He said the reinforcements , which would increase overall UK numbers to 9,500 , would happen only if troops had the equipment and training necessary to perform the tasks asked of them .
' Safer Britain '
Two additional Merlin helicopters would be sent to Helmand in the near future , he told MPs , while more armoured vehicles and other specialist equipment would be provided to counter the threat of roadside bombs .
He also insisted Nato countries must bear their " fair share " of the mission by sending more troops of their own and the Afghan government had to substantially increase its own troop presence in Helmand .
Most recent UK fatalities Total deaths 2011 : 32
Only if he received such guarantees , Mr Brown said , would he be able to " justify " sending more troops .
Downing Street later said it believed the conditions for sending more troops were " achievable " and it hoped this would happen as quickly as possible .
Conservative leader David Cameron and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg paid tribute to those who had lost their lives .
But Mr Cameron said the welfare of British troops returning from combat needed to be " fundamentally re-examined " with more resources for helping the badly injured .

Mark Mardell on Obama 's dilemma
He also said it was " totally unacceptable " that some were not properly prepared for going to Afghanistan , mentioning the case of a Territorial Army soldier he said had told him he was not getting full training or pay .
Mr Brown said he would look into such claims but said he was confident that troops now in Afghanistan were " properly resourced " .
Mr Clegg welcomed the imminent arrival of more helicopters but said there must be be a " radical " change of strategy in Afghanistan with more emphasis on political reconciliation .
And Mr Brown faced criticism from his former defence secretary John Hutton who said it would have been " much more helpful " to have sent the extra troops six months ago .
British forces have been in Afghanistan since October 2001 and besides the US , the UK has the second - largest contingent of troops there .
Military commanders have said extra troops are needed to build on the progress of Operation Panther 's Claw , which saw UK forces help expel insurgents from key areas this summer .
HAVE YOUR SAY
How about instead of sending more troops we just give the existing ones the equipment they deserve Mark , Edinburgh Given the conditions placed on their deployment , the BBC 's defence correspondent Caroline Wyatt said it was unlikely the extra troops would be in Afghanistan soon .
But the announcement did send a clear message to the US as it reviews its Afghan strategy , she added .
US President Barack Obama has been considering future troop options after a request by General Stanley McChrystal , the commander of international forces in Afghanistan , for what has been widely reported as up to 40,000 more Nato troops .
The White House welcomed the UK's troop pledge as a reflection of its " continuing commitment " to the mission .
The question of UK troop numbers in Afghanistan has become highly politicised in recent months .

The ex-head of the Army , Sir Richard Dannatt , has claimed that No 10 turned down a request to send up to 2,000 more troops earlier this year - a suggestion Downing Street has denied .
But Chief of the Defence Staff , Air Chief Marshal Sir Jock Stirrup , said the 2,000 figure was a " myth " and suggested that commanders had been pushing for a total force of 9,500 troops all along .
" We never asked for 2,000 additional troops , " he said .
" We set forward a recommendation with clear military advice on what was required ....
Over the course of the year we have moved to the figure of 9,500 which is , essentially , the military advice we started off with . "
He added : " This is what we have asked for and this is what we have been given . "

GLASGOW–In a grimy lane in central Glasgow stand an abandoned brothel and a boarded - up saloon .
Partners in hopelessness , they face the dismal thoroughfare .
The building that houses them , like all its neighbours , is slated for demolition , and standing there you think : the sooner the better .
Yet from this doomed street in 1820 , a failed businessman began a journey that ended in the creation of a country .
He left his place of work in Brunswick Lane for the last time .
A ship was waiting in the River Clyde , and he boarded with his family .
Among them was his eldest surviving son , a 5 - year - old .
The boy was John A. Macdonald .
" And you 'd never know this place had anything to do with him , " said Douglas Pritchard , a Winnipeg - born architect , as he stood in the Glasgow lane and looked at the hoardings and the flaking paint and the green weeds growing in the cracks .
" If this was connected to George Washington , the Americans would have covered it in gold .
There 'd be arrows pointing the way from miles around , " Pritchard said .
" Not even a plaque . "
" It 's a crying shame , " said John McNamee , a local politician who has been agitating for a memorial to Macdonald , Canada 's first prime minister .
" It 's a shame and a scandal .
Macdonald was a great man and he founded a great country – one of the beacons of hope for immigrants from everywhere in the world . "
McNamee is a councillor in the sprawling municipality of South Lanarkshire that borders Glasgow to the east .
An unabashed admirer of Canada , three years ago he tried to interest Ottawa in his plan .
The Prime Minister 's Office bounced McNamee 's query to Canadian Heritage , which took 2 1 / 2 months to tell him they'd be sure to keep it in mind .
The Brunswick Lane site is owned by Selfridges , a high - end British department store .
Selfridges in turn is owned by Toronto billionaire Galen Weston .
This week , learning that their Glasgow site was connected to Macdonald , Selfridges agreed to include a memorial in its development plans .
Veteran Glasgow city councillor Colin Deans , born in Scotland but raised in Nova Scotia , is a proponent of a Macdonald memorial , as is councillor Catherine McMaster .
" I can assure you , " McMaster said in an email , " that I will be active and robust in my promotion of the memorial to Sir John A. Macdonald . "
Part of the problem with remembering Macdonald in Glasgow is deciding where to do it .
It is not certain that he was born in Brunswick Lane .
Records show his father worked there , at two addresses , and families often lived in rooms attached to the breadwinner 's business .
In a black - and - white documentary shot in a crowded pub in Brunswick Lane 40 years ago , Saskatchewan 's Hugh Gainsford , who claims to be Macdonald 's only living descendant , says his great - grandfather was born on the top floor .
A commemorative tablet put up by the Ontario government on a church wall two blocks away asserts that Macdonald was born in the local parish .
But some believe Macdonald was born on the other side of the River Clyde , where the birth was registered .
An early Macdonald biography also puts the birthplace there , " in a row of stone tenement houses near the ferry landing , " an area razed long ago .
Wherever he was born , the only address in Glasgow incontestably connected to him is the shabby street now waiting for the wrecker .
" He may not have been born there , " said Graham MacDonell , a Canadian - born genealogist who lives in Scotland and has amassed an archive on Macdonald , " but he would have played there as a boy .
" He 'd have gone there with his father .
He knew the street . "
McNamee recalled that when he heard the news that Selfridges had agreed to include a memorial in its development plans , he said , " Businesses are more agile than government .
In this economic climate , that 's what it takes . "
Final development will not take place until the economy picks up , but Steve Inch , Glasgow 's top planner , says demolition will go ahead in about six months , probably to make a parking lot .
Fortunately , there is a way to preserve the Brunwick Lane property – digitally .
Pritchard , who now works at the Glasgow School of Art , has pioneered a technique of laser - scanning buildings to create three - dimensional images .
In Scotland , he has scanned and modelled such sites as Stirling Castle .

Once the hoardings have been pulled off in Brunswick Lane , Pritchard , in an afternoon of scanning that will cost Selfridges about $ 1,500 , will capture an image of the building , down to the finest detail .
The street may be rubble but the building will remain – on a disk .
One of the Americans convicted in absentia by an Italian court for her part in the 2003 abduction of a Muslim cleric by CIA operatives has acknowledged they " broke the law " and complained she was given insufficient protection by her superiors in Washington .
Sabrina deSousa , employed in the US consulate offices in Milan at the time of the abduction , made clear in an interview with ABC News that she was disgruntled that she and the other 22 Americans who were convicted by a Milan court on Wednesday had been left to fend for themselves by their country .
Ms deSousa , who has not explicitly said she was working for the CIA , was sentenced to five years by the judge in the case .
Indeed on the day that the cleric , known as Abu Omar , was taken from the street and whisked first to Germany and thereafter to Egypt , she was out of the city on a skiing break .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The longest sentence , of eight years , was given to the former Milan CIA station chief , Robert Seldon Lady .
There seems little likelihood that the convicted Americans will serve their terms , not least because Italy has declined to seek their extradition from the US , partly in the interest of US - Italian relations .
It is probably true , however , that the 22 will always run the risk of arrest if they leave the US territory .
Saying she felt " abandoned and betrayed " as the trial unfolded over three years , Ms deSousa said " everything I did was approved by Washington ... and we are paying for the mistakes right now , whoever authorised this . "
That so many former and current CIA operatives should have been dragged through a foreign court has begun to rankle Capitol Hill .
" I think these people have been hung out to dry , " complained Republican congressman Pete Hoekstra of the House Intelligence Committee .
" They 're taking the fall for a decision that was made by their superiors . "
The CIA will not comment on the case , which is seen as a rebuke to the administration of George W Bush .
In an interview earlier this year with an Italian newspaper , Mr Lady was candid about the seizure of the cleric .
" Of course it was an illegal operation , " the newspaper quoted him .
" But that 's our job .
We 're at war against terrorism " .
Tea time , that most soothing of British institutions , can be a rather heated affair depending on who you have around the table .
Those from the Midlands and north will say that what I call a crumpet is a pikelet .
Antipodeans argue that a pikelet is a drop scone .
And Americans gaze disappointedly at my muffins , yearning for a cakier offering filled with fruit , nuts , even chocolate .
But whatever you call them , they 're all vehicles for butter ( a dollop or two of jam would n't go amiss , either ) .
Another thing they have in common is that they 're all yeasty doughs or sconey batters traditionally cooked on a griddle .
The word muffin comes from the old French word for soft bread , moufflet , and the dough is indeed more bread - like than the crumpet and pikelet .
Proper muffins should be eaten as fresh as possible , and do n't cut them in half , because that makes them tough .
Hannah Glasse described it perfectly in The Art Of Cookery Made Plain And Easy way back in 1747 : " Toast them with a Fork crisp on both Sides , then with your Hand pull them open , and they will be like a Honey - Comb ; lay in as much Butter as you intend to use , then clap them together again , and set it by the Fire , when you think the Butter is melted turn them , that both Sides may be butter 'd alike , but do n't touch them with a Knife , either to spread or cut them open , if you do they will be as heavy as Lead . "
Crumpets are made from a thickish , yeasty batter and poured into rings .
If you do n't have rings , make thinner pancakes , or pikelets .
Whether they are thick or thin , crumpets or pikelets , toast on the flattened bottom first and then on the holey side , so that maximum butter will melt into the crisp toasted holes .
Now all you need is a big pot of tea , a fire and , possibly , a clean shirt standing by .
Crumpets
Hugely satisfying to make .
Makes 12 .
450g plain white flour
350 ml warm milk
350 ml warm water ( approximately )
5g powdered dried yeast
10g salt
1 tsp baking powder
A little sunflower or vegetable oil
In a bowl , whisk the flour , milk , water and yeast into a rather runny batter the consistency of single cream .
Cover with cling - film and leave for an hour until really bubbly ( or three to four hours , if need be ) .
Heat a heavy - based frying pan or flat griddle over a medium - high heat .
Whisk the salt and baking powder into the batter .
Lightly grease the crumpet rings and pan .
Put one ring in the pan , fill to just below the top – the batter should stay in the ring and lots of holes should appear on the surface after a minute or two .
( If it dribbles out underneath , it is too thin , so whisk a little more flour into your batter mix .
If lots of holes do n't form , it 's too thick , so whisk in some water . )
Assuming your test crumpet is OK , after five minutes or so , when the surface is just set , flip it over , ring and all .
( If the cooked base seems too dark , turn down the heat . )
Cook for two to three minutes , until golden on the other side .
Repeat with the remaining batter in batches .
Butter and eat at once , or cool on a wire rack for toasting later .
A pikelet variation
If you do n't have rings , whisk an extra 50g flour into the batter , to stiffen it , dollop spoonfuls into a greased , warmed pan and cook for a couple of minutes a side .
Muffins
I 've got my very own muffin man , River Cottage baker , Daniel Stevens , whose recipe this is .
Makes nine .
500g strong white bread flour , plus extra for dusting ( or a 50:50 mixture of strong and plain flour )
2 tsp ( 10g ) salt
1 tsp ( 5g ) powdered dried yeast
325 ml warm water
1 tbsp sunflower oil , plus a bit extra
1 handful semolina flour , for coating
To knead by hand , mix the flour , salt , yeast and water in a bowl to form a sticky dough .
Add the oil , mix , then turn out on to a work surface and knead until smooth and silky .
To use a mixer with a dough hook attachment , combine the flour , salt , yeast and water on a low speed , then add the oil and knead for 10 minutes until smooth and silky .
Shape the dough into a round , coat very sparely with oil and place in a clean bowl covered with a plastic bag .
Leave to rise until doubled in size .
Tip out the dough on to a work surface and press all over to deflate .
Divide into nine pieces ( about 90g each ) , shape each into a round and flatten to about 1.5 cm .
Dust with semolina flour – this gives a lovely texture to the crust – and leave to prove on a clean linen tea towel on a wooden board ( slip into a plastic bag to help it along ) until doubled in size .
Heat a large , heavy frying pan or griddle over medium heat and grease very lightly .
Cook the muffins in batches so you do n't overcrowd the pan ( or have two pans going at once ) .
Lay the muffins in the pan , cook for a minute or two , then turn gently .
Cook slowly for 10 - 12 minutes , turning every now and then .
You may need to adjust the heat if they seem to be colouring too fast or not fast enough .
Cool on a wire rack .
Potato farls
A great savoury teatime treat , or as part of a fry - up .
Serve hot with butter and a sprinkling of salt .
Makes four .
850g potatoes , peeled and halved ( or leftover mash )
½ tsp salt
30g plain flour , plus extra for dusting
20g melted butter , plus more for frying ( or use dripping or lard )
Put the spuds in a pan , add water to cover by 4 cm and bring to a boil .
Simmer until tender , about 20 minutes .
Drain , return to the pan to steam and dry out a bit , then mash .
Place the warm mash in a bowl , stir in the salt , flour and butter until well combined , then turn out on to a floured surface .
Knead lightly – the dough will be sticky – then use a floured rolling pin to flatten into a 20 cm circle about 7 mm thick .
Use a floured knife to cut into quarters , and dust lightly with flour .
Warm the fat in a heavy frying pan over a medium - high heat and cook the farls for three minutes a side until evenly browned .
Season with a little salt and serve straight away .

November 9 , 2009 -- Venezuelanalysis.com --
The possibility of an imperialist - backed war in the Americas came a step closer on October 30 , when Colombia and the United States finalised a 10 - year accord allowing the US to massively expand its military presence in the Latin American country .
The move comes as the US .
seeks to regain its hegemony over Latin America – which has declined over the past decade in the context of a continent - wide rebellion against neoliberalism spearheaded by the revolution in Venezuela , led by President Hugo Chavez .
In order to regain control of its “ backyard ” , the US is increasingly resorting to more interventionist measures .
This is reflected by the recent military coup in Honduras , the destabilisation of progressive governments in Bolivia , Venezuela , Ecuador and Paraguay , and a massive military build up in the region , including new military bases in Panama and the reactivation of the US navy 's Fourth Fleet .
Over the past decade the Venezuelan government , which is the fifth - largest oil exporter in the world , has used its control over this resource to massively increase social spending .
This has resulted in significant achievements , such as poverty levels being reduced by half , the eradication of illiteracy , and the provision free universal education and healthcare for the poor .
In 2005 Chavez declared the revolution to be socialist in its aims .
Since then , in addition to regular elections and referendums , the government has sought to promote grassroots democracy and participation , through the creation of institutions such as urban land committees , health committees , grassroots assemblies , communes , workers ’ councils and communal councils .
However , these pro-poor and redistributive policies have increasingly brought the Chavez government into conflict with powerful economic interests both in Venezuela and the US .
The new military bases deal with US ally Colombia poses a direct threat to this radical process of social change .
Propaganda campaign
Hand in hand with this military build up has come a fraudulent propaganda campaign that tries to paint the democratically elected Chavez government as a “ dictatorship ” and claims that include that the government promotes drug trafficking and supplies arms to left - wing guerrillas in Colombia .
Tensions between Venezuela and the US - aligned government of Colombian President Alvaro Uribe have also increased with the deal .
As the negotiations came to light in July , Chavez ordered the “ freezing ” of all diplomatic and commercial relations with Colombia .
With the finalisation of the US - Colombia accord Chavez declared that Colombia had handed over its sovereignty to the US .
“ Colombia today is no longer a sovereign country ... it is a kind of colony ” , he said .
Under the deal , the US military has access , use and free movement among two air bases , two naval bases and three army bases , in addition to an existing two military bases , as well as all international civilian airports across the country .
The deal also grants US personnel full diplomatic immunity for any human rights abuses or other crimes committed on Colombian soil .
Among other things , US military , civilian and diplomatic personnel and contractors covered by the accord are also exempt from customs duties , tariffs , rent and taxes , while ships and planes are exempt from most cargo inspections .
Although US officials claim publicly that only 800 personnel will operate in Colombia the deal places no limits on the numbers of military personnel that can be deployed .
Launch pad for military intervention
US President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have repeatedly denied that under the accord Colombia will be used as a launching pad for military interventions in other South American countries .
However , as James Suggett pointed out in a recent Venezuelanalysis.com article , the US military ’s financial documents tell a different story .
“ The Pentagon budget for the year 2010 says the Department of Defense seeks ‘ an array of access arrangements for contingency operations , logistics , and training in Central / South America , ’ and cites a $ 46 million investment in the “ development ” of Colombia ’s Palanquero air base as a key part of this ” , Suggett wrote .
Also the 2010 fiscal year budget of the US Air Force Military Construction Program describes the Palanquero base as a “ Cooperative Security Location ( CSL ) ” , which “ provides a unique opportunity for full spectrum operations in a critical subregion of our hemisphere where security and stability is under constant threat from narcotics funded terrorist insurgencies , anti-US governments , [ author ’s emphasis ] endemic poverty and recurring natural disasters . ”
“ A presence [ at the Palanquero base ] will also increase our capability to conduct Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( ISR ) , improve global reach , support logistics requirements , improve partnerships , improve theater security cooperation , and expand expeditionary warfare capability ” , the budget document states .
“ It also supports mobility missions by providing access to the entire continent , except the Cape Horn region , if fuel is available , and over half of the continent if unrefueled ” , the budget continues .
On August 10 , Chavez said in an open letter to all South American presidents that the US - Colombian bases deal shows that the US empire wants to “ control our resources ” .
Colombian paramilitaries operating illegally in Venezuela ’s oil rich border regions , together with the right - wing opposition in Venezuela , are the advance guard of this imperialist project to destabilise and ultimately defeat the Bolivarian Revolution .
` Pre-war situation ' ?
Tensions flared in recent weeks when the bodies of nine Colombians believed to have been executed by an illegal armed group were found dumped in the border state of Tachira .
The Venezuelan government said the group was part of a “ paramilitary infiltration plan ” .
In addition , Venezuela announced that it has captured three Colombians accused of spying for Colombia ’s intelligence service , the Administrative Security Department ( DAS ) , as well as documents that indicate that Colombia sent spies to Venezuela , Ecuador and Cuba as part of a CIA operation .
Then on November 2 , two Venezuelan National Guard members were shot dead at a border checkpoint by armed gunmen .
In response the Venezuelan army has begun massive security sweeps of the border region where paramilitary groups , Colombian guerrillas , extortion and kidnapping rings and smugglers are rife .
Trade between the two countries dropped a dramatic 49.5 % for September , after Chavez ordered commercial relations to be “ reduced to zero ” to protest the bases .
Former Colombian President Ernesto Samper , who has criticised the bases deal , said in a recent interview “ we are in a pre-war situation … the situation could harden and reach extremes ” .
Brazil , the major economy in South America , has called for “ dialogue ” between Chavez and Uribe .
While an armed conflict is a possibility , the current tactic of the US is to continue undermining and destabilising the Venezuelan revolution in the hope that it will collapse under its own weight .
A war would also be dangerous for US imperialism already bogged down in Iraq , Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Even a proxy war via Colombia would be likely to spiral out of control .
Latin America ’s poor , downtrodden and marginalised have had a taste of independence ; it is likely they would fight back .

Official US Air Force document reveals true intentions behind US - Colombia military agreement
By Eva Golinger
November 5 , 2009 -- Venezuelanalysis.com --
An official document from the Department of the US Air Force reveals that the military base in Palanquero , Colombia , will provide the Pentagon with “ … an opportunity for conducting full spectrum operations throughout South America ” .
This information contradicts the explanations offered by Colombia 's President Alvaro Uribe and the US State Department regarding the military agreement signed between the two countries on October 30 .
Both governments have stated that the military agreement refers only to counternarcotics and counterterrorism operations within Colombian territory .
President Uribe has reiterated numerous times that the military agreement with the US will not affect Colombia ’s neighbours , despite constant concern in the region regarding the true objetives of the agreement .
But a US Air Force document , dated May 2009 , confirms that the fears of South American governments have been right on target .
The document reveals that the aim is to allow the US to engage in “ full spectrum military operations in a critical sub-region of our hemisphere where security and stability is under constant threat from narcotics funded terrorist insurgencies … and anti-US governments ... ” .
The military agreement between Washington and Colombia authorises the access and use of seven military installations in Palanquero , Malambo , Tolemaida , Larandia , Apíay , Cartagena and Málaga .
Additionally , the agreement allows for “ the access and use of all other installations and locations as necessary ” throughout Colombia , with no restrictions .
Together with the complete immunity the agreement provides to US military and civilian personnel , including private defence and security contractors , the clause authorising the US to utilise any installation throughout the entire country -- even commercial aiports -- for military ends signifies a complete renouncing of Colombia 's sovereignty and officially converts Colombia into a client state of the US .
The US Air Force document underlines the importance of the military base in Palanquero and justifies the US $ 46 million requested in the 2010 budget ( now approved by US Congress ) in order to improve the airfield , associated ramps and other installations on the base to convert it into a US Cooperative Security Location ( CSL ) .
“ Establishing a Cooperative Security Location ( CSL ) in Palanquero best supports the COCOM ’s ( Command Combatant ’s ) Theater Posture Strategy and demonstrates our commitment to this relationship .
Development of this CSL provides a unique opportunity for full spectrum operations in a critical sub-region of our hemisphere where security and stability is under constant threat from narcotics funded terrorist insurgencies , anti-US governments , endemic poverty and recurring natural disasters ” , the document states .
It ’s not difficult to imagine which governments in South America are considered by Washington to be “ anti-US governments ” .
The constant agressive declarations and statements emitted by the US state and defence departments and the US Congress against Venezuela and Bolivia , and even to some extent Ecuador , evidence that the ALBA countries are the ones perceived by Washington as a “ constant threat ” .
To classify a country as “ anti-US ” is to consider it an enemy of the United States .
In this context , it ’s obvious that the military agreement with Colombia is a reaction to a region the US now considers full of “ enemies ” .
“ Access to Colombia will further its strategic partnership with the United States .
The strong security cooperation relationship also offers an opportunity for conducting full spectrum operations throughout South America to include mitigating the counternarcotics capability . ”
This statement clearly evidences that counternarcotics operations are secondary to the real objectives of the military agreement between Colombia and Washington .
Again , this clearly contrasts the constant declarations of the Uribe and Obama governments insisting that the main focus of the agreement is to combat drug trafficking and production .
The Air Force document emphasises the necessity to improve “ full spectrum ” military operations throughout South America – not just in Colombia – in order to combat “ constant threats ” from “ anti-US governments ” in the region .
Palanquero
The Air Force document explains that “ Palanquero is unquestionably the best site for investing in infrastructure development within Colombia .
Its central location is within reach of … operations areas … its isolation maximizes Operational Security ( OPSEC ) and Force Protection and minimizes the US military profile .
The intent is to leverage existing infrastructure to the maximum extent possible , improve the US ability to respond rapidly to crisis , and assure regional access and presence at minimum cost .
Palanquero supports the mobility mission by providing access to the entire South American continent with the exception of Cape Horn … ”
Espionage and warfare
The document additionally confirms that the US military presence in Palanquero will improve the capacity of espionage and intelligence operations , and will allow US armed forces to increase their warfare capabilities in the region .
“ Development of this CSL will further the strategic partnership forged between the US and Colombia and is in the interest of both nations …
A presence will also increase our capability to conduct Intelligence , Surveillance and Reconnaissance ( ISR ) , improve global reach , support logistics requirements , improve partnerships , improve theater security cooperation and expand expeditionary warfare capability . ”
The language of war included in this document is evidence of the true intentions behind the military agreement : preparing for war in Latin America .
The past few days have been full of conflict and tension between Colombia and Venezuela .
Just days ago , the Venezuelan government captured three spies from the Colombian intelligence agency , DAS , and discovered several active destabilisation and espionage operations against Cuba , Ecuador and Venezuela .
The operations -- Fénix , Salomón and Falcón , respectively -- were revealed in documents found with the captured DAS agents .
Approximately two weeks ago , 10 bodies were found in Táchira , a border zone with Colombia .
After completing the relevant investigations , the Venezuelan government discovered that the bodies belonged to Colombian paramilitaries infiltrated inside Venezuelan territory .
This dangerous paramilitary infiltration from Colombia forms part of a destabilisation plan against Venezuela that seeks to create a paramilitary state inside Venezuelan territory in order to breakdown President Chávez ’s government .
The military agreement between Washington and Colombia will only increase regional tensions and violence .
The information revealed in the US Air Force document unquestionably is evidence that Washington seeks to promote a state of warfare in South America , using Colombia as its launching pad .
Before this declaration of war , the peoples of Latin America must stand strong and unified .
Latin American integration is the best defence against the Empire ’s aggression .
* The US Air Force document was submitted in May 2009 to US Congress as part of the 2010 budget justification .
It is an official government document and reaffirms the authenticity of the White Book : Global Enroute Strategy of the US Air Mobility Command , which was denounced by President Chávez during the UNASUR meeting in Bariloche , Argentina , on August 28 .

Mr Chen " called himself a rabbi " the justice ministry said
The leader of a Jewish sect has been extradited from Brazil to Israel to face charges of abusing children in a purification ritual to expel demons .
Elior Chen fled in 2008 after two boys , aged 3 and 4 , were taken to hospital with severe injuries .
One is in a vegetative state with brain damage .
It is alleged young children were beaten , burned and made to eat faeces at his home in the occupied West Bank .
A lawyer for the self - styled rabbi denied the incidents happened .
Mr Chen was arrested in June 2008 in Sao Paolo and his since been battling Israeli extradition requests in the Brazilian courts .
The Israeli Justice Ministry said the allegations relate " primarily to violence and severe physical and emotional abuse " on two brothers carried out by four followers of Mr Chen .
It said the abuse took place over a " prolonged period " mostly at Mr Chen 's house in the Beitar Illit settlement , which has a large ultra-orthodox Jewish population .
The mother of the two boys is serving a five - year prison term under a plea bargain .

The charges laid against the mother , M , described a series of abuses in which she failed to intervene : shaking the children with " great force " ; tying up their hands and legs with ropes , forcing them to drink alcohol until they vomited and beating them with a wooden hammer .
According to the charge sheet , the members of the group held the younger boy , A , under a stream of water until he choked , burned his fingers with a cigarette lighter and would strip him , put him outside and poor hot and cold water over him .
It said the older boy , N , then aged four , was put next to a heater until he was severely burned and his skin was starting to peel , and then poured alcohol and salt on the wounds .
An investigation was opened after the boys were brought for medical treatment in March 2008 .
Mr Chen 's lawyer Ariel Atari said on Wednesday that the incidents in question " never happened " , the Israeli newspaper Yediot Ahranot reported .
" He will look at them during the probe , listen to them , and that 's it .
He will say whatever he has to say at court , " he was quoted as saying .
Last year , Mr Atari said his client denied any intent to injure children , and fled Israel because he did not trust its legal system , according to the Jerusalem Post .
The trial of the four followers is continuing in Israel .

Now there is huge international pressure on Mr Karzai to accept whatever is the result of the ballot - stuffing inquiry .
There is also pressure on both him and Dr Abdullah Abdullah , the former eye surgeon and briefly foreign minister who is his challenger , to agree a deal that would somehow avoid a second round of the election , with all the security and logistical problems that would bring .
Mars is weird .
It 's small , and cold , and has a thin atmosphere that 's almost entirely carbon dioxide , and what is n't CO 2 is nitrogen and , bizarrely , argon .
So you expect to see weird landscapes .
But even so , Mars has the potential to be really , really weird .
Check this out :
That slightly disturbing image ( click to embiggen ) is not a microscopic picture of a scientist 's colon ( at least , not as far as you know ) .
It 's actually a region near the Martian south pole .
It was taken with the HiRISE camera on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter , and the area shown is roughly 700 meters across ( about 0.4 miles ) .
What you 're seeing are layers of the polar ice cap .
The ice is mostly CO 2 .
Mars is so cold that a lot of the cap persists throughout the year , and is called the residual cap .
Some of it does sublimate , though , which means it goes right from a solid to a gas .
Underneath that layer is something more solid , perhaps water ice , that does not sublimate .
As the upper layer partially goes away , it leaves these weird Swiss - cheese - like patterns , revealing the smooth layer below .
This image only shows a small portion of a much larger area where this occurs .
Here 's the " context image " , a zoom out if you will :
I marked the rough outline of the zoomed image in this one ( it 's rotated about 90 degrees counterclockwise in the zoom ) .
You can see that this odd terrain ( aresain ? ) goes on for kilometers .
It really does look like some sort of bacterial colony .
But it 's actually the result of millennia , maybe millions of years , of constant annual atmospheric deposition and sublimation .
And just as a reminder -- because I love to point this out -- Mars was 250 million kilometers ( 150 million miles ) away from Earth on August 20 , 2009 , when this image was obtained .
Yet MRO was only 250 km above its target , yielding this fine imagery at a resolution of 25 centimeters ( 10 inches ) per pixel .
Got a ruler handy ?
Pick it up , hold it in your hand , and think on the fact that we have spacecraft orbiting Mars , an alien world , that can take pictures of objects on its surface about the size of that ruler .
Man .
I love this stuff .

“ After we made ’ 28 Days Later , ’ people would come up and ask , ‘ How do you scare people in a movie ?
Give me three ways . ’
And I would say ‘ Sound , sound , and sound . ’
Sound is the thing that really ‘ sells the blow ’ every time .
Sometimes in the edit or in a screening you raise the sound up a bit in the mix and certain scenes are unwatchable .
People will turn away because the sound amplifies the reality of the image .
But if you watch it with the sound off , it ’s no problem and they ’re not fazed by whatever you show them .
“ So the two bits of advice I give all aspiring filmmakers are to make sure you work in a team and to save more money than you think you need for sound .
The temptation — especially if you ’re working with limited budgets like our early films — is to spend your money up front while you ’re shooting and solve things later .
But the aural , audio impact of our films is on the same level as the visual impact . ”

“ Marketing is the place where one has to be tenacious .
You do have a voice , and you have to keep that voice active by letting [ marketing executives ] know that you ’re either happy or displeased .
Although you may not be able to make the final decision , ultimately , you can be involved in shaping it .
…
Some filmmakers say , “ Hey , man , it ’s not about the box office .
I ’ve even said that , too .
But the truth is you ’re not making films so you can show them in your basement to a few friends .
You ’re putting your film out there as popular entertainment and hoping there ’s going to be a great audience for them . ”
ALEXANDER PAYNE
Director , “ Sideways , ” “ About Schmidt , ” HBO ’s “ Hung ”
“ It ’s very important for young filmmakers — actually for filmmakers of any age — to know when to capitalize on those small windows of notoriety , on those windows of success , in order to facilitate getting their first project or their next project made .
You get out in the filmmaking world and you see what offers are coming in , you see what material is striking you , what themes , what movies you already like that you want to emulate .
All these things come into play , and you just feel it out because you do n’t always know how you ’re going to get there .
“ Am I going to need independent sources of financing or am I going to need foreign financing that I put together and later find a U.S. distributor .
Am I going to shoot it off credit cards like Robert Townsend or Kevin Smith for $ 50,000 ?
Am I going to get a studio assignment , and if it is a studio thing , what are the prices there ?
How much control will I lose ?
Who am I getting involved with ?
Today young filmmakers come up to me and say , ‘ You know , I ’ve been trying to get my film made for eight months … or 16 months … can you help me out ? ’
And I tell them I understand their frustration and I know that agony , but I can’t give them pity .
That ’s simply the process .
As Hyman Roth says in ‘ The Godfather : Part II , ’ ‘ This is the business we ’ve chosen . ’ ”
LAWRENCE BENDER
Producer , “ Inglourious Basterds , ” Pulp Fiction ”
“ If I were making a small movie I would not use ‘ Pulp Fiction ’ as a business model or ever pitch people the ‘ Pulp Fiction ’ model .
‘ Pulp Fiction ’ honestly , was one of those movies that was good and bad for independent cinema .
It was great because it was a big success and that encouraged a lot of people in the business and made them realize you could make money with independent movies .
All the studios began creating their own independent or specialized divisions .
“ But on the other hand , everybody also began looking for their own grand slam on an independent movie and looking for huge upside from small films .
It used to be that if you made an independent movie and it grossed more than 10 million bucks , you were in amazing shape .
But today , people are looking for much more than that .
Even though I happen to have made that one - in - a - million film , that does n’t mean it happens very often — or even a second time . ”
DOUG LIMAN
Director , “ Swingers , ” “ The Bourne Identity ”
“ The reality is that ‘ Swingers ’ was a much better movie because we were n’t able to raise the $ 1.5 million we were originally shooting for .
I ’m a big believer that for most filmmakers , including myself , you need some limitations in order to force your creativity .
That ’s why I advise people to just go for it with what they ’ve got .
With ‘ Swingers ’ , all we were able to raise was $ 200,000 .
Most sane people would be emboldened by the fact that they were able to raise the first $ 200,000 and so they keep going with the fundraising to try to get more money .
If I had waited to get the rest I ’d probably still be waiting , trying to raise the other $ 1.3 million . ”
LEE DANIELS
Director , “ Precious : Based on the Novel by Sapphire ”
“ My advice is filmmakers who are trying to make really challenging flims is to embrace the struggle required to make them .
All great films come from struggle .
People said ‘ Monster ’s Ball ’ should n’t be made and even asked why I was working on such a film .
But struggle puts hair on your chest .
You fight so hard for these little movies that sometimes you feel like you must be crazy .
Sometimes I think , ‘ Why do n’t I just buy into the system ?
Get myself a house and a decent car ? ’
But when I see the result like ‘ The Woodsman ’ and the effect the films have on people , it makes me feel like I ’m not crazy , that I ’m not alone , and that people do appreciate them . ”

“ When it comes to marketing , a really good film can be its own best asset .
But an independent film always has to have at least some marketable elements : brilliant reviews , great word - of - mouth , or its cast , but ‘ playability ’ can also be a film ’s strongest marketing element .
For example , a film like ‘ Waitress ’ succeeds because audiences respond to it emotionally and tell their friends how much they enjoyed it .
The thing is , it ’s hard enough to make a great movie , and it ’s also hard to start thinking about marketing materials while you ’re on set , but it does help the cause later on .
“ When you ’re trying to explain a film to audiences it ’s important to have usable ‘ trailer moments , ’ where a character says something memorable or where a character explains what the movie is about to someone in a coherent way , so that you do n’t have to use extensive or artificial voiceover when you get to trailering .
It ’s always much better if you can use something organic to the film itself so you do n’t have to have that Voice of God saying : ‘ In a world where this or that can happen …’ or a trailer voiceover that says : ‘ So - and - so did n’t know he was going to get into such - and - such … but guess what happened . ’”

“ There was a rumor going around Sundance years ago about an independent film with $ 700,000 in uncleared music rights .
That ’s $ 700,000 on top of what they wanted distributors to pay for the movie .
Then when we went to the screening and heard all the songs , we realized that the rumors had to be true .
But if we had n’t hard about it , we might not have discovered the extent of the music - rights issue until we were deep into the negotiation process to buy the film , which could have derailed our interest .
“ Music creates all sorts of headaches .
For example , many filmmakers secure festival rights for music but then do n’t or ca n’t get clearances for the trailer , for broadcast television or for overseas theatrical exhibition , or even for domestic home video .
So essentially , we ’re often asked to buy a movie that ca n’t be show on television or home video as long as the songs are still in the film .
Once we find out the music has only been cleared for festivals or only for domestic theatrical , it ’s a big problem and it can potentially undo a distribution deal . ”

“ ’ The Diving Bell and the Butterfly ’ was a very difficult film to get made .
If you were looking at it in a very hard - hearted , actual way , there were many things about it that made it impossible to make , and then impossible to make into a commercial success .
But what literally gave ’ The Diving Bell ’ its lifeblood was that it was about a man who despite everything discovered a joie de vivre , the desire to live , and everything about the human existence that he still wanted to experience .
What really connected to people was that someone even in that devastating moment still had this incredible soul and this incredible heart and the will to live , which is very different from being in that position and wanting to die .
“ Jean - Dominique Bauby did n’t want to die .
He thought he did and then he realized he really did n’t .
We screened ’ The Diving Bell and the Butterfly ’ for French groups , literary groups , and cinema groups , and for the medical community because I think it had such a hopeful message for people treating serious illnesses .
And by doing that you ’re taking the movie out of the core audience and showing it to a different group that maybe does n’t usually see a subtitled movie , and then suddenly you ’re breaking through a barrier .
If you have a movie that can cross over or break through or go beyond the borders that you would normally see , then you should definitely think of that secondary audience . ”
DARREN ARONOFSKY
Director , “ The Wrestler , ” “ Requiem for a Dream ”
“ I think YouTube and similar streaming sites represent a great opportunity for aspiring filmmakers to distribute their films .
Filmmakers used to have to follow the festival cycle and wait for their applications and films to be approved , but today , you can create something and get it out there immediately , and if it ’s good , people will watch it and tell their friends to watch it .
And every once in a while you see something really clever and cool that breaks out , like the music video with the guys walking on the treadmills , and it ’s great .
“ There are things online that might have never gotten that much exposure and now a creative filmmaker has created a viable band through OK Go ’s ‘ Here It Goes Again , ’ and the song ’s online popularity .
Videos like that are going to be seen by a much larger online audience than if they only get a few screenings at a film festival that not everybody can attend .
You ’re still going to get independent films coming out of Sundance and kids whose careers are launched because they got some attention or buzz at a major festival .
And feature - length film is still probably the premier way that people enjoy narrative entertainment .
“ But over the next few years I think we ’ll continue to see a number of exciting developments for filmmakers as a result of opportunities emerging from online distribution . ”

The power to resist temptation has been extolled by philosophers , psychologists , teachers , coaches , and mothers .
Anyone with advice on how you should live your life has surely spoken to you of its benefits .
It is the path to the good life , professional and personal satisfaction , social adjustment and success , performance under pressure , and the best way for any child to avoid a penetrating stare and a cold dinner .
Of course , this assumes that our natural urges are a thing to be resisted – that there is a devil inside , luring you to cheat , offend , err , and annoy .
New research has begun to question this assumption .
A new brain imaging study by Josh Greene and Joe Paxton at Harvard University published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences suggests that what separates the well - behaved from the poorly - behaved might not be the ability to control your temptations but rather what kind of temptations you have .
For example , foregoing the opportunity for short - term gain and satisfaction , whether it is a delicious slice of tiramisu or that wallet stuffed with cash you stumbled across in the empty parking lot , will depend more on the nature of your automatic urges than your ability to control them .
Greene and Paxton were interested in why people behave honestly when confronted with the opportunity to anonymously cheat for personal gain .
They considered two possible explanations .
First , there is the “ Will ” hypothesis : in order to behave honestly people must actively resist the temptation to cheat .
In other words , returning the wallet depends on your ability to stifle your desire to take the cash and buy yourself something nice .
Alternatively , there is the “ Grace ” hypothesis : honest behavior results from the absence of temptation .
Returning the wallet requires no particular ability to control your treacherous urges – the urge simply is n’t there .
These two hypotheses make competing predictions regarding the brain regions activated when acting honestly as well as the time it should take participants to decide to act honestly .
If “ Will ” is correct then people who choose to act honestly should exhibit heightened activity in brain regions responsible for cognitive control ( presumably resulting from the struggle to ignore immediate desires ) .
But if “ Grace ” is right then no such increase should occur .
Furthermore , people should take a longer time to decide to act honestly if doing so requires a conscious act of “ Will , ” but a relatively shorter time to act if all you need is a bit of “ Grace . ”
In order to test these possibilities the researchers measured neural activity in an fMRI machine while participants played a computerized game wherein they could gain money by predicting the outcome of coin flips .
Correctly guess heads or tails , you get some cash .
In one condition , participants recorded their predictions before seeing any of the flips , precluding the opportunity to cheat .
In the other condition , participants were rewarded based on self - reported accuracy after the flips , and therefore could fudge their predictions in accordance with the outcome of the flip .
I got 100 percent correct , Mr. Experimenter , must be my lucky day !
Consistent with the “ Grace ” hypothesis , those who acted honestly ( who guessed wrong and self - reported as much ) showed no increased activity in control - related areas relative to others who guessed wrong but did not have the opportunity to cheat .
Honest reporting of scores , then , did n’t require will - power , these participants simply did not feel the urge to cheat .
Reaction time data further supported “ Grace ” showing that participants who acted honestly took no longer to do so , on average , when they had the opportunity to cheat than when they did not .
The authors suggest that these findings demonstrate the human capacity to , at least temporarily , achieve a state of “ moral grace ” – a state devoid of selfish temptation .
But what good does this state serve ?
Why would we be averse , or even indifferent , to cheating when we could benefit from it ?
Perhaps because our automatic responses have evolved in social environments where self - interested behavior in the short - term has not always lead to personal gains over the long - term .
Gaining a reputation as a cheat would be a one - way ticket to ostracism .
Having intuitions sensitive to equity and the needs of others would promote the formation and maintenance of cooperative relationships that would ultimately be of benefit to the individual .
Greene and Paxton ’s findings fit nicely with this idea , as well as past research showing that many of our intuitions regarding equity / fairness actually promote prosocial behavior , and we overcome them at our peril .
This is not only because of the positive social consequences they confer , but also because the cognitive processes we use to overcome them can be susceptible to bias , motivated reasoning , justification and rationalization .
This is not to say that self - control is an impediment to social life .
Clearly certain desires and urges are better off ignored .
The psychologist Dan Gilbert has found that participants , when given the choice between receiving $ 50 now or $ 60 a month from now , prefer the immediate reward .
The strong desire for cash in hand trumps the thought that you ’d be better off if you waited for the higher sum .
In this case , if it were n’t for those pesky urges , life would be much easier – you could more effectively plan for the long - term .
But what ’s also clear is that many of our urges guide us towards decision and actions that , while contrary to short - term goals , are in our long - term interests .
Given Greene and Paxton ’s findings , it seems that at least in some situations the best way to consider the future is by not considering it at all .

Whilst attending the Internet Governance Forum in Sharm El Sheikh , Egypt , the OpenNet Initiative ( along with partners of ONI Asia ) gathered to present their upcoming book , Access Controlled : The Shaping of Power , Rights , and Rule in Cyberspace .
A poster advertising the book was hung for the reception ; UN security officials requested removal of the poster , which contained mention of China 's " Great Firewall . "
When ONI officials refused to remove the poster , UN security bundled up the poster and took it away .
The sentence in question ?
" The first generation of Internet controls consisted largely of building firewalls at key Internet gateways ; China ’s famous ‘ Great Firewall of China ’ is one of the first national Internet filtering systems . "
OpenNet Initiative officials were told that the banner had to be removed because of its reference to China , a request repeated on several occasions , and in front of a number of witnesses , including the UN Special Rapporteur For Human Rights .
Earlier , those same officials had asked ONI to stop circulating an invite to the event because it contained a mention of Tibet .
ONI officials requested to see governing rules pertaining to the act , however , UN security refused to provide them , with mention given to " objections of a member state . "
The incident has been covered in the major news media , most notably by the BBC , which quoted ONI Principal Investigator Ron Deibert as saying " If we are not allowed to discuss topics such as internet censorship , surveillance and privacy at a forum on internet governance , then what is the point of the IGF ? "
Deibert 's web site contains further information and will be updated to reflect new developments .
Access Controlled is slated for release in early 2010 .
Our previous volume , Access Denied : The Practice and Policy of Global Internet Filtering is available on Amazon.com and other booksellers ; each chapter is also available individually online .

There is probably no bigger sign of economic distress than bankruptcy .
It can be in the form of a business unable to pay debt obligations or an individual simply unable to keep up with former obligations .
Most people that file for bankruptcy are not in a good economic spot .
In fact , if you want a better indicator of economic health bankruptcy filings are a good measure .
It is interesting what passes for good news in today ’s market .
For example , Alcoa announced a profit for the third quarter .
Good news right ?
Well if you look into the details the company has cut 18,000 jobs in the 12 months ending on June 30th and also planned on cutting an additional $ 2.4 billion in costs .
In this economic crisis people need to look at the details before assuming something is just good news .
Bankruptcy data does n’t hide this .
Since new legislation went into law in 2005 , bankruptcy has been harder to file .
So the recent increase in filings makes it all the more troubling :
Since 2005 the rise in quarterly bankruptcy filings has been steady .
This is indicative of the nature of the current deep recession .
The average American is feeling the strain of the high unemployment rate and the country is combating a market that is not willing to hire ( i.e. , Alcoa cutting jobs ) .
And recent bankruptcy filing data is showing the trend still moving up .
The latest data that we have is for August and it showed 119,874 consumer bankruptcy filings and that is a jump of 24 percent from last year .
You would think that with the massive amount of capital in banks , that lending would be easier so that would mitigate filings in the short - term but banks are not lending to consumers .
Early this week we saw the continuing contraction in consumer credit :
Now these data points are important because they show what is really happening on Main Street .
Wall Street is being pumped up by easy credit provided by the U.S. Treasury and Federal Reserve but most Americans do n’t pay their monthly bills because the S&P 500 went up 10 points .
Bankruptcy is the ultimate sign of distress .
That is , someone has reached the point of financially being unable to meet obligations .
This is n’t like missing one bill payment .
This is someone sitting and looking at all their obligations and throwing in the towel .
Keep in mind that this new change comes in light of the 2005 tougher bankruptcy laws .
That is why in the above , the chart shows a dramatic spike .
What changed in 2005 ?
A wide group of consumer advocates , legal scholars , and retired bankruptcy judges questioned the soundness of the legislation and recommended against it .
The credit card industry lobbied hard .
The contention was that bankruptcy was wrought with fraud .
There was n’t much data backing up that assertion but remember that in 2005 the good times were going on so hardly anyone was paying attention and the legislation was jammed through .
The major changes included means testing but also shifting people into Chapter 13 instead of Chapter 7 .
The big difference here is with Chapter 13 people filing have to work out some kind of agreement to rework their obligations while in Chapter 7 , current debts are paid from current assets .
Of course this shifts the burden completely on the consumer instead of lenders actually spending the time to be more diligent .
This worked perfectly in a mega housing bubble world .
Take a look at Chapter 7 even in light of the tougher legislation :
The biggest proponents of the bill were the credit card industry .
In fact , the credit card industry spent 8 years and $ 100 million in lobbying for this effort .
If you look at the legislation , it actually enforces a means test by looking at your state median income .
If you are at your state median income , you will not be able to qualify for Chapter 7 if you can pay 25 percent of the unsecured debt .
What it does is that it allowed for credit card companies to give anyone and anything credit while shifting the burden to the states and consumers .
Once things go bad as they are right now , credit is yanked from the system and now debtors are being forced to pay any penny they have to the credit card companies .
In the new legislation counseling is also required .
Yet what about counseling for the credit card companies ?
The bill is a lobbyist dream and we are seeing the ramifications of this bill today .
In fact , if it was n’t for the bill we would be seeing tens of thousands more filing for Chapter 7 today but people are holding off because what use would it be to go into Chapter 13 and still need to pay off your debts ?
What many of the credit card companies did n’t see however was the massive rise in unemployment .
In fact , with 26 million unemployed and underemployed I ’m sure many will be falling below the state median income test thus allowing people to file for Chapter 7 and liquidate .
Unsecured debt like credit card loans are usually washed away in court hence the big lobbying by the credit card industry .
So this is becoming a more likely option and as the chart shows above , more are opting for this .
Take a look at brief breakdown of how this plays out :

Iran today sent a defiant signal to the international community by announcing plans to build 10 uranium enrichment plants days after it was condemned by the UN for concealing activities that are feared may be designed to produce an atomic bomb .
Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's government said the plants would be the same size as the main enrichment complex at Natanz , central Iran , and work would begin within two months .
" We have a friendly approach towards the world but at the same time we wo n't let anyone harm even one iota of the Iranian nation 's rights , " the president said .
The aim was to produce 250-300 tonnes of nuclear fuel a year by using centrifuges with a higher speed .
The announcement seems likely to strengthen the hands of those arguing for sanctions if negotiations do not resume soon .
The Foreign Office called the development " a matter of serious concern " .
The news from Tehran followed Friday 's rare display of unanimity by the security council 's " big five " – the US , Russia , China , Britain and France – who condemned Iran for concealing an enrichment plant in a mountainside near Qom .
The 25 - 3 vote by the International Atomic Energy Agency , the UN 's nuclear watchdog , was seen as a sign of deepening exasperation over the impasse .
Mohammed ElBaradei , the outgoing IAEA chief , warned that talks were at " a dead end " .
As a signatory to the nuclear non- proliferation treaty , Iran has the right to generate nuclear power for peaceful purposes , which is what is says it wants to do .
But five UN resolutions demand it suspend enrichment and it is refusing to comply .
Nor is Iran any closer to allaying suspicions it is seeking to secretly build a nuclear weapon .
It has been asked by the IAEA to discuss evidence of warhead - related research activities but has refused .
Having been caught cheating in the past , its repeated denials have little credibility .
In recent weeks , after talks in Geneva and Vienna with the big five and Germany , Iran has seemed to reject a proposal under which most of its uranium would be shipped to France and Russia for processing into fuel for use in civilian reactors .
An arrangement of that kind would give Iran the nuclear fuel it needs but provide guarantees that it was not being diverted for military purposes .
Analysts and officials suggested the Iranian move was more about making gestures than a realistic plan .
" This is mostly about presenting two fingers to the world , " said one diplomat .
Others also pointed to the president 's domestic problems , where he is under pressure from conservatives in parliament , from the supreme leader , Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , and from opposition supporters protesting against the " theft " of last June 's election .
" It 's bluster , " said Sir Richard Dalton , a former British ambassador to Tehran .
" Iran ca n't afford 10 plants the size of Natanz and 500,000 centrifuges . "
But the move is likely to galvanise efforts to put together a package of sanctions , perhaps persuading Russia and China to back moves supported by the US , Britain and France .
Israel welcomed Friday 's censure by the IAEA but has made clear for months that it reserves the right to take pre-emptive military action if it felt that its own nuclear deterrence were to be challenged by Tehran .
The US warned on Friday that its patience is not unlimited , but doors are being left open in the hope that Iran will somehow re-engage .
Earlier today MPs announced the allocation of $ 20 m for unnamed " progressive " groups to combat what it called US and British " conspiracies . "
Iran 's parliament said the money would be disbursed by a committee including representatives of the ministries of intelligence , foreign affairs and the Revolutionary Guards .
With his lean frame topped by a shock of thick graying hair , 42 - year - old Alan Kayser is the epitome of a seasoned cyclist .
He does not look like a criminal , but recently he was pulled over on his bike and fingerprinted by a sheriff ’s officer .
“ He fingerprinted everybody , ” Mr. Kayser said .
“ That ’s how they ID people . ”
His crime ?
Running a stop sign on his bike .
As a growing number of people in the Bay Area take to bicycles  to be green , healthy or thrifty  there are signs of an emerging backlash against those who fail to follow the rules of the road .
Mr. Kayser was stopped in Portola Valley , an idyllic suburb of gently sloping , tree - lined roads .
On weekend afternoons , cyclists are as ubiquitous there as smiles , following a route nicknamed The Loop .
You will not find a single traffic light , but there is a three - way stop at the one significant intersection of Portola and Alpine Roads .
Microsoft Silverlight is a web application framework that provides functionalities similar to those in Adobe Flash , integrating multimedia , graphics , animations and interactivity into a single runtime environment .
We asked Microsoft User Experience Platform Manager Brian Goldfarb last week at PDC 2009 , and the answer was a huge surprise ... followed by some caveats .
But it contained these four amazing words : " We worked with Apple . "
The promise of Silverlight is that it's a cross - device , cross - browser , cross - platform solution , and it works the same on Macs as it does on Windows
Microsoft demonstrated the first developer beta of Silverlight 4 at the Professional Developer ’s Conference this week , nothing very exciting if it's not that they actually demoed it running on an iPhone .
For those who do n't know about Silverlight , Wikipedia is your friend :

Watch highlights from the Rajasthan International Folk festival .
guardian.co.uk
A recent exhibition at the British Museum brought artworks produced for the Maharajas of northern India at the height of their influence to Europe for the first time .
The mesmerising illustrations depict one long party of music , food and romance , which 200 years on seems somewhat otherworldly .
But for me , attending India 's newest music festival in Jodhpur last month felt like stepping into one of those paintings , as I was able to appreciate firsthand the incredible cultural heritage of the region .
The route down to the blue city .

The Rajasthan International Folk festival was established in 2007 , with an aim to help preserve the musical traditions of India 's largest state .
It is an area defined by the vibrant colours and sounds of all its art forms – from patterned textiles to expressive dance – offsetting the bleakness of the Thar desert that occupies such a vast amount of the land .
Performances take place at the Mehrangarh Fort , a former Royal palace that stands high on a cliff above the town , providing the best vantage point to appreciate the indigo hue of the blue city 's cubic houses .
As a seasoned festival - goer of damper climes , I am used to obsessing about the elements .
Here , this is n't an issue , as the monsoon has passed ; performances take place late into the evening as the days are so swelteringly long .
After dark , the spectacular arches and courtyards are transformed into a breathtaking series of candlelit venues , with the brightest full moon of the year beaming down on an intimate gathering of a thousand or so music lovers .
Jodhpur itself is an established highlight of India 's tourist trail , but festival organisers hope the event will encourage visitors to stay longer .
For the rest of the year , the fort is open as a museum , documenting the building 's regal past .
There are extravagantly decorated boudoirs , devoted entirely to the pursuit of pleasure , along with elephant proof spikes adorning every entrance in case of invasion , and an unrivalled collection of artefacts including covered palanquins , which were used to protect women from the male gaze as they travelled .
Outside , steep , cobbled streets lead down to an immaculately kept series of gardens , maintained in the original design of all those years ago .
Although the main goal of the event is to provide a stage for Rajasthani musicians , what makes it so unique is the specially commissioned collaborations for one - off performances .
On my visit , the programme ranged from folk artists playing alongside Ustad Sultan Khan , one of India 's most renowned classical artists , to singer Rehana Mirza from a nearby village duetting with Bollywood star Rekha Bhardwaj .
Sunrise and sunset devotional concerts take place at Jaswant Thada , the royal family 's burial ground , where we sat to observe the movements of the sun and moon , with a sitar or sarangi soundtrack .
Locals and travellers alike basked in the air of spirituality .
But the highlight of my weekend was the Dharohar Project , featuring beatboxer Jason Singh and guitarist Kirk McElhinney , of Manchester band the Safires , who developed new compositions with a group of Rajasthanis , playing brilliantly named instruments : the morchang , gungaroo , kartal and dholak .
The resulting work was premiered to a packed 15th - century courtyard , rebranded for the night as Club Mehran .
Rapturous applause and high - spirited dancing – " It 's going off ! " , one of the Mancunians exclaimed delightedly – confirmed that their fusion of old and new styles defies all notions of time .

Afghan voters had to face election fraud in the country Despite being relatively few in number , the Afghan Taliban are thriving in Afghanistan and Pakistan , as they take advantage of Islamabad 's apparent ambivalence towards them , the BBC's Hugh Sykes reports from Kabul .
Despite their fierce reputation , Afghans are mostly gentle , thoughtful people - deeply courteous , with warm humanity that radiates from luminous eyes .
They are also tolerant and very patient .
There was clear evidence of barefaced election fraud , implicitly insulting people who went out to vote believing that their ballots would count .
But there has been peace on the streets .
One man said to me this week : " This is all so crazy I 've just stopped thinking - and most of my friends are now simply depressed . "
And Afghanistan struggles on .
Despite eight years of international assistance , many places in Kabul are a mess .
Simple demands
Major road intersections are pitted with pools of filthy water as wide as streams , and nearly all the deep concrete gutters by the roadside , that I have seen , are stagnant with waste water and rubbish .
And all along these unhygienic streets , food vendors sell their wares from rickety wooden carts .
Bananas on many carts , grapes and pomegranates on others .
Almost everyone I have spoken to here on three visits in less than a year has said their demands are very simple : employment , an end to the corruption that 's endemic in the Afghan system , and - security .
Security should be simple , one man pointed out : " The Taliban are a small force compared to the British and American armies you could beat them if you really want . "
There is a suspicion here that the entire Western presence is Afghanistan is deeply cynical , misguided , and fundamentally confused .
Rubbish piles up in a stagnant ditch in central Kabul The Afghan Taliban leadership and sources of supply are not even in Afghanistan , they are in Pakistan - in Quetta , a city just across the mountains from Kandahar where so many British and American troops have died .
The charge of cynicism arises because the Americans and the British support the Pakistan government - and the Pakistan government at the same time provides sanctuary in Quetta for the Afghan Taliban who are killing US and British troops .
It is like fighting off the enemy at the front door of your home , but leaving the back door unlocked .
Or - imagine the Chicago Police in the 1920s fighting Al Capone , but turning a blind eye to the gun shops where he buys his weapons and ammunition , and even paying protection money to the owners of those shops .
Haroun Mir , director of Afghanistan 's Centre for Research and Policy Studies , told me he cannot understand why this surreal situation is tolerated .
" Pakistan gets away with impunity .
And instead of being punished , they are rewarded with US aid . "
" Why is American public opinion silent about this ? "
The Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban are twins and America must now get Pakistan to decide if they are an ally or an enemy
Dawood Sultanzoy
What the American public have been hearing on their TV networks has been Secretary of State Hillary Clinton declaring that the United States stands " shoulder to shoulder " with Pakistan .
They have not heard her complaining that Pakistan provides safe haven for the Afghan Taliban who are killing American and British troops .
This double - dealing has to stop , in the opinion of the independent Afghan MP - Dawood Sultanzoy .
He told me that Pakistan should realise that they are creating a " boomerang effect " .
" The Afghan Taliban and the Pakistan Taliban are twins , " he said , " and America must now get Pakistan to decide if they are an ally or an enemy . "
Supply lines
At the moment , Pakistan is both ally and enemy to the USA - ally in the fight against the Pakistani Taliban , but enemy so long as they continue to protect the Afghan Taliban .
Quetta is the crucial element .
An entire suburb of that Pakistani city is effectively occupied by the Afghan Taliban and their " Shura " ruling council - including their leader Mullah Omar .
The Afghan Taliban get many of their basic supplies in Quetta - their motorbikes , for example , and their mobile phone SIM cards .
And their supply lines cross the mountains into Afghanistan to the north .
Afghanistan is caught in the middle .
Nothing will really change here until this has been resolved .
Pakistan could deny the Afghan Taliban their safe haven in Quetta just across the border from where British and American troops and Afghan civilians are being killed .
The question here in Afghanistan is - why do n't they ?
An Afghan child sits quietly while his country faces many troubles
One answer is that Pakistan has to hedge its bets .
As more and more British and American troops die , pressure from the public in Britain and America to withdraw their forces could become irresistible .
The future of the Afghan government of President Hamid Karzai , already stained by election fraud , would then be uncertain .
And the chance of the Taliban returning to power here would sharply increase .
They are already waiting in the wings .
On Friday , Nato - led International Security Assistance Force ( Isaf ) troops from Poland went to a village in Ghazni province south of Kabul .
They distributed blankets , and some radios , and they left .
Twenty minutes later , a dozen Taliban arrived on motorcycles and seized the blankets ; they set fire to some of them , and took the rest away for themselves .
The Afghan Taliban are well - organised , well - resourced , patient - and they have good sources of intelligence .
They should not be under -estimated .
Pakistan needs smooth relations with whoever is in power in Kabul .
Islamabad was one of the very few capitals where the previous Afghan Taliban regime had an embassy .
Only two other countries recognised the Taliban government - Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates .
And after 11 September 2001 , the only nation that continued to recognise the Taliban government in Kabul was ... Pakistan .

At the time , as America reeled from the horror of the 11 September attacks , the idea seemed perfect : a remote and instantly available high - security prison for the country 's most implacable enemies – " the worst of the worst " , as the Pentagon boss Donald Rumsfeld called them , when the place opened for business in January 2002 .
Technically it was n't on US soil , so inmates would not enjoy the tiresome protections of the American legal system , nor , since they were not classed as prisoners of war , those " quaint " Geneva Conventions .
It was conveniently close to the mainland , but hidden within a military base , so prying eyes could be kept away .
But Guantanamo
Bay has n't quite worked out like that .
Instead , it has proved a nightmare , and not just for the numerous detainees who , far from being " the worst of the worst " , were mere flotsam from the Afghan battlefield .
Such was the blot on America 's global reputation , and so uncomfortable the legal arguments that Guantanamo spawned , that even president George Bush wanted to shut the place down , only to conclude it simply was n't practical .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Last 23 January , three days after taking office , Barack Obama signed an order to close Guantanamo within a year , but found himself facing the same realities as his predecessor .
The deadline will not be met , and last week Gregory Craig , the White House counsel closely involved in the deliberations , in effect paid for the delay with his job .
But the 44th president 's Guantanamo travails are far from over .
From the outset , the US authorities faced the problem of what do with the captives .
Even in Guantanamo , they could n't be held for ever without trial of some kind .
So military tribunals were set up , but their loose standards of evidence and the limited representation permitted to defendants served only to draw more criticism .
The Obama White House sought to amend the tribunals ' mechanism , but with limited success .
Now it has gone a giant step further , with the stunning news that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other prime organisers of 9/11 will be taken to New York , the scene of their crime , where they will be tried in a civilian federal court a few blocks from Ground Zero , where 2,605 people died .
There could be no clearer proof that Obama means to get rid of the shameful limbo - land that is Guantanamo Bay .
It is the boldest decision yet taken by this President – but could also turn out his most foolish .
If the trials proceed smoothly , they will be a belated vindication of the American legal system .
They will make a political point , too , further distancing this administration from the Bush - Cheney creed of government by executive fiat .
But if they do not proceed smoothly ?
The trial of Zacarias Moussaoui in a federal court in Virginia gives a taste of the potential pitfalls .
Moussaoui , the so - called " 20th hijacker " , pleaded guilty to being party to an al - Qa'ida conspiracy to crash planes into buildings and remains the only person thus far convicted in connection with 9/11 .
Moussaoui 's histrionics , and his long insistence on conducting his own defence , often turned this trial of a comparatively small fish in the war on terror into a circus that lasted four years , from 2002 to 2006 .
In the end , civilian justice worked , but barely .
The trial of Mohammed and his accomplices ( presumably we must now call them " alleged accomplices " ) is of an entirely different magnitude .
The possibilities of legal snarl - ups are endless .
For starters , the five may seek a change of venue , on the grounds a fair trial is impossible in New York City .
Then there 's the torture factor .
During his interrogation in CIA - run " ghost camps " , Mohammed was subjected no fewer than 183 times to waterboarding , a procedure that Eric Holder , the US Attorney - General who announced the New York trial on Friday , has publicly declared to be torture .
The Bush - era military tribunals admitted hearsay evidence and evidence obtained under duress , but civilian courts do not .
So what if Mohammed , the alleged mastermind of the entire plot , withdraws his confession ?
If that is struck from the record , does the US have enough other evidence to prove a death - penalty case ?
If it does , how much will have to be heard in camera , for reasons of national security ?
And what if the five try to call other suspected terrorists , either at large or behind bars , as witnesses ?
Of course , Mohammed , who has proudly boasted of his responsibility for the attacks , may try no such manoeuvres .
But if he attempts to turn the courtroom into a theatre of martyrdom , the trial would merely fuel new grief , new anger , for the bereaved families .
The timing of the trial is not clear , but it may be in full swing by the time of the mid-term Congressional elections , now less than a year away .
If things get bogged down – or , worst of all , if the case against a defendant were thrown out on technical grounds – a political disaster for Obama 's Democrats could be in the making .
Republicans who are already lambasting the decision to try the five in a civilian court will make hay with charges that Obama is both naive and unpatriotic .
So much , in that case , for good intentions .
In the depths of the Second World War , Churchill used to tell colleagues that when the Nazi leaders were caught , they should be put up against a wall and shot .
War crimes trials , he claimed , would be a farce .
In fact , Nuremberg , for all the complaints of " victors ' justice " , was a cathartic exercise , showing that the law could cope with such gigantic crimes .
New York could yet be another Nuremberg .
If not , however , even Barack Obama will have to admit that Churchill had a point .
A woman in China discovered a snake clinging to the wall of her bedroom with one clawed foot .
It turned out she 'd discovered an incredibly rare mutation - it 's actually more common for snakes to have two heads than feet .

Unfortunately , Duan Qiongxiu of Suining , China , killed the snake before it could be captured and studied by scientists .
She said " the monster " was crawling along her wall using its foot and she beat it to death .
According to the London Telegraph :
The snake – 16 inches long and the thickness of a little finger – is now being studied at the Life Sciences Department at China 's West Normal University in Nanchang .
Snake expert Long Shuai said : " It is truly shocking but we wo n't know the cause until we 've conducted an autopsy . "

Creatures can re-evolve old features .
Maybe this snake is the first mutation in a series that will bring back snakes with legs ?
Perhaps as the snakes ' environments disappear , it will be better for them to have legs with claws .
All the better for climbing around in cities .

“ Consumers have to be slashing the prices of the homes they list .
There ’s a significant inventory of homes for sale .
You ’re still going to see further price declines before the market stabilizes in 2010 . ” – Pete Flint , chief executive officer of Trulia
>
This is in line with my experience and anecdotal research with Real Estate agents ;
There is still lots of anchoring , but it is starting to loosen up :
“ U.S. home sellers cut their asking prices by a total of $ 28.4 billion to attract buyers as the real estate recovery stalled , Trulia Inc. said .
The average discount was 10 percent as of Oct. 1 , the San Francisco - based real estate data provider said today .
Homes listed for more than $ 2 million were cut the most , with owners taking an average of 14 percent off the original price .
Luxury homes accounted for 25 percent of all of the reductions .
Sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly fell in August for the first time since March , according to the National Association of Realtors , signaling the recovery will be slow to gain speed .
The median price dropped 12.5 percent from August 2008 . ”

Call it First Bang .
The Large Hadron Collider , the world ’s biggest and most expensive science experiment , produced its first collisions on Monday , said scientists at CERN , the European Organization for Nuclear Research , outside Geneva .
Seemingly making up for lost time after years of disasters and delays , the collisions came only three days after engineers had begun shooting the subatomic particles known as protons around their 17 - mile underground racetrack .
The physicists announced that they had succeeded in making the beams collide , producing what they called “ candidate collision events ” in the giant particle detectors in the collider .
The collider has been built over 15 years at a cost of $ 9 billion to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion electron volts apiece and then slam them together in an attempt to recreate forces and particles that reigned during the first moments of the Big Bang .
But for much of that time , the only things that have gone bang in the collider were magnets and other components , most notably in September 2008 after the first time protons circled the collider .
When the beams began circulating again on Friday , CERN officials said they expected the first collisions to happen in early December .

Hollywood often complains about the billions of dollars allegedly lost due to piracy .
Indie film makers , on the other hand , tend to welcome the free buzz generated when their film is pirated .
The makers of Ink belong to this latter group , and are thanking the hundreds and thousands of people who downloaded their movie on BitTorrent .
Written and directed by Jamin Winans ,
Ink is the story of a brutal mercenary who appears in the dreamscape of a comatose 8 year old called Emma .
Like virtually every movie nowadays , the film ended up being ripped and put on BitTorrent just a few days ago .
In this short time span it was downloaded by more than 400,000 people on BitTorrent alone , earning it a spot in Torrent Freak ’s chart of top 10 most pirated movies this week .
For most Hollywood bosses this is usually a trigger to start complaining about lost revenue , but the makers of Ink are welcoming their new pirate audience .
In an email to the followers of their newsletter , Jamin and Kiowa Winans say that they have “ embraced the piracy ” and are “ just happy Ink is getting unprecedented exposure . ”
Thanks to the pirated copy their movie jumped to 16th place on IMDb ’s movie meter , and according to the makers this increased popularity also boosted DVD and Blu-ray sales .
Who needs a hefty marketing budget to promote a movie ( and merchandise ) when they have BitTorrent ?
Sent out a few hours ago , here ’s the mailing in full plus a follow up response from Kiowa .
Dear Fans and Friends ,
Over the weekend something pretty extraordinary happened .
Ink got ripped off .
Someone bit torrented the movie ( we knew this would happen ) and they posted it on every pirate site out there .
What we did n’t expect was that within 24 hours Ink would blow up .
Ink became the number 1 most downloaded movie on several sites having been downloaded somewhere between 150,000 to 200,000 times as far as we can tell .
Knowing there ’s absolutely nothing we can do about it , we ’ve embraced the piracy and are just happy Ink is getting unprecedented exposure .
As a result , Ink is now ranked # 16 on IMDb ’s movie meter and is currently one of the top 20 most popular movies in the world .
This all started as a result of the completely underground buzz that you ’ve each helped us create .
We ’ve had no distributor , no real advertising and yet the word of mouth that you ’ve generated has made the film blow up as soon as it became available worldwide .
So many of you came to see the movie multiple times , bringing friends and family and many of you have bought the DVD and Blu-ray from us .
All of this built up and built up and suddenly it exploded .
We do n’t know exactly where this will all lead , but the exposure is unquestionably a positive thing .
Ink hits Netflix , Blockbuster , iTunes and many more tomorrow !
Remember to get your signed copies , t- shirts and posters at the Ink Store .
Thank you so much for the constant love and support .

Analytic Combinatorics proposes a unified treatment of analytic methods in combinatorics .
We develop in about 800 pages the basics of asymptotic enumeration and the analysis of random combinatorial structures through an approach that revolves around generating functions and complex analysis .
A symbolic framework ( Chapters I - III ) first provides systematically a large number of exact description of combinatorial models in terms of generating functions .
Major properties of generating functions that are of interest in this book are singularities .
The text then presents ( in Chapters IV - VIII ) the core of the theory with two chapters on complex analytic methods focusing on rational and meromorphic functions as well as two chapters on fundamentals of singularity analysis and combinatorial consequences , followed by a chapter on the saddle point method .
The last section ( Chapters IX ) covers multivariate asymptotics and limit laws in random structures .
Many examples are given that relate to words , integer compositions and partitions , paths and walks , graphs , mappings and allocations , lattice paths , permutations , trees , and planar maps .

A noted geologist who coauthored the New York Times bestseller Sugar Busters has turned his attention to convincing Congress that carbon dioxide emissions are good for the Earth and do n't cause global warming .
Leighton Steward is on Capitol Hill this week armed with studies and his book Fire , Ice and Paradise in a bid to show senators working on the energy bill that the carbon dioxide cap - and - trade scheme could actually hurt the environment by reducing CO2 levels .
" I 'm trying to kill the whole thing , " he says .
" We are tilting at windmills . "
He is meeting with several GOP lawmakers and has plans to meet with some Democrats later this week .
Much of the global warming debate has focused on reducing CO2 emissions because it is thought that the greenhouse gas produced mostly from fossil fuels is warming the planet .
But Steward , who once believed CO2 caused global warming , is trying to fight that with a mountain of studies and scientific evidence that suggest CO2 is not the cause for warming .
What 's more , he says CO2 levels are so low that more , not less , is needed to sustain and expand plant growth .
Trying to debunk theories that higher CO2 levels cause warming , he cites studies that show CO2 levels following temperature spikes , prompting him to back other scientists who say that global warming is caused by solar activity .
In taking on lawmakers pushing for a cap - and - trade plan to deal with emissions , Steward tells
Whispers that he 's worried that the legislation will result in huge and unneeded taxes .
Worse , if CO2 levels are cut , he warns , food production will slow because plants grown at higher CO2 levels make larger fruit and vegetables and also use less water .
He also said that higher CO2 levels are not harmful to humans .
As an example , he said that Earth 's atmosphere currently has about 338 parts per million of CO2 and that in Navy subs , the danger level for carbon dioxide is n't reached until the air has 8,000 parts per million of CO2 .
Steward is part of a nonprofit group called Plants Need CO2 that is funding pro-CO2 ads in two states represented by two key lawmakers involved in the energy debate : Montana 's Sen. Max Baucus and New Mexico's Sen. Jeff Bingaman .

Police said Galipeau exchanged words with a cashier then threw her spare change at her , hitting her in the face .
Police said 33 - year - old Jackson then picked up two - foot tall cones from the mopped floor and hurled it at employees , cutting one employee 's nose .
It was unclear whether Galipeau or Jackson have hired an attorney .
A retrial is ordered after a Bahamian politician announced one of the accused had been cleared while the jury was still deliberating
After nearly four weeks in a courtroom , a Bahamian judge declared a surprise mistrial late Wednesday in the John Travolta extortion trial , leaving the actor and his attorneys mystified and upset .
Senior Supreme Court Judge Anita Allen declared a mistrial because of juror misconduct following an announcement from a local politician that one of the defendants had been acquitted – before the jurors came back with their verdict .
Allen ordered a retrial , but did it remains unclear when , if ever , the case will be retried .

RELATED : Key Evidence Destroyed in Travolta Case ?
“ This came out of the clear blue ; this was so weird , ” Mike Ossi , one of Travolta s Florida lawyers told PEOPLE .
First Hint of Trouble
Ossi , an entertainment lawyer who was also a prosecution witness , says the first hint of trouble came when a police officer heard on TV that one of the defendants – a onetime Bahamian senator named Pleasant Bridgewater – had been acquitted .
“ The police officer said , ‘ It looks like Pleasant got off , ’ ” Ossi said .
News of Bridgewater s so - called acquittal was on TV two hours before the foreman told the judge the nine - member jury was having difficulty reaching a verdict , Ossis told PEOPLE .
Bridgewater ( who resigned her position as a senator with the Progressive Liberal Party in the wake of the scandal ) and paramedic Tarino Lightbourn were charged with conspiring to extort $ 25 million from Travolta .
The prosecution sought to prove they demanded money in exchange for not releasing information to the press in connection with his 16 - year - old son ’s death last January .
Jett Travolta died on Jan. 2 , following a seizure in the family vacation home on Grand Bahama island .
Travolta on the Stand
The paramedic claimed to have a medical document that Travolta signed , requesting his son be driven to the airport so he could fly the boy for treatment in Florida rather than go to the local hospital in Freeport .
One of the more compelling moments of the trial occurred when Travolta stoically told the jury he did not read the document he signed because , “ Time was of the essence . ”
At another point , he testified about helping a nanny perform CPR on his son .
PHOTOS : Jett ’s Loving Family Life
“ My son was autistic and he suffered from seizure disorder every five to 10 days , ” Travolta , 55 , told the court .
“ He would suffer a seizure that would last 45 seconds to a minute , and sleep for 12 hours . ”
Lightbourn had kept the original form because it had the signature of a famous actor , another Travolta Florida attorney , Michael McDermott , testified .
The paramedic ultimately enlisted the help of Bridgewater to sell the document , with the senator telling McDermott the document showed “ Mr. Travolta either intentionally killed his child or was negligent , and that this document is evidence that Mr. Travolta tried to flee the jurisdiction with his child s dead body , ” McDermott said .
McDermott proved central to the prosecution in that he helped capture the defendants talking about their demands on secretly recorded audio and videotape .
On the tapes , the parties discuss various sums of money ranging from thousands of dollars to $ 25 million .
In one tape .
McDermott says to Lightbourn : “ You know what we ’re both doing here is a criminal offense . ”
Lightbourn nods and says : “ Yes . ”
His attorney , Bridgewater , listening in on speakerphone , says nothing .
Slow to Decide
Despite this compelling evidence , the jury , which began deliberations around 2:45 p.m. Wednesday , moved ponderously .
Around 10:30 p.m. , the jury told the judge they were having difficulty reaching a verdict .
Judge Allen instructed them to try to resolve their differences .
But 10 minutes later , the judge called a mistrial .
“ John [ Travolta ] was upset , ” Ossi says .
“ He wants to know more . ”
It ’s believed one of the jurors called a politician in Freeport and told him Bridgewater had been acquitted , Ossi said .
That call would have taken place at the same time the jury was deliberating .
A mistrial came as no surprise to some court observers who predicted politics played a role throughout the trial .
Bridgewater had been a rising star within the PLP when she was arrested in January .
One of the prosecution ’s main witnesses , Allyson Maynard - Gibson , is a PLP senator and Travolta ’s Bahamian attorney .
Gibson ’s involvement in the case caused a great rift in the party .
CAMBRIDGE , Mass . --
A cancer vaccine carried into the body on a carefully engineered , fingernail - sized implant is the first to successfully eliminate tumors in mammals , scientists report this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine .
The new approach , pioneered by bioengineers and immunologists at Harvard University , uses plastic disks impregnated with tumor - specific antigens and implanted under the skin to reprogram the mammalian immune system to attack tumors .
The new paper describes the use of such implants to eradicate melanoma tumors in mice .
" This work shows the power of applying engineering approaches to immunology , " says David J. Mooney , the Robert P. Pinkas Family Professor of Bioengineering in Harvard 's School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Wyss Institute for Biologically Inspired Engineering .
" By marrying engineering and immunology through this collaboration with Glenn Dranoff at the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute , we 've taken a major step toward the design of effective cancer vaccines . "
Most cancer cells easily skirt the immune system , which operates by recognizing and attacking invaders from outside the body .
The approach developed by Mooney 's group redirects the immune system to target tumors , and appears both more effective and less cumbersome than other cancer vaccines currently in clinical trials .
Conventional cancer vaccinations remove immune cells from the body , reprogram them to attack malignant tissues , and return them to the body .
However , more than 90 percent of reinjected cells have died before having any effect in experiments .
The slender implants developed by Mooney 's group are 8.5 millimeters in diameter and made of an FDA - approved biodegradable polymer .
Ninety percent air , the disks are highly permeable to immune cells and release cytokines , powerful recruiters of immune - system messengers called dendritic cells .
These cells enter an implant 's pores , where they are exposed to antigens specific to the type of tumor being targeted .
The dendritic cells then report to nearby lymph nodes , where they direct the immune system 's T cells to hunt down and kill tumor cells .
" Inserted anywhere under the skin -- much like the implantable contraceptives that can be placed in a woman 's arm -- the implants activate an immune response that destroys tumor cells , " Mooney says .
The technique may have powerful advantages over surgery and chemotherapy , and may also be useful in combination with existing therapies .
It only targets tumor cells , avoiding collateral damage elsewhere in the body .
And , much as an immune response to a bacterium or virus generates long - term resistance , researchers anticipate cancer vaccines will generate permanent and body - wide resistance against cancerous cells , providing durable protection against relapse .
Mooney says the new approach 's strength lies in its ability to simultaneously regulate the two arms of the human immune system : one that destroys foreign material and one that protects tissue native to the human body .
The implant - based vaccine recruits several types of dendritic cells that direct destructive immune responses , creating an especially potent anti-tumor response .
" This approach is able to simultaneously upregulate the destructive immune response to the tumor while downregulating the arm of the immune system that leads to tolerance , " Mooney says .
" In cancer , this latter arm is typically a limiting feature of immunotherapies , since it can extinguish vaccine activity and afford tumors a degree of protection . "

We often talk about fictional apocalypses here at io9 , but what if the collapse of civilization actually happens in your lifetime ?
Here are some things you can start doing right now to make sure you 're ready to ride it out .

Learn To Make Fire .
In a post - apocalyptic scenario , you have to account for both short and long - term survival .
Fire will be absolutely necessary in the short term .
Have you ever watched one of those seasons of Survivor where one of the tribes can't figure out how to build a fire , and they do n't win the flint for days and days ?
They can't cook their food or boil their water , and they fade fast , growing weak and ineffective until the producers take pity and slip them a Zippo when no one 's looking .
If you can't build a fire , you 'll die .
Learn to build fires in a variety of conditions , with a wide range of materials .
Can you build one without dried grass ?
Can you build one when you 're freezing cold and your hands wo n't stop shaking ?
Learn how , and practice it regularly .
Of course , it never hurts to hedge your bets , and keep a supply of waterproof matches handy .

Build a Team .
I know you like to envision yourself as this awesome lone wolf bad - ass making your way through the wastelands with no one to depend on but your trusty shotgun , but the fact is you 'll need friends after the apocalypse .
It could be as simple as someone to stand guard so you are n't mugged or eaten by starving feral dogs while you sleep .
You 're going to need help , and you 're going to want people you trust .
You need to assemble your team long before the apocalypse happens .
Make a list of friends and family who live nearby , then decide who you want with you .
People with useful skills go to the top of the list ( nunchuk skills do n't count , but bow - hunting does ) .
People with lots of children go to the bottom .
Then make a plan and get your team in on it – if things go down suddenly , you wo n't all be in the same place , and there will likely be no way to communicate .
Your plan should be simple , like : Step 1 , get somewhere safe and wait out the worst of it ; Step 2 .
Meet at the statue of Thomas Jefferson in Jefferson Square downtown , or better yet , your Uncle Jim 's ranch 40 miles outside of town .
Do n't underestimate the benefits of having a plan – aside from its actual effectiveness , it gives you a goal to focus on , and that 's been shown to be a factor is disaster survival .

Get a Gun. Learn to Use It .
I 'm not a big fan of guns myself , but the reality is , any apocalypse is either going to caused by , or inevitably lead to resource shortages .
Whether it 's water , gasoline , food , or plague vaccines , there will be haves and have - nots .
Some percentage of the have - nots are going to try to get what they need by force , and if you can't defend yourself , you 're going to lose what you have ( you 're doing all this planning so you 'll be a have , remember ) .
There 's another vital use for guns in a post - apocalyptic world , of course – hunting .
We 're all going to revert to hunter / gatherers for a little while at least .
For this reason , a hunting rifle is a good idea .
That 's not a good weapon for close - quarters urban protection , however .
For that , a shotgun is often the weapon of choice .
Good thing you have a team .

Stockpile .
FEMA recommends one gallon of water per person per day , plus food .
How many days can you possibly plan for ?
It really depends on your space and your plans .
Do you have a shelter at your team 's meeting place with a larger stockpile ?
Then a few weeks of water should be enough to get you through .
You can never store enough drinking water , but obviously if you live in a 12th floor apartment , there 's a limit .
Do n't forget a set of sturdy clothes and boots , a can opener , hand crank radios and flashlights , batteries , gasoline , and a fire extinguisher .
Disaster survival experts offer a few other suggestions you might not expect : beer and cigarettes ( they 'll be the primary currency post - apocalypse ) , 3 mil . plastic bags ( also known as contractor bags ) , duct tape ( combine with contractor bags for water - resistant shelter or rain - water conduits ) , plus a few books and card games ( you and your fellow survivors will eventually drive each other crazy without distractions ) .

Learn a Marketable Skill .
Once you 've made it through the first few weeks , you 'll eventually want to connect with other survivors , whether you 're with your team or not .
Any group trying to survive with limited resources is not going to accept new members unless they offer a net gain of some kind .
No one 's going to be impressed by your level 70 character in World of Warcraft , your discerning taste in wine or your extensive knowledge of 60s British Invasion bands ( or your magnificent blogging skills , for that matter ) .
Here are some suggested avocations to learn so you have something to offer the nascent post - apocalyptic society : small engine repair ; emergency medical training ; agriculture ( emphasis on durable , high - yield crops ) ; hunting / fishing ; construction / carpentry ; rigging / sailing ( not so good in Kansas , but could be clutch in San Diego or Chicago ) .
If all else fails , work out – no one 's likely to turn down a strong back or a durable pair of legs .

" Not Your Ordinary Survival Checklist . "
Popular Mechanics , Oct. 2009 .
, Franklin County ’s seat .
For many years , the borough has allowed a garden club to place a Nativity scene on the ground surrounding the Memorial Fountain .
Borough council decided this week to amend its policy and prohibit all displays on the fountain .
The change came after
( PAN ) , an organization of atheist , agnostic and secular humanists from around the midstate , notified Chambersburg it wanted to erect a sign reading “ Celebrating Solstice — Honoring Atheist War Veterans . ”
Earlier this month , PAN Capital Area director Carl Silverman of Camp
Hill wrote the borough a letter stating its intention to erect the sign .
While the group believed it did not need the borough ’s permission because the creche required none , it was submitting a proposed design in “ the spirit of cooperation , ” the letter said .
“ We did n’t want to take Jesus out of the public square , ” Silverman said .
“ We want to put atheism in the public square . ”
Bill McLaughlin , president of Chambersburg ’s borough council , said that after discussion with the borough ’s solicitor , two practical options emerged — it could either allow everything or allow nothing to be displayed on the fountain .
Council chose to allow nothing , he said .
Lisa Blackstock of Mercersburg is spearheading a demonstration at noon Saturday in Chambersburg ’s downtown .
She believes the majority of people in the community want the creche to remain .
“ This is Christ - mas .
It ’s a no - brainer if you ask me , ” Blackstock said .
“ There ’s no way people in Chambersburg should let ( PA Nonbelievers ) win . ”
McLaughlin said he took PAN ’s letter as “ a demand , with an implied threat of legal action . ”
“ The down side of ‘ everything ’ is it means everything , ” McLaughlin said .
“ It would mean this group , and groups that are much more odious . ”
That was something , he said , council could not live with .
A solution may be on the horizon .
Central Presbyterian Church , on the square across from the fountain , is considering construction of a perch on its property where the Nativity scene could be displayed .
A university education is important to longevity , the study suggests A well - educated woman positively influences both her own and her partner 's chances of a long life , Swedish research suggests .
A man whose partner had only a school education has a 25 % greater risk of dying early than if she had had a university education , it suggests .
The authors say educated women may be more likely to understand the various health messages their families needed .
The findings are based on a study of 1.5 m working Swedes , aged 30 to 59 .
The study , in the journal of Epidemiology and Community Healthcare , says that in the case of men , it is their income and social status that affect women 's lifespan .
The researchers looked at data from the 1990 Swedish census and followed up information on causes of death , including cancer and circulatory diseases like heart disease and stroke from the cause of death registers up to 2003 .
University education
A woman 's education and social status were more important for a man 's life chances than his own education , the findings indicate .
And a woman 's education also affects her own mortality , with someone with a school education having a 53 % greater risk of dying early than a university educated woman .
The authors said : " Education is of great importance through a direct influence on mortality as well as indirectly via occupation and income .
" Education may also have an indirect effect through its possible importance for choice of partner . "
Dr Robert Erikson , who led the research , said : " Women traditionally take more responsibility for the home than men do and , as a consequence , women 's education might be more important for the family lifestyle - for example , in terms of food habits - than men ' s education .
" It 's still the case that women tend to put the food on the table and in that way have a very direct influence .
" Women with higher education may also receive better medical treatment and their partners may benefit too . "
Professor Alan Maryon - Davis , of the UK's Faculty of Public Health , said : " This study shows how closely education , lifestyle and long - term health are linked together .
" If we 're serious about radically improving the health of the nation , we must fully invest in high - quality education at all levels . "

What are these ?
E-mail this to a friend Printable version
My friend Elisia asked me to help her move .
Moving is one of my least favorite activities ( which partially explains why I live in an RV ) , but I gladly agreed to help .
Why ?
Because she followed the golden rules of asking favors .
If you want people to do you favors , or , more importantly , feel good about doing you favors , make sure you follow these rules .
They 're written from the point of view of someone asking me for a favor , but I would also follow them when asking favors of others .
1. Your Benefit Must Greatly Outweigh My Inconvenience
If you 're asking me for a favor it should be something that I am particularly good at or well suited for .
If a friend of mine asks me to help him set up a blog , I 'm happy to do it because it 's something I have experience with and am good at .
What could take my friend five hours to set up , I might be able to do in thirty minutes .
The same goes for favors where I 'm in the right place at the right time , even if I do n't have specific skills for the job .
If a friend asks me to pick up some bananas while I 'm at Whole Foods , I 'm more than happy to do it .
If he asks me to pick up bananas while I 'm home in the middle of writing something , that 's a ridiculous request .
2. You Should Make it as Easy as Possible for Me to do the Favor
Earlier this year the Austin Society asked me to give a short talk on pickup .
Besides following rule number one , they also immediately offered to pick me up and drop me back off after the speech .
That shows that they value the favor and are willing to do what they can to minimize my inconvenience .
When I arrived at my friend from the first paragraph's house , she had everything boxed and ready to go .
She offered to load it all into my RV and unload it by herself .
I helped her load and unload , but appreciated that she was trying to make it as easy as possible for me .
Imagine if I had gotten there and had to wait around for hours as she boxed up her stuff .
That 's what " helping me move " usually means .
3 . Ask immediately , Don't Small Talk
If you 're going to ask for a favor , just ask .
The worst is when someone makes small talk for five minutes and then says , " Oh , by the way ... can you watch my dog while I 'm out of town ? " .
That feels like I 'm being used .
This one just happened to Todd , who reminded me of it .
The same goes for doing preemptive favors in order to obligate someone .
" Here are some cookies I made you .
Any way I can borrow your computer ? " .
4. Do Everything You Can First
If someone has tried to solve a problem but can't , I 'm happy to help them .
If they have n't even tried , I 'm annoyed .
People email me asking for travel or pickup advice all the time .
If they 've bought my book first , I 'm happy to answer their questions .
If they 're asking me stuff that I 've already taken the time to write down in the book , I 'm offended .
You 're willing to take up my time , but not willing to pay me for my work ?
The most common manifestation I see of this is in airport rides .
Taxis are ridiculous , as are shuttles , so I 'm usually really happy to pick people up from the airport .
An hour of my time can save them a lot of money and hassle .
In Austin you can take a shuttle from the airport to downtown for fifty cents .
Taking the shuttle and having me pick you up downtown saves me half an hour of driving or more .
If someone wants me to pick them up from the airport but does n't offer to take the shuttle , they 're basically valuing my time at one dollar an hour .
Disrespectful !
( There 's one person reading this who MIGHT take this the wrong way -- that was a different set of circumstances , though ! )
5. Reciprocate
Do n't be the person who asks for favors but never does them for others .
It 's old fashioned , but I always try to send people gifts or at least a thank you card if they do me a favor .
If you stay at someone 's house for a week , thus saving several hundred dollars , the least you can do is have some small present shipped to them .
The idea is n't necessarily to compensate them for their hospitality , but rather to show that you do n't take it for granted .
Final Thoughts
I 'm not some sort of weird favor miser who only does people favors if they follow the rules exactly , and you probably are n't either .
But I am more likely to do someone a favor if they are considerate about it , and much more likely to be happy about doing it .
I almost did n't post this , thinking it 's common sense and does n't need to be said , but it 's been on my mind because I 've seen a few bad favor askers recently .
( CNN ) -- A
Utah man trapped for more than 26 hours in a crevice of a popular cave tourist attraction died as rescuers struggled to save him , authorities said Thursday .
John Edward Jones , 26 , of Stansbury Park was stuck in the Nutty Putty Cave , which sits west of Utah Lake near Cedar Valley , according to the sheriff 's office of Utah County .
The cave is 55 to 60 miles south of Salt Lake City .
Sheriff 's officials said Jones entered the cave at around 6 p.m. Tuesday with a group of about 11 people and became stuck about 8:45 p.m. in a " tightly confined " feature inside Nutty Putty Cave called " Bob 's Push . "
Utah County sheriff 's spokesman Sgt. Spencer Cannon told CNN affiliate KSL that Jones was trapped upside down in a crevice that was about 18 inches wide and about 10 inches high .
The crevice is about 150 feet below the surface and about 700 feet from the cave entrance , according to the sheriff 's department .
" They had him to a level spot where he was n't heading downhill with his head below his feet , " Cannon said .
" During the course of that , they have a raising system to hold him in position , and one of the devices of that system failed , and Mr. Jones actually fell back to the area where he had been stuck for so long . "
Shortly before midnight on Wednesday , rescuers got close enough to Jones to conclude that he was not breathing and he had no pulse .
Rescue officials were meeting Thursday to determine how to recover Jones ' body .
Rescuers had tried to reach Jones for more than 24 hours , but had problems navigating the treacherous terrain , Cannon said .
" Getting people to him is very difficult , " Cannon told KSL before Jones died .
" It is a tightly confined space .
When there is movement , it is literally millimeters at a time . "
There are narrow areas of the cave where visitors have to crawl on their bellies to get through , according to the attraction 's Web site .
Up to 5,000 people visit each year , the site said .
Sync between iPods without a Computer
Every time you transfer files between iPods , you ’ll obviously have to use your PC / Laptop , transfer files from iPod to PC , and then from PC to the other iPod ; a roundabout way , is n’t it ?
Desperately looking for a way to transfer tracks from one iPod to another ?
Wish there was a hardware to do this task ?
well .. there actually is !
Named miShare , this tiny gadget that connects to the 30 - pin dock connector ( the usual data connectivity socket ) of your iPod , transfers tracks / files from one iPod to another with no hassle !
And what ’s more , files get transferred at the speed of USB 2.0 !
miShare looks like the image above .
A slider + a button and that ’s it .
It works with all Mini , Nano , 3G , 4G , Video ( 5G ) , and Classic ( 6G ) iPod models and does NOT work with iPhone and iPod Touch .
The team that designed miShare is working to enable support for iPhone and iPod Touch and this will be available later .
miShare wo n’t work with iPod Shuffle as they do not have the 30 - pin connector on which miShare works .
Connecting your iPods with miShare and transferring files is no big deal .
Create an ‘ on - the - go ’ playlist on your source iPod .
This is done by pressing the center button while the song title is highlighted .
Add the tracks that you want to be transferred .
Next , connect the left pin of miShare to your source iPod and slide the switch all the way to the right .
When the left arrow glows green , connect your destination iPod ( to which the files have to be transferred ) to the right pin .
Press the only button ( center ) in miShare to start the transfer Selected tracks will now be transferred .
miShare blinks green when the transfer is in progress .
Once done , remove the smart gadget from both the iPods ( you do n’t have to choose ‘ safely remove ’ ;-) )
The destination iPod should have a playlist named “ miShare Playlist ” that contains all the tracks that have been transferred .
And also , be ready to shell out 99 bucks before this gadget can sync your tracks .
And yes , that ’s in $ ( USD ) . ;)
Do check out the official miShare site for more about miShare .

Many parents are trying to decide whether to send their kids to private school .
Private schools do offer many perks to parents and students .
Although there are some drawbacks as well .
One of the main reasons parents put their children in these schools is so that they will be better prepared for college .
Does it really make much of a difference ?
Private Schools offer students more time with the teacher .
Smaller class sizes are really tempting because with more one on one attention comes greater understanding .
Plus private schools tend to be more accommodating than public schools .
If students are handicapped , suffer from a learning disorder , or just struggle in school they have specialists and teachers that are willing to do anything to help your child succeed .
They also offer accelerated programs that can help your children learn faster and prepare them for college .
Many private schools spend a lot of time on the basics so that children really understand and then they can progress at a faster rate .
They also offer greater resources to students .
In public schools , many classes do n't have enough books for students to have one in class and one to take home so students can't spend much time studying .
Private schools have more resources available to them .
However , one of the problems with private schools is that they are very expensive .
Many parents do n't have a problem cutting corners in other places in order to fund their children 's education .
Another thing is that the student body at private schools does n't tend to be very diverse so students are missing out on different perspectives and experiences that tend to give them a more rounded education .
Students at private schools also tend to miss out on team sports .
Many do n't seem to know how to work together on a team .
Plus , they miss out on teamwork and the competitive sports that can not only be great exercise , but keeps many kids out of trouble .
Plus many miss out on the social skills that come naturally to students in public schools .
Because many students in private schools are from similar backgrounds they tend to be clickier and stuck up .
Another problem with some private schools is that some colleges do not accept their credits .
They do n't recognize them or accredit them .
So after these students have gone to school for years , learned , and worked really hard they do n't reap any benefits , because colleges do n't accept them .
I know this is a rare exception but there 's still that chance so make sure colleges accept credit from that private school before you enroll your child there .
Although I have mentioned the enormous property bubble in Canada on numerous occasions , I have also stated a belief that Canada as a whole was better off than the US .
Not so fast says Jonathan Tonge of the America Canada Blog .
Jonathan pinged me with the following email :
Mish ,
Observing the attached August 2009 GDP report you ’ll note that Canada ’s economy is still receding and it has not escaped recession .
Furthermore , the only sectors that are growing are from the result of one of two things : stimulus and a massively inflationary credit environment .
Canadian Real Estate :
Canada ’s home prices have skyrocketed in this recession .
When the dollar was at 97 cents US a couple weeks ago , average Canadian home prices hit roughly $ 320,000 US – an all - time high .
Residential mortgage debt has over doubled since 2002 .
We will surpass the US in per capita residential debt within the next year .
In 2009 alone , we will add 100 billion in fresh residential mortgage credit ( equivalent of about 1 trillion in the US on a per capita basis )
The average price of a detached Toronto home has approached $ 600,000 .
I have attached a home listed at $ 559,000 .
The home is about a 15 minute drive from downtown in an average location .
It is clearly overvalued .
The listing - to - sales ratio in Toronto , the fifth largest city in North America , has surpassed the late 1980 ’s bubble .
Moments after that point Toronto ’s housing market crashed losing 25 % of its value and the country went into a deep recession .
Toronto ’s housing market took 12 years to recover , and needless to say its recovery was brought on by a massively inflationary credit environment .
In the greater Vancouver area , our third largest metropolis after Montreal , the average price of a detached home in March 2008 was $ 921,000 .
In fall of 2008 the market tanked , but only to find itself growing again in 2009 .
By September 2009 the average price was back up to $ 904,000 .
Average household incomes in Vancouver are lower than average incomes in Toronto .
They hover somewhere around the $ 70,000 mark .
All of these prices are one hundred percent attributable to ultra low interest rates and a government insured credit market .
CMHC , the equivalent of Fannie and Freddie , has expanded securitization of mortgage debt to nearly 100 % of the credit market in Canada .
The government of Canada insures the securities .
The healthy banks in Canada , something that gets bragged about internationally , have fewer loans on their books then they did in 2007 .
This is despite the credit market growing by 30 % since then .
The Bank of Canada has already admitted to a real estate bubble in Canada .
Mark Carney , head of the BOC , has threatened to manipulate the mortgage market if borrowers do n’t come to their senses .
Exports and Buy America :
Exports to the United States have fallen nearly 50 % , in part thanks to “ Buy America ” .
I was just transferred from our Mississauga , ON offices to Hamilton , and I get the pleasure of driving through the steel armpit of Ontario daily .
US Steel purchased Stelco , our largest steel manufacturer , two years ago and just after it received hundreds of millions from Ontario ’s provincial government to keep operating .
Within days of “ Buy America ” , US steel shut down the Canadian Stelco plant .
A few months ago , as the benefits for the laid off workers dried up , US Steel was notified that they would have to either bring the workers back or pay out their pensions .
US Steel decided to bring them back to work .
Instead of making steel , they painted all the buildings in a fresh coat of blue paint .
If you understand the size of the Stelco plant and buildings , then you can understand what a formidable task this was .
A couple weeks after it now appears that all the buildings are blue and the workers have been laid off again .
However the steel mill now sends clouds of pollution miles high in the sky .
I have been told by some locals that the US Steel sends its iron ore to the plant to be refined .
Once refined it is put back on the ship and sent to one of their US plants – most likely in Gary Indiana – to be turned into steel .
So we get the pollution up here but none of the profits or labour .
The government of Canada has taken US Steel to court for $ 10 million per day for breach of contract .
Wait until more Canadians find out about this .
“ Buy Canada ’ , or more plausibly , “ Do Not Buy America ” will gain steam .
We ’re a free trade country by and far , but “ Buy America ” has been a hard hit below the belt for most of us .
Deficits :
In Ontario , a province with 1/ 3 the number of citizens as California , we are running a 25 billion deficit , which is getting revised upwards of 10 billion every two months .
On top of that the governments in Canada are in bed with the government unions , and for obvious reasons they truly believe that running massive deficits are good for the economy .
They remember nothing of the hardship that Canada went through in the 90’s when our debt - to - gdp topped 100 % , our country went into deep recession , and we lost our triple A rating .
As an example of this ludicrous spending , Ontario , despite the record deficit , just passed all day kindergarten .
The program , a concoction of the teacher ’s union , insisted that the all day program shall be taught by university educated teachers .
These teachers can earn almost $ 100,000 per year .
The program is expected to serve up to 100,000 students and cost $ 1.5 billion per year .
That ’s $ 15,000 per year per child to receive an additional half day of kindergarten class .
Between our federal and provincial governments we will run deficits well over 100 billion .
On a per capita basis , that is the equivalent of the US running a trillion dollar deficit .
This is the fastest and most significant meltdown of our national finances in a single year in history .
Last year almost everything was operating in surplus .
Conclusion :
All in , I ’d short Canada if it was a stock .
This is n’t good news for America .
We are by far your largest trading partner .
We consume more American made products than any other nation by a long shot ( 4 times what China consumes ) .
If our economy crashes in the near future , it will impact tens of millions of US workers who depend daily on the free trade of goods between our countries .

Jonathan Tonge
CHMC - Canada's Fannie Mae
Everyone here is probably very well aware of who CMHC is .
For any international visitors , CMHC was formed as a crown corporation in Canada after World War II to address the shortage in housing .
It 's mandate was to make home ownership accessible to all Canadians .
CMHC primary deliverable is mortgage insurance and mortgage backed securities .
Think Fannie and Freddie .
In 2001 GE Capital was permitted to join CMHC in the Canadian mortgage insurance industry to provide competition in the marketplace .
GE Capital began insuring Canadian mortgages and issuing NHA - MBS ( Mortgage Backed securities insured by the Government of Canada ) .
In response to competition , CMHC began its trip down a new road .
In 2002 total outstanding mortgage debt in Canada was still a cool $ 467 billion .
This was predominantly issued to good credit and people with proper downpayments .
CMHC insured a small portion of this debt .
In 2003 CMHC decided to remove the price ceilings limitations .
That is , it would insure any mortgage regardless of the cost of the home .
In 2007 , after years of lobbying , the now defunct AIG found new hope with the newly elected Conservative government .
AIG was now permitted to insure high risk Canadian mortgages .
It was also permitted to issue mortgage backed securities and exchange these on the open market .
At the same time , the Conservative government launched a radical policy that allowed CMHC , AIG & GE to insure 35 year ams and 0 % down payments .
A few months later this was expanded to 40 year amortizations .
Thanks to this stimulus in 2007 the market radically changed .
Historically high home prices continued to gain steam .
High risk borrowers flooded the real estate market .
Throughout 2007 , the average home buyer who took out a mortgage had only 6 % equity in their homes .
That 's the national average downpayment for all mortgages including buyers who moved up .
CMHC mandate is to help provide affordable housing .
Yet it has only served to fuel the credit markets , increasing the price of homes well beyond affordable levels .
I 'm about to offer the absolute best evidence of why Canada 's housing market has to crash .
It 's written into the cards .
So here it is in three quick charts .
We can start off by taking a quick snapshot of residential mortgage credit in Canada over the past thirty years .
Total Residential Mortgage Credit
Residential Mortgage Credit as a Percent of Salaries and Wages
Click on the chart for a sharper image .
Note that in the past thirty years , home prices have only risen substantially when credit is accelerating .
This summer brought to us record home sales and average prices despite stagnating incomes .
This was all caused by government stimulus priming the credit markets - mostly thanks to CMHC and the Bank of Canada .
In 1985 we borrowed 45 % of our gross salaries and wages to pay for housing .
By April of 2009 we borrowed 110 % .
This of course is an average of our entire country including those without mortgages .
To the bulls and bears , please put aside your emotions .
A real estate correction is written into the cards .
It 's a mathematical must .
Vancouver Ownership vs. Rental

I just did a quick comparison to see what the premium to own vs. rent in Vancouver & Toronto looked like , and I thought you may be interested .

The purchaser pays full price , gets a 5 year closed at 4.1 % and puts 20 % down , the monthly cost to buy ( including condo fees ) is $ 3718 .
Premium to own vs. rent is 62 %….. not to mention the additional $ 72 k the Vancouver buyer needs in order to put down 20 % .
I guess it ’s important to consider a few other differences between the two cities .
Toronto / Ontario has :
A higher rate of population growth 9.2 % vs. 6.5 % ( 5 year average )
Higher median income ( $ 78,802 compared to $ 74,961 )
Higher savings rate ( 3.7 % ONT vs. - 2.6 % for BC )
A bigger and more diverse economy
Vancouver / BC has :
A more aesthetically appealing city
A better hockey team
Way more Starbucks
Ontario deficits :
No one cares
October 22 , 2009 5:09 PM
Bond markets shrugged off news that Ontario will run a larger - than - expected $ 24.7 - billion deficit .
There was widespread anticipation that Canada ’s most populous province would overshoot its deficit forecast going into Thursday 's economic update .
So bond traders said the spread , or premium , on benchmark Ontario bonds widened by just one basis point when Finance Minister Dwight Duncan revealed an additional $ 6.2 - billion in deficit spending .
Ontario is expected to see its total borrowing requirement for this fiscal year increase by $ 3.2 - billion to $ 42.6 - billion .
A large portion of that additional borrowing - up to 50 per cent , according to investment banking sources - will be done on international markets .
Ontario taxpayers bracing for years of deficits
October 21 , 2009
Ontario ’s finance minister is bracing taxpayers for years of budget deficits , warning Canada ’s most populous province could be in for a “ long , slow grind ” before it swings back to true economic recovery .
The scope of Ontario ’s financial crisis is underscored by its sputtering economy , so closely tied to the United States .
The province ’s gross domestic product , a key measure of economic health that represents the dollar value of all goods and services produced , stood at $ 508.9 - billion in the second quarter .
That ’s roughly the same size as it was in 2005 , meaning Ontario ’s economy has not grown in the four years since .
Government revenues are also now back at levels they were that year .
Since peaking in the fourth quarter of 2007 , real GDP has shrunk 5 % .
Corporate tax revenues have plunged over the past year as the recession took hold .
That in turn will make it more difficult for the province to dig itself out of a deficit position by 2015 as promised .
Ontario is not alone however .
Based on the most recent estimates compiled by TD Bank Financial , the federal and provincial governments combined are on pace to tally a deficit of $ 85 - billion in fiscal year 2009 - 2010 on an aggregate basis , representing 6 % of GDP .
TD Bank says the real shortfall could top $ 100 - billion as governments revise their estimates higher .
Tackling the deficits will be made tougher by the likelihood of a historically slow rate of GDP growth nationwide and age - related spending challenges like seniors ’ benefits , the bank said in a report released Tuesday .
Exactly how Ontario intends to sustain its public services while restoring a balanced budget is still unclear .
The province spent $ 4 - billion to help rescue General Motors Co. and Chrysler earlier this year .
It is running a deficit that ’s roughly 20 % of total revenues , according to TD -- the highest ratio of any province .
ntario credit downgraded by S&P
The Ontario government had its credit rating downgraded one category by Standard and Poor 's Ratings Services on Thursday in response to its recent projection of a record deficit and negative prospects for the province 's economy going forward .
The province 's rating was dropped to AA - minus from AA .
Last week the Ontario government said it expects to run a deficit of $ 24.7 - billion in the current fiscal year , up from its expectation of $ 14.1 - billion in March .
The bigger shortfall is largely a result of more money being spent than earlier expected , including $ 4 - billion that 's going toward auto - industry bailouts .
As well , it expects now to get $ 5.8 - billion less in tax revenues than previously anticipated as earnings for both companies and individuals alike have taken a hit from the recent recession .
Government To The Rescue
Starting in September , 2011 , Ontario students from grade four to 12 will learn how to better manage their money in courses that will be integrated into their overall school curriculum in an effort to improve financial smarts .
“ The global economic challenges of the last year have highlighted the need to ensure a financially literate population , ” Ontario Education Minister Kathleen Wynne said in a statement .

Hutchison : Oh Noes !!1!
Call Teh Marines !
From the desk of Susan Hutchison , candidate for King County Executive :
I want to talk to you today about the most serious and immediate threat to the region ’s economy and well being — floods along the Green River resulting from problems at the Howard Hansen Dam .
I have said for two months that we need to be working 24/ 7 to shore up the levees to prevent the disaster .
Today I suggest we call up the Marines !
The Howard Hanson Dam ( which has its own Twitter page ) is located in south King County .
It was dedicated in 1962 and built to prevent flooding of the lowland areas of Auburn , Kent , Tukwila , and Renton .
But now the dam is steadily leaking , and it can't store as much water as it used to , which may precipitate flooding .
Back to Hutchison :
Thousands of businesses are located there , including the Boeing Commercial Airplane company headquarters .
The lowlands are home to 30,000 residents including senior and low - cost housing .
The county , Boeing and other businesses are spending millions to protect their assets , and people who can , are moving to higher ground .
But as we saw with Katrina , the poor and vulnerable will suffer the most .
Hutchison , who places priorities with the poor and the vulnerable , lays out a bullet - point plan on how to address the issue , a list that includes :
Asking for military assistance from Fort Lewis - based units , calling for volunteers from the area to prepare for flooding , and , to lobby the Governor and our D.C. delegation to get us the cash to fix the dam .
Hutchison attacks Constantine , too : " My opponent , who is chair of the County Council , says he ’s been in meetings since May .
But we what we need is action ! "
Meetings !
He 's been in meetings !
Meetings about the damn dam !
You mean , like this meeting ?
Spent the morning with the Army Corps Colonel and at the Howard Hanson Dam .
Good progress .
Now at the flood prep meeting in Kent.
BIG crowd .
Huh .
Sometime meetings can be good , too .
( London ) - The UK government should immediately order an independent judicial inquiry into the role and complicity of British security services in the torture of terrorism suspects in Pakistan , Human Rights Watch said in a report released today .
The 46 - page report , " Cruel Britannia : British Complicity in the Torture and Ill - treatment of Terror Suspects in Pakistan , " provides accounts from victims and their families in the cases of five UK citizens of Pakistani origin - Salahuddin Amin , Zeeshan Siddiqui , Rangzieb Ahmed , Rashid Rauf and a fifth individual who wishes to remain anonymous - tortured in Pakistan by Pakistani security agencies between 2004 and 2007 .
Human Rights
Watch found that while there is no evidence of UK officials directly participating in torture , UK complicity is clear .
" British intelligence and law enforcement colluded with and turned a blind eye to the use of torture on terrorism suspects in Pakistan , " said Ali Dayan Hasan , senior South Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch .
" British officials knew that Pakistani intelligence agencies routinely used torture , were aware of specific cases and did not intervene . "
A well - placed official within the UK government told Human Rights Watch that allegations of UK complicity made by Human Rights Watch in testimony to the UK Parliament 's Joint Committee on Human Rights in February 2009 were accurate .
Another government source told Human Rights
Watch that its research into this subject was " spot on . "
These officials said that the Pakistani intelligence services cooperated in specific cases by sharing information from abusive interrogations with British officials , which was used in prosecutions in UK courts and other investigations .
UK law enforcement and intelligence officials passed questions to Pakistani officials for use in interrogation sessions in individual cases , knowing that these Pakistani officials were using torture .
Knowledgeable civilian and military officials in the Pakistani government have on numerous occasions told Human Rights Watch that British officials were aware of the mistreatment of the terrorism suspects in question .
" A key lesson from the past eight years of global efforts to combat terrorism is that the use of torture and ill - treatment is deeply counterproductive , " Hasan said .
" It undermines the moral legitimacy of governments that rely on it and serves as a recruiting tool for terrorist organizations . "
Four of the victims described meeting British officials while detained in Pakistan .
In some cases this happened shortly after sessions in which the individuals had been tortured , when clear and visible signs of torture were evident .
Rangzieb Ahmed , from Greater Manchester , England , was arrested in the North West Frontier Province in Pakistan on August 20 , 2006 and accused of links with al Qaeda .
On September 7 , 2007 , he was transferred to the United Kingdom .
Ahmed told Human Rights
Watch that while he was in detention in Pakistan , he was repeatedly tortured , beaten , deprived of sleep , and otherwise mistreated by Pakistani security agencies .
His torturers pulled out three of his fingernails , he said .
Human Rights
Watch spoke to members of Pakistan 's law enforcement agencies involved in processing Ahmed at various stages of his detention .
These sources , from both civilian and military Pakistani agencies , confirmed what they described as the " overall authenticity " of his claims , including the claim that British intelligence services were aware of his detention and treatment at " all times . "
Zeeshan Siddiqui from Hounslow , London , was arrested in Pakistan on May 15 , 2005 , on suspicion of involvement in terrorism .
He was deported to the United Kingdom on January 8 , 2006 .
During his detention , Siddiqui said he was repeatedly beaten , chained , injected with drugs , and threatened with sexual abuse and further torture .
Speaking on condition of anonymity , Pakistani security officials confirmed to Human Rights Watch that Siddiqui was arrested on the basis of a tip - off from the British intelligence services and at their request .
The Pakistani sources added that British intelligence agents were aware at all times that Siddiqui was being " processed " in the " traditional way " and the British were " effectively " interrogating Siddiqui even as Pakistan 's Intelligence Bureau " processed " him .
" Because no one could prove or get him to admit anything useful , that is probably why the green light was given to bring him into the [ legal ] system , " the source said .
Amin , of Edgware , was convicted in April 2007 in the " Crevice " trial for plotting attacks against several potential targets , including London 's Ministry of Sound nightclub .
Amin gave himself up voluntarily to Pakistani authorities after assurances were given to his family that he would not be mistreated , but was then tortured repeatedly through 2004 and forced into false confessions .
Amin alleges that during his detention he was met by British intelligence officials on almost a dozen occasions .
Amin was released by Pakistani authorities after a 10 - month illegal detention , and then arrested upon arrival at Heathrow airport in 2005 .
Pakistani intelligence sources said that Amin 's account of his detention and meetings with British and American intelligence personnel are " essentially accurate . "
These sources told Human Rights Watch that Amin's was a " high pressure " case and that the British and American desire for information from him was " insatiable . "
The sources added that the British and American agents who were " party " to Amin 's detention were " perfectly aware that we were using all means possible to extract information from him and were grateful that we were doing so . "
" The evil of terrorism does not justify participating in or using the results of torture , " Hasan said .
" Until an independent inquiry is held and those responsible held accountable , Britain 's reputation as a rights - respecting nation will stand tarnished . "
General denials of complicity in torture from the foreign and home secretaries have not addressed the specific allegations made by Human Rights Watch , The Guardian newspaper , and lawyers representing torture victims .
The government has also failed to respond adequately to the findings and recommendations of the Joint Committee on Human Rights ( JCHR ) and the Foreign Affairs Committee .
The JCHR has called for an independent judicial inquiry .
" The British government has stonewalled parliament , victims and the public alike in refusing to answer any questions about its behavior in Pakistan , " Hasan said .
" It should immediately set up an independent judicial inquiry and put in place measures to ensure that its complicity in torture never happens again . "
The Guardian newspaper has said that the problem of sex trafficking has been exaggerated and that the number of people who have been brought into the UK and forced against their will into prostitution is much smaller than claimed .
Jeremy Paxman talks to former minister for Europe , Dennis McShane , and Nikki Adams , of the English Collective of Prostitutes , about who is right .
If you 're extending the federal law and federal subsidies into other areas of health care , then the current law on abortion should apply .
There is no greater restriction placed on anyone .
If you have a policy and you receive federal subsidy , and if you want to buy abortion coverage , you can .
It says very clearly : supplemental policies , you 're free to do it , you 've just gotta use your own money .
States do it right now .
They put up their matching share on Medicaid .
They can't use their state funds when they use the matching share , they can't take money out of there , but they can dip into another state pot , and 11 states do that and provide abortion coverage .
That does n't change .
None of that changes .
NPR has a site that says nothing changes , PolitiFact has a site that says the Stupak language does n't change anything , it 's current law .
I understand it was a fight to get the vote on this amendment .
What was it like dealing with leadership on this ?
Did things ever get contentious between you and the pro-life members of the Democratic caucus and the Democratic leaders ?
Well that 's how we got our amendment , because Speaker Pelosi went to present what she agreed to with us , that it would be part of a manager 's amendment .
There should have never been an amendment .
There never should have been a vote on this .
We had agreed to put it in a manager 's amendment , which would have been less than what I actually got -- Hyde - lite as I call it , Hyde language lite -- and it was the pro-choice people that rejected it .
They 're the ones -- and I 've been saying all along , all I want to do is vote on my conscience , let the will of the House work its way -- they 're the ones who insisted , ' No , Stupak does n't get to go in the manager 's amendment , we want it on the floor . '
They 're the ones who insisted on bringing it to a vote .
They 're the ones who wanted to vote against me , they were the ones who said they would win this vote .
Now they lose , and now they 're distorting the hell out of the amendment .
That 's the part that bothers most of us .
They 're the ones who wanted the amendment .
We had an agreement with the Speaker .
They rejected it , and then they took it to the floor and they lost , and now suddenly I 'm the bad person .
So if they had n't fought you at that stage ...
If they had n't rejected the Speaker on Friday night , to use their words , there would have been a less restrictive amendment that would have been part of the manager 's amendment .
They rejected that .
They could not live with it .
Even the less restrictive language .
And therefore the Speaker came back and said , ' Bart , I 'm sorry , but our deal 's off .
So I have no choice , because we made an agreement , I 'm gonna have to give you an amendment , ' and I said , ' Well , with all due respect , Madame Speaker , I 'm not gonna send the amendment we agreed to , because if the deal 's off , then I do n't have to hold to that agreement , Hyde - lite , and I 'm putting up the original Hyde language that I offered in committee , that Joe Pitts and I offered . '
That 's why it 's called the Stupak - Pitts amendment : that 's the same amendment we offered July 30th in committee .
So , in a way , the pro-choice people , by rejecting the Speaker 's proposal , brought this on themselves , and then somehow now they 're blaming me .
I find that rather ironic .
ISM , 6 November 2009 20 years to the fall of the Berlin wall : Demonstrators toppled 8 meters tall concrete wall in Ni�ilin
Three protest marches were held today in the West Bank to mark the 20th anniversary to the fall of the Berlin wall , which has been declared an international day of action against Israel�s barrier .
In Ni�lin , the 300 demonstrators managed to topple a part of the eight meters tall concrete wall that cuts through the village�s land .
Following the direct action , the army fired scores of live rounds at the demonstrators .
Demonstrators topple concrete wall Using small tools , Ni�lin residents push concrete wall
No matter how tall , all walls fall
The concrete wall in Ni�lin � five to eight meters ( 15 to 25 feet ) in height � has only recently been laid on the path of the wall cutting through Ni�lin�s lands , in addition to the already existing electronic barrier and razor - wire .
Since the Wall was built to allow more land to annexed to the nearby settlements rather than in a militarily strategic manner , demonstrators have been able to repeatedly dismantle parts of the electronic fence and razor - wire surrounding it .
The section of the Wall in Ni�lin is the only place along the route of the barrier where a concrete wall has been erected in an attempt to deal with the civic , unarmed campaign waged by the village in protest of the massive land theft that will enable the expansion of the illegal settlements of Modi�in Il�it and Hashmonaim .
Since Israel began its construction in the year 2002 , This is the first time demonstrators succeed in toppling a part of Israel�s barrier which is a concrete wall .
One of the demonstrators , Moheeb Khawaja , said during the protest : " Twenty years ago no one had thought the monster that divided Berlin into two could be brought down , but in only two days in November , it did .
Today we have proven that this can also be done here and now .
It is our land beyond this wall , and we will not give up on it .
We will win for a simple reason � justice is on our side . "
Background Israel began construction of the Wall on Ni�lin�s land in 2004 , but stopped after an injunction order issued by the Israeli Supreme Court ( ISC ) .
Despite the previous order and a 2004 ruling from the International Court of Justice declaring the Wall illegal , construction of the Wall began again in May 2008 .
Following the return of Israeli bulldozers to their lands , residents of Ni�lin have launched a grassroots campaign to protest the massive land theft , including demonstrations and direct actions .
The original route of the Wall , which Israel began constructing in 2004 , was ruled illegal by the ISC , as was a second , marginally less obtrusive proposed route .
The most recent path , now completed , still cuts deep into Ni�lin�s land .
The Wall has been built to include plans , not yet approved by the Army�s planning authority , for a cemetery and an industrial zone for the illegal settlement Modi�in Ilit .
Since the Wall was built to annex more land to the nearby settlements rather than in a militarily strategic manner , demonstrators have been able to repeatedly dismantle parts of the electronic fence and razor - wire surrounding it .
Consequently , the army has erected a 15 - 25 feet tall concrete wall , in addition to the electronic fence .
The section of the Wall in Ni�lin is the only part of the route where a concrete wall has been erected in response to civilian , unarmed protest .
As a result of the Wall construction , Ni�lin has lost 3,920 dunams , roughly 30 % of its remaining lands .
Originally , Ni�lin consisted of 15,898 dunams ( 3928 acres ) .
Post 1948 , Ni�lin was left with 14,794 dunams ( 3656 acres ) .
After the occupation of the West Bank in 1967 , the illegal settlements and infrastructure of Modi�in Ilit , Mattityahu and Hashmonaim were built on village lands , and Ni�lin lost another 1,973 dunams .
With the completion of the Wall , Ni�lin has a remaining 8911 dunams ( 2201 acres ) , 56 % of it�s original size .
Ni�lin is effectively split into 2 parts ( upper and lower ) by Road 446 , which was built directly through the village .
According to the publicized plan of the Israeli government , a tunnel will be built under road 446 to connect the upper and lower parts of Ni�lin , allowing Israel to turn Road 446 into a segregated - setter only road .
Subsequently , access for Palestinian vehicles to this road and to the main entrances of upper and lower Ni�lin will be closed .
Additionally , since the tunnel will be the only entryway to Ni�lin , Israel will have control over the movement of Palestinian residents .
Israel commonly uses tear - gas projectiles , rubber coated steel bullets and live ammunition against demonstrators .
Since May , 2008 , five of Ni�lin�s residents were killed and one American solidarity activist was critically injured from Israeli fire during grassroots demonstrations in Ni�lin .
5 June 2009 : Yousef Akil Srour ( 36 ) was shot in the chest with 0.22 caliber live ammunition and pronounced dead upon arrival at a Ramallah hospital .
13 March 2009 : Tristan Anderson ( 37 ) , an American citizen , was shot in the head with a high velocity tear gas projectile .
He is currently at Tel Hashomer hospital near Tel Aviv with uncertain prospects for his recovery .
28 December 2008 : Mohammed Khawaje ( 20 ) was shot in the head with 5.56 mm caliber live ammunition .
He died in a Ramallah hospital 3 days later on 31 December 2008 .
28 December 2008 : Arafat Rateb Khawaje ( 22 ) was shot in the back with 5.56 mm caliber live ammunition and pronounced dead upon arrival at a Ramallah hospital .
30 July 2008 : Yousef Amira ( 17 ) was shot in the head with two rubber coated steel bullets .
He died in a Ramallah hospital 5 days later on 4 August 2008 .
29 July 2008 : Ahmed Mousa ( 10 ) was shot in the forehead with 5.56 mm caliber live ammunition and pronounced dead upon arrival at a Ramallah hospital .
In total , 19 people have been killed during demonstrations against the Wall .
Israeli armed forces have shot 40 demonstrators with live ammunition in Ni�lin .
Of them , 11 were shot with 5.56 mm caliber live ammunition and 24 were shot with 0.22 caliber live ammunition .
Since May 2008 , 87 arrests of Ni�lin residents have been made in relation to anti-Wall demonstrations in the village .
The protesters seized by the army constitute around 7 % of the village�s males aged between 12 and 55 .
The arrests are part of a broad Israeli intimidation campaign to suppress all demonstrations against the apartheid infrastructure in the West Bank .
Well - mannered :
Well , that was awkward — one of those embarrassing breach - of - etiquette moments , like when some guy on the bus asks to borrow your comb .
You want to be generous , do the polite thing , etc. but geez ...
In our case , the uncomfortable moment involved U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn , who presided over the recent City Hall corruption trial of former city council member Don Hill , his wife and cronies .
After the trial concluded last month , Dallas Observer reporter Sam Merten interviewed one of the jurors who voted to convict Hill and his four co-defendants .
Juror Nedra
Frazier let slip that there might have been some chitchat among jurors about testimony before deliberations began and jurors might have heard talk about the case outside the jury room .
All of which is a no - no .
We posted part of Merten 's interview with Frazier on our blog Unfair Park , and Victor Vital , lawyer for Hill 's wife , Sheila , used the interview as part of his basis for requesting a new trial for his client .
So , Lynn had her clerk call the paper and ask Merten for a copy of his tape of the interview .
We refused , of course .
" Citing to some vague constitutional protection unknown to this Court , the Observer declined to produce the tape to the Court .
Because of the Observer 's refusal to produce the tape , the Court cannot assess the accuracy of the story , " the judge wrote last week in a somewhat snippy footnote to a ruling that partly rejected Vital 's motion .
She held off ruling on whether Frazier 's statement constitutes grounds for granting the motion until she gets a chance to interview Frazier herself .
Listen , judge , we here at the Observer love to be helpful — we 're just a big bunch of Boy Scouts — and Lord knows we 'd never deliberately do anything to screw up the process of sending a local political hack off to the pokey .
But 'round here we call that " vague constitutional protection " the First Amendment .
As our lawyer Steve Suskin explained to Lynn 's clerk , if the judge wants our tapes , we at least want a chance to be heard before her on why we think we should n't give them up .
We would n't be the first news organization in Texas to fight a court 's request to turn over our work product .
We 're not in the business of becoming an adjunct to the government .
" The point is n't we do n't want anyone to know what is on the tape .
There are First Amendment issues that need to be asserted here as a matter of principle , " Suskin says .
That 's right .
We have principles .
Who knew ?
It was unattended in a hotel room at the time :
Israel ’s Mossad espionage agency used Trojan Horse programs to gather intelligence about a nuclear facility in Syria the Israel Defense Forces destroyed in 2007 , the German magazine Der Spiegel reported Monday .
According to the magazine , Mossad agents in London planted the malware on the computer of a Syrian official who was staying in the British capital ; he was at a hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Kensington at the time .
The program copied the details of Syria ’s illicit nuclear program and sent them directly to the Mossad agents ’ computers , the report said .
Hello !
You look GOOD today .
God damn .
Oh , here are some West Coast North America , and UK + Ireland tour dates !
I like people watching .
It 's fun .
You go , you sit on a patio or something with a friend , and you watch people go by .
The two of you can make up little stories in your head for them .
I mean , I think we make up little stories for people in our heads anyway , on an unconscious level .
Stereotyping is a part of that .
But when you 're people watching you think about it more .
But what 's even more fun , especially if you live near a college or university , is to get up high , at night .
Not too high , but above head - level .
In a tree , or on a ledge in shadows .
And then you and your friend just sit quietly , and you sit still , and you wait for groups of people going to and from parties , or to and from friends ' houses , and you listen .
You get a snatch of conversation , here or there .
It 's like people watching , except you can get a bit closer to them .
It 's almost like for a brief second you can hear their thoughts .
People listening !
Another hobby that 's just one step closer to stalking !

3.1 Built - in Table Editor
Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII .
Any line with ‘ | ’ as the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table .
‘ | ’ is also the column separator17 .
Moreover , a line starting with ‘ |- ’ is a horizontal rule .
It separates rows explicitly .
Rows before the first horizontal rule are header lines .
A table might look like this :
| Name | Phone | Age | |-------+-------+-----| | Peter | 1234 | 17 | | Anna | 4321 | 25 |
A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press TAB , RET or C -c C -c inside the table .
TAB also moves to the next field — RET to the next row — and creates new table rows at the end of the table or before horizontal lines .
The indentation of the table is set by the first line .
Horizontal rules are automatically expanded on every re-align to span the whole table width .
So , to create the above table , you would only type
| Name |Phone|Age| |-
and then press TAB to align the table and start filling in fields .
Even faster would be to type ‘ | Name | Phone|Age ’ followed by C-c RET .
When typing text into a field , Org treats DEL , Backspace , and all character keys in a special way , so that inserting and deleting avoids shifting other fields .
Also , when typing immediately after point was moved into a new field with TAB , S - TAB or RET , the field is automatically made blank .
If this behavior is too unpredictable for you , configure the option org - table - auto - blank - field .
Creation and conversion
C-c | ( org - table - create - or - convert - from - region ) Convert the active region to table .
If every line contains at least one TAB character , the function assumes that the material is tab separated .
If every line contains a comma , comma-separated values ( CSV ) are assumed .
If not , lines are split at whitespace into fields .
You can use a prefix argument to force a specific separator : C-u forces CSV , C-u C-u forces TAB , C-u C-u C-u prompts for a regular expression to match the separator , and a numeric argument N indicates that at least N consecutive spaces , or alternatively a TAB will be the separator .
If there is no active region , this command creates an empty Org table .
But it is easier just to start typing , like | N a m e | P h o n e | A g e RET | - TAB .
Re-aligning and field motion
C-c C-c ( org - table - align )
Re-align the table without moving point .
TAB ( org - table - next - field ) Re-align the table , move to the next field .
Creates a new row if necessary .
C-c SPC ( org - table - blank - field )
Blank the field at point .
S- TAB ( org - table - previous - field ) Re-align , move to previous field .
RET ( org - table - next - row ) Re-align the table and move down to next row .
Creates a new row if necessary .
At the beginning or end of a line , RET still inserts a new line , so it can be used to split a table .
M-a ( org - table - beginning - of - field )
Move to beginning of the current table field , or on to the previous field .
M-e ( org - table - end - of - field )
Move to end of the current table field , or on to the next field .
Column and row editing
M- LEFT ( org - table - move - column - left )
Move the current column left .
M- RIGHT ( org - table - move - column - right )
Move the current column right .
M-S- LEFT ( org - table - delete - column )
Kill the current column .
M-S- RIGHT ( org - table - insert - column )
Insert a new column at point position .
Move the recent column and all cells to the right of this column to the right .
M- UP ( org - table - move - row - up )
Move the current row up .
M- DOWN ( org - table - move - row - down )
Move the current row down .
M-S- UP ( org - table - kill - row )
Kill the current row or horizontal line .
S- UP ( org - table - move - cell - up )
Move cell up by swapping with adjacent cell .
S- DOWN ( org - table - move - cell - down )
Move cell down by swapping with adjacent cell .
S- LEFT ( org - table - move - cell - left )
Move cell left by swapping with adjacent cell .
S- RIGHT ( org - table - move - cell - right )
Move cell right by swapping with adjacent cell .
M-S- DOWN ( org - table - insert - row )
Insert a new row above the current row .
With a prefix argument , the line is created below the current one .
C-c - ( org - table - insert - hline )
Insert a horizontal line below current row .
With a prefix argument , the line is created above the current line .
C-c RET ( org - table - hline - and - move )
Insert a horizontal line below current row , and move point into the row below that line .
C-c ^ ( org - table - sort - lines )
Sort the table lines in the region .
The position of point indicates the column to be used for sorting , and the range of lines is the range between the nearest horizontal separator lines , or the entire table .
If point is before the first column , you are prompted for the sorting column .
If there is an active region , the mark specifies the first line and the sorting column , while point should be in the last line to be included into the sorting .
The command prompts for the sorting type , alphabetically , numerically , or by time .
You can sort in normal or reverse order .
You can also supply your own key extraction and comparison functions .
When called with a prefix argument , alphabetic sorting is case - sensitive .
Regions
C-c C-x M-w ( org - table - copy - region )
Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard .
Point and mark determine edge fields of the rectangle .
If there is no active region , copy just the current field .
The process ignores horizontal separator lines .
C- c C-x C-w ( org - table - cut - region )
Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard , and blank all fields in the rectangle .
So this is the “ cut ” operation .
C- c C-x C-y ( org - table - paste - rectangle )
Paste a rectangular region into a table .
The upper left corner ends up in the current field .
All involved fields are overwritten .
If the rectangle does not fit into the present table , the table is enlarged as needed .
The process ignores horizontal separator lines .
M- RET ( org - table - wrap - region )
Split the current field at point position and move the rest to the line below .
If there is an active region , and both point and mark are in the same column , the text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given number of lines .
A numeric prefix argument may be used to change the number of desired lines .
If there is no region , but you specify a prefix argument , the current field is made blank , and the content is appended to the field above .
Calculations
C-c + ( org - table - sum )
Sum the numbers in the current column , or in the rectangle defined by the active region .
The result is shown in the echo area and can be inserted with C-y .
S- RET ( org - table - copy - down )
When current field is empty , copy from first non-empty field above .
When not empty , copy current field down to next row and move point along with it .
Depending on the variable org - table - copy - increment , integer and time stamp field values , and fields prefixed or suffixed with a whole number , can be incremented during copy .
Also , a 0 prefix argument temporarily disables the increment .
This key is also used by shift - selection and related modes ( see Conflicts ) .

Back in August , Portland was visited by NBC Nightly News to do a piece on Portland ’s food cart scene .
It was a great few days showing the producer around and chatting with him and introducing him to some of Portland ’s cart owners .
Greg Abbot from Whiffies and I were interviewed on Strangelovelive that week and that segment alone gave the article some meat .
Originally , I think it was to be a Portland vs. New York piece .
I think Portland got the better deal .
You decide .
If you ’re not able to watch the video , head over to MSNBC .
Wonderful job Portland !

As the UN climate summit in Copenhagen approaches , BBC News environment correspondent Richard Black traces key milestones , scientific discoveries , technical innovations and political action .
The Newcomen Engine foreshadowed industrial scale use of coal 1712 - British ironmonger Thomas Newcomen invents the first widely used steam engine , paving the way for the Industrial Revolution and industrial scale use of coal .
1800 - world population reaches one billion .
1824 - French physicist Joseph Fourier describes the Earth 's natural " greenhouse effect " .
He writes : " The temperature [ of the Earth ] can be augmented by the interposition of the atmosphere , because heat in the state of light finds less resistance in penetrating the air , than in re-passing into the air when converted into non-luminous heat . "
1861 - Irish physicist John Tyndall shows that water vapour and certain other gases create the greenhouse effect .
" This aqueous vapour is a blanket more necessary to the vegetable life of England than clothing is to man , " he concludes .
More than a century later , he is honoured by having a prominent UK climate research organisation - the Tyndall Centre - named after him .
1886 - Karl Benz unveils the Motorwagen , often regarded as the first true automobile .
1896 - Swedish chemist Svante Arrhenius concludes that industrial - age coal burning will enhance the natural greenhouse effect .
He suggests this might be beneficial for future generations .
His conclusions on the likely size of the " man-made greenhouse " are in the same ballpark - a few degrees Celsius for a doubling of CO2 - as modern - day climate models .
Svante Arrhenius unlocked the man-made greenhouse a century ago 1900 - another Swede , Knut Angstrom , discovers that even at the tiny concentrations found in the atmosphere , CO2 strongly absorbs parts of the infrared spectrum .
Although he does not realise the significance , Angstrom has shown that a trace gas can produce greenhouse warming .
1927 - carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and industry reach one billion tonnes per year .
1930 - human population reaches two billion .
1938 - using records from 147 weather stations around the world , British engineer Guy Callendar shows that temperatures had risen over the previous century .
He also shows that CO2 concentrations had increased over the same period , and suggests this caused the warming .
The " Callendar effect " is widely dismissed by meteorologists .
1955 - using a new generation of equipment including early computers , US researcher Gilbert Plass analyses in detail the infrared absorption of various gases .
He concludes that doubling CO2 concentrations would increase temperatures by 3 - 4C .
1957 - US oceanographer Roger Revelle and chemist Hans Suess show that seawater will not absorb all the additional CO2 entering the atmosphere , as many had assumed .
Revelle writes : " Human beings are now carrying out a large scale geophysical experiment ... "
1958 - using equipment he had developed himself , Charles David ( Dave ) Keeling begins systematic measurements of atmospheric CO2 at Mauna Loa in Hawaii and in Antarctica .
Within four years , the project - which continues today - provides the first unequivocal proof that CO2 concentrations are rising .
Change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto
Margaret Thatcher 1960 - human population reaches three billion .
1965 - a US President 's Advisory Committee panel warns that the greenhouse effect is a matter of " real concern " .
1972 - first UN environment conference , in Stockholm .
Climate change hardly registers on the agenda , which centres on issues such as chemical pollution , atomic bomb testing and whaling .
The United Nations Environment Programme ( Unep ) is formed as a result .
1975 - human population reaches four billion .
1975 - US scientist Wallace Broecker puts the term " global warming " into the public domain in the title of a scientific paper .
1987 - human population reaches five billion 1987 - Montreal Protocol agreed , restricting chemicals that damage the ozone layer .
Although not established with climate change in mind , it has had a greater impact on greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol .
1988 - Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) formed to collate and assess evidence on climate change .
1989 - UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - possessor of a chemistry degree - warns in a speech to the UN that " We are seeing a vast increase in the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere ...
The result is that change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto . "
She calls for a global treaty on climate change .
1989 - carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and industry reach six billion tonnes per year .
The CO2 concentration , as measured at Mauna Loa , has risen steadily 1990 - IPCC produces First Assessment Report .
It concludes that temperatures have risen by 0.3-0.6C over the last century , that humanity 's emissions are adding to the atmosphere 's natural complement of greenhouse gases , and that the addition would be expected to result in warming .
1992 - at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro , governments agree the United Framework Convention on Climate Change .
Its key objective is " stabilization of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system " .
Developed countries agree to return their emissions to 1990 levels .
1995 - IPCC Second Assessment Report concludes that the balance of evidence suggests " a discernible human influence " on the Earth 's climate .
This has been called the first definitive statement that humans are responsible for climate change .
1997 - Kyoto Protocol agreed .
Developed nations pledge to reduce emissions by an average of 5 % by the period 2008 - 2012 , with wide variations on targets for individual countries .
US Senate immediately declares it will not ratify the treaty .
1998 - strong El Nino conditions combine with global warming to produce the warmest year on record .
The average global temperature reached 0.52C above the mean for the period 1961 - 1990 ( a commonly - used baseline ) .
1998 - publication of the controversial " hockey stick " graph indicating that modern - day temperature rise in the northern hemisphere is unusual compared with the last 1,000 years .
The work would later be the subject of two enquiries instigated by the US Congress .
Rajendra Pachauri's IPCC netted the Nobel Peace Prize in 2007 1999 - human population reaches six billion .
2001 - President George W Bush removes the US from the Kyoto process .
2001 - IPCC
Third Assessment Report finds " new and stronger evidence " that humanity 's emissions of greenhouse gases are the main cause of the warming seen in the second half of the 20th Century .
2005 - the Kyoto Protocol becomes international law for those countries still inside it .
2005 - UK Prime Minister Tony Blair selects climate change as a priority for his terms as chair of the G8 and president of the EU .
2006 - the Stern Review concludes that climate change could damage global GDP by up to 20 % if left unchecked - but curbing it would cost about 1 % of global GDP .
2006 - carbon emissions from fossil fuel burning and industry reach eight billion tonnes per year .
2007 - the IPCC 's Fourth Assessment Report concludes it is more than 90 % likely that humanity 's emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible for modern - day climate change .
2007 - the IPCC and former US vice - president Al Gore receive the Nobel Peace Prize " for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change , and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change " .
2007 - at UN negotiations in Bali , governments agree the two - year " Bali roadmap " aimed at hammering out a new global treaty by the end of 2009 .

I 've made this point before .
And I promise I will make it again .
But let 's review .
This is what the Democratic party believes :
We will never put ideology above women ’s health .
---
The Democratic Party strongly and unequivocally supports Roe v. Wade and a woman ’s right to choose a safe and legal abortion , regardless of ability to pay , and we oppose any and all efforts to weaken or undermine that right .
So , Stupak , you son of a bitch , who is the double - crosser here ?
Is it the Democrats who are promising to put ideology above women 's health ?
Because Democrats promised they would n't do that .
Is it the Democrats who are opposing efforts to weaken or undermine the right to safe , legal , and affordable abortion ?
Because Democrats promised they would n't do that .
Is it the Democrats who are opposing equality for women , including when it comes to health care ?
Because Democrats promised they would n't do that .
Or is it you ?
You 're the one leading the charge to put your sick ideology above women 's health .
You 're the one seeking to undermine Roe v. Wade .
You 're the one trying to make a legal medical procedure less accessible to the women who most need it .
So is it the real Democrats who are the double - crossers ?
Or is it you ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) -
The scandal - hit liberal grass - roots group ACORN sued the U.S. government on Thursday , saying it did not have the right to cut off ACORN ’s federal funding because the group had not been convicted of a crime .
The U.S. Congress voted in September to cut off federal money to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ( ACORN ) , after conservative activists secretly filmed employees in several cities giving tax and housing advice to a couple posing as a pimp and a prostitute .
“ It ’s not the job of Congress to be the judge , jury , and executioner , ” said Jules Lobel , an attorney with the Center for Constitutional Rights , which brought the case in Brooklyn federal court .
“ We have due process in this country , and our constitution forbids lawmakers from singling out a person or group for punishment without a fair investigation and trial , ” Lobel said .
Republicans have long accused the group of fraud in registering voters and improperly mixing political and nonpolitical activities .
They say it has received $ 53 million in federal money since 1994 .
ACORN , which has also suffered an embezzlement scandal involving the founder ’s brother , has separately sued the makers of the videos .
The lawsuit seeks a temporary restraining to prevent the Congress from reallocating funds designated for ACORN .
Beyond its voter registration drive , the group promotes affordable housing programs for lower - income people , offers tax counseling and has aggressively fought home foreclosures .
Especially if you ’re a first time entrepreneur , starting your own business can be quite overwhelming and it helps to know about the small business resources at your disposal .
After all , there are many rules from both an accounting and a legal perspective that need to be followed or you risk getting penalized by the government .
Sometimes unexpected problems or disputes will arise in which you will have no clue how to proceed .
That is why it is essential to have an experienced professional available to consult with when things become complex .
At a bare minimum , you should find an accountant or a tax expert to help in preparing your initial business tax return even if you think you know what you are doing .
Trust me .
Even if you have a strong grasp of the tax rules , an experienced accountant can help you squeeze out that last bit of tax savings .
Many of the tax rules are ambiguous and you ’ll need an experienced consultant to tell you what the limits are to avoid an audit .
In addition , even though your business may be easy to run now , things will get more complicated as your business expands .
How To Find An Accountant
The best way to find an accountant is through a referral .
When my wife and I first set out to find an accountant , we mistakenly went straight to a large accounting firm .
After an hour consultation and $ 350 later , we came out of the meeting feeling intimidated by all of the potential accounting fees and tax rules .
We were also in such a rush to minimize the hourly fees that we forgot to address many of our questions .
Ultimately , the accountant that you go with should be someone that you feel comfortable with .
If you come out of the consultation feeling scared and overwhelmed , then chances are that accountant is not a good fit for you .
It ’s also important that you do n’t feel like you are getting nickel and dimed as well .
We eventually found our accountant by contacting a friend who runs a small retail business .
Not only was our new accountant cheaper , but he made us feel at ease with our tax strategy .
Even better , he was easily accessible by phone at no additional charge .

The Taj Mahal Palace hotel was among the targets of the attacks A court in Pakistan has charged seven people in connection with last year 's attacks in the Indian city of Mumbai .
They include the alleged mastermind Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi .
Mr Lakhvi and the other suspects were charged under Pakistan 's anti-terrorism act and criminal code .
All seven have pleaded not guilty .
A total of 174 people , including nine gunmen , were killed in the attacks in November .
Nine other suspects have been charged in their absence .
Some of those are thought to be at large in Pakistan - others overseas .
The attacks led India to suspend peace talks with Pakistan .
In July Indian PM Manmohan Singh said talks would not restart until the Mumbai attacks suspects were brought to justice .
The only surviving attacker , Muhammed Ajmal Qasab , is currently facing trial in India .
After initially denying it , Islamabad acknowledged that Mr Qasab is a Pakistani national .
Pakistani security forces here say they are still searching for more suspects , but India has previously also blamed the Pakistani authorities themselves for aiding the Mumbai attackers .
Confession of survivor
These are the first people the Pakistani courts have indicted in connection with the Mumbai attacks .
ANALYSIS Aleem Maqbool
BBC News , Islamabad
The indictments come amid renewed pressure from India for Pakistan to do much more to speed up the legal process , and convict those responsible for planning the attacks .
Security forces here say they 're still searching for more suspects , but India has previously blamed the Pakistani authorities themselves for aiding the Mumbai attackers .
It is almost one year since the incident , and the strain in diplomatic relations is still , very much , being felt .
The charges were read to the seven accused at a special anti-terrorist court set up inside the high security Adiala Jail in Rawalpindi where they are being held .
Those in Rawalpindi's anti-terrorism court were Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi , Shahid Jamil Riaz , Hammad Amin Sadiq , Mazhar Iqbal , Jamil Ahmed , Abdul Wajid and Younus Amjad .
Zaki-ur - Rehman Lakhvi is the head of the banned militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba and , according to the prosecution , the mastermind of the Mumbai attacks .
Hamid Amin Sadiq is alleged to be one of the main handlers of the attackers and the operational head , according to Pakistan 's Interior Minister Rahman Malik .
All have been charged with being involved in conspiring to carry out the Mumbai attacks .
On Wednesday , Manmohan Singh said he welcomed " every step " by Pakistan to rein in the attackers .
" It is the obligation of the government of Pakistan to do everything in their power to bring these perpetrators " to justice , the Indian premier told reporters during his visit to Washington .
He said , however , that he had not been briefed on the charges of the suspects by the Rawalpindi court .
Prosecutors ' determined '
The charges were framed principally on Mr Qasab 's confessional statement .
" The prosecution does not have the evidence to support the charges it has framed , " Ilyas Siddiqui , lawyer for Shahid Jamil , told the BBC after the proceedings .
He said his client was innocent and would contest the charges .
The case was adjourned until 5 December .
Prosecutors say they are determined to bring convictions and secure the maximum sentence for those in the dock .
Following the attacks , Pakistan rounded up a number of suspects - among them the Lashkar - e - Taiba founder Hafiz Saeed , who spent some time in custody before being released due to lack of evidence .
He has denied any involvement .

Here 's a commercial break to be happy about .
Commercial filming on the streets of LA is on the upswing , which hopefully might mean there is a thaw in the nationwide economy as advertisers show more willingness to spend money .
On-location shoots for commercials increased for the third consecutive week , according to FilmL.A.Inc. , which handles film permits .
Commercial filming generated 102 production days last week ( defined as a single crew 's permission to film at a project at a single location during a 24 - hour period ) , nearly double the level from the same time a year ago ( see chart ) .
The recession has taken a toll on commercial production , causing major advertisers like the Big Three automakers to scale back their spending on ads , meaning fewer opportunities for commercial filmmakers .
Notwithstanding the recent spike in filming , on - location filming for commercials is still down 21 % compared to the same time a year ago , according to FilmL.A .
" There 's definitely more momentum , '' said Brian Carmody , executive producer of Smuggler , a production company that is filming a Nikon commercial this week with Ashton Kutcher in West Hollywood and Beverly Hills .
In addition to the Nikon shoot , Smuggler also is shooting commercials in the next week for Audi , AT&T , Kayak.com -- even the U.S. Postal Service .
To be sure , budgets are tighter than ever .
Advertisers who previously might have been willing to spend $ 500,000 on a two - day shoot , may limit their budget to $ 400,000 .
But activity is definitely increasing , Carmody added .
" Advertisers are getting back on track , '' he said .
" They are spending their way out of the recession . "

One of my favorite political insights is that of Étienne de La Boétie who , almost five centuries ago , wrote that all political states , benign or tyrannical , exist on a foundation of popular consent .
Why do my neighbors seem to go along with whatever idiotic dictate comes from these clowns running the political system ?
Even grossly unpopular political edicts remain because legislators cleverly enlist private intermediaries on whom nearly all people depend , the main one being your employer .
We pay extortionate income and payroll tax rates , for instance , only because the employers on whom we depend are surrogate tax collectors ( thank you Milton Friedman et al. ) via the withholding system .
Employers and employees alike submit because not doing so would drive them into legal limbo where the huge benefits of openness , visibility , and trust must be abandoned lest the IRS and other alphabet soup agencies use them as a means to find and crucify those agencies ’ victims .
If Pelosi and Obama succeed in spreading the disease of Medicare / Medicaid to all medical service provision , how many physicians will quit their jobs at Kaiser or Mayo , stop accepting any third - party payment whatsoever , and take their services private ?
Chances are that doing so under this new federal edict would place them outside of the law , meaning their state license to practice medicine would be revoked .
Physicians have to live , too .
They have families , mortgages , and children to feed .
If Pelosi ’s and Obama ’s program results in a vast new tax bite , how many people will resign from their jobs in order to avoid such additional extortion ?
Most people will stay with this system as long as the cost of doing so does not exceed the cost of abandoning it and paying the price for duplicating it in whatever market ( black , gray , or otherwise ) exists .

Political parasites know that people will not choose to abandon this system until they have nothing left to lose by doing so .
Ironically , those parasites ’ competing ambitions and greed create a classic " tragedy of the commons " in their own system , a system that benefits them as a group if they preserve it unchanged , but whose demise they individually guarantee .
Each political parasite ’s power rests on the wealth extracted from citizens and showered on campaign contributors , with a little bread and circuses tossed to the constituents to secure their belief that they benefit from the system .
The problem is that each election cycle requires new political promises of government loot to the jostling factions of campaign contributors , industry segments , the permanent bureaucracy , and constituents , so every year those political parasites each come up with new needs to extract more wealth from members of society at large .
It really does n’t matter if these extractions take the form of higher taxes , higher borrowing , or monetary debasement , all extract additional wealth , lose a ton of it through waste , and reward political - favor - seeking and redistribution instead of wealth generation .
This teaches a subtle but unmistakable lesson that people who produce wealth are chumps , and that real power goes to those who pick producers ’ pockets .
Each parasite maximizes his or her power to control the lives of others by channeling the largest amount of wealth extraction through his or her office to campaign contributors and constituents , but when all the parasites do this together , they strip - mine the capital , the price signals , and the self - improvement motivation on which the entire wealth - generating system rests .

No wonder Western Civilization appears to be intellectually bankrupt .
The state is a coercive monopoly managed by a huge committee ( of parasites ) and populated by those who consume looted wealth and produce bads ( e.g. murder , disorder , war , victimless criminal statutes ) instead of goods .
Inevitably this monopoly grows , consuming and blocking available production until no production is left to deliver on the promises its managers make .
As we approach that point , first a trickle , then a deluge of people recognize this truth ; that they ’re better off paying to duplicate those promises privately because the alternative is an even lower standard of living .
This is the insight that animates home - schooling and other voluntarily - funded educational alternatives , private security contracting , the alternative health fields , and all other duplicate costs of doing properly what our political masters promise to provide and already fail to deliver .
It is the insight that compels prudent people to gut their current standard of living in order to save for their future again , on top of the extortionate taxes paid to doomed old - age welfare programs like Medicare and Social Security , knowing that their colossal political failure looms just over the horizon .

This duplication costs us dearly .
It costs ingenuity , time , effort , all things that in the absence of this burden would contribute to rising standards of living .
This does n’t even take into account how political manipulations artificially raise the cost of everything they touch from higher education to hospital care .
This tragedy of the commons is everywhere we look , yet few will see it until not a shred of value remains visible to steal .
Why is this so ?
It appears so preventable .
All we have to do is collectively set aside the willingness to be bled by these parasites .
This begins by seeing " the government " as an unacceptable customer or employer .
Stop selling to Uncle Sam and its many vassals .
Stop accepting jobs with them .
Stop accepting money from them .
That ’s unlikely to happen .
Paraphrasing MacKay , men go mad in groups but recover their senses only as individuals .
This assures our slide toward a standard of living where even brainwashed believers in political systems will have nothing left to lose by abandoning their faith .
To me , hope lies on the path where individuals accept the cost of duplicating what the state ’s managers promise but ca n’t deliver .
By traveling this path , we may preserve a remnant of civil society while the rest of the herd and its elected parasites bleed themselves dry .

International police , politicians and conservationists warn that the UN 's programme to cut carbon emissions by paying poor countries to preserve their forests is ' open to wide abuse '
A revolutionary UN scheme to cut carbon emissions by paying poorer countries to preserve their forests is a recipe for corruption and will be hijacked by organised crime without safeguards , a Guardian investigation has found .
The UN , the World Bank , the UK and individuals including Prince Charles have strongly backed UN plans to expand the global carbon market to allow countries to trade the carbon stored in forests .
If , as expected , this is agreed at crucial UN climate change talks taking place in Bangkok this week and concluding in Copenhagen in December , up to $ 30 bn a year could be transferred from rich countries to the owners of endangered forests .
But experts on all sides of the debate , from international police to politicians to conservationists , have warned this week that the scheme , called Reducing emissions from deforestation and degradation ( Redd ) , may be impossible to monitor and may already be leading to fraud .
The UN itself accepts there are " high risks " .
Interpol , the world 's leading policing agency , said this week that the chances were very high that criminal gangs would seek to take advantage of Redd schemes , which will be largely be based in corruption - prone African and Asian countries .
" Alarm bells are ringing .
It is simply too big to monitor .
The potential for criminality is vast and has not been taken into account by the people who set it up , " said Peter Younger , Interpol environment crimes specialist and author of a new report for the World Bank on illegal forestry .
" Organised crime syndicates are eyeing the nascent forest carbon market .
I will report to the bank that Redd schemes are open to wide abuse , " he said .
The significance of the felling of forests across great swaths of the world cannot be overstated - it is are responsible for about 20 % of the globe 's entire carbon emissions .
With governments anxious to find new ways to meet increasingly stringent national emission targets , a scheme which promises to benefit poor countries , cut emissions cheaply and not require any new technology is highly attractive .
But most of the countries rich in forests are also home to some of the world 's most corrupt politicians and uncontrolled logging companies , who stand to make billions of dollars if they can get Redd projects approved .
" Fraud could include claiming credits for forests that do not exist or were not protected or by land grabs .
It starts with bribery or intimidation of officials , then there 's threats and violence against those people .
There 's forged documents too , " said Younger .
" Carbon trading transcends borders .
I do not see any input from any law enforcement agency in planning Redd . "
Hans Brattskar , director of Norway 's forest and climate programme , whose country is financially backing the UN Redd programme , said last night : " It will be extremely difficult to make it work .
Law enforcement is vital because the corruption issued are very real .
But we have to put in safeguards and we have to try .
Redd can save up to 20 % of all the world 's emissions .
Without it , I believe it will be impossible to reach the target of stemming climate change and holding global temperatures to 2 C , " the level judged acceptable by the European Union .
Last month , Papua New Guinea , one of the countries pushing hardest for Redd to be accepted in the UN climate talks , suspended their climate change minister after allegations that $ 100 m of fake carbon credits had been handed to communities to persuade them to sign up to forest protection schemes .
Last night the UN admitted that Redd schemes were dangerously open to abuse .
" Where countries are corrupt the potential for Redd corruption is dangerous .
[ In Papua New Guinea ] , people have tried to take advantage of the market in an unacceptable way and carbon cowboys are trying to get the benefits .
We can expect more of this as Redd develops , " said Tiina Vahanen , a senior officer at UN - Redd .
People setting up Redd schemes also fear that they may be discredited by fraudsters aiming to profit from public money .
" The potential for Redd rape and pillage is staggering .
Logging companies may turn into carbon companies .
All they have to do is count , not cut .
It 's like giving a mass murderer money , " said Rob Dodwell , a British conservationist setting up schemes in Kenya and Cameroon .
The UN estimates that 25 % of the world 's forestry emissions , or nearly 5 % of total global carbon emissions , could be saved by 2015 if rich countries invest $ 15 bn to set up Redd schemes .
So far rich countries have put up $ 52 m to establish nine official pilot Redd schemes in Asia , Latin America and Africa .
In addition several hundred private schemes are being set up by bankers , conservation groups , and businesses who plan to offer carbon credits on the voluntary market .
But academics and environment groups with long experience working with the logging industry and indigenous communities said that both government and private schemes are being set up with no guarantees to protect communities who depend on the forests .
" Decisions are being rushed , communities are not consulted or compensated and the lure of money from cutting emissions is overiding everything , " says Rosalind Reeve of forestry watchdog group Global Witness .

Decaffeinated coffee did not provide the same protective benefits .

November 17 , 2009 Ritual [ actually , non- therapeutic ] circumcisions ' illegal '
Exclusive by Stephen Moyes ( stephen.moyes@mirror.co.uk )
DOCTORS performing ritual circumcisions on children face financial ruin , disciplinary action and even jail .
A test - case being brought by a 20 - year - old man circumcised as a baby could , if successful , open the floodgates to claimants .
The unnamed man is to sue a GP still practising in Greater London for physical and psychological damage .
He will argue that circumcision on a child without a medical requirement is mutilation .
His father took him to be circumcised shortly after birth in accordance with his own religious beliefs .
Now the father is mortified at the mental and physical state of his adult son , and is supporting the case .
The father has documents that prove which GP carried out the circumcision .
Performing surgery on a person without adequate consent constitutes battery in law , which can be prosecuted in the civil courts .
But given the lack of consent the surgery also constitutes an assault which can be prosecuted under criminal law - meaning a guilty verdict could lead to a prison term .
The test - case is being supported by a legal firm , leading urologist , child protection agency and circumcision awareness body The National Organisation of Restoring Men ( Norm ) .
[ actually NORM - UK ]
Norm spokesman David Smith said : " Surgery is defined as ' manual or instrumental treatment of injuries or disorders of the body ' .
If no injury or disorder is present , then it can't be surgery .
" Circumcision is a mutilation , which is defined as ' to injure , to make imperfect by the removal of a part ' .
It is shocking that the NHS is responsible for mutilating children .
" We support a man 's right to choose a ritual circumcision for himself , but not for anyone else .
" Adult circumcision is a straight - foward operation which can be undertaken in under 30 minutes under local anaesthetic .
There is no excuse for forcing it on children .
" There is growing belief by many people that the only way to make doctors put their scalpels down is to take legal action .
This is not about money , it 's about protecting the next generation . "
Some doctors privately charge up to s350 [ sic £ 350 ? ] for ' forced circumcision ' of a baby brought to them by their parents .
Legal action can only be brought when the child reaches 18 .
There is then a three - year legal window in which they can take action against the GP .
Circumcision is a surgical procedure that can be performed on men and women and is done for a variety of reasons , some of them cultural or religious .
The General Medical Council does not have a public position on the issue of ritual male circumcision on children who cannot give informed consent .
A spokeswoman said : " We do not have general authority to determine public policy on issues that arise within medical practice - these are matters for society as a whole to determine , through the parliamentary process . "
Katy Swaine , legal director of Child Rights Alliance for England , told the Mirror : " The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has made clear that female genital mutilation violates childrens rights and this position has been reflected in the banning of such procedures under UK legislation .
" The carrying out of circumcision procedures on young male children must also be examined in the context of childrens rights under the treaty - not least given the requirement for non-discrimination in the application of treaty rights .
" A body of medical opinion has for some time supported the view that most male circumcision procedures do not have a medical basis .
As such , given the invasiveness of the procedure and the negative consequences suffered by some individuals , there is a strong argument that it should not be carried out without informed consent from the individual who is to undergo the procedure .
" It is only a matter of time before these issues are raised in the courts by those who have undergone the procedure as children and have suffered negative consequences .
In the meantime it behoves the NHS , Department of Health , professional medical bodies and communities to examine this issue seriously , acknowledging and addressing its implications for childrens rights .
"
The individual bringing the test - case is collating evidence and financial and legal support and will launch it next year .
A solicitor close to the case said : " The action being brought against the doctor is more likely to lead to financial damage rather than prosecution , but it is complicated and nothing can be ruled out .
" Doctors performing ' forced circumcision ' on a small minority of children are acting in defiance of general medical council and are effectively medical rebels .
" Most urologists will only perform a circumcision on someone who needs it , just like any form of amputation .
" This is not a straightforward case .
Parents have the right to give consent but only when in the best interests of a child .
I do n't think any act involving cutting off half of a child 's penis is in their best interests . "
The litigant gave up , reportedly because he could not afford the case ; it would have cost £ 10,000 [ $ US 15,600 ] just to do the research and the lawyer held out little hope of success .
A urologist also discouraged him , pointing out that " anything goes with circumcision " , so it 's hard to prove negligence or botching .
PEOPLE get stuck on the word stout .
It confuses , the way it connotes size and fleshiness .
And the color , too  inky , impenetrable black  suggests mass and power .
As a result , many people think stout is a formidable blockbuster of an ale , heavy and alcoholic , just the way they assume darker roasts of coffee have more caffeine than lighter roasts .
Nothing could be further from the truth .
Stout in its classic form is one of the lighter ales , paradoxically full - bodied yet delicate .
For years , my go - to midday brew was draft Guinness Stout , a once - rare beer that has become easier and easier to find in New York in the years since the city ’s beer consciousness was raised .
Aside from the enticing flavors of roasted barley and coffee , a properly pulled pint is low in alcohol , around 4 percent , fractionally less even than Bud Light .
It ’s probably wishful thinking , but I like to think a midday stout aids the digestion .
I know it improves the imagination .
Where 20 years ago I might have scoured the city looking for the few places that served draft Guinness ( the canned and bottled versions never achieve the same lightness of texture ) , nowadays fine stout is everywhere , courtesy of the craft beer revolution .
As they have with so many other genres of ale , American brewers have seized on the myriad styles of stout and made them their own .
At a shop with a good selection of beers , one might easily see Irish stout , English stout , oatmeal stout , extra stout , milk stout , cream stout , chocolate stout , Russian imperial stout , even blueberry or vanilla stout .
These styles may vary greatly in their flavors , and they may range from dry to quite sweet .
Some require an added element , like lactose for the milk and cream stouts , or oatmeal for the oatmeal stouts .
Other flavors like coffee or chocolate may be achieved by roasting barley , though occasionally coffee or chocolate may actually be added .
Yet they all retain the combination of full - body richness , lightness of texture and relatively low alcohol that is characteristic of stout .
All , that is , except Russian imperial stout , the anti-stout , embodying so much that stout is not .
Imperial stout was brewed especially , the story goes , to appeal to Russian royalty .
It is high in alcohol , massive , powerful and sometimes powerfully sweet .
The manager of a cattle station in the Douglas Daly region south - west of Darwin says he feels devastated and horrified to have shot a pygmy hippopotamus on Saturday night .
The man , who prefers to go by his first name only - Nico , says he shot the hippopotamus while conducting routine feral animal control on the cattle station .
Pygmy hippos are an African rainforest species , classified as being vulnerable , which is just one step away from an endangered classification .
Nico says he would never have deliberately shot the hippo , which is thought to have escaped from millionaire property developer Warren Anderson 's former zoo on Tipperary Station .
" [ I was ] driving across the paddock and saw it from the distance in the spotlight and thought it was a pig , " he said .
" You do n't expect to see a hippo out here in the paddock and so we hunted after it and let a shot off out of the rifle and it dropped .
[ I ] had a look at it and thought what the hell is that ?
" We knew it was n't a pig , which is what we thought it was , that is what it looked like .
It ran like one , it moved like one , it looked like a pig . "
Nico says he feels sick in the stomach after accidentally slaughtering the rare species .
" It is just a smaller version of a hippo that has got a head like a hippo and it just looks like a pig , " he said .
" I am a bit disgusted , sick to my stomach .
It is on the way to get taxidermied , to get it all put together so people can see it .
" It is not really a trophy or something you would brag about .
It makes you feel sick . "
The hype is that the " recession is over . "
Has anyone touting this line actually walked around the real world ?
The next 7 million jobs to be lost are already in the pipeline .
The divergence between the reality easily observed in the real world and the heavily touted hype that " the recession is over because GDP rose 3.5 % " is growing .
It 's obvious that another 7 million jobs which are currently hanging by threads will be slashed in the next year or two .
According to the latest Employment Situation Summary ( Bureau of Labor Statistics ) dated November 7 , 2009 :
Total nonfarm payroll employment declined by 190,000 in October .
In the most recent 3 months , job losses have averaged 188,000 per month , compared with losses averaging 357,000 during the prior 3 months .
In contrast , losses averaged 645,000 per month from November 2008 to April 2009 .
Since December 2007 , payroll employment has fallen by 7.3 million .
Civilian labor force : 154 million
Employment : 138.3 million
Unemployment : 15.7 million
Sept -Oct. change in employment : - 589,000
in unemployment : 558,000
Not in labor force : 82,575,000
It is staggering that 7 million jobs lost out of 145 million ( the total prior to the financial meltdown ) has created a 10.2 % unemployment rate .
The numbers here do n't add up - - " only " 190,000 jobs were lost in October , but then employment fell by 589,000 - - huh ?-- but the point missing is how many jobs are hanging by a thread .
I recently traveled to Los Angeles to be interviewed by my polymath friend and media maven Richard Metzger , creator of the Dangerous Minds website which has rocketed to 50,000 page views a day since he launched it a few months ago .
( The topic was of course Survival + ; look for the interview in about a week on Dangerous Minds . )
( Richard also manages the L.A . Time 's hot blog Brand X which will have you humming Randy Neuman 's I Love L.A. in short order . )
Has anyone noticed that airports are commercial dead - zones peopled by zombie clerks suffering from terminal boredom ?
One desperate young man had taken the unenviable job of hawking Chase credit cards via a weak pitch for a free ticket on Southwest Air ( retail value $ 59 ) .
Since I like to arrive early for flights ( perhaps scar - tissue remaining from being on TSA 's " watch list " for months on end , and almost missing flights as a result --" papers , please ! " )
I was able to observe hundreds of travelers stream by the young man 's kiosk while he gamely voiced the pitch .
Not one person even paused , much less stopped .
Translation : Up yours , Chase credit cards .
How many of these dead - zone airport retail kiosks will go dark next year ?
The See's Candy kiosk : bored clerk rearranging pricey boxes of candy , no customers .
Ditto the sunglasses kiosk , and every retail outlet except Starbucks , which was moving plain coffee and the pizza / beer establishment which did a brisk business around 7 - 8 p.m. with the " heading home Sunday evening " crowd .
( Richard and I had picked up some excellent Chicken Tikka Masala from a small indian market on Pico Blvd. , so I was n't tempted . )
I rented a brand - new 4 - door Ford Focus - - a nice car with plenty of zip - - for $ 24 total , including all the ripoff airport and State of California taxes , with unlimited miles .
$ 24 for all day , including all the new junk fees added to car rentals ?
Deal !
The red Mustang sat in the rental lot , a rather sad icon , while the cheapest compacts were rented and driven off the lot .
What does that say ?
Arriving early at the studio ( natch ) , I had time to wander down one of the premiere open - air retail malls in the nation , the Promenade in Santa Monica ( town of my birth , heh , though I never lived there ) .
Other than one or two Asian tourists , no one carried a shopping bag of any size or type .
This was noon on Sunday , a busy shopping day , and nobody was buying anything .
Barney 's Beanery was doing a good business but most other dining establishments were crypts .
Sauntering down blocks of America 's standard - issue mall outlets -- J. Crew , Apple , Pottery Barn , etc. etc. -- the stores were empty though the sidewalks were busy .
Victoria 's Secret was promoting 7 panties for $ 21 - - how much profit can VS rake in selling 7 panties for $ 21 ?-- and the store was empty .
Even the Apple store was a morgue .
Bored waiters were leaning on sidewalk cafe railings , and a few employees were sitting outside talking with their friends - - tip - off -- no drinks , no food , the table was bare .
OK , here 's the money shot .
Recall for a split second I am a writer ( for better or worse ) and so my " job " is to observe people closely ( 22 years free - lancing , man , am I dumb to keep doing this ! ) .
So a tres-chic young Caucasian woman with two adorable kids around 7 to 9 years of age pauses a few yards from me .
The woman has the casually tony attire and slim figure of someone who either is a well - educated professional pulling down major dollars or someone whose spouse is pulling down major dollars in some yuppie gig ( or both spouses are doing so ) .
The yuppie Mom pulls her wallet out of her upscale little purse as the two kids gather round and I am thinking , " She 's going to give each kid a Jackson ( $ 20 ) or at least a fiver just to blow on whatever strikes their fancy . "
This is , after all , Santa Monica on a Sunday , and this is a yuppie Mom with the bucks to pay for high - end casual attire , hair coloring , personal trainer , gym membership , etc .
After digging around a bit , she extracts two pennies which she gives to her kids to toss into the water feature / fountain nearby .
I think this rather neatly summarizes the entire U.S. consumer and the future of the economy .
Does n't anyone follow the threads of what is easily observable anywhere in America ?
Consider for a moment one of the few businesses licensed to print money -- towing companies with city contracts .
What are the odds that these towing outfits are towing cars which no one ever claims ?
Heck , with tickets , towing and storage fees , the cost of reclaiming your vehicle can run into the hundreds of dollars in a mere day or two .
That is more than many vehicles are worth .
So what 's the net result ?
the towing companies ' lots will soon be filling with junkers and their revenues will be falling as down - and - out citizens abandon their vehicles because they do n't have the money to get them un-impounded .
Net -net , when the towing company 's revenues fall then somebody 's hours or job gets cut .
About once a month I take my Mom out to dinner in San Francisco , " the most European city in America " and a favorite city for those with disposable income .
The city contains approximately three restaurants per resident ( slight exaggeration ) with a Michelin one - star establishment ( i.e. excellent , superb , etc. ) about every block in the better neighborhoods .
Yes , it is a splurge , but it 's my Mom and it's our " quality time . "
So we chat with the waiters and waitresses , and on opera nights and the like , business is so good it seems impossible the word " recession " is even being bandied about .
But when it 's slow , it 's dead .
It seems almost random , which nights are busy and which are slow , but the net result is far from random .
A couple of places that we occasionally frequented a mere year ago are now dark .
A friend of ours has been trying to sell an investment house in a highly desirable zip code in a San Francisco Bay Area suburb .
Built perhaps a decade ago , the house would have fetched $ 800,000 in a heartbeat in 2006 , and our friend rejected an offer of $ 550,000 a year ago as absurdly low .
This is after he spent a lot of money having the home repainted in and out , new cabinet doors installed , new carpeting , etc .
That was the only offer the property has received in over a year .
Needless to say , maintaining the mortgage is killing him financially .
How many hundreds of thousands of families are in the same situation ?
The Honolulu Symphony , which I enjoyed occasionally when I lived on Oahu , recently declared bankruptcy .
How many other non-profit arts , theater and community groups are hanging by a thread ?
Hundreds , if not thousands .
Put together the anecdotal evidence and the next 7 million jobs to be lost are already in the pipeline .
I could go on and on about the small businesses whose owners are preparing to close " if things do n't pick up a big way soon " and all the other signs that a new wave of massive job losses is rising .
But you know that already if you 've walked around with your eyes open .
I ’ve noticed a theme I seem to keep harping on in my latest posts where I keep whining ( let ’s call it what it is ) about various companies or entities .
I just want to clear something up right now that I first believe in Personal Responsibility .
In my own life my stupid financial mistakes and poor purchasing chooses are clearly my own .
An outside entity or corporation did not force me to trade in a relatively new car for a brand new truck .
The mortgage companies did not hold one of my family members hostage to instigate the purchase of my first home with zero money down .
They surely made it easy for me to make those poor decisions by loaning me the money , but the responsibility is mine alone .
I do n’t want to sound preachy but an important first step in getting your personal financial life in order is understanding that it ’s yours to manage .
It ’s also your mess to clean up .
Some Internal Responsibility Conversations
These may be some thoughts rumbling around in your own grey matter , I certainly have had many of these conversations with myself .
My Employer just does n’t pay me enough so I ca n’t get ahead .
No one ’s holding a gun to your head making you work there .
You can find another job , or even take on another .
Your income is one of your best tools for building wealth , so if you are unhappy with your current job , look elsewhere .
Even in today ’s strained economy people are hiring .
If I just win the Lottery , I ’d be set .
If you were just hit by lighting you would n’t care anymore , and your odds are better .
Read some books , take a class , start an online business .
Figure out how to start your own lottery with only one ticket ever printed , you ’ll win every time .
Bob has a Lexus , how can he afford that we do the same thing ?
Odds are Bob ca n’t afford it .
Do yourself a favor and check out “ The Millionaire Next Door ” from your local library .
Most Millionaires drive Ford ’s and Toyota’s .
Who would you rather be ?
Aspirational or a Millionaire ?
This one ’s hard for me I admit it .
I love cars and gadgets , and when I see someone with something new and shiny I become envious , and always call to question how they can have that but I can’t .
This book as well as “ Start Acting Rich ” both by Thomas Stanley have helped me a lot to be more realistic about some of these areas in my life .
Again I do n’t deserve these things , they are just stuff .
I want them .
Personally Own Your Finances
This is an important enough concept that I want to detail it a little more .
By taking responsibility for yourself and your finances , you are putting yourself in the drivers seat .
No one is ever going to care the same about your own fiscal life as much as you and that ’s the way it should be .
Sure you can hire some outside help to give you advice , but that needs to be tempered with your own knowledge and experiences .
So when the financial planner recommends that you put your emergency fund in a Short Term Bond use some of your base knowledge that you ’ve hopefully learned here and through your own pursuit of knowledge you ’ll be able to ask some hard questions .
Admit Your Mistakes and Move On
We ’ve all made mistakes .
I ’ve been making them most of my life , reviewing them and learning from them will keep you from repeating the mistake .
James Joyce said “ A man ’s errors are his portals of discovery . ” 
Dwelling on your mistakes will quickly take the wind out of your sails .
Use that mistake as a springboard for finding your next mistake and consequently your next discovery .
This is also true of excuses .
Rather than admitting a mistake we often find somewhere else to place the blame .
That ’s not going to help your financial situation either .
My 6th grade teacher Mr. Kerns used to say “ Excuses are the refuge of cowards . ”
And as far as maxim ’s go that has stuck with me all of my life and it will always ring true .
Take to Arms
Dave Ramsey often quotes Charlie Tremendous Jones who said “ Five years from now you will be pretty much the same as you are today except for two things : the books you read and the people you get close to . ”
Your going to have to go out there and find those people yourself but here ’s a great list of books to help you in the right direction .

Review : Dragon Age : Origins
by Michael Camacho [ Sunday , 15th of November 2009 - 04:00 PM ]
Dragon Age : Origins is a dark fantasy game set in a land , known as Ferelden , where the Blight is at hand , and Darkspawn are quickly taking over .
You begin the game as your choice of race and class , and set on your own origin quest .
Each quest is very different , yet will all yield the same results afterwards .
The only differences will be how characters interact with you later in game .
You come to join the Grey Wardens , a group created to eliminate the Darkspawn , and begin your quest to kill the Archdemon and save the lands from evil .
You work to unite the lands to help end the Blight , even as some of its own try to drive it apart for their own quest for power .
Dragon
Age has taken what Bioware is best known for and significantly improved on it .
The decision making in Dragon Age is second to none and will greatly affect your story and sometimes your outcome of the game .
Decisions can affect whether someone lives or dies , including yourself .
They also affect who is there to help you at the end of the game during the final battle .
You can choose to be as nice or as cruel as you want to be , and yet there are times it forces you to make that critical decision where there is no right or wrong .
Another thing Dragon
Age does well is engaging you into the characters themselves .
You actually will come to like , love , hate or even downright despise some of the people in game .
This is even more apparent when dealing with your party members , in which you can pursue romances with or order them to flat out leave your party .
Decisions you make in game will also cause party members to approve or disapprove .
Be careful though , as some decisions will cause them to turn against you and fight .
You can also give gifts to help increase their approval of you .
The voice acting in Dragon Age is outstanding , and rarely does any character 's voice sound out of place .
And sometimes the dialogue between characters while travelling are some of the best moments in the game .
You are guaranteed to laugh at some of their numerous interactions .
I especially enjoyed Morrigan 's and Alistair 's many conversations .
Unfortunately your character has no real dialogue and only speaks at random times during battles or interacting with objects .
The soundtrack composing Dragon
Age is also another great addition to the game and helps to amplify many of the scenes and moods of the story .
It helps you feel the intensity or drama of situations almost to perfection .
The graphics of the game do seem dated often , and while it can show at times , it is never a hindrance to the game .
Some areas are noticeably more bland , especially in the early stages of the game .
But the characters and animations all look very good for the most part .
The character creation is well made , and I found it easy to forge a character to my liking .
It allows you quite an array of options to help create the character to your liking , so you could easily spend a good amount of time creating one .
I do wish it had a few more options , but this was more out of myself being picky and not a fault of Dragon Age .
Gameplay within Dragon
Age is very old school in design .
You select an enemy and your character will begin to attack them .
You can choose other spells or types of attacks to use , but for the most part your character will just hack away until the enemy is dead if you so choose to .
The rest of your party works on a tactics system that you can leave as default or set up to how you want them to react in battle .
The tactics system is pretty deep with the many options you can choose for each member to do in certain situations .
For the most part this all works well , but some may wish for a more action oriented hack and slash model of gameplay .
I did find one major problem with the lack of being able to revive a fallen party member in battle unless you used a spell for it .
I found myself extremely frustrated that once my healer (s ) go down , I am on my own at this point struggling to micro-manage my party 's health .
Constantly switching between characters to make sure they heal becomes more of a chore , than strategy .
Overall , Dragon
Age is another excellent role - playing game from Bioware , and fans of the developer or dark fantasy will find much to enjoy .
With a deep , rich story that pulls you in by forcing you to make those tough and many times , critical decisions , the player will find themselves consumed in the world .
Due to the effort put forth on story - telling , voice acting and character development , it is easy to forgive the graphical shortcomings .
Be prepared to spend hours upon hours with this game if you want to squeeze every drop out of the lore .
There are multiple endings , romances and plenty of side quests to keep you coming back for more and will hold you over until the inevitable sequel .
This review was based on the Xbox 360 version and was purchased as the Collector 's Edition .
The game was beaten in roughly 40 hours and my play through was as a Female Dalish Elf Rogue .

Obama administration climate czar Carol Browner on Wednesday rejected claims that e-mails stolen from a British university show climate scientists trumped up global warming numbers , saying she considers the science settled .
“ I ’m sticking with the 2,500 scientists .
These people have been studying this issue for a very long time and agree this problem is real , ” said Ms. Browner , who President Obama has tapped as his chief of policy on global warming .
The e-mails were hacked from the Climate Research Unit at the University of East Anglia and have come to light over the last week .
They appear to show scientists saying they ’ve smoothed over data that does n’t back up their claims of warming , and pondering how to freeze out scientists who disagree with them .
Release of the e-mails has fueled skeptics ahead of next month ’s major global warming meeting in Copenhagen , which is supposed to set the framework for a new global treaty to restrict greenhouse gas emissions .
The White House said Wednesday that Mr. Obama will personally travel to Copenhagen to commit the U.S. to greenhouse gas reductions .
The e-mails remain a point of debate , with skeptics pointing to several data sets that show the last few years have actually seen a cooling effect .
Sen . James Inhofe , Oklahoma Republican , has called for an investigation into the e-mails , and says they confirm his long - held suspicion that climate claims are not supported by the actual data .
Ms. Browner said the only people who still doubt global warming is happening and that humans are to blame are “ a very small group of people who continue to say this is n’t a real problem , that we do n’t need to do anything . ”
She also said the e-mails are only trickling out , and that the entire set has n’t been released .
Ms. Browner initially shrugged when asked about the e-mails , saying she did n’t have a reaction .
But when a reporter followed up , she said she will stick with the consensus of the 2,500 climate scientists on the International Panel on Climate Change who concluded global warming is happening and is most likely being pushed by human actions .

A new study suggests that in utero exposure to certain plastics may change behaviour in boys , making them less masculine .
Researchers at the University of Rochester examined the play habits of children aged 4 to 7 years old .
The mothers of 145 youngsters had previously volunteered to be tested during pregnancy .
Those boys born to women with higher levels of exposure to phthalates were less likely to play with toys like guns or trucks , or exhibit play behaviour typical of their gender , such as roughhousing or participating in sports .
" ( The results ) say to me that these phthalates have the ability to alter brain development in utero , " said Dr. Shanna Swan , the lead researcher .
The affected boys did not display feminine qualities , such as increased play with dolls .
Instead , they acted in ways less typically masculine than peers whose mothers were not exposed to high levels of phthalates during pregnancy .
" They 're playing in more gender neutral ways – the sports were quite neutral , for instance , " said Swan .
" What it does suggest is that ( the effects ) could manifest in other ways – in verbal ability , in spatial ability and so on , which are also sexually dimorphic ( i.e. different depending on gender ) . "
Phthalates are so - called plasticizers – a chemical compound added to commercial plastic to make it more pliable or translucent .
The phthalates examined in Swan 's study – DEHP and DEB – can be found in commonly used flooring products , PVC shower curtains , and a variety of textiles and dyes found in many homes .
Phthalate use in toys has been banned in the EU for several years , and restricted in the U.S .
Swan believes that the main source of phthalate exposure for the women in her study was through food – either through the packaging of processed foods or storing and heating of food in plastic containers .
She suggests that if women are concerned about these findings , they may want to change their eating habits during pregnancy .
" A pretty easy thing to do would be to switch to using glass ( containers ) for storage and heating , " Swan said .
Previous testing by Swan and her team suggests that the effect on men is physical as well as behavioural .
Boys born to women with high phthalate levels had smaller penises , for instance , a result also borne out by animal studies .
There were no discernible effects on girls in the study .
The testing instrument was a questionnaire called the Pre-School Activities Inventory , a tool used to determine typical behaviour in young children .

Ottawa to ban bottles with bisphenol A
Without insurance , John has been unable to get surgery or even help managing the pain .
When he collapses or suffers particularly excruciating headaches , Esther rushes him to the emergency room of one hospital or another , but an E.R. ca n’t do much for him .
One hospital has told them not to come back unless he gets insurance , they say .
Esther used up her family leave time to look after her new husband .
“ Then I went back to work , and he fell several times , ” she said .
“ I told my boss that I had to quit .
Taking care of John was more important than building someone else ’s house . ”
That meant that the couple had no income  and no insurance for anyone in the family , including the children .
Neighbors have helped , and a community program has paid the rent so that they are not homeless .
But bills are piling up , and John and Esther do n’t know how they will cope .
The doctors warn that pressure from the growth could lead a major blood vessel nearby to burst , killing him .
“ They tell me I ’m a time bomb , ” John said .
With a touch of bitterness , he adds , “ It sort of feels as if they ’re playing for time to see if it bursts , to save them from doing anything . ”
I ’m not a physician , and I certainly can’t speak to the medical issues here .
But I have examined John ’s medical records , and they appear to confirm his story .
John says the principal obstacle to treatment appears to be simply his lack of insurance .
In August , he qualified for an Oregon Medicaid program , but he has n’t been able to find a doctor who will accept him as a patient for surgery , apparently because the reimbursements are so low .
Doctors tell him that his condition is operable  but that they ca n’t accept him without conventional insurance .
He is increasingly frustrated as he watches his family crushed by the burden of his illness .
WASHINGTON --
A new report from the National Research Council examines and , when possible , estimates " hidden " costs of energy production and use -- such as the damage air pollution imposes on human health -- that are not reflected in market prices of coal , oil , other energy sources , or the electricity and gasoline produced from them .
The report estimates dollar values for several major components of these costs .
The damages the committee was able to quantify were an estimated $ 120 billion in the U.S. in 2005 , a number that reflects primarily health damages from air pollution associated with electricity generation and motor vehicle transportation .
The figure does not include damages from climate change , harm to ecosystems , effects of some air pollutants such as mercury , and risks to national security , which the report examines but does not monetize .
Requested by Congress , the report assesses what economists call external effects caused by various energy sources over their entire life cycle -- for example , not only the pollution generated when gasoline is used to run a car but also the pollution created by extracting and refining oil and transporting fuel to gas stations .
Because these effects are not reflected in energy prices , government , businesses and consumers may not realize the full impact of their choices .
When such market failures occur , a case can be made for government interventions -- such as regulations , taxes or tradable permits -- to address these external costs , the report says .
The committee that wrote the report focused on monetizing the damage of major air pollutants -- sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , ozone , and particulate matter - on human health , grain crops and timber yields , buildings , and recreation .
When possible , it estimated both what the damages were in 2005 ( the latest year for which data were available ) and what they are likely to be in 2030 , assuming current policies continue and new policies already slated for implementation are put in place .
The committee also separately derived a range of values for damages from climate change ; the wide range of possibilities for these damages made it impossible to develop precise estimates of cost .
However , all model results available to the committee indicate that climate - related damages caused by each ton of CO2 emissions will be far worse in 2030 than now ; even if the total amount of annual emissions remains steady , the damages caused by each ton would increase 50 percent to 80 percent .
DAMAGES FROM ELECTRICITY GENERATION
Coal accounts for about half the electricity produced in the U.S.
In 2005 the total annual external damages from sulfur dioxide , nitrogen oxides , and particulate matter created by burning coal at 406 coal - fired power plants , which produce 95 percent of the nation 's coal - generated electricity , were about $ 62 billion ; these nonclimate damages average about 3.2 cents for every kilowatt - hour ( kwh ) of energy produced .
A relatively small number of plants -- 10 percent of the total number -- accounted for 43 percent of the damages .
By 2030 , nonclimate damages are estimated to fall to 1.7 cents per kwh .
Coal - fired power plants are the single largest source of greenhouse gases in the U.S. , emitting on average about a ton of CO2 per megawatt - hour of electricity produced , the report says .
Climate - related monetary damages range from 0.1 cents to 10 cents per kilowatt - hour , based on previous modeling studies .
Burning natural gas generated far less damage than coal , both overall and per kilowatt - hour of electricity generated .
A sample of 498 natural gas fueled plants , which accounted for 71 percent of gas - generated electricity , produced $ 740 million in total nonclimate damages in 2005 , an average of 0.16 cents per kwh .
As with coal , there was a vast difference among plants ; half the plants account for only 4 percent of the total nonclimate damages from air pollution , while 10 percent produce 65 percent of the damages .
By 2030 , nonclimate damages are estimated to fall to 0.11 cents per kwh .
Estimated climate damages from natural gas were half that of coal , ranging from 0.05 cents to 5 cents per kilowatt - hour .
The life - cycle damages of wind power , which produces just over 1 percent of U.S. electricity but has large growth potential , are small compared with those from coal and natural gas .
So are the damages associated with normal operation of the nation 's 104 nuclear reactors , which provide almost 20 percent of the country 's electricity .
But the life cycle of nuclear power does pose some risks ; if uranium mining activities contaminate ground or surface water , for example , people could potentially be exposed to radon or other radionuclides ; this risk is borne mostly by other nations , the report says , because the U.S. mines only 5 percent of the world 's uranium .
The potential risks from a proposed long - term facility for storing high - level radioactive waste need further evaluation before they can be quantified .
Life - cycle CO2 emissions from nuclear , wind , biomass , and solar power appear to be negligible when compared with fossil fuels .
DAMAGES FROM HEATING
The production of heat for buildings or industrial processes accounts for about 30 percent of American energy demand .
Most of this heat energy comes from natural gas or , to a lesser extent , the use of electricity ; the total damages from burning natural gas for heat were about $ 1.4 billion in 2005 .
The median damages in residential and commercial buildings were about 11 cents per thousand cubic feet , and the proportional harm did not vary much across regions .
Damages from heat in 2030 are likely to be about the same , assuming the effects of additional sources to meet demand are offset by lower - emitting sources .
DAMAGES FROM MOTOR VEHICLES AND FUELS
Transportation , which today relies almost exclusively on oil , accounts for nearly 30 percent of U.S. energy demand .
In 2005 motor vehicles produced $ 56 billion in health and other nonclimate - related damages , says the report .
The committee evaluated damages for a variety of types of vehicles and fuels over their full life cycles , from extracting and transporting the fuel to manufacturing and operating the vehicle .
In most cases , operating the vehicle accounted for less than one - third of the quantifiable nonclimate damages , the report found .
Damages per vehicle mile traveled were remarkably similar among various combinations of fuels and technologies -- the range was 1.2 cents to about 1.7 cents per mile traveled -- and it is important to be cautious in interpreting small differences , the report says .
Nonclimate - related damages for corn grain ethanol were similar to or slightly worse than gasoline , because of the energy needed to produce the corn and convert it to fuel .
In contrast , ethanol made from herbaceous plants or corn stover -- which are not yet commercially available -- had lower damages than most other options .
Electric vehicles and grid- dependent ( plug - in ) hybrid vehicles showed somewhat higher nonclimate damages than many other technologies for both 2005 and 2030 .
Operating these vehicles produces few or no emissions , but producing the electricity to power them currently relies heavily on fossil fuels ; also , energy used in creating the battery and electric motor adds up to 20 percent to the manufacturing part of life - cycle damages .
Most vehicle and fuel combinations had similar levels of greenhouse gas emissions in 2005 .
There are not substantial changes estimated for those emissions in 2030 ; while population and income growth are expected to drive up the damages caused by each ton of emissions , implementation of new fuel efficiency standards of 35.5 miles per gallon will lower emissions and damages for every vehicle mile traveled .
Achieving significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 will likely also require breakthrough technologies , such as cost - effective carbon capture and storage or conversion of advanced biofuels , the report says .
Both for 2005 and 2030 , vehicles using gasoline made from oil extracted from tar sands and those using diesel derived from the Fischer - Tropsch process -- which converts coal , methane , or biomass to liquid fuel -- had the highest life - cycle greenhouse gas emissions .
Vehicles using ethanol made from corn stover or herbaceous feedstock such as switchgrass had some of the lowest greenhouse gas emissions , as did those powered by compressed natural gas .
Fully implementing federal rules on diesel fuel emissions , which require vehicles beginning in the model year 2007 to use low - sulfur diesel , is expected to substantially decrease nonclimate damages from diesel by 2030 -- an indication of how regulatory actions can significantly affect energy - related damages , the committee said .
Major initiatives to further lower other emissions , improve energy efficiency , or shift to a cleaner mix of energy sources could reduce other damages as well , such as substantially lowering the damages attributable to electric vehicles .

4 Resigned Aug. 2 , 2009 , to accept appointment as administrator of the U.S. Energy Information Administration
Over 400 employees under the banner of Employees Joint Action Committee and State Road Transport Corporation Employees Union assembled and held demonstrations here .
Shouting anti-government slogans , they later tried to march toward the Secretariat where Section 144 CrPC has already been imposed by the district administration .
Police personnel restricted their march following which a scuffle ensued , but the protestors were dispersed .
The Darbar move offices reopened here this morning with a customary press conference addressed by Chief Minister Omar Abdullah at the Civil Secretariat .
Britain's cops have the largest DNA database in the world , and it 's full of innocent people who were arrested but not charged , or charged but not convicted ( the EU 's Court of Human Rights have ordered this practice to stop , but the cops refuse to comply with the law — their latest dodge is to keep innocents ' DNA for six years ) .
Now an inquiry that begins today claims that police are " routinely arresting people " that they know they can't convict of any crime , simply to get their DNA into the database .
The highly critical report from the government 's advisory body on the development of human genetics is published as the number of innocent people on the database is disclosed to be far higher than previously thought â€ ' nearing 1 million .
The commission says the policy of routinely adding the DNA profiles of all those arrested has led to a highly disproportionate impact on different ethnic groups and the stigmatisation of young black men , with the danger of their being seen as " an ' alien wedge ' of criminality " …
The chairman of the commission , Prof Jonathan Montgomery , said : " It 's now become pretty routine to take DNA samples on arrest .
So large numbers of people on the DNA database will be there not because they have been convicted , but because they 've been arrested . "
He said the commission had received evidence from a former police superintendent that it was now the norm to arrest offenders for everything possible .
" It is apparently understood by serving police officers that one of the reasons , if not the reason , for the change in practice is so that the DNA of the offender can be obtained , " said Montgomery , adding that it would be a matter of very great concern if this was now a widespread practice .
The big song contest
Nowadays life without cover songs is hard to imagine .
Permanently we run into these remakes while we listen to the radio and sometimes we even do n't know that this song has existed for a long time and is now only covered in a rough - and - ready way .
Mostly the original versions are much better , but they were not played in the radio any more .
However , sometimes an artist makes it not only to copy the original song , but also improves it drastically .
Only in this case the remake should have a right to exist .
On this website you can vote , if a cover band has managed this or if they have just produced a cheap plagiarism .
In addition you can also leave a comment for each song .
If you like to hold a vote on a special song you can't find here , you can add your personal song contest here .
And now enjoy voting !

Following stern criticism from two games writers yesterday , Infinity Ward 's Robert Bowling pulled back a viral video for Modern Warfare 2 , couched as a PSA from a group called " Fight Against Grenade Spam " that called the tactic " for pussies . "
Advertisement
Destructoid 's Samit Sarkar , following the event unfold over Twitter , reports that Infinity Ward took fire publicly from Philip Kollar of Game Informer and freelancer Mitchell Dyer over the video 's language , tone and especially , the way the fake interest group 's name formed the acronym " F.A.G.S . "
In the video , Philadelphia Phillies pitcher - and Modern Warfare fan - Cole Hamels ( pictured , at right ) , pretends to deliver the public interest message that randomly throwing grenades around in multiplayer is " for pussies , " and throws in an " oh f—k , " at the end when he himself is blown up .
" Fight Against Grenade Spam " appeared as a title card introducing Hamels .
Advertisement
In the end , Bowling said he could " appreciate the concerns " although he felt " the core gag is great , " and ultimately , the video was taken down .
Kollar made his feelings known in a long message , broken up into five tweets , to a reader who said he was " overreacting " to the video :
Overreacting how ?
I 'm not organizing a mass boycott or even saying I wo n't buy the game .
I 'm just pointing out that their decision to become complicit in one of their communities most oppressive slurs in a not - terribly - fun ad campaign is stupid and makes me reconsider my purchase more than any other controversy surrounding the game thus far .
But it 's an official video released by them that for all intents and purposes says , " Yeah , we think it 's hillarious to use the word FAGS as well !
LOLOLOLOL ! " Just look at all the YouTube comments saying how totally awesome IW is for that bit .
Whether it was their intent or not , that stupid joke condones a part of their community they should be shunning .

Bowling noticed the exchange and replied :
I think it was more of a social commentary joke of that stereotype than it was a fist - bump of acceptance to it .

Dyer replied to that , copying the message to Kollar , with :
The problem is that it was so poorly handled / executed that it looks derogatory .
It seems to enforce the asshole-ry .
Advertisement
Finally , Bowling relented in the following tweet :
I agree .
I think the core gag is great , the end is a bit too far from the intent of the joke & can appreciate the concerns .
Pulled .

And now the withering , scorching comments about political correctness and who has the right to take offense and to what shall begin again , thanks to a video that needlessly took one step over the line .
Just a slight tweaking of the PSA group 's title , as one Kotaku reader pointed out , to " Fight Relentlessly Against Grenade Spam , " would have preserved the spirit of this piece and skirted all the outrage , even with the " for pussies " line .
Many gamers , judged largely on what I 've seen in commenting threads and in behavior online , have n't expressed a lot of sophistication on this subject or a great willingness to have a mature discussion about it .
It tends to break down to " I 'm not offended so , no one else can be either , " and accuse anyone who is of politically motivated dishonesty .
By no means do I accuse Infinity Ward or Bowling of homophobia or having that same small - minded attitude .
But the video was pointlessly provocative , and made not only the studio , but also some of their biggest fans , by their reactions to it , look foolish and reprehensible to the general public .
Bowling made the right call in removing it .

The Democrats want to change the name of the PATRIOT Act to the JUSTICE Act .
That ’s the easy part – exchanging one Orwellian branding for another – much like earlier this year , when the new Obama administration insisted the government was n’t waging a Global War on Terrorism , but an " Overseas Contingency Operation . "
Save for the name , there has n’t been one major transformation in the way the federal government is executing the Long War ( the recent helicopter gunship execution of a suspected al - Qaeda terrorist in Somalia in September was completely in step with the old GWOT ) .
And seeing how key Democrats are slowly caving on some of the most promising reforms to the PATRIOT
Act in three years , it ’s becoming clear the JUSTICE
Act wo n’t be much of a metamorphosis , either .
President Obama , who as an Illinois state senator in 2003 called the PATRIOT Act " shoddy and dangerous " and pledged to replace it with a " new , carefully crafted " set of " limited " tools once in Washington , has been mum on where he stands now , as three provisions are set to expire and at least two other controversial measures are being debated in Congress right now .
In fact , his administration has coyly signaled that aside from being open to reasonable " modifications , " it would be happy if the whole bit were reauthorized without the drama .
Though the American Civil Liberties Union – the loyal vanguard of the reform fight – calls this tossed bone " encouraging , " there is no masking its regret over what could have been the best opportunity yet to reverse nearly a decade of depreciating civil liberties .
" There is no doubt that there is a big difference between the former administration and the present administration .
There ’s willingness to at least talk about these issues .
But when push comes to shove , they have gotten to the point where they are protecting the aggregation of power in the executive branch that occurred in the Bush administration , by and large , " said Michael Macleod - Ball , acting director of the ACLU ’s legislative office , in a recent interview .
As for what seems to be the tone of the Democrat - controlled Congress today , Macleod - Ball said it " does n’t have any more interest in curtailing those powers than the Republican Congress had in curtailing the Bush administration ’s powers . "
Of course , you could have seen this coming down Pennsylvania Avenue like a holiday parade .
Obama voted for the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act as a U.S. senator in 2006 .
His positions on issues like counter - terrorism already calibrated for a presidential run , Obama said there were enough " modest " improvements to the final legislation to support it .
But the reauthorization also made 14 of the 16 expiring measures in the bill permanent – including the controversial use of national security letters , which allow federal agents to demand a wide range of personal information , from financial records to e-mail communications , without judicial review , and to impose gag orders on their targets and third parties from which sensitive information is being sought .
Plus , when President Bush finally signed the bill in early 2006 , he added one of his famous " signing statements , " charging that his administration would comply with the new audit requirements , " in a manner consistent with the president ’s constitutional authority to supervise the unitary executive branch and to withhold information the disclosure of which could impair foreign relations , national security , the deliberative processes of the executive , or the performance of the executive ’s constitutional duties . "
And let ’s not forget that Obama voted in 2008 for warrantless wiretaps and immunity for telecom companies that gave up their subscribers ’ personal phone and Internet records to federal agents on demand .
As a new president , he officially backed elements of the Bush warrantless wiretaps and telecom immunity in court .
At the end of this year , the two remaining temporary provisions of the PATRIOT
Act will sunset : Section 206 , the counter - terror " roving wiretap " that allows the Feds to tap any communication device of a target without having to specify who or what they are targeting , and Section 215 , the measure that allows the government to grab " any tangible thing " – with accompanying gag orders – including library records and other personal information with a secret FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) court order .
Also expiring is the so - called " lone wolf " provision of the related Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act ( IRTPA ) , which allows the government to obtain secret FISA court orders against individuals who are not tied to any terrorist group or organization , but who might be suspected of terrorism .
Sen. Russell Feingold ( D - Wisc. ) , who fought valiantly against the 2006 reauthorization bill , joined with several other progressive senators on Sept. 17 to introduce a bill focused on " the problems with surveillance laws that threaten the rights and liberties of American citizens . "
The proposal calls for the reauthorization of the expiring provisions with ambitious revisions , including tougher standards for warrants and notification and better judicial review of all surveillance orders in the PATRIOT Act , including NSLs and the gags that restrict targets from talking about their cases or the circumstances under which they can appeal .
That bill was watered down by a proposal offered by Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen.
Patrick Leahy ( D - Vt. ) a week later , and then by another , weaker bill by Leahy and Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - Calif. ) a week after that .
That was the starting point for debate during the Oct. 1 committee markup .
" It ’s very , very frustrating , extremely frustrating , " said Macleod - Ball .
" We had this nice bill from Sen. Feingold … it had a lot of nice changes to it , then Leahy introduced his watered - down version .
It had made some tweaks .
The first thing they do [ during markup ] is they accept a further watered - down bill as the base bill – a very limited set of reforms .
Now we are left in the position of having to defend a further watered - down version of a bill that was already watered down . "
PATRIOT Act Lacks Patriotic Opposition
The reformers are in a weak position because , frankly , their position is weak , or at least it is perceived as weak .
As a result , outrage is in short supply , and therefore lawmakers do n’t feel compelled to take a stand and risk being labeled " soft on terror . "
Others simply insist that draconian surveillance powers will keep the country safe ( the recent arrests of suspected would - be domestic terrorist Najibullah Zazi and the Somali - Americans headed into the embrace of al - Shabaab are supposed to prove this point ) .
The key to lighting a fire under this thing is proof the PATRIOT
Act is being abused by federal authorities , putting the liberty of law - abiding individuals at risk .
So far , thanks to a " cloak of secrecy " and a lack of data beyond anecdotal complaints and lower - court rulings against specific PATRIOT
Act provisions , it has been difficult to build that case effectively .
" Unfortunately , when the expiring provisions came up for review in 2005 , there was very little in the public record for the Congress to evaluate , " said Mike German , policy counsel for the ACLU , in a statement [ .pdf ] to the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution , Civil Rights , and Civil Liberties on Sept. 22 . " [ The FBI ] repeatedly claimed there had been no ‘ substantiated ’ allegations of abuse .
Of course , the lack of substantiation was not due to a lack of abuse , but rather to a cloak of secrecy that surrounded the government ’s use of these authorities , which was duly enforced through constitutional gag orders . "
Although flawed , the 2006 reauthorization bill included additional auditing of PATRIOT Act programs .
New statistics via Justice Department inspector general ( IG ) reports have since trickled in , and it ’s not pretty .
For one , the Feds requested 49,425 national security letters in the year 2006 alone .
In 2004 , it requested 56,507 .
Compare that to 8,500 in 2000 .
According to the ACLU , these statistics understate the number of actual requests " because the FBI did not keep proper records … and the audit revealed a significant undercounting of NSL requests . "
No reliable data exists for 2001 and 2002 .
The IG found that agents repeatedly ignored the requirements for using NSLs and had actually used them to collect personal information against individuals " two or three times removed " from the subjects of FBI investigations .
Twenty - two percent of the audited files contained unreported " legal violations , " and FBI supervisors used hundreds of " exigent letters , " pressing telecoms to give up telephone records without NSLs by falsely claiming emergencies , according to a 2007 report [ .pdf ] .
An IG audit a year later [ . pdf ] on the same subject found that high - ranking members of the FBI , including an assistant director , issued 11 illegal " blanket NSLs " seeking data on 3,860 personal phone numbers , in addition to other misuse of the NSLs .
" The FBI ’s gross mismanagement of its NSL authorities risks security as much as it risks the privacy of innocent persons , " charged German in his fact - packed ACLU testimony [ . pdf ] last month , pointing out that according to the 2008 audit , the FBI could not locate information for at least 532 NSL requests issued from the field and 70 requests issued from headquarters .
That information just disappeared .
Meanwhile , under the PATRIOT
Act , the types of financial institutions required to file " suspicious activity " reports – which include detailed personal and account information to be turned over to the FBI and the Department of the Treasury – has expanded .
The number of these reports reached 1.25 million in 2007 , up from 163,184 in 2000 .
There has been lots of " suspicious activity , " but according to the numbers analyzed by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse , FBI prosecutions of international terrorism cases dropped steadily from 355 in 2002 to 34 in 2008 .
Out of the cases opened by the FBI in 2006 , the Department of Justice declined to prosecute 87 percent of them .
In fact , the DOJ has declined to prosecute no less than 77 percent of the FBI ’s international terrorism cases since 2003 .
Yet the Feds keep all of the personal information collected in these cases " forever , " says the ACLU .
" Once information is obtained in response to a national security letter , it is indefinitely retained and retrievable by the many authorized personnel who have access to various FBI databases , " testified Lisa Graves [ .pdf ] , executive director for the Center for Media and Democracy , on Sept. 23 .
" How many of the people subject to the [ NSL requests ] are innocent ?
We do not know for certain , but we do know that the government conducts only a couple dozen international terrorism prosecutions per year . "
She also pointed out that the FBI now has over 1 billion records in its Investigative Data Warehouse , which was only established five years ago .
That ’s more records than the Library of Congress .
The point is , thanks to the " cloak of secrecy , " we can never be sure how those records got there , what percentage were ill - gotten and illegal , and what percentage were obtained legitimately – or what the FBI and every other ancillary federal department with access were doing with them .
It would seem the time is ripe for a much broader movement against these abuses , considering the proliferation of neo-patriots taking to the streets for modern - day tea parties against overreaching government and the threat of tyranny .
Perhaps once the abuses are more fully known , it will give these revolutionaries an even better reason to dump their tea and start holding officials to account – beginning with the president , who as an ambitious candidate once called for serious reform , not just a name change .
" When can we finally stop the merry - go - round ? " said Councilman Dennis Zine , who kicked off the City Council 's consideration of the issue in 2005 when concerns about dispensaries first surfaced .
He proposed an alternative provision that would allow dispensaries to accept cash for marijuana as long as they comply with state law .
The controversial measure , first proposed a year and a half ago , delayed deliberations as council members debated the wisdom of ignoring the opinion of the city 's top prosecutor .
But about four hours into a raucous hearing , council members made it clear they were ready to move on .
Rejecting the advice of the city attorney , two Los Angeles City Council committees voted today to scrap a proposed provision that would have banned the sale of medical marijuana .
William Carter , the chief deputy city attorney , repeatedly argued that state law and state court decisions make it clear that collectives can cultivate medical marijuana but not sell it .
" We 're stuck with the current law , " he said .
But Zine urged the council members to adopt an interpretation of the law that would not upend how dispensaries operate in Los Angeles and most of the state .
" I 'm saying let 's push that to the edge , " he said .
After the members of the planning committee and Public Safety Committee voted , David Berger , a special assistant to City Atty .
Carmen Trutanich , said it is up to the council to decide whether to accept the office 's legal advice .
" Our duty is to advise them on what the law allows for and not to go on a whim , " he said .
" They decided to go a different way . "
Councilman Ed Reyes , who has overseen most of the council 's consideration of the issue , expressed exasperation with the city attorney 's office .
" I think they are very , very narrow in that they 're taking their prosecutorial perspective , " he said .
The long - delayed measure could be taken up by the full council as soon as Wednesday .
" We need something on the books now .
There is no reason why we should delay , " Reyes said .
Four years ago , when the City Council first began to look into regulating dispensaries , there were four .
A year later , there were 98 .
In 2007 , when the city adopted a moratorium , 186 dispensaries were allowed to remain in business .
Now , the city attorney 's office estimates there could be as many as a thousand spread throughout the city , and heavily concentrated in some neighborhoods .
At the hearing , scores of dispensary operators and marijuana users argued that the proposed ban would force them to close .
" It simply wo n't work , " said Don Duncan , a Los Angeles resident who is the California director of Americans for Safe Access .
A vote for a sales ban would have taken Los Angeles into uncharted legal territory .
Duncan 's organization and the Union of Medical Marijuana Patients threatened to sue the city if the council adopted the provision , arguing that the city attorney 's opinion was flawed .
About 400 people crowded into the main council chamber for the hearing .
Most of the speakers were supporters of medical marijuana who became increasingly rowdy .
They repeatedly interrupted the handful of neighborhood activists who spoke , urging the adoption of an ordinance that would reduce the number of dispensaries and clamp down on operations that create nuisances .
" Do the right thing .
Protect your community .
You 're going to get sued anyway , " said James O'Sullivan with the Miracle Mile Residential Assn .

TREECE , Kan .  Mayor Bill
Blunk sees no reason for sugar - coating his opinion when asked to describe this town .
“ It ’s dead , ” he said .
“ Wasted land . ”
Almost anywhere else on the map , such bluntness could cost a politician re-election .
But not here .
Mr. Blunk has the near - unanimous support of the population , 140 people or so , who are perhaps singular among residents of municipalities in that they all want out of theirs .
“ I ’d be happy to go as anyone , ” said Randall Barr , a retired sand company worker .
“ You ca n’t do anything with this land .
What good is it ? ”
For most of the early part of the 20th century , this little city in the southeast corner of Kansas had the feel of a rollicking boom town , its prosperity coming from land rich in lead , zinc and iron ore .
Part of a vast mining district where Kansas , Missouri and Oklahoma meet , Treece and its twin city across the Oklahoma state line , Picher , became the unofficial capitals of a zone that in its heyday produced more than $ 20 billion worth of ore  much of it used for weaponry to fight World Wars I and II .
Although recent advances have raised hopes that a protective vaccine can be developed , acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) remains a major public health problem .
Much has been learned about HIV - 1 , the virus that causes the disease .
However , basic aspects of person - to - person transmission and of the progressive intercellular infection that depletes the immune system of its vital T cells remain imperfectly understood .
In a paper published November 6 in the online journal PloS Pathogens , Professor Don Lamb 's group at the Ludwig - Maximilians - Universitaet ( LMU ) in Munichs 's Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry , together with colleagues in Heidelberg , describe in detail how new virus particles assemble at the membrane of infected cells , and are released to attack healthy cells nearby .
The new findings could help provide clues as how to interrupt the process of intercellular viral spread .
As many of us have learned from personal experience , computer viruses , which contain short pieces of malicious code and arrive in anonymous packages , can gum up data - processing routines .
This definition also fits their biological counterparts , which generally comprise compact genomes packed in protein shells , and enter cells via specific portals .
For example , the retrovirus HIV - 1 has only nine genes in its RNA genome and infects cells by binding to specific receptors .
Inside the cell , the genetic material is copied and 15 viral proteins are synthesized .
They interact to pack the genomic RNA into new viral particles .
These are then extruded from the cell , wrapped in an envelope of membrane bearing viral proteins that direct the parcel to the next susceptible cell .
The basket that encases the viral RNA is constructed from the Gag protein .
Gag is highly versatile :
It can bind to the inner face of the cell membrane , to the viral RNA , to itself ( to form the shell around the RNA ) and to cellular proteins that extrude the newly assembled particle into the extracellular medium .
Indeed , Gag can form virus - like particles in the absence of other viral proteins .
For their experiments , Professor Lamb 's team used cultured cells containing eight of the HIV - 1 genes , one of which coded for a fluorescent form of Gag .
" We adopted our custom - built microscope specifically for the experiment , visualizing Gag in the cellular plasma membrane by Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy while alternately switching to Wide - Field Fluorescence Microscopy to get a deeper view into the cell , " explains Lamb .
This allowed the team to track single Gag particles and follow the assembly process , in real time .
Once virus assembly is switched on within an infected cell , the membrane surface of the cell becomes covered with viruses in one to two hours .
Each virus is assembled individually at the plasma membrane on the time scale of minutes , rejecting the idea of a reusable assembly platform that is believed to exist for other viruses .
By tracking individual viruses , the scientist could follow the processes of assembly from initiation of assembly through to release , learning that it takes about 25 minutes to produce an HIV virus .
Hence , a lag of 15 - 20 minutes precedes release of the enveloped virus , presumably because it takes time for the hijacked cellular budding machinery to close of the virus and release it into to the extracellular medium .
" Using a ' photoconvertible ' version of the famous green fluorescent protein -- whose discovery and utilization in biological systems were honored with the Nobel prize in chemistry in 2008 -- attached to the Gag protein , we were able to convert the color of membrane bound Gag proteins from green to red , " says Lamb .
" Thereby , we could determine that viruses were assembly from protein delivered directly from the cytosol or had only arrived recently to the plasma membrane . "
The new findings add an important dynamic dimension to the process of intercellular viral spread .
If they help find ways to interrupt it , HIV - 1 could finally be stamped as " undeliverable . "
For a whole week , the political classes have been obsessed by the prospect of a hung Parliament .
The subject has arisen quite suddenly , out of nowhere , or almost nothing .
All that happened was that a newspaper published an opinion poll showing a reduced but still perfectly healthy Conservative lead .
There were also a few straws in the November wind indicating that Mr David Cameron was not the universal favourite to take up residence at No 10 , or that Mr George Osborne would be his next - door neighbour .
The trouble is that we have become bored .
With Mr Gordon Brown limping along , there is nothing to divert us from the long winter nights that lie ahead until the flowers emerge for the spring election .
What more agreeable diversion than to speculate about a hung Parliament ?
The phrase is of comparatively recent origin .
It derives from the first 1974 election , when Edward Heath tried to hang on to office on the basis that the Conservatives had won more votes than Labour , though Labour had won more seats .
The Economist magazine of that time invented the phrase , from the " hung jury " in American trials , where the jury had failed to reach a verdict .
The phrase caught on , but the phenomenon – where no party has an absolute majority – is as old as parliamentary politics itself .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
No party held a majority in the two elections of 1910 .
The 1923 election allowed Labour to form its first minority government in 1924 .
In 1929 Labour took office again under Ramsay MacDonald , and survived for two years until MacDonald formed his supposedly National – in reality , Conservative – government .
In March 1974 Harold Wilson took office once more .
In October Wilson won narrowly , by three seats , but Labour lost its majority almost at once , and for the most of this period Labour governed as a minority party , sustained by the Liberals .
In 1950 - 51 Labour had a tiny majority .
it did not feel like that at the time .
It seemed smaller still .
There were urgings from the Palace that what the country needed was a government of national unity .
Order was restored only when the Conservatives won the election .
Labour 's small majority of 1964 worked unexpectedly smoothly .
The Tories did not expect to win the election which they knew Wilson would call in 1966 ; nor did they .
The saddest experience was almost certainly that of John Major in 1992 - 97 .
He lost his majority towards the end of his period of office .
But for most of the time it felt as if he was not governing with any majority at all .
Sir John 's fatal error – as the late Edgar Lustgarten used to say in those old films about Scotland Yard – was to take the committee stage of the Maastricht treaty on the floor of the House of Commons .
There were about a dozen awkward Tories who kept abstaining or voting against the Major government .
There was also an accomplished parliamentary operation conducted by John Smith , George Robertson and Geoff Hoon ( for Tony Blair was busying himself elsewhere ) .
Oddly enough , the predominantly anti-European conservative press did not proclaim the awkward squad as heroes .
Still less did the liberal papers applaud the Labour opposition for exercising its right to oppose .
It was the function of government to get its business through in one piece , on time .
And this the government was manifestly failing to do .
Accord
ingly , we have quite recent experience of a state of affairs when a government is not all - powerful .
But the high point of speculation about the hung Parliament occurred in the 1980s .
Margaret
Thatcher went on to win two crushing victories , in 1983 and 1987 .
It was evident ( to me , at any rate ) that the splitting of the anti-Tory vote between Labour and the newly formed Alliance would let in Mrs Thatcher .
And so it turned out .
This saw the rise of the " constitutional expert " , a creature hitherto unknown to our system of government .
The monopoly , or duopoly , was held by Lord Blake , and Lord St John of Fawsley .
Lord Blake was a good historian and a nice man ; Lord St John , formerly Norman St John - Stevas , as the boxing posters would put it , needs no introduction .
More recently a new contender has entered the booth , or the studio : Professor Vernon Bogdanor , who taught Mr Cameron politics at Oxford .
Lord Blake is , sadly , no longer with us , and another of that galère , Sir Robert Rhodes James , has gone the same way .
All of them gave the impression of providing sage advice to Her Majesty as to her proper constitutional duty , if called upon to to so .
Roy Jenkins was the first leader of the Social Democratic Party and was called the " prime minister designate " for the purpose of conducting negotiations with the other parties .
Jenkins was not keen on the title but for a time it stuck .
He soon gave way to a joint leadership of David Owen and David Steel .
It became a great sport among lobby journalists to tempt the two of them to say slightly – or it may be very – different things in relation to their future behaviour in some hypothetical government .
Lord Owen tended to be bolder in his speculations .
He inclined to dislike writing anything down , and was prone to drop off into a stream of consciousness with the slightest encouragement .
Lord Ashdown was anxious to obtain office of some kind or , at any rate , a position of pomp and power under Mr Blair .
Alas , Lord Ashdown was led up the garden path , though this was more to do with the size of Labour 's majority than with any conscious betrayal on the part of Mr Blair .
Mr Charles Kennedy behaved with admirable self - restraint .
So , more or less , did Sir Menzies Campbell , in the limited time available to him .
The change is that Mr Nick Clegg is prepared to support the Tories as no previous Liberal or Liberal Democrat leader was prepared to support them .
A possible exception might have been Mr Jeremy Thorpe in 1974 .
But there are slightly varying accounts of this episode .
And , in any case , his party was willing to back him .
From Jo Grimond onwards , the Liberal dream was of reunion of the parties of more or less the left , of the progressive forces of politics .
Mr Blair often brought the subject up in his first phase .
What did for Mr Blair , and for the Labour Party , was the Iraq war and the constant stream of bossy , petty and interfering policies .
My guess is still that Mr Cameron will win a comfortable majority .
Indeed , my prediction is that England are more likely to win the Triple Crown at rugby – that is , to defeat Wales , Scotland and Ireland – than we are to end up with a hung Parliament .
Naturally , I should quite like it to happen .
I should welcome the accommodations that would have to be made on all sides and enjoy the spectacle of Mr Osborne looking less smug .
Mr Brown might even smile , for once .
But I fear it is not going to happen .
Developer Naughty
Dog has revealed that sales of stellar sequel Uncharted 2 : Among
Thieves have vastly eclipsed those of its predecessor , Drake ’s Fortune , noting the universally acclaimed title is currently “ exceeding expectations ” at retail .
“ I would definitely say it ’s exceeding expectations , ” the firm ’s creative director , Amy Hennig , told IndustryGamers .
“ Being in the industry for a while you learn to try to manage your expectations because you ’d rather be surprised with good news than disappointed .
It ’s a tough business , but from the early numbers I ’ve seen getting reported back it ’s exceeded any estimates we had internally , and it ’s certainly outsold the first game by many , many times .
That and the critical reception so far has been really gratifying . ”
Elsewhere , Hennig also divulged that fans can expect the first batch of downloadable content for Among Thieves to arrive before 2010 .
Apparently , the company will be offering a mix of both free and purchasable goodies .
“ Without going into specifics , it ’ll involve new maps , new characters , things like that .
Some of it will be free of charge and some of it will be purchasable .
We ’ve got a lot of people on the team working on this stuff , some really cool stuff that people will be excited about , ” she said .
Nouriel Roubini wants a nickname - change .
Compared to his outlook of a year ago , he 's downright sunny .
So now he would like to be called Dr. Realist .
Somehow that does n't have quite the same ring to it .
Anyway , Nouriel 's also still sounding gloomy , but only because the market has gone to the moon :
Kelly Evans , WSJ : “ Some of [ the rally ] is fundamental , ” [ Dr. Doom ] said .
“ We avoided Armageddon , there is a light at the end of the tunnel , and risk aversion is lower . ”
“ But it has occurred so fast , so soon , in my view that it ’s diverging from the underlying economic fundamentals , ” he said .
“ Markets today are pricing in a V - shaped recovery and they have to start pricing in a U - shaped recovery , so the fourth quarter or first quarter could see a correction . ”
Mr. Roubini also denied that he is a “ permabear ” and joked that his nickname should be “ Dr. Realist ” rather than “ Dr. Doom , ” given his warnings about the U.S. housing market prior to its collapse ...
“ There is froth in markets — a significant amount of froth , ” he said , but “ the recovery is going to be so weak , there is no way the Fed can start raising interest rates anytime soon . ”
The U.S. unemployment rate , for example , “ will certainly be well above 10 % ” for some time since “ many of these lost jobs are gone forever , ” he said .

Gluing Things Together -
Scheme in the Real - time CG Content Production
Square USA Inc. Shiro Kawai * Square USA Inc .
Cutting - edge 3D real - time rendering is where programmers rack their brains to feed more instructions to CPU or transfer more data on the bus within each frame , and dynamic languages seem to have no place there .
However , there is another hidden cost which is growing rapidly as the quality and complexity of rendered images get higher -- the cost of content creation .
At SIGGRAPH 2000 and 2001 , we , Square USA R&D team showed real - time rendering of scenes from full computer - generated movie ``Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within' ' .
Although we used the most advanced rendering hardware at that time , such as Sony Computer Entertainment 's GSCube parallel rendering engine and nVidia 's Quadro DCC chip , we had to spend lots of time to tune data to achieve the maximum image quality .
We found it tremendous help to have an embedded Scheme interpreter in real - time rendering engine .
Scheme could lay out the data on the memory , inspect the state of the engine , and handle user interactions and allow data manipulation over the network , without affecting rendering performance .
Scheme representation of the scene structure worked nicely for the last - minute tuning ( lots of Emacs works , in fact ) .

It is not a news for Lisp programmers that Lisp is used in the interactive computer graphics .
Actually , Lisp used to be the language to do graphics .
There were various reasons for it , but we think one of the reasons was that dealing with the data structure in computer graphics is basically tweaking a directed graph dynamically , and Lisp was very good to deal with graph structure at run time .
However , real - time interactive computer graphics are constantly facing the limit of hardware due to ever increasing requirement of pushing more data to the graphics hardware , and such languages that the programmers can have precise control over what 's on the memory and in the instruction stream are much preferred -- so C and C++ have dominated the field .
The dynamic languages tend to bring unpredictability into the tightly - tuned engine and are frowned away by many programmers .
( Actually , some game programmers even avoided C++ until recently , because it is prone to introduce unexpected pointer indirection and hidden fields in the data structure ) .
Nevertheless , tweaking the parameters and structures in the rendered scene at run time is inevitable during the production stage .
People deal with it starting from ``run - time configuration file '' that sets some parameters at the startup .
It is natural that such configuration file syntax evolves to a simple command language , then to a full - fledged programming language .
Square Co. , the parent company of Square USA , has been using in - house specialized scripting languages to describe game events for long time .
Recently there are some attempts to embed full - feature language , such as Python [ 1 ] , or Lisp [ 2 ] , in the game engine .
Square USA R&D Team had been developing an in - house real - time rendering engine in a project called Dancer , and we adopted Scheme as an embedded scripting language .
The engine and scripting features were tested in production for ``Final Fantasy in Real Time '' demonstration in SIGGRAPH 2000 and 2001 exhibition .
The demonstration showed real - time rendering of a sequence taken from a full - CG Movie in photo - realistic quality , and that made us face some nontrivial challenges [ 3 ] .
This paper describes our experience in the production of those demonstrations , and how we addressed the issues using Scheme as a glue language .
In the next section we 'll give an overview of the Dancer Project in Square USA .
In the following sections we describe the implementation details of the embedded Scheme engine , the problems we faced during the production of the demonstration , and how we used Scheme to address those issues .
Then we summarize our experience , and conclude the paper by the future direction of real - time scripting .
2 The Dancer Project
The Dancer Project is an in - house development project in Square USA , aiming at building a high - quality real - time 3D rendering and animation engine that took advantage of advanced graphical hardware as much as possible .
It started in 1999 , when Sony Computer Entertainment ( SCE ) revealed PlayStation 2 ( PS2 ) specification .
The engine first targeted at PS2 , as well as standard OpenGL , then the support for DirectX and nVidia 's OpenGL extensions were added .
It was used for technical demonstration titled ``Final Fantasy in Real Time ' ' at SIGGRAPH 2000 and 2001 exhibitions , showing a scene from the movie ``Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within '' rendered in real time , on SCE 's GSCube parallel rendering engine ( in 2000 ) and nVidia 's Quadro DCC graphics card ( in 2001 ) .
Dancer was also used for a preview tool to support the production of ``Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within ' ' and another short animation .
A part of the Dancer library was used in a console game title as well .
( But the latter applications did n't use the Scheme engine . )
The Dancer engine was implemented mostly in C , with some assembly language code .
Performance and predictable memory consumption at run time were the highest priority .
The use of C++ was rejected by the potential users of the library since it did n't fit in their production pipeline .
One of the characteristics of the Dancer engine was its modular architecture .
It consisted of mostly independent , modular libraries , and the user could take the features they needed for their application .
Dancer had its own data structure , but it did n't force the user 's code to use the Dancer structures which might not fit in the internal structure of the application .
Instead , the Dancer API could take minimal structures , such as a pointer to an array of floats .
For example , the deformer module took pointers to the source and destination float arrays that represented vertex positions , and updated the destination float array every frame according to the settings .
The hierarchical transformation module took pointers to the 4x4 matrices and updated them according to the transformation hierarchy .
The rendering module used the shape structure that took a pointer to the vertex arrays which were an array of floats .
They could be used together to create a complete animation engine , but each modules could be plugged - in to user 's application by just passing pointers .
3 The Scripting Engine
The Dancer 's scripting engine had to fit this framework .
It had to work as a pure ``add - on '' module , that is , adding extra data field ( such as tag bits ) to the Dancer data structure or interfering with application 's memory management were not the option .
We started with STk 1 Scheme interpreter , for embedding it to other applications was relatively easy , and we had been using it for various in - house tools , including embedded Scheme plug - in for Maya 2 .
First , due to the limitation of memory space ( especially of PlayStation 2 ) , we stripped unnecessary features :
Only fixnums and flonums were used for numbers ( no bignums ) .
Flonums used floats instead of doubles .
Some error checks were omitted .
Continuations worked upward - only ( just setjmp and longjmp ) .
Dropped support of module system , promise , eval - hook , autoload , virtual ports , FFI , POSIX functions , dynamic loading , and unix processes .
PlayStation 2 and GSCube runtime had limited support of system functions , so some of them were omitted and some of them had to be emulated ( e.g. we built a buffered file I /O on top of PlayStation 2's file transfer protocol via host machine ) .
Memory management was tricky .
Dancer data structure might point in the middle of other data structure , as , for example , a hierarchical transform node pointed to a matrix inside another object .
Lacking precise type information and layout information of each object , there was no way for GC to know which objects were alive .
However , as the real - time rendering engine , the allocation pattern of Dancer data was usually very specific .
Almost all data was laid out on memory during initialization stage , and the allocation during real - time playback was generally avoided .
So we decided to make the Scheme engine not to reclaim Dancer data structure .
The scripting engine used its own memory allocator to allocate Scheme object from the designated memory space .
The objects from the space was managed by GC .
The Dancer objects were allocated by application 's memory allocator .
The Dancer objects allocator could be called from Scheme to obtain the pointer of new Dancer objects as a foreign pointer .
Scheme could also call the explicit deallocator of Dancer objects , although it was the responsibility of the script programmer to make sure the Dancer scene graph would be consistent after deallocation of some objects .
The explicit deallocation was hardly used , since it was always easy to flush entire memory and reload the data into a fresh state .
The Scheme binding to Dancer library API was generated semi-automatically from hand - written API description format .
The Scheme binding was fairly low - level , in the sense that it was allowed to deal with C pointers within Scheme .
Scheme code could take the address of a field of Dancer object and put it to a field of another Dancer object , for example .
It was accepted well by the programmers , since they could treat Dancer structures in the same way as in C .
The Scheme engine also had a couple of important features , one was UI binding and the other was a networked listener .
The UI binding allowed Scheme code to construct menus , to connect keyboard and mouse events to Dancer objects , and to register callbacks to such events .
Connecting events to Dancer objects means to pass the UI driver the pointer of a field of some Dancer object and ask the driver to update the field whenever the event occurs .
The important fact here was that no Scheme code would run when actual events occurred , thus no allocation and no GC would be required during real - time playback .
Callback feature could be used if we needed more than such a simple connection , mainly to implement the features useful during authoring stage , when a pause of GC was a much less problem .
( In fact , it turned out that the pause of GC was never be a problem ; we hardly noticed it .
The pause caused by texture swapping was much more problematic ) .
The networked listener was a read - eval - print loop that listened network connection .
It used sockets on PC / nVidia platform , and a special protocol on PlayStation and GSCube platform .
Initially we implemented it for the last resort of run-time tweaking , when we needed to adjust some parameters without stopping the playback .
However , it turned out much more useful when we connected the Dancer playback engine and the authoring software .
We 'll explain it later .
4 The Production
We experienced two production process using Dancer and the scripting engine .
The first one was for the exhibition of SIGGRAPH 2000 , where we played back a sequence ( called ``BOA ' ' ) taken from the ``Final Fantasy '' movie which ran about a minute and included a single character .
It ran on SCE 's GSCube parallel rendering engine , which essentially had 16 PlayStation 2's and an image composition hardware in it .
The second one was for the exhibition of SIGGRAPH 2001 , where we played back a sequence called ``SLA '' , which ran about four minutes and had two characters .
In both demonstrations , the audience could control the camera and the lights interactively while playing back the animation .
In the 2001 demonstration the audience also could adjust various parameters , such as object colors and transparencies , interactively .
We had the movie data , but they were extremely large and complicated and there was no way to render them in real - time as they were .
Thus the production was mainly to tune and reconstruct the data into a suitable form for real - time playback .
It was not just a matter of reducing the amount of the data -- sometimes the fundamental structure needed to be changed , such as animation setup , and sometimes the movie data was totally irrelevant and needed to be redesigned , such as lighting setup .
The redesigning involved artistic decisions , and we worked with several artists to achieve the goal .
The actual process was described in detail in [ 3 ] .
There were some issues we wanted to address by scripting .
Integration of the data :
The scene consisted of large number of data from various sources .
For example , a character model was exported from Maya , and the texture was retouched by Photoshop .
Animation data was also exported from Maya but it was chopped for each shot and each individual channels , and had to be concatenated somehow .
The lighting data needed to be recreated in terms of the Dancer 's rendering engine .
We needed some way to integrate them , so that they form a scene graph in the Dancer 's memory .
Shortening turn - around time : Traditional workflow for real - time content production is to iterate ( 1 ) exporting data from authoring tool ( Maya ) , ( 2 ) loading the data into the target environment , and ( 3 ) checking the appearance and fixing the original data .
It does not work well as the amount of data grows , for the exporting takes more and more time .
In our production , the extreme case was the facial animation of the main character , which took 8 hours to export 3 .
It was crucial to have the means of tweaking the data and seeing its effect immediately on the target environment , instead of repeating the above time - consuming iteration .
Supporting trial - and - error :
When you want to achieve certain visual appearance , it is not uncommon that there are two approaches , one that puts more work on designer side to prepare data , or another that emphasize more on programmer 's work to deal with the data .
The cost and effect of these approaches may vary greatly , and trial - and - error is inevitable in the production .
Nevertheless , the tight schedule of the production usually does n't allow enough room for trials .
It would have been a great help if we had the means to try out certain programmatic effects quickly , instead of waiting a day or two for a programmer to write up the complete code to do it .
5 The Roles of Scheme
We used Scheme in various places throughout the production , but it could be summarized as the following several topics .
5.1 Scheme as a file format
( define * shot - lengths * '( ( 3 84 ) ( 4 402 ) ( 4a 48 ) ( 5 36 ) ( 6 74 ) ( 7 113 ) ( 8 72 ) ( 9 120 ) ( 10 217 ) ( 12 120 ) ( 13 368 ) ( 15 86 ) ( 16 128 ) ( 18 275 ) ( 18 a 72 ) ... ) ) ( define * shot - data * ( let ( ( frame 1 ) ) ( map ( lambda ( len ) ( let ( ( result ( list ( car len ) frame (+ frame ( fps- frame len ) - 1 ) ) ) ) ( set ! frame (+ frame ( fps- frame len ) ) ) result ) ) * shot - lengths * ) ) ) ( define ( get- motions shots file - format - string ) ( define ( read - channel file ) ( sqmo- channel - read ( sq- complete - filename file ) ) ) ( map ( lambda ( shot - data ) ( if ( memq shot - data shots ) ( create - motion - channel ( read - channel ( format #f file - format - string ( shot - number shot - data ) ) ) ( first - frame shot - data ) ) # f ) ) * shot-data * ) )
Figure 1 : Excerpt from the integration script , showing the part that defines shots in the sequence and then loads required animation channels ( ``motions ' ' ) .
The variable * shot - lengths * keeps assoc- list of shot name and its length .
Changing the length of the shots or omitting certain shots were as easy as just changing the value of * shot - lengths * , which helped us greatly during data tuning and debugging stage .
To address data integration problem , we just decided to use Scheme program as the integrated file format .
So loading data files was just evaluating Scheme scripts .
We had a special binary format for individual data files such as geometry data and animation data .
Scheme had API binding to read those binary files .
After placing those binary data in the memory , the Scheme script was responsible to interconnect pointers of the data structures to construct the scene graph .
We wrote an exporter plugin in Maya that emitted binary files and a Scheme program to load and interconnect them .
Not all data in the original scene were exported as binary ; for example , shader and material information was exported as a Scheme program that would construct a shader node and set up the parameters .
Having a Scheme program as a file format gave us lots of flexibility .
Splitting the data hierarchy into manageable size was trivial , for we could just `load ' the subtree of the data .
Treating animation data was a bit more involved , for the original data was prepared for each shot , having the time frame beginning of the shot .
The script had to load the animation data of shots in the sequence , then offset them accordingly within the sequence .
Furthermore , simple concatenation of the animation data would n't work , since the interpolation around a shot boundary would yield wrong result .
So we used a special Dancer structure called a ``switch connector '' , which took input from animation channels of all shots , and one ``control '' input that selects the active shot , then output the selected data into the given pointer .
A hand - written Scheme script took care of creating required switch connectors and wiring them .
One example of such flexibility was the ability of parameterization .
It was often required to play back just a certain shot , or even a part of the shot , in order to tune some data or debug some defects .
We had a single location that defines shots and their lengths ( see figure 1 ) , and changing the shot to play back was just a matter of changing the value of that definition .
It was also important that we had an ability to patch things procedurally ; if we found some bug in the rendering engine that had a problem with certain data , we could add a Scheme function to the data file that scanned the data hierarchy and rewrote the problematic data , so that the artists could keep working without waiting the bug to be fixed .
5.2 Scheme as a debugging tool
Debugging was especially a problem in GSCube project .
The target program ran on 16 CPUs in GSCube , while you could only login to the host processor that controls those CPUs .
A remote debugger was provided but difficult to use , and we ended up mostly using print statement to monitor the state of CPUs .
Scripts came handy here .
It did n't require recompilation , of course , but the real power came from the ability of registering callbacks to events , including shot boundaries or frame boundaries .
So we could write a procedure , for example , that were evaluated in each frame while frame count was in a particular range and reported if the data was in supposed range or not .
Evaluating callbacks required some memory allocation in the Scheme engine and might cause GC during playback , so it could have a probe effect , but in practice we did n't have the problem .
Besides , we could also set a callback to some button event to turn on and off the debug stub , so that we could evaluate the probe effect itself .
Even in development on PC for SIGGRAPH 2001 , where we could invoke debugger as we needed , it was sometimes useful to use a script to show certain values on the screen , for example , so that we could monitor the data during playback .
We expected the network listener to be another powerful debugging tool , but it was n't used very much for debugging .
It was probably because ``inspect '' feature of the listener was poor , and it took lots of typing to reach the data you want to investigate .
We realized the power of interactive top - level was not just from the fact that you could evaluate the expression interactively , but also from the rich supporting tools such as inspectors , apropos , and history features .
However , the network listener turned out to be useful to construct authoring environment , which we describe later .
5.3 Scheme for rapid prototyping
The demonstration UI was a kind of last - minute hack , since we were not sure how much we could show until very late in the production .
The UI was written in Scheme , which helped a lot to tweak it until the last moment .
There were another incident that Scheme served as a handy tool .
Lighting of the scene had to be redone for the demonstration , since the movie 's lighting setting was not for real - time rendering .
The adjustment must have been done in the Dancer 's rendering engine ; the authoring tool ( Maya ) could n't reproduce the exact image that Dancer produced .
So we quickly hacked a lighting tool on Dancer , which enabled an artist to change positions and parameters of several lights while the scene was playing back .
The tool could also save and load the light settings .
The tool features were entirely written in Scheme , without modifying Dancer engine code .
An artist worked on the tool and finished lighting of 20 - some shots within a couple of days .
Considering that it had taken many weeks to do lighting in the movie scenes , we realized the power of real - time playback for authoring environment .
( This is not a fair comparison , though , since the movie scenes involved a lot more light settings than just 6 to 8 hardware - rendered lights in the demo .
Still , the artist mentioned that it was much easier to see the effects immediately , instead of waiting an hour for the image to be rendered ) .
5.4 Scheme for authoring
The experience of lighting tool motivated us to proceed that direction further .
Although it was n't finished in time in the production of the demonstrations , we later developed a prototype system called ``Laika '' , which was an attempt to make a fusion of authoring and playback environment .
Figure 2 : The ``Laika '' authoring prototype .
The Laika authoring prototype consisted of an authoring tool ( Maya ) , and the Dancer playback engine ( see figure 2 ) .
Maya had our in - house embedded Scheme plugin ( called ``schemaya ' ' ) , which monitored changes in the Maya scene and propagated them to Dancer , via Dancer 's network listener .
Schemaya was also based on STk and could use STk 's object system , STklos , which had CLOS - like MOP [ 4 ] .
We wrote a simple distributed object system on top of it .
An object in Maya side was defined as a ``proxy '' , which had slots marked `remote ' ( see figure 3 ) .
Changes of the remote slots were sent to Dancer side , and reflected promptly on the scene being played back .
Proxy metaclass managed caching and optimizing the communication .
The actual messages sent to Dancer were simply a bunch of set !
expressions , which were evaluated by Dancer 's network listener .
( define-class < dancer- light - proxy > ( < proxy > ) ( ( id : init - keyword : id : accessor id - of ) ( name : accessor name - of : initform #f : init - keyword : name ) ( state :accessor state - of : allocation : remote ) ( color : accessor color - of : allocation : remote ) ( target : accessor target - of : allocation : remote ) ( rotate :accessor rotate - of : allocation : remote ) ( distance :accessor distance - of : allocation : remote ) ( fov :accessor fov - of : allocation : remote ) ( jitter - angle : accessor jitter - angle - of :allocation : remote ) ( jitter - distance : accessor jitter - distance - of : allocation : remote ) ( phong :accessor phong - of : allocation : remote ) ( settings : accessor settings - of : allocation : virtual : slot-ref ( make- light- settings - getter ) : slot-set ! ( lambda ( o v ) # f ) ) ) : getter - builder make - light - proxy - getter : setter - builder make - light - proxy - setter ) Figure 3 : Definition of ``remote '' object .
Changes to the slots marked remote would propagate to the other side and reflected in the scene being played back .
An artist could change camera setting and lighting in Maya , which would propagate to the Dancer 's rendering immediately .
Besides , Laika could use Dancer engine to render multiple images while jittering camera and lights , then compose them to create higher - quality images with nicer effects like soft shadows and depth - of - field .
Unfortunately , Square USA shut down the studio before ``Laika ' ' was used in the real production .
However , we think this technique should be used in the future production .
6 Experience
Thinking back our experience of two demonstration productions , we 'd like to note several points .
S -expression was a win .
It could be any structured format with well - defined external representation , but I think S - expression is the simplest form among other possibilities .
Reading and writing S - expression are trivial 4 , and we wrote lots of small , throw - away Scheme scripts to fix the data deficiencies , since re-exporting the data from Maya was too expensive .
Emacs has built - in support to deal with S - expressions , and the capability of hand - editing data files was indispensable for the last - minute crunch time .
( define ( create - switch - connector obj shots file - format - string connector - builder slot - accessor ) ( let* ( ( swc ( connector - builder ( list ( slot - accessor obj ) ) ( if ( string ? file - format - string ) ( get- motions shots file - format - string ) file - format - string ) * studio* ) ) ( inc ( sqst-create-integer-connector ( sqco-switch - connector-get-current - source - ptr swc ) * shot- step-motion * * studio* ) ) ) ( sqst-studio-add - updater - before * studio* * root * swc ) ( sqst-studio - add - updater - before * studio* swc inc ) swc ) )
Figure 4 : Using higher - order function for abstraction .
The function create - switch - connector takes two procedures , connector - builder and slot - accessor , that have information about the type and location of the data to deal with .
Higher - order function was a win .
This was a surprise for us .
We expected scripting engine needed just trivial stuff , such as loops , conditionals , and function definitions at most .
However , the tweaking of data produced lots of similar code , and some kind of parameterization was handy for refactoring them .
And the functional abstraction was , again , the simplest way to realize that .
For example , figure 4 shows an excerpt of the scene - setup code that creates a ``switch connector '' node which feeds different animations for each shot from different motion files .
There were some variations of in types of animated data ( matrices , colors , etc. ) and the fields , so the connector creation function took two functions , connector - builder and slot - accessor , to parameterize the construction .
GC was a problem .
The speed of GC was not a big problem , since no memory allocation was done while the tight rendering loop was running , so GC would never run in the normal playback .
( The menu UI and remote evaluation could cause GC , but it was an acceptable pause in the production period .
It was possible to set up the scene so that no allocation would be done during the actual demo . )
The real problem was that existence of GC might force a certain style of programming .
If we had wanted to GC not only the Scheme data but also the actual Dancer structures , we would have had to ask the application that uses Dancer to obey some restrictions , such as using Dancer 's memory allocator or limiting the use of pointers so that they would be visible from GC .
This would severely limit the usefulness of Dancer , for the memory management is one of the core part the potential application writers would want to tune by themselves .
One possible way to address this might be to provide several choices of allocators that works with GC .
For example , sometimes real - time rendering engine uses simple first - in - last - out allocator , where the memory is divided by free area and used area by a single pointer , and a new object is allocated by just taking the required chunk of memory from the top ( or bottom ) of the free area and updating the dividing pointer .
The objects must be freed in the reverse order of allocation , or freed all at once 5 , but such limitations are accepted for the better performance .
It would be nice if we have GC that is aware of this type of allocator .
Limited memory space was a problem .
We could n't keep meta information such as the layout of Dancer structures and a catalog of instantiated objects in the target 's memory , due to the limitation of memory space .
It reduced the usefulness of interactive listener -- we needed to chase pointers by hand , looking at the source code , to reach the object we needed to inspect , which was too cumbersome .
On PC platforms this restriction could be removed , but the special platforms such as a console game engine will always have less memory than the PC at the same generation .
In the applications like Laika , it might be possible to keep the meta - information in the host machine .
We could make the target machine report addresses of newly allocated object to the host machine ( or even make host machine to emulate the allocator of the target machine ) , so that the host machine can keep a table of names and pointers of allocated instances , instead of letting the target machine do so .
A special client program running on the host machine can then use the information to help interactive listener , much like remote debuggers do .
Power of abstraction must be advertised more .
When talking about the ideas of embedded Scheme , it is common to get a reaction such as ``Why do we need that complicated stuff , such as higher - order functions ?
Ca n't we keep it simple , just using variables and assignment command , for example ? ''
The problem of this idea is that eventually some kind of abstraction would be required , and adding them in ad - hoc language would be horrible .
In fact , Scheme may be one of the simplest form among the systems with the given abstraction capability .
7 Future
As the graphics hardware gets faster and the audiences ' expectation to the real - time interactive graphics gets higher , the amount and complexity of data the rendering engine has to deal with will ever increase .
It will be more important to push the point of fine - tuning toward the target platform , otherwise turn - around - time will be increased to the point being prohibitive for production to do enough iterations .
The cost of having full - featured scripting language inside the real - time rendering engine becomes smaller nowadays .
We expect it to be the mainstream .
With clever GC and supporting tools , Scheme can be a good choice for it .
We also believe the fusion of authoring and playback environment , not only in the consumer game production but also in the high - end computer graphics .
Such applications will be required to deal with complex structure , spread out among processors and changing dynamically at run time .
Lisp is still a good language for it .

The charging equipment .
Image : TechOn
( PhysOrg.com ) -- Toyota is developing a solar charging station for electric cars and plug - in hybrids , making a green technology even greener .
It has also designed a battery charger for mounting inside an electric vehicle or plug - in hybrid to recharge the storage batteries .
Toyota Industries Corporation 's announcement follows similar press releases in August by Nissan Motor Co Ltd and Showa Shell Sekiyu KK .
Toyota 's solar charging station will consist of solar cells capable of generating 100/ 200V of electricity .
The station includes storage batteries to store the electricity generated until it is required to recharge electric vehicles .
The station also has a communication facility to authenticate users ' identification information , and to communicate the amount of charge and other data to a remote data center .
The communication system is expected to use LANs and Mobile networks .
Earlier this year Toyota Industries unveiled a new public charging station for electric vehicles , which went on sale a few months ago at a cost of 450,000 Yen ( around 4,600USD ) .
Both the earlier public charging station and the new solar charging system were developed in collaboration with Nitto Kogyo Corporation .
A variety of charging station options is needed to address the potential range limitations of electric vehicles , and a significant network of charging stations will need to be deployed to make electric vehicles viable for longer distance travel .
Virtually all major car manufacturers are planning to launch electric or plug - in hybrid cars starting next year .
Charging stations for electric cars are gradually becoming more widespread .
In the UK the Department of Transport estimates there will be about two million electric vehicles by 2020 .
In the US , SolarCity and Rabbobank have created a partnership to provide free electric charging for electric vehicles traveling between San Francisco and Los Angeles along Highway 101 .
SolarCity has also bought SolSource Energy , which is in the business of installing charging stations for electric cars .
Toyota made the announcement and exhibited the charging station and battery charger at the 2009 Tokyo Motor Show being held from October 23 to November 4 , 2009 at Makuhari Messe , in Chiba City , Japan .
The solar charger is scheduled for release late next year or in 2011 at a price of several hundred thousand Yen .

LONDON ( Reuters Life ! ) - London luxury goods department store Harrods is moving into the precious metals market with the launch of a service to sell investment - grade gold bullion bars and coins to customers .
London luxury goods department store Harrods store is seen during a snow flurry in central London February 2 , 2009 .
Harrods is moving into the precious metals market with the launch of a service to sell investment - grade gold bullion bars and coins to customers .
REUTERS / Toby Melville / Files
Malcolm McLean , general manager of Harrods Bank , told Reuters on Thursday that the company saw a gap in the market for a well - known retailer to enter the increasingly high - profile gold market .
“ We have been very conscious of the fact that there has been an ever increasing amount of interest in the gold market , and in buying investment gold , ” he said .
“ We became very conscious that there is no well - recognised name out there which the general public can turn to and say , I know that name , I trust it , I want to buy from them . ”
“ That is not to say there are not reputable dealers out there -- we know there are , ” he said .
“ But they do n’t carry the brand that we do . ”
Since Monday , Harrods has been selling Swiss - sourced investment grade bars and coins including sovereigns , South African Krugerrands and American Eagles , from the Harrods Bank premises on London ’s upscale Brompton Road .
Harrods would not be drawn on the sales volumes seen by the store so far , but McLean said feedback for the service had been positive .
“ We are very much looking to the Harrods customer , and the customers of Harrods bank itself , ” said McLean .
“ But we are open to the general public . ”
RETAIL
Prices vary according to the spot price of gold , the amount of bullion ordered , and the type of product selected .
Internationally traded spot gold prices rose to a record high of $ 1,070.40 an ounce on Wednesday .
Around midday Thursday , a one - ounce Kruggerrand coin would have retailed at just under 740 pounds , around a 14 percent premium above the gold spot price at the time .
Premiums on gold investment products in Europe are typically between 5 - 20 percent , depending on the spot price , supply and demand conditions , and volumes .
The store offers a secure safety deposit service , with its smallest box available for 235 pounds a year and capable of holding the largest investment product Harrods offers : the 12.5 kg bar .
“ The customer can take the gold away with them if they wish , or can arrange for it to be delivered to wherever they choose , ” McLean said .
Investment in gold coins and bars rose sharply in late 2008 and early this year as the financial crisis boosted the appeal of physical gold as a safe store of value for consumers .
According to the World Gold Council , worldwide net retail investment in gold , which includes coin and bar buying , rose 22 percent in the first half of 2009 from the same period of the previous year to 301 tonnes .
Obama ogling girl ?
An average man devotes a good 43 minutes a day eyeing up to 10 different girls .
This translates to a year of an average man ’s lifetime , British researchers said .
As far as women are concerned , on average they eye up to six men for 20 minutes a day — or six months of their lives , reports the Sun .
Mark Ireland , of Kodak Lens Vision Centres , which carried out the poll , said : “ Men are renowned for looking at women but it ’s interesting to see just how long they spend doing it .
A year of your life is a long time to spend with your eyes fixed on the opposite sex ” .
The researchers assumed that a person ’s ogling life would be limited between the ages of 18 and 50 .
The poll of 3,000 Britons revealed that most people felt flattered at being gazed at , but 16 % of women said it made them uncomfortable , and 20 % said it embarrassed them .
Most women said it was a man ’s eyes that first drew their gaze .
With men , it was a girl ’s figure , the poll said .

RNC plan will no longer cover abortions
The Republican National Committee will no longer offer employees an insurance plan that covers abortion after POLITICO reported Thursday that the anti-abortion RNC 's policy has covered the procedure since 1991 .
" Money from our loyal donors should not be used for this purpose , " Chairman Michael Steele said in a statement to POLITICO .
" I do n't know why this policy existed in the past , but it will not exist under my administration .
Consider this issue settled . "

Steele has told the committee 's director of administration to opt out of coverage for elective abortion in the policy it uses from Cigna .

US builds “ coalition of like - minded nations ” against Iran
By Peter Symonds
10 October 2009
While the Obama administration is publicly backing continued international talks with Iran over its nuclear programs , preparations are continuing apace for the imposition of draconian new penalties should Tehran fail to meet US demands .
The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported on a high - level meeting in Washington on Wednesday involving what was informally described as a “ coalition of the like - minded nations ” to discuss the imposition of sanctions on Tehran — with or without UN Security Council agreement .
Obama has set December as the deadline for the conclusion of talks with Iran .
The gathering involved all G - 7 members — the US , Britain , France , Germany , Japan , Italy and Canada — as well as Saudi Arabia , the United Arab Emirates , Australia and South Korea .
Significantly , China and Russia were absent .
Both are permanent members of the UN Security Council and parties to the negotiations with Iran , but have been resistant to broad sanctions against Tehran .
The meeting at the Treasury Department headquarters was convened at the initiative of Stuart Levey , Treasury Undersecretary for the Office of Terrorism and Financial Intelligence .
Levey , a Bush administration official retained by Obama , has been centrally involved in the US campaign to bully international banks and financial institutions into cutting off relations with Iran .
No statement was issued from Wednesday ’s meeting .
The Wall Street Journal reported that eight areas of the Iranian economy were targetted , including refined petroleum projects , insurance and re-insurance companies , shipping and the banking sector .
In addition , new ways to sanction key Iranian leaders and their ability to travel internationally were discussed .
According to one diplomat , “ Everything is on the table . ”
The meeting recalls the Bush administration ’s notorious “ coalition of the willing ” that joined the criminal US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
While the gathering discussed economic penalties , it is obviously part of a broader US strategy to enlist close allies in any broader confrontation with Iran .
While presently downplaying military action , Obama has pointedly not ruled it out .
The US plans further meetings .
As the Wall Street Journal explained : “ US officials view the meeting as the first in a series of strategy sessions among the 11 countries on how to enact new financial penalties on Tehran should it rebuff international efforts to end its nuclear program diplomatically . ”
The US Congress is also preparing a battery of legislation designed to aggressively pressure foreign banks and corporations into imposing sanctions on Iran .
As the US itself has virtually no economic ties with Iran , the measures threaten to penalise companies that trade or invest in Iran by choking off access to the American economy .
At a meeting of the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday , the Democrat Chairman Christopher Dodd declared that he would move ahead with “ comprehensive sanctions legislation ” this month .
“ Our legislation will complement … and reinforce ongoing diplomatic efforts , and send a very , very , clear signal to Iran ’s leaders of what ’s in store if they continue to defy the will of the international community , ” he warned .
Broad options under consideration in the Senate committee include the cutting of US ties to foreign companies involved in supplying refined petroleum to Iran , the construction of oil and gas pipelines , and banking and financial transactions .
The legislation could also include a broad ban on imports from Iran .
Another measure proposed by Democrat Robert Casey and Republican Sam Brownback would seek to force state and local governments to divest from companies doing business with Iran .
Democrat Charles Schumer and Republican Lindsey Graham have introduced the Reduce Iranian Cyber - Suppression
Act to prohibit the US government from dealing with firms that export communications technology to Iran .
Dodd told the Senate committee that Tehran had to know that the US would not wait long and that Congress wanted action .
“ The fear here collectively is that the Iranian government is taking us to the cleaners on this issue . ”
In response , US Deputy Secretary of State James Steinberg , who testified at the session , underscored the Obama administration ’s preparedness for confrontation .
“ Our patience is not unlimited , ” he said , reiterating that “ nothing is off the table ” in dealing with Iran .
To reinforce the December deadline , the House of Representatives approved a defence authorisation bill on Thursday requiring the Obama administration to provide a formal assessment to Congress in January of negotiations with Iran .
The legislation , which is yet to be approved by the Senate , calls for new economic penalties on Iran should it refuse to “ accept the offer of the United States to engage in diplomatic talks ” and “ to suspend all enrichment - related and reprocessing activities ” .
The flurry of behind - the - scenes activity in the US Congress and internationally is another sign that the Obama administration intends to rapidly ratchet up the threats against Iran even as further negotiations between the P5+1 powers — the US , Britain , France , Russia , China and Germany — with Iran are slated later this month .
Prior to talks in Geneva on October 1 , Obama deliberately stoked tensions with a theatrical “ revelation ” at the G - 20 summit in Pittsburgh that Iran had a second , covert uranium enrichment plant near the city of Qom .
Tehran had notified the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) about the uncompleted facility four days previously .
Iran has subsequently reached an agreement with the IAEA to inspect the site on October 25 .
At the Geneva talks , Iran also offered to discuss a plan to ship the bulk of its current stock of low - enriched uranium to Russia then France for further enrichment and processing into fuel rods for its medical research reactor .
By exporting Iran ’s low enriched uranium , the proposal would reinforce Tehran ’s claim that it was not planning to build a bomb .
The scheme is due to be discussed in Vienna on October 19 .
None of this has halted the continuing campaign in the US and international media branding the Iranian regime as “ liars ” and “ cheats ” over its nuclear program .
The purpose of these denunciations is to create a climate of fear and distrust in a bid to stampede public opinion in the US and its allies behind an escalating confrontation with Iran and to bully countries that are wavering , or even opposed , into line .
In reality , the US is using Iran ’s nuclear programs as a convenient pretext for pursuing efforts to fashion a regime in Tehran more amenable to American economic and strategic ambitions in the region , particularly as it escalates the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
The constant aggravation of tensions in the Persian Gulf only serves US interests , by cutting across the existing economic relations of its rivals with Iran .
Earlier today , Atlantic blogger Megan McArdle argued that Stupak - Pitts is n't that bad , and it certainly is n't bad enough to derail health care reform over .
What 's scary is n't McArdle 's pragmatic position - it's the anti-choice dogma wrapped around her words .
Advertisement
McArdle seems to have a low opinion of the various opinions put forth against Stupak , writing :
Most of them seem to come from feminists who blithely assume away concerns about the personhood of the fetus , and the staunch political opposition to subsidized abortion from those who lean towards the " person " side .
This allows them to spend 1,000 words or so having a completely irrelevant discussion of the disparate effects of the Stupak amendment on poor women , arguing that women 's reproductive health care is too real health care , and similarly unrelated side points .
Memo to authors : you could prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that women's health care is important , that this has a hugely disparate impact on women , that it will result in more women carrying unplanned pregnancies to term , etc . . . and that still would n't make a majority of the country want to pay for other peoples ' abortions out of their tax dollars .
Advertisement
And once again , the majority of the country does n't want a lot of shit .
People did n't want to desegregate , or have their tax dollars fund schools and public services in minority areas .
I do n't want to pay for wars with my tax dollars .
But the government does n't work that way - did I miss the line - item veto form on my taxes ?
McArdle then busies herself misusing the 13 % statistic and making some really large assumptions :
The women who genuinely can't afford $ 500 bucks for an abortion are the women closest to the poverty line .
Those women will be covered by Medicare , and they wo n't get abortion coverage anyway in most states .
The women who will be buying insurance on the exchanges presumably mostly do not have health insurance now , and thus are losing nothing if their new insurance does n't cover abortions . [...]
Obviously , I am not saying that feminists should n't worry whether women will be denied access to abortion if this passes .
But the number of people who are going to lose access that they currently have , and therefore be forced to carry a pregnancy to term , is not likely to be all that large .
We 're mostly talking about a modest number of women who will have to hand over several hundred dollars that they would really rather spend elsewhere .
The very small number of women who currently have access to abortion services , and will lose them , and cannot get together a few hundred dollars for an abortion in time — those women can easily be taken care of if everyone who is outraged by this makes a small donation to Planned Parenthood .

Exactly , because that takes care of all the problems , shifting a public health issue onto the plates of private donors .
It also makes a huge assumption - that Planned Parenthood and other like - minded organizations are able to reach all the women impacted , particularly when one considers that it can be difficult to find access to these services outside of major urban areas .
A donation to Planned Parenthood wo n't do much good if the person in need of an abortion is more than 250 miles from the nearest provider .
In the new New York magazine , Jennifer Senior provides disheartening facts and figures about support for abortion .
While noting that even at the time of Roe vs.
Wade , the Supreme Court decision was against the popular majority , Senior points out that over the years , our nation has swung closer and closer to the anti-choice side of the pendulum .
More troubling appears to be the attitudes of the neo-lifers , which fall along these lines :
NARAL 's Nancy Keenan likes to say that abortion 's biggest defenders right now are a " menopausal militia " - a rueful , inspired little joke .
These baby - boomers , whose young adulthoods were defined by the fight over the right to choose , will soon be numerically overtaken by a generation of twentysomethings who is more pro-life than any but our senior citizens .
As GOP strategists Christopher Blunt and Fred Steeper have pointed out , this group came of age during the partial - birth debate and was the first to grow up with pictures of sonograms on their refrigerators .
The major development in reproductive technology during their lifetimes was n't something that prevented pregnancies but something that created them : IVF .
These kids have no idea - none - what it was like to live in a world without abortion rights .
( " This generation 's knowledge of Roe is like , ‘ Roe vs. what ? ' " says Keenan . )
And they feel much more strongly about personal responsibility than the generations preceding them :
Did n't use birth control ?
The burden 's on you .

These anti-choice narratives are changing how women view abortion - and leaving less and less room for stories like this one :
The woman is 28 years old and ten - and - a - half - weeks pregnant .
She wears false eyelashes , blue eyeliner , and a striped shirt of black and gray .
The condition is : I can sit in on her counseling session if I do not know her name .
" I can see that you are stressed , " starts Claire Keyes , her counselor .
" Yeah , " the woman responds .
" Always look stressed . "
Keyes was particularly interested in counseling this woman because of the constellation of adjectives she 'd checked off on her intake form : selfish , uncertain , guilty .
If you listened only to pro-life cant , you 'd think that women were unconflicted - cavalier , even - about their abortions , using them fungibly with birth control .
Keyes can tell you this is seldom the case , especially in such a Catholic city as Pittsburgh , and especially among African - Americans , like this woman , who on national surveys are less inclined than whites to identify themselves as pro-choice .
" I see you 're going to school , " says Keyes .
" Is it harder doing that or working ? " " Going to school . "
" Because … ? "
" Because I got to cram in homework ; sometimes I do n't do it , " says the woman .
" I got three kids : 13 , 11 , and 8 .
And I got to deal with them , and the household , and phone calls from school , ' cause they 're cutting out .
So it 's just like … a whole lot of … everything . "
She reaches for a tissue .
" Basically , I go to school , and as soon as I come home , I go straight to sleep . "
Not all abortion clinics drill down and do this kind of work .
But the Allegheny Reproductive Health Center in Pittsburgh , from which Keyes stepped down as director in January but still works as a counselor , has a national reputation for being psychologically oriented .
If there 's any place where the complexity and ambivalence surrounding abortion plays out , it 's here .
Keyes opens the woman 's folder .
" The first thing I saw in your chart , " she says , " is you 're not sure about your decision .
What do you want to tell me about that ? "
" I do n't know , " says the woman .
" In a sense , I got too much going on , and I can't afford to take on another child .
But in a sense , I feel pressure from my boyfriend , because he do n't want the kids … so it 's like , I want to .
I 'm not into the whole abortion thing .
I did it before " - twice , according to her chart , once last year at this very clinic - " and I really did n't like it .
I think some things happen for a reason . "
Advertisement
Worst still are how all of our discussions of " choice " and " life " can still be so woefully inadequate :
Keyes gestures toward the waiting room , where the patient 's boyfriend is sitting .
" Is he an important part of your life ? "
The woman hesitates .
" I guess .
For now . "
" He does n't have kids ? "
" He 's got kids .
He just do n't want any more . "
Keyes pauses .
" I do n't feel you in this decision , and that makes me sad . "
She thinks .
" If you had to name a percentage - pick a number - what percentage of your decision to be here today is yours ? "
The woman stares into space .
" Basically , 99 percent of it is him . "
She looks listlessly at Keyes .
" So . Get it done and over with . "
Keyes gently returns her look .
" We have a saying around here : We do n't do abortions for boyfriends . "
The woman is silent for several long , drawn - out seconds .
Then , she offers something .
" But see , that 's where it comes down to my percent .
I have three kids already .
So , he leaves , and now I have four children and no dads . "

Often , the default pro-choice discussions shy away from these moments , while anti-choicers relish them .
To some , this woman is exactly why the government should not assist anyone in paying for abortion .
Her story plays neatly into existing stereotypes about black women , promiscuity , and parental responsibility that seems pulled straight out of the pages of the Moyinahan report .
And yet , this woman 's story is true , and it is one of the many different circumstances that lead to why women seek abortions in the first place .
What generally is n't applied to this type of analysis is a look at the larger factors surrounding choice .
Race and racism loom large in various aspects of the debate , but are rarely discussed .
African American children are disproportionately placed in the foster care system , and it is often difficult to find these children homes - the GAO even commissioned a study in 2007 to analyze the problem and propose solutions .
Poorer women are already banned from receiving abortion coverage , but this is not a fight that has been taken up .
Many mainstream feminist organizations are just concerned with maintaining what American women have , and lack the resources and support to push for more equality .

This may be partially an issue of our own making .
As Kimala Price writes in Homegirls Make Some Noise :
From the 1980s to the present , women of color have continued this activist legacy in reproductive rights and justice .
In the late 1980s , a group of thirty - five prominent African - American women , including political activists and members of Congress , issued the statement " We Remember . "
The statement connected reproductive health with other issues such as economic and social justice issues :
We understand why African American women risked their lives then , and why they seek safe legal abortion now .
It 's been a matter of survival .
Hunger and homelessness .
Inadequate housing and income to properly provide for themselves and their children .
Family instability .
Rape .
Incest .
Abuse .
Too young , too old , too sick , too tired .
Emotional , physical , mental , economic , social – the reason for not carrying a pregnancy to term are endless and varied , personal , urgent and private .
And for all these pressing reasons , African American women once again will be among the first forced to risk their lives if abortion is made illegal ( African American Women Are for Reproductive Freedom 1999 , p. 39 )
This re-articulation is in light of the U.S. government 's ugly history of determining who can and cannot be mothers , who has the right to bear and raise children , through coercive policies .
In the past , the federal government had sterilization campaigns targeting African America , Puerto Rican , Mexican American and Native American women .
Today it uses more insidious ways of accomplishing the same end , such as family cap policies in the " reformed " welfare system in which mothers may lose benefits if the number of children they bear exceeds the limit set by state governments .
Thanks to the 1976 Hyde Amendment , which banned federal funding of abortions , most state Medicaid programs will not cover abortions , and women who serve in our nation 's armed forces cannot obtain abortions on military bases or through the military 's health plan .
Women in federal prisons and most state prisons do n't have access to abortions as well .
The problem has been that the mainstream reproductive rights movement has not paid that much attention to these and other related issues .
Out of their frustration with this , women of color activists are busy building our own movement . [...]
Drawing from human rights and social justice principles , women of color activists have re-defined " reproductive rights " into what they now call " reproductive justice . "
Reproductive justice is not just about the individualistic right to have an abortion ( i.e. , the right not to have children ) but to include the right to have children and to raise them in healthy and stable families .
Accordingly , these activists have broadened reproductive rights and freedom beyond abortion rights , the rights to privacy and " choice " which are normally associated with the movement .
In sum , reproductive justice encompasses many other issues such as economic justice , immigration rights , housing rights , and access to health care .

This is the reason that Stupak - Pitts has become an important dividing line for the pro-choice movement .
The amendment is horrid enough on its own - however , as a symbol , it continues to show the quiet erosion of women 's right to choose and a painful reminder of all that progressives have failed to accomplish .
Interested in helping to Stop Stupak and expressing support for the right to choose ?
There are events scheduled this week that you may be interested in .
There is a National Day of Action ( that 's this Wednesday , December 2 ) where coalitions from different Reproductive Rights Organizations will lobby their congresspeople as well as rally .
Supporters are welcome , and Planned Parenthood is asking for people to RSVP .
NOW has more details on the basic schedule for the day .
There are also rallies planned in Illinois ( Dec. 2 ) and New York ( December 4 ) with more details here .

It is completely legal to photograph the Los Angeles Metro System .
Be sure to Digg the video here , leave a comment on YouTube , and submit the story to boingboing .
On October 31 , 2009 while on my way home from the Hollywood and Highland area , I was unlawfully detained for 25 minutes by LASD Officers Richard Gylfie # 2955 and Bayes # 456 for taking two photographs of the turnstiles located at the Hollywood and Western Metro Station — an act that is completely legal and occurred in public space .
As you can see in the video ( which can be viewed on YouTube , Vimeo , Liveleak , Flickr and discarted.com ) , Officer Gylfie # 2955 and Officer Bayes # 456 took it upon themselves to ignore established law and Metro policies in order to bully me , humiliate me , and detain me for conducting a perfectly legal activity in public .
More important , by illegally detaining me , Officers Gylfie and Bayes violated my constitutional rights , which protect me as a photographer and against unlawful stops , searches , and seizures .

Getting a flu shot this fall ?
Canadians scientists have found that focusing on a pretty image could alleviate the sting of that vaccine .
According to a new Université de Montréal study , published in the latest edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) , negative and positive emotions have a direct impact on pain .
" Emotions -- or mood -- can alter how we react to pain since they 're interlinked , " says lead author Mathieu Roy , who completed the study as a Université de Montréal PhD student and is now a post - doctoral fellow at Columbia University .
" Our tests revealed when pain is perceived by our brain and how that pain can be amplified when combined with negative emotions . "
As part of the study , 13 subjects were recruited to undergo small yet painful electric shocks , which caused knee - jerk reactions controlled by the spine that could be measured .
During the fMRI process , subjects were shown a succession of images that were either pleasant ( i.e. summer water - skiing ) , unpleasant ( i.e. a vicious bear ) or neutral ( i.e. a book ) .
Brain reaction was simultaneously measured in participants through functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) .
The fMRI readings allowed the scientists to divide emotion - related brain activity from pain - related reactions .
" We found that seeing unpleasant pictures elicited stronger pain in subjects getting shocks than looking at pleasant pictures , " says Dr. Roy .
The discovery provides scientific evidence that pain is governed by mood and builds on Dr. Roy 's previous studies that showed how pleasant music could decrease aches .
" Our findings show that non-pharmaceutical interventions -- mood enhancers such as photography or music -- could be used in the healthcare to help alleviate pain .
These interventions would be inexpensive and adaptable to several fields , " he stresses .
The study was authored by Mathieu Roy , Piché , Mathieu , Chen , Jen -I , Isabelle Peretz and Pierre Rainville of the Université de Montréal .
Support was provided by the Fonds de recherche en santé du Québec , the Natural Science and Engineering Research Council of Canada and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research .
Hours after guiding the New York Yankees to a World Series championship , manager Joe Girardi stopped along a suburban parkway on his way home to help a woman whose car had crashed into a wall , The ( Westchester ) Journal News reported .
Early Thursday morning , Westchester County police officer Kathleen Cristiano congratulated Girardi on the World Series win as he passed through a drunken - driving enforcement checkpoint , according to the newspaper .
Yankees left - hander Andy Pettitte , who had started in the Series clincher , had passed through the same checkpoint earlier , she said .
About 15 minutes later , Cristiano was among the first responders to a one - car accident on the Cross County Parkway in Eastchester .
She was surprised to again see Girardi , this time trying to flag down assistance , according to the report .
PARIS  Europe should take the opportunity of a new Afghan administration to coordinate its policies on Afghanistan and not wait for Washington to make all the decisions , the French foreign minister , Bernard Kouchner , said on Wednesday .
“ We need to speak as Europe to the Americans ” on Afghanistan , he said , and end the differences in policy and military rules on the ground , where the Germans fight only if fired upon and each member of NATO has different rules of engagement .
“ In Europe we are acting and fighting and going to war , but we are not talking to one another , and it ’s shameful , ” he said .
“ We have to be together and improve the command structure , ” he said .
Asked if the NATO alliance was not working very well in Afghanistan , he said : “ It ’s not working at all . ”
“ What is the goal ?
What is the road ?
And in the name of what ? ” Mr. Kouchner asked .
He said he appreciated President Obama ’s deliberations on a new Afghan strategy , but asked : “ Where are the Americans ?
It begins to be a problem . ”
He added : “ We need to talk to one another as allies . ”

" An Image of Africa : Racism in Conrad 's ' Heart of Darkness ' " Massachusetts Review .
18 . 1977 . Rpt. in Heart of Darkness , An Authoritative Text , background and Sources Criticism .
1961 . 3rd ed. Ed. Robert Kimbrough , London : W. W Norton and Co. , 1988 , pp.251-261
In the fall of 1974 I was walking one day from the English Department at the University of Massachusetts to a parking lot .
It was a fine autumn morning such as encouraged friendliness to passing strangers .
Brisk youngsters were hurrying in all directions , many of them obviously freshmen in their first flush of enthusiasm .
An older man going the same way as I turned and remarked to me how very young they came these days .
I agreed .
Then he asked me if I was a student too .
I said no , I was a teacher .
What did I teach ?
African literature .
Now that was funny , he said , because he knew a fellow who taught the same thing , or perhaps it was African history , in a certain Community College not far from here .
It always surprised him , he went on to say , because he never had thought of Africa as having that kind of stuff , you know .
By this time I was walking much faster .
" Oh well , " I heard him say finally , behind me : " I guess I have to take your course to find out . "
A few weeks later I received two very touching letters from high school children in Yonkers , New York , who -- bless their teacher -- had just read Things Fall Apart .
One of them was particularly happy to learn about the customs and superstitions of an African tribe .
I propose to draw from these rather trivial encounters rather heavy conclusions which at first sight might seem somewhat out of proportion to them .
But only , I hope , at first sight .
The young fellow from Yonkers , perhaps partly on account of his age but I believe also for much deeper and more serious reasons , is obviously unaware that the life of his own tribesmen in Yonkers , New York , is full of odd customs and superstitions and , like everybody else in his culture , imagines that he needs a trip to Africa to encounter those things .
The other person being fully my own age could not be excused on the grounds of his years .
Ignorance might be a more likely reason ; but here again I believe that something more willful than a mere lack of information was at work .
For did not that erudite British historian and Regius Professor at Oxford , Hugh Trevor Roper , also pronounce that African history did not exist ?
If there is something in these utterances more than youthful inexperience , more than a lack of factual knowledge , what is it ?
Quite simply it is the desire -- one might indeed say the need -- in Western psychology to set Africa up as a foil to Europe , as a place of negations at once remote and vaguely familiar , in comparison with which Europe 's own state of spiritual grace will be manifest .
This need is not new ; which should relieve us all of considerable responsibility and perhaps make us even willing to look at this phenomenon dispassionately .
I have neither the wish nor the competence to embark on the exercise with the tools of the social and biological sciences but more simply in the manner of a novelist responding to one famous book of European fiction : Joseph Conrad 's Heart of Darkness , which better than any other work that I know displays that Western desire and need which I have just referred to .
Of course there are whole libraries of books devoted to the same purpose but most of them are so obvious and so crude that few people worry about them today .
Conrad , on the other hand , is undoubtedly one of the great stylists of modern fiction and a good storyteller into the bargain .
His contribution therefore falls automatically into a different class -- permanent literature -- read and taught and constantly evaluated by serious academics .
Heart of Darkness is indeed so secure today that a leading Conrad scholar has numbered it " among the half - dozen greatest short novels in the English language . "
I will return to this critical opinion in due course because it may seriously modify my earlier suppositions about who may or may not be guilty in some of the matters I will now raise .
Heart of Darkness projects the image of Africa as " the other world , " the antithesis of Europe and therefore of civilization , a place where man 's vaunted intelligence and refinement are finally mocked by triumphant beastiality .
The book opens on the River Thames , tranquil , resting , peacefully " at the decline of day after ages of good service done to the race that peopled its banks . "
But the actual story will take place on the River Congo , the very antithesis of the Thames .
The River Congo is quite decidedly not a River Emeritus .
It has rendered no service and enjoys no old - age pension .
We are told that " Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world . "
Is Conrad saying then that these two rivers are very different , one good , the other bad ?
Yes , but that is not the real point .
It is not the differentness that worries Conrad but the lurking hint of kinship , of common ancestry .
For the Thames too " has been one of the dark places of the earth . "
It conquered its darkness , of course , and is now in daylight and at peace .
But if it were to visit its primordial relative , the Congo , it would run the terrible risk of hearing grotesque echoes of its own forgotten darkness , and falling victim to an avenging recrudescence of the mindless frenzy of the first beginnings .
These suggestive echoes comprise Conrad 's famed evocation of the African atmosphere in Heart of Darkness .
In the final consideration his method amounts to no more than a steady , ponderous , fake - ritualistic repetition of two antithetical sentences , one about silence and the other about frenzy .
We can inspect samples of this on pages 36 and 37 of the present edition : a ) it was the stillness of an implacable force brooding over an inscrutable intention and b)
The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy .
Of course there is a judicious change of adjective from time to time , so that instead of inscrutable , for example , you might have unspeakable , even plain mysterious , etc. , etc .
The eagle - eyed English critic F. R. Leavis drew attention long ago to Conrad 's " adjectival insistence upon inexpressible and incomprehensible mystery . "
That insistence must not be dismissed lightly , as many Conrad critics have tended to do , as a mere stylistic flaw ; for it raises serious questions of artistic good faith .
When a writer while pretending to record scenes , incidents and their impact is in reality engaged in inducing hypnotic stupor in his readers through a bombardment of emotive words and other forms of trickery much more has to be at stake than stylistic felicity .
Generally normal readers are well armed to detect and resist such under - hand activity .
But Conrad chose his subject well -- one which was guaranteed not to put him in conflict with the psychological predisposition of his readers or raise the need for him to contend with their resistance .
He chose the role of purveyor of comforting myths .
The most interesting and revealing passages in Heart of Darkness are , however , about people .
I must crave the indulgence of my reader to quote almost a whole page from about the middle of the stop / when representatives of Europe in a steamer going down the Congo encounter the denizens of Africa .
We were wanderers on a prehistoric earth , on an earth that wore the aspect of an unknown planet .
We could have fancied ourselves the first of men taking possession of an accursed inheritance , to be subdued at the cost of profound anguish and of excessive toil .
But suddenly as we struggled round a bend there would be a glimpse of rush walls , of peaked grass - roofs , a burst of yells , a whirl of black limbs , a mass of hands clapping , of feet stamping , of bodies swaying , of eyes rolling under the droop of heavy and motionless foliage .
The steamer toiled along slowly on the edge of a black and incomprehensible frenzy .
The prehistoric man was cursing us , praying to us , welcoming us -- who could tell ?
We were cut off from the comprehension of our surroundings ; we glided past like phantoms , wondering and secretly appalled , as sane men would be before an enthusiastic outbreak in a madhouse .
We could not understand because we were too far and could not remember , because we were traveling in the night of first ages , of those ages that are gone , leaving hardly a sign -- and no memories .
The earth seemed unearthly .
We are accustomed to look upon the shackled form of a conquered monster , but there -- there you could look at a thing monstrous and free .
It was unearthly and the men were ....
No they were not inhuman .
Well , you know that was the worst of it -- this suspicion of their not being inhuman .
It would come slowly to one .
They howled and leaped and spun and made horrid faces , but what thrilled you , was just the thought of their humanity -- like yours -- the thought of your remote kinship with this wild and passionate uproar .
Ugly .
Yes , it was ugly enough , but if you were man enough you would admit to yourself that there was in you just the faintest trace of a response to the terrible frankness of that noise , a dim suspicion of there being a meaning in it which you -- you so remote from the night of first ages -- could comprehend .
Herein lies the meaning of Heart of Darkness and the fascination it holds over the Western mind : " What thrilled you was just the thought of their humanity -- like yours .... Ugly . "
Having shown us Africa in the mass , Conrad then zeros in , half a page later , on a specific example , giving us one of his rare descriptions of an African who is not just limbs or rolling eyes :
And between whiles I had to look after the savage who was fireman .
He was an improved specimen ; he could fire up a vertical boiler .
He was there below me and , upon my word , to look at him was as edifying as seeing a dog in a parody of breeches and a feather hat walking on his hind legs .
A few months of training had done for that really fine chap .
He squinted at the steam - gauge and at the water - gauge with an evident effort of intrepidity -- and he had filed his teeth too , the poor devil , and the wool of his pate shaved into queer patterns , and three ornamental scars on each of his cheeks .
He ought to have been clapping his hands and stamping his feet on the bank , instead of which he was hard at work , a thrall to strange witchcraft , full of improving knowledge .
As everybody knows , Conrad is a romantic on the side .
He might not exactly admire savages clapping their hands and stamping their feet but they have at least the merit of being in their place , unlike this dog in a parody of breeches .
For Conrad things being in their place is of the utmost importance .
" Fine fellows -- cannibals -- in their place , " he tells us pointedly .
Tragedy begins when things leave their accustomed place , like Europe leaving its safe stronghold between the policeman and the baker to like a peep into the heart of darkness .
Before the story likes us into the Congo basin proper we are given this nice little vignette as an example of things in their place :
Now and then a boat from the shore gave one a momentary contact with reality .
It was paddled by black fellows .
You could see from afar the white of their eyeballs glistening .
They shouted , sang ; their bodies streamed with perspiration ; they had faces like grotesque masks -- these chaps ; but they had bone , muscle , a wild vitality , an intense energy of movement that was as natural and hue as the surf along their coast .
They wanted no excuse for being there .
They were a great comfort to look at .
Towards the end of the story Conrad lavishes a whole page quite unexpectedly on an African woman who has obviously been some kind of mistress to Mr. Kurtz and now presides ( if I may be permitted a little liberty ) like a formidable mystery over the inexorable imminence of his departure :
She was savage and superb , wild - eyed and magnificent .... She stood looking at us without a stir and like the wilderness itself , with an air of brooding over an inscrutable purpose .
This Amazon is drawn in considerable detail , albeit of a predictable nature , for two reasons .
First , she is in her place and so can win Conrad 's special brand of approval and second , she fulfills a structural requirement of the story : a savage counterpart to the refined , European woman who will step forth to end the story :
She came forward all in black with a pale head , floating toward me in the dusk .
She was in mourning ....
She took both my hands in hers and murmured , " I had heard you were coming . " ...
She had a mature capacity for fidelity , for belief , for suffering .
The difference in the attitude of the novelist to these two women is conveyed in too many direct and subfile ways to need elaboration .
But perhaps the most significant difference is the one implied in the author 's bestowal of human expression to the one and the withholding of it from the other .
It is clearly not part of Conrad 's purpose to confer language on the " rudimentary souls " of Africa .
In place of speech they made " a violent babble of uncouth sounds . "
They " exchanged short grunting phrases " even among themselves .
But most of the time they were too busy with their frenzy .
There are two occasions in the book , however , when Conrad departs somewhat from his practice and confers speech , even English speech , on the savages .
The first occurs when cannibalism gets the better of them :
" Catch 'im , " he snapped with a bloodshot widening of his eyes and a flash of sharp teeth -- " catch 'im .
Give ' im to us . "
" To you , eh ? " I asked ; " what would you do with them ?
" Eat 'im ! " he said curtly .
. . .
The other occasion was the famous announcement : " Mistah Kurtz -- he dead . "
At first sight these instances might be mistaken for unexpected acts of generosity from Conrad .
In reality they constitute some of his best assaults .
In the case of the cannibals the incomprehensible grunts that had thus far served them for speech suddenly proved inadequate for Conrad 's purpose of letting the European glimpse the unspeakable craving in their hearts .
Weighing the necessity for consistency in the portrayal of the dumb brutes against the sensational advantages of securing their conviction by clear , unambiguous evidence issuing out of their own mouth Conrad chose the latter .
As for the announcement of Mr. Kurtz 's death by the " insolent black head in the doorway " what better or more appropriate finis could be written to the horror story of that wayward child of civilization who willfully had given his soul to the powers of darkness and " taken a high seat amongst the devils of the land " than the proclamation of his physical death by the forces he had joined ?
It might be contended , of course , that the attitude to the African in Heart of Darkness is not Conrad 's but that of his fictional narrator , Marlow , and that far from endorsing it Conrad might indeed be holding it up to irony and criticism .
Certainly Conrad appears to go to considerable pains to set up layers of insulation between himself and the moral universe of his history .
He has , for example , a narrator behind a narrator .
The primary narrator is Marlow but his account is given to us through the filter of a second , shadowy person .
But if Conrad 's intention is to draw a cordon sanitaire between himself and the moral and psychological malaise of his narrator his care seems to me totally wasted because he neglects to hint however subtly or tentatively at an alternative frame of reference by which we may judge the actions and opinions of his characters .
It would not have been beyond Conrad 's power to make that provision if he had thought it necessary .
Marlow seems to me to enjoy Conrad 's complete confidence -- a feeling reinforced by the close similarities between their two careers .
Marlow comes through to us not only as a witness of truth , but one holding those advanced and humane views appropriate to the English liberal tradition which required all Englishmen of decency to be deeply shocked by atrocities in Bulgaria or the Congo of King Leopold of the Belgians or wherever .
Thus Marlow is able to toss out such bleeding - heart sentiments as these :
They were dying slowly -- it was very clear .
They were not enemies , they were not criminals , they were nothing earthly now , nothing but black shadows of disease and starvation lying confusedly in the greenish gloom .
Brought from all the recesses of the coast in all the legality of time contracts , lost in uncongenial surroundings , fed on unfamiliar food , they sickened , became inefficient , and were then allowed to crawl away and rest .
The kind of liberalism espoused here by Marlow / Conrad touched all the best minds of the age in England , Europe and America .
It took different forms in the minds of different people but almost always managed to sidestep the ultimate question of equality between white people and black people .
That extraordinary missionary , Albert Schweitzer , who sacrificed brilliant careers in music and theology in Europe for a life of service to Africans in much the same area as Conrad writes about , epitomizes the ambivalence .
In a comment which has often been quoted Schweitzer says : " The African is indeed my brother but my junior brother . "
And so he proceeded to build a hospital appropriate to the needs of junior brothers with standards of hygiene reminiscent of medical practice in the days before the germ theory of disease came into being .
Naturally he became a sensation in Europe and America .
Pilgrims flocked , and I believe still flock even after he has passed on , to witness the prodigious miracle in Lamberene , on the edge of the primeval forest .
Conrad 's liberalism would not take him quite as far as Schweitzer 's , though .
He would not use the word brother however qualified ; the farthest he would go was kinship .
When Marlow 's African helmsman falls down with a spear in his heart he gives his white master one final disquieting look .
And the intimate profundity of that look he gave me when he received his hurt remains to this day in my memory -- like a claim of distant kinship affirmed in a supreme moment .
It is important to note that Conrad , careful as ever with his words , is concerned not so much about distant kinship as about someone laying a claim on it .
The black man lays a claim on the white man which is well - nigh intolerable .
It is the laying of this claim which frightens and at the same time fascinates Conrad , " ... the thought of their humanity -- like yours .... Ugly . "
The point of my observations should be quite clear by now , namely that Joseph Conrad was a thoroughgoing racist .
That this simple truth is glossed over in criticisms of his work is due to the fact that white racism against Africa is such a normal way of thinking that its manifestations go completely unremarked .
Students of Heart of Darkness will often tell you that Conrad is concerned not so much with Africa as with the deterioration of one European mind caused by solitude and sickness .
They will point out to you that Conrad is , if anything , less charitable to the Europeans in the story than he is to the natives , that the point of the story is to ridicule Europe 's civilizing mission in Africa .
A Conrad student informed me in Scotland that Africa is merely a setting for the disintegration of the mind of Mr. Kurtz .
Which is partly the point .
Africa as setting and backdrop which eliminates the African as human factor .
Africa as a metaphysical battlefield devoid of all recognizable humanity , into which the wandering European enters at his peril .
Can nobody see the preposterous and perverse arrogance in thus reducing Africa to the role of props for the break - up of one petty European mind ?
But that is not even the point .
The real question is the dehumanization of Africa and Africans which this age - long attitude has fostered and continues to foster in the world .
And the question is whether a novel which celebrates this dehumanization , which depersonalizes a portion of the human race , can be called a great work of art .
My answer is : No , it cannot .
I do not doubt Conrad 's great talents .
Even Heart of Darkness has its memorably good passages and moments :
The reaches opened before us and closed behind , as if the forest had stepped leisurely across tile water to bar the way for our return .
Its exploration of the minds of the European characters is often penetrating and full of insight .
But all that has been more than fully discussed in the last fifty years .
His obvious racism has , however , not been addressed .
And it is high time it was !
Conrad was born in 1857 , the very year in which the first Anglican missionaries were arriving among my own people in Nigeria .
It was certainly not his fault that he lived his life at a time when the reputation of the black man was at a particularly low level .
But even after due allowances have been made for all the influences of contemporary prejudice on his sensibility there remains still in Conrad 's attitude a residue of antipathy to black people which his peculiar psychology alone can explain .
His own account of his first encounter with a black man is very revealing :
A certain enormous buck nigger encountered in Haiti fixed my conception of blind , furious , unreasoning rage , as manifested in the human animal to the end of my days .
Of the nigger I used to dream for years afterwards .
Certainly Conrad had a problem with niggers .
His inordinate love of that word itself should be of interest to psychoanalysts .
Sometimes his fixation on blackness is equally interesting as when he gives us this brief description :
A black figure stood up , strode on long black legs , waving long black arms .
. . .
as though we might expect a black figure striding along on black legs to wave white arms !
But so unrelenting is Conrad 's obsession .
As a matter of interest Conrad gives us in A Personal Record what amounts to a companion piece to the buck nigger of Haiti .
At the age of sixteen Conrad encountered his first Englishman in Europe .
He calls him " my unforgettable Englishman " and describes him in the following manner :
" ( his ) calves exposed to the public gaze . . . dazzled the beholder by the splendor of their marble - like condition and their rich tone of young ivory .
. . .
The light of a headlong , exalted satisfaction with the world of men . . . illumined his face .
. . and triumphant eyes .
In passing he cast a glance of kindly curiosity and a friendly gleam of big , sound , shiny teeth .
. . his white calves twinkled sturdily . "
Irrational love and irrational hate jostling together in the heart of that talented , tormented man .
But whereas irrational love may at worst engender foolish acts of indiscretion , irrational hate can endanger the life of the community .
Naturally Conrad is a dream for psychoanalytic critics .
Perhaps the most detailed study of him in this direction is by Bernard C. Meyer , M.D. In his lengthy book Dr. Meyer follows every conceivable lead ( and sometimes inconceivable ones ) to explain Conrad .
As an example he gives us long disquisitions on the significance of hair and hair - cutting in Conrad .
And yet not even one word is spared for his attitude to black people .
Not even the discussion of Conrad 's antisemitism was enough to spark off in Dr. Meyer 's mind those other dark and explosive thoughts .
Which only leads one to surmise that Western psychoanalysts must regard the kind of racism displayed by Conrad absolutely normal despite the profoundly important work done by Frantz Fanon in the psychiatric hospitals of French Algeria .
Whatever Conrad 's problems were , you might say he is now safely dead .
Quite true .
Unfortunately his heart of darkness plagues us still .
Which is why an offensive and deplorable book can be described by a serious scholar as " among the half dozen greatest short novels in the English language . "
And why it is today the most commonly prescribed novel in twentieth - century literature courses in English Departments of American universities .
There are two probable grounds on which what I have aid so far may be contested .
The first is that it is no concern of fiction to please people about whom it is written .
I will go along with that .
But I am not talking about pleasing people .
I am talking about a book which parades in the most vulgar fashion prejudices and insults from which a section of mankind has suffered untold agonies and atrocities in the past and continues to do so in many ways and many places today .
I am talking about a story in which the very humanity of black people is called in question .
Secondly , I may be challenged on the grounds of actuality .
Conrad , after all , did sail down the Congo in 1890 when my own father was still a babe in arms .
How could I stand up more than fifty years after his death and purport to contradict him ?
My answer is that as a sensible man I will not accept just any traveler 's tales solely on the grounds that I have not made the journey myself .
I will not trust the evidence even off man 's very eyes when I suspect them to be as jaundiced as Conrad's .
And we also happen to know that Conrad was , in the words of his biographer , Bernard C. Meyer , " notoriously inaccurate in the rendering of his own history . "
But more important by far is the abundant testimony about Conrad 's savages which we could gather if we were so inclined from other sources and which might lead us to think that these people must have had other occupations besides merging into the evil forest or materializing out of it simply to plague Marlow and his dispirited band .
For as it happened , soon after Conrad had written his book an event of far greater consequence was taking place in the art world of Europe .
This is how Frank Willett , a British art historian , describes it :
Gaugin had gone to Tahiti , the most extravagant individual act of turning to a non-European culture in the decades immediately before and after 1900 , when European artists were avid for new artistic experiences , but it was only about 1904 - 5 that African art began to make its distinctive impact .
One piece is still identifiable ; it is a mask that had been given to Maurice Vlaminck in 1905 .
He records that Derain was ' speechless ' and ' stunned ' when he saw it , bought it from Vlaminck and in turn showed it to Picasso and Matisse , who were also greatly affected by it .
Ambroise Vollard then borrowed it and had it cast in bronze .
. .
The revolution of twentieth century art was under way !
The mask in question was made by other savages living just north of Conrad 's River Congo .
They have a name too : the Fang people , and are without a doubt among the world 's greatest masters of the sculptured form .
The event Frank Willett is referring to marks the beginning of cubism and the infusion of new life into European art , which had run completely out of strength .
The point of all this is to suggest that Conrad 's picture of the people of the Congo seems grossly inadequate even at the height of their subjection to the ravages of King Leopold 's lnternational Association for the Civilization of Central Africa .
Travelers with closed minds can tell us little except about themselves .
But even those not blinkered , like Conrad with xenophobia , can be astonishing blind .
Let me digress a little here .
One of the greatest and most intrepid travelers of all time , Marco Polo , journeyed to the Far East from the Mediterranean in the thirteenth century and spent twenty years in the court of Kublai Khan in China .
On his return to Venice he set down in his book entitled Description of the World his impressions of the peoples and places and customs he had seen .
But there were at least two extraordinary omissions in his account .
He said nothing about the art of printing , unknown as yet in Europe but in full flower in China .
He either did not notice it at all or if he did , failed to see what use Europe could possibly have for it .
Whatever the reason , Europe had to wait another hundred years for Gutenberg .
But even more spectacular was Marco Polo 's omission of any reference to the Great Wall of China nearly 4,000 miles long and already more than 1,000 years old at the time of his visit .
Again , he may not have seen it ; but the Great Wall of China is the only structure built by man which is visible from the moon !
Indeed travelers can be blind .
As I said earlier Conrad did not originate the image of Africa which we find in his book .
It was and is the dominant image of Africa in the Western imagination and Conrad merely brought the peculiar gifts of his own mind to bear on it .
For reasons which can certainly use close psychological inquiry the West seems to suffer deep anxieties about the precariousness of its civilization and to have a need for constant reassurance by comparison with Africa .
If Europe , advancing in civilization , could cast a backward glance periodically at Africa trapped in primordial barbarity it could say with faith and feeling :
There go I but for the grace of God.
Africa is to Europe as the picture is to Dorian Gray -- a carrier onto whom the master unloads his physical and moral deformities so that he may go forward , erect and immaculate .
Consequently Africa is something to be avoided just as the picture has to be hidden away to safeguard the man 's jeopardous integrity .
Keep away from Africa , or else !
Mr. Kurtz of Heart of Darkness should have heeded that warning and the prowling horror in his heart would have kept its place , chained to its lair .
But he foolishly exposed himself to the wild irresistible allure of the jungle and lo !
the darkness found him out .
In my original conception of this essay I had thought to conclude it nicely on an appropriately positive note in which I would suggest from my privileged position in African and Western cultures some advantages the West might derive from Africa once it rid its mind of old prejudices and began to look at Africa not through a haze of distortions and cheap mystifications but quite simply as a continent of people -- not angels , but not rudimentary souls either -- just people , often highly gifted people and often strikingly successful in their enterprise with life and society .
But as I thought more about the stereotype image , about its grip and pervasiveness , about the willful tenacity with which the West holds it to its heart ; when I thought of the West 's television and cinema and newspapers , about books read in its schools and out of school , of churches preaching to empty pews about the need to send help to the heathen in Africa , I realized that no easy optimism was possible .
And there was , in any case , something totally wrong in offering bribes to the West in return for its good opinion of Africa .
Ultimately the abandonment of unwholesome thoughts must be its own and only reward .
Although I have used the word willful a few times here to characterize the West 's view of Africa , it may well be that what is happening at this stage is more akin to reflex action than calculated malice .
Which does not make the situation more but less hopeful .
The Christian Science Monitor , a paper more enlightened than most , once carried an interesting article written by its Education Editor on the serious psychological and learning problems faced by little children who speak one language at home and then go to school where something else is spoken .
It was a wide - ranging article taking in Spanish - speaking children in America , the children of migrant Italian workers in Germany , the quadrilingual phenomenon in Malaysia , and so on .
And all this while the article speaks unequivocally about language .
But then out of the blue sky comes this :
In London there is an enormous immigration of children who speak Indian or Nigerian dialects , or some other native language .
I believe that the introduction of dialects which is technically erroneous in the context is almost a reflex action caused by an instinctive desire of the writer to downgrade the discussion to the level of Africa and India .
And this is quite comparable to Conrad 's withholding of language from his rudimentary souls .
Language is too grand for these chaps ; let 's give them dialects !
In all this business a lot of violence is inevitably done not only to the image of despised peoples but even to words , the very tools of possible redress .
Look at the phrase native language in the Science Monitor excerpt .
Surely the only native language possible in London is Cockney English .
But our writer means something else -- something appropriate to the sounds Indians and Africans make !
Although the work of redressing which needs to be done may appear too daunting , I believe it is not one day too soon to begin .
Conrad saw and condemned the evil of imperial exploitation but was strangely unaware of the racism on which it sharpened its iron tooth .
But the victims of racist slander who for centuries have had to live with the inhumanity it makes them heir to have always known better than any casual visitor even when he comes loaded with the gifts of a Conrad .
KEVIN RUDD ’s Big Idea is for an “ Asia - Pacific Community ” ( APC ) .
Australia ’s prime minister argues that as the centre of gravity of the world economy moves from the Atlantic to the Pacific , so the Asia - Pacific region needs the institutional structures to handle the economic and strategic implications of this shift .
It is hard to know whether to admire Mr Rudd more for his big idea or for his dogged grit in sticking with it in the face of a decidedly iffy reception around the region .
Mr Rudd now claims progress , thanks in part to the tireless efforts of his special envoy , Dick Woolcott , a well - regarded diplomat .
Though it has not been announced , in early December Mr Rudd intends to convene a conference in Sydney at which he hopes that politicians and opinion leaders from 21 Asian countries will start to put flesh on the APC 's bones .
Though in public Mr Rudd does not put it so bluntly , probably the chief rationale of an APC is to handle China 's rise , while keeping the United States engaged in the region .
So it will be interesting to observe China 's commitment to the conference .
You see , the Dalai Lama intends to be in Sydney at exactly the same time .
CAIRO  Iranian officials have sentenced to death three protesters who participated in demonstrations following the nation ’s disputed presidential election in June , according to ISNA , Iran ’s semiofficial news agency .
The news service quoted an unnamed spokesman for the Tehran prosecutor ’s office saying that the three were sentenced to be hanged and that they had been part of what Iran considered terrorist organizations .
The death sentences are the first to be made public in cases involving the hundreds charged in the vast protests that followed the government ’s declaration of a landslide victory for the incumbent , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , in the June 12 presidential election .
Reform - aligned
Web sites reported last week that a prisoner named Mohammad - Reza Ali-Zamani had received a death sentence .
The announcement on Saturday , which said a man with the initials M. Z. would be put to death , appears to confirm that sentence and report two others .
BOMB PROOF FILM :
There is a new dimension in window film technology for property and personal protection against crime , violent weather and accidents .
Today , protecting yourself and your property is more important than ever .
Developed as a defense against bomb blasts , explosions and flying glass , glass protection film adheres to the interior side of the window .
The high strength , optically clear or tinted polyester material acts like an invisible coat of armor , making the glass significantly stronger and virtually impenetrable to small ballistic attacks .
The film is virtually undetectable to the human eye and will not alter the appearance of the windows in any way .
In the event of a major explosion , security film helps hold the razor sharp glass fragments together , preventing flying shards of glass from becoming deadly weapons .
The product also absorbs shock waves , cushioning and dispersing the impact to the window frame , lessening collateral damage to surrounding buildings .

Ever since i installed jaunty , randomly my computer would just freeze , and even a alt +f1 or a alt + sysrq+reisub would not do anything , so i assume its a kernel problem .
This just happened right now , and i had to restart my computer , so i ran ' ubuntu- bug linux ' the second i restarted .
Maybe it will provide some insight to the problem ?

Skimming through Real Simple magazine at the check out line of the supermarket , I came across Dr. Robert Leahy ’s article “ 10 Ways to Cope with Anxiety . ”
Dr. Leahy is the director of the American Institute for Cognitive Therapy and the author of many books on the subject .
His suggestions will help you calm your nerves :
1. Repeat your worry until you ’re bored silly .
“ … take the troublesome thought that ’s nagging at you and say it over and over , silently , slowly , for 20 minutes .
It ’s hard to keep your mind on a worry if you repeat it that many times . ”
Dr. Leahy calls this technique “ the boredom cure . ”
Behavioral scientists call it ‘ flooding ’ .
I ’m not so keen about this technique for my extremely anxious patients who are having trouble regulating their thoughts and emotions .
If your anxiety is on the milder side , however , and you have the courage to do this , I recommend you think about your worries while practicing relaxation techniques to keep your body as calm as possible .
2 . Make it worse .
“ When you try too hard to control your anxieties , you only heighten them .
Instead exaggerate them and see what happens . ”
This is a good one .
When I suggest it to my patients I call it the ‘ Bring it on ’ technique or ‘ Fake it ’ til you make it ’ .
By inviting what scares you , you learn on your time that you can survive your fears instead of waiting to be bushwhacked by them .
Sports psychologists use this all the time .
When I was terrified my horse would shy and dump me on the ground , my coach told me to stop trying to keep my mare from bolting .
Instead she told me expect her to shy , to look forward to it .
That attitude helped me relax and so did the horse .
3 . Do n’t fight the craziness .
“ You may …have thoughts that lead you to think you ’ll do something terrible …or that you ’re going insane …
Remember – our minds are creative …every now and then ‘ crazy ’ thoughts jump out .
Everyone has them . ”
In the weeks after my first child was born , when I was exhausted , sleep deprived and in the grips of baby blues , I had thoughts of throwing my screaming baby out the window .
Those thoughts terrified me .
Tearfully , I confessed my horrible thoughts to my mother who shrugged and said , “ We all think something like that at some time .
You did n’t act on it , did you ? ”
She assured me I was n’t crazy .
I could relax .
My patients are sometimes surprised when I suggest they allow themselves to imagine doing something outrageous like throwing a banana cream pie at their nasty boss ’s puss .
Unleashing our creative minds may be just what we need to de-stress .
4. Recognize false alarms .
“ Many thoughts and sensations that we interpret as cues for concern–even panic–are just background noise .
Think of each of them [ rapid heart beat , tensing of muscles ] as a fire engine going to another place . ”
5 . Turn your anxiety into a movie .
“.. imagine that your anxious thoughts are a show … while you sit in the audience , eating popcorn , a calm observer . ”
This is a good way to exercise ‘ detachment , ’ stepping outside of the anxiety just enough to keep your thinking brain working .
Another technique I suggest is to imagine the worry happening to a friend , not you .
Then imagine talking to your friend .
What would you say to them ?
How can you be supportive ?
6 . Set aside worry time .
“ Try setting aside 20 minutes everyday–let ’s say 4:30 PM–just for your worries .
If you are fretting at 10 AM , jot down the reason and resolve to think about it later .
By the time 4:30 comes around , many of your troubles wo n’t even matter anymore . ”
7 . Take your hand off the horn .
“ When you desperately try to take command of things that ca n’t be controlled , you ’re more like the swimmer who panics and slaps the water screaming …
Instead , imagine that you are floating along on the water with your arms spread out …
It ’s a paradox , but when you surrender to the moment , you actually feel far more in control . ”
8. Breathe it out .
“ Focusing on breathing is a common but effective technique for calming the nerves . ”
This a classic , oldy , but goody .
If you do it right , deep , mindful breathing is better than Valium .
9 . Make peace with time .
“ Every feeling of panic comes to an end , every concern eventually wears itself out , every so - called emergency seems to evaporate . ”
When we are in the midst of a panic attack we feel it will last forever or else we will die .
Remembering the fact that panic attacks and anxiety in milder form is finite , usually not lasting more than ten minutes .
Dr. Leahy also counsels :
“ Ask yourself , ‘ How will I feel about this in a week or a month ? ’
This one , too , really will pass . ”
10 .
Do n’t let your worries stop you from living your life .
“ What can you still do even if you feel anxious ?
Almost anything . ”
Not all anxiety is bad .
Keep in mind that some highly productive people transform their anxiety into motivation to do better and achieve much , both great and small .

Ten More Ways to Lower Anxiety
Linda McMahon , best known as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment ( yep , that 's WWE , home to over - muscled " wrestlers " hurling folding chairs at each other ) , is leaving her post to challenge Sen.
Chris Dodd ( D ) of Connecticut for the US Senate seat he 's held for five terms .
" I am 100 percent serious about this race , " she said Wednesday of her bid for the Republican nomination .
But " serious " is not a word often associated with the WWE , known for its melodramatic storylines and faux wrestling moves .
Mrs. McMahon , the wife of Vince McMahon , WWE 's public bossman and ringmaster , says she was largely the behind - the - scenes brains of the company , which she points out has grown from 13 to 300 employees under her watch .
Still , she 'll have to contend with YouTube videos which argue the contrary .
How many politicians do you know that were " tombstoned " ( translation : dropped on their heads ) by a giant bald man in full - body spandex – albeit while wearing a pantsuit ?
Ok , maybe more than you 'd think .
Jesse Ventura , the former governor of Minnesota , proved that pro-wrestling credentials are n't necessary a no - go with voters .
Mr. Ventura , a.k.a.
" The Body " ( and later known as " The Governing Body " ) transformed himself into a politician , first with a stint as mayor of Brooklyn Park , Minn. , before running for governor in 1998 as an Independent .
He only served one term as governor and did not seek reelection .
After all , at their core , WWE wrestlers are just actors .
In that respect , McMahon could join the ranks of actors - turned - politicians Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger ( R ) ( who , like Ventura , first rode his muscles to fame ) , President Ronald Reagan , Sen . Al Franken ( D ) and former Sen. Fred Thompson ( R ) .
Still , it 's an uphill battle in what will likely be a crowded field of candidates .
But one McMahon , who currently serves on Connecticut 's Board of Education , says she 's ready for .
She 'll largely self - finance her campaign ( she can afford it – WWE is worth $ 1 billion according the New York Times ) and says she wo n't accept campaign donations over $ 100 so as not to be beholden to any special interests .

Draw near , infidels , for these are dark days for the Knights of Hubbard .
Do not despair entirely – the Church of Scientology remains insanely rich , has excellent and rapacious lawyers , and according to the International Scientology News , " every minute of every hour , someone reaches for L Ron Hubbard technology … simply because they know Tom Cruise is a Scientologist " .
So unless the world 's supply of troubled fools is melting away quicker than the Arctic ice cap , they can probably hold off trying to lure disaffected Kabbalists into their cultish communion , after the fashion of Pope Benedict and the Anglicans .
And yet , all things considered , it has not been the best of weeks for our operating thetans .
In France , Scientology was found guilty of defrauding its followers after a judge effectively debunked the idea of the church 's trusty e-meter , a crude polygraph whose readings are used to encourage Scientologists to purchase everything from books to extreme sauna courses .
In Los Angeles , the Oscar - winning ( even if it was only for the abysmal Crash ) director Paul Haggis cut his ties with Scientology in protest at what he branded their tolerance of homophobia , adding for good measure that the church 's claim that they do not tell people to " disconnect " from unsupportive family members was untrue – his own wife had been ordered to do so .
Meanwhile , Scientology 's chief spokesman Tommy Davis stormed out of a television interview with Martin Bashir , after the latter pressed him on what we might delicately term " certain articles of faith " .
The alien stuff , basically .
What has caused these synchronous events ?
Naturally , one 's initial assumption is that the everlasting battery which provides the force field which holds the intergalactic tyrant Xenu captive in an unspecified mountain here on Earth is not as everlasting as billed , or was perhaps commandeered when the battery went in some vast cosmic remote control .
In humanoid households , of course , a TV remote is the appliance for which all other batteries must be yielded up – including those in the smoke alarm – and the same hierarchy holds true on a galactic scale .
And yet , despite this seeming the most convincing answer , the truth is rather more prosaic .
It is the internet wot dun it .
Did I lose you on the intergalactic tyrant stuff ?
Then Google it immediately , as you are fortunate enough to be able to do these days .
During his lifetime , the religion 's inventor L Ron Hubbard deemed the chief enemies of Scientology to be tax inspectors and psychiatrists ( it is not desperately difficult to figure out why ) .
Even a sixth - rate science fiction writer such as himself would not have been able to predict that it would be the web that would pose the gravest threat to his church since his inception , facilitating everything from the circulation of whistleblower accounts and cult - busting advice to videos of Tom Cruise chuckling maniacally while repeating " KSW ! Keep Scientology Working ! "
Strangely , there are times when " Lol ! ! " – normally the seal - honk of the internet 's least self - aware halfwits – really is the most eloquent dismissal on earth .
Similarly , if you have n't seen the Bashir interview , you can do so on YouTube .
Challenged on the old Xenu chestnut , Davis knows how utterly loony tunes it sounds , and walking out evidently seems less damaging than even having the discussion .
And so with the French court case .
How could the Scientologists possibly have argued that the readings from their Fisher Price - style Play 'n ' Polygraph machine justified a penny in the collection tin , let alone hundreds of euros worth of books ?
Yet there is the rub .
In France , Scientology is deemed a sect as opposed to a religion , which is why they are required to produce evidence for their claims , where recognised religious leaders are not .
For those of us who believe that all religions are full of tall tales , this might seem slightly unfair .
Admittedly , it costs more financially to be lied to by Scientology than it does to be taken on an equally evidence - free journey by other faiths , and we should not for a moment gloss over the cruel and repulsive way in which the church has hounded their critics .
But when I think of Mel Gibson building his $ 42 m church compound in Malibu , blithely telling interviewers at the time of the Passion of the Christ 's release that his then wife would unfortunately be going to hell , because she was Church of England … well , I can't find it in myself to find him any less barking than Tom Cruise .
Clearly , Scientologists should be forced to justify their doctrinal lunacies – the only sadness is that other religions are apparently exempt from having to do the same .
Imagine for a moment a Bashir - type interviewing some senior cardinal .
" So , " he might inquire , " you 're saying that by some magic the communion wafer actually becomes the flesh of a man who died 2,000 years ago , a man who – and I do n't want to put words into your mouth here – we might categorise as an imaginary friend who can hear the things you 're thinking in your head ?
And when you 've done that , do you mind going over the birth control stuff ? "
What a shame that we see rather fewer of these exchanges , however amusing and useful a sideshow Scientology may be .
Kamran Pasha , the author of Mother of the Believers , a new novel relating the story of Islam from the perspective of Aisha , Prophet Mohammed 's wife , was told of the al - Awlaki connection from a Muslim friend who is also an officer at Fort Hood .
Using the name Richard , the recent convert to Islam described how he frequently prayed with Hasan at the town mosque after Hasan was deployed to Fort Hood in July .
They last worshipped together at predawn prayers on the day of the massacre when Hasan " appeared relaxed and not in any way troubled or nervous " .
Today ’s major media journalism is biased , irresponsible , sensationalist reporting that distorts , exaggerates or misstates the truth .
It ’s misinformation or agitprop disinformation masquerading as fact to boost circulation , readership , viewers , or listeners , and on vital issues lie about or suppress uncomfortable truths to provide unqualified support for state and / or corporate interests — to the detriment of the greater good that ’s always sacrificed for profits and imperial aims .
As a result , major media sources produce a daily propaganda diet and what Project Censored calls “ junk food news , ” and get most people to believe it .
In their landmark book , Manufacturing Consent , Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky explained the “ propaganda model ” that controls the public message by “ filter ( ing ) ” disturbing truths , “ leaving ( behind ) only the cleansed residue fit to print ” or air .
Today the media is in crisis and a free and open society at risk at a time fiction substitutes for fact , news is carefully controlled , dissent marginalized , and on - air and print journalists support powerful interests as paid liars , or what famed journalist George Seldes ( 1890 - 1995 ) called “ prostitutes of the press . ”
As a result , imperial wars are called liberating ones .
Civil liberties are suppressed for our own good .
Major topics go unaddressed or are misrepresented .
Government and business interests are endorsed wholeheartedly .
America is always called “ beautiful . ”
Beneficial social change is considered heresy .
The market works best , we ’re told , so let it , and patriotism means supporting lawlessness and corporate outlaws by shopping till we drop .
The New York Times : Its Lead Role in Distorting and Suppressing Truth
For many decades , the Times has been the closest thing in America to an official ministry of information and propaganda masquerading as real news , commentary and analysis .
Its unmatched clout once got media critic Norman Solomon to call its front page “ the most valuable square inches of media real estate in the USA ; ” most everywhere , in fact , because its reports are widely circulated and followed globally .
The Paper of Record has a long history of :
supporting the powerful ;
backing corporate interests ;
endorsing imperial wars ;
supporting CIA efforts to topple elected governments , assassinate independent leaders , prop up friendly dictators , secretly fund and train paramilitary death squads , practice sophisticated forms of torture , and menace democratic freedoms at home and abroad .
For decades , in fact , some Times ‘ foreign correspondents were covert Agency assets .
Others today likely are as well as other prominent fourth estate members .
The Times management is also comfortable with :
Washington and corporate lawlessness ;
an unprecedented and growing wealth gap ;
Wall Street banksters looting the federal treasury ;
a private banking cartel controlling the nation ’s money ;
unmet human needs and increasing poverty , hunger , homelessness , and despair for growing millions in a nation run by rogue politicians who do n’t give a damn as long as they ’re re-elected ;
a de facto one - party state ;
deep corruption at the highest government and corporate levels ;
democracy for the select few alone ;
sham elections ; and
a deepening social decay symptomatic of a declining state , yet The Times management wo n’t use its clout to expose and help reverse it .
Of course , the same applies throughout the corporate media , the only variance being audience size , the ability to influence it , and the special impact of TV news and talk radio to arouse their faithful .
Plus their power of round - the - clock persuasive repetition .
Examples of Journalism , New York Times Style
After a Washington staged February 29 , 2004 middle - of - the - night coup ousted democratically elected Haitian president Jean - Bertrand Aristide , the Times March 1 editorial lied by :
stating he resigned ;
saying sending in Marines to abduct him “ was the right thing to do ; ”
claiming they only came after “ Mr. Aristide yielded power ; ”
blaming him for “ contribut ( ing ) significantly to his own downfall ( because of his ) increasingly autocratic and lawless rule …. ; ” and
accusing him of manipulating the 2000 legislative elections and not “ deliver ( ing ) the democracy he promised . ”
In fact , he ’s a beloved democrat first elected in 1990 with 67 % of the vote , ousted by a US - supported coup months later , returned to Haiti in 1994 , then , because he could n’t succeed himself in 1996 , ran in 2000 and was overwhelmingly re-elected with 92 % of the vote .
Today in exile , the great majority of Haitians want him back but paramilitary occupiers , under orders from Washington , wo n’t let him .
Following Hugo Chavez ’s December 1998 election , the Times ‘ Latin American reporter , Larry Roher , wrote :
Regional “ presidents and party leaders are looking over their shoulders ( concerned about the ) specter ( they ) thought they had safely interred : that of the populist demagogue , the authoritarian man on horseback known as the caudillo ( strongman ) ” taking power .
Ever since , Times writers consistently :
turned a blind eye to Venezuelan democracy ;
bashed Chavez as “ divisive , a ruinous demagogue , provocative ( and ) the next Fidel Castro ; ”
said he “ militarized the government , emasculated the country ’s courts , intimidated the media , eroded confidence in the economy , and hollowed out Venezuela ’s once - democratic institutions : ” common conditions during decades of pre-Chavez rule that columnist Roger Lowenstein falsely said exist now in :
calling him anti-capitalist for sharing his nation ’s oil wealth with the people by providing essential social services , and for lifting the most needy out of poverty ; and
denouncing his making foreign investors pay their fair share .
Lowenstein backed the aborted April 2002 coup by calling Chavez ’s ouster a “ resignation , ” then saying Venezuela “ no longer ( would be ) threatened by a would - be dictator . ”
Post -/911 , the Times played the lead role in taking the nation to war by highlighting the “ day of terror ” and saying the “ President Vows to Exact Punishment for ‘ Evil . ’ ”
In the run-up to the Iraq war , Judith Miller was a weapon of mass deception with her daily front page Pentagon press release columns masquerading as real news , later exposed as manipulative lies , but they worked .
Following the September 15 , 2009 Goldstone Commission report , a same day Neil MacFarquhar column suggested that Israel ’s “ disproportionate attack ” followed Hamas provocations , so perhaps it was justified .
While the Times gave Judge Goldstone op - ed space , it :
— published scathing letters denouncing his “ one- sidedness ” and a September 18 piece saying “ the Obama administration said ( today ) that a United Nations report accusing Israel of war crimes in Gaza was unfair to Israel and did not take adequate account of ‘ deplorable ’ actions by the militant group Hamas in the conflict last winter . ”
The paper then imposed a near - blackout on its news and editorial pages to bury the story and kill it through silence – never mind its importance in documenting clear evidence of Israeli war crimes against a civilian population .
National Public Radio ( NPR ) and Public Broadcasting ( PBS )
Founded in 1970 as an independent , private , non-profit member organization of US public radio stations , NPR promised to be an alternative to commercial broadcasters by “ promot ( ing ) personal growth rather than corporate gain ( and ) speak with many voices , many dialects . ”
Having long ago abandoned its promise , and given its substantial corporate and government funding , NPR is indistinguishable from the rest of the corporate media , just as corrupted , and consider its former head , Kevin Klose .
He was president from December 1998 - September 2008 and CEO from 1998 - January 2009 .
Earlier he was US propaganda director as head of the Voice of America ( VOA ) , Radio Liberty , Radio Free Europe , Radio Free Asia , Worldnet Television , and the anti-Castro Radio / TV Marti , so he fit easily into his new role .
On January 5 , 2009 , Vivian Schiller succeeded him as president and CEO .
Her official bio says she was previously with “ The New York Times Company where she served as Senior Vice President and General Manager of NYTimes.com . ”
She ’ll oversea “ all NPR operations and initiatives , including the organization ’s critical partnerships with our 800 + member stations , and their service to the more than 26 million people who listen to NPR programming every week . ”
Most do n’t know they ’re getting the same corporate propaganda and “ junk food news ” or that NPR calls itself “ public ” to conceal its real agenda , and why critics call it “ National Pentagon or Petroleum Radio ” with good reason .
Created by the Public Broadcasting Act of 1967 , the Corporation for Public Broadcasting ( CPB ) calls itself “ a private , nonprofit corporation created by Congress … and is the steward of the federal government ’s investment in public broadcasting .
It helps support the operations of more than 1,100 locally - owned and - operated public television and radio stations nationwide , and is the largest single source of funding for research , technology , and program development for public radio , television and related online services . ”
Like NPR , it ’s heavily corporate and government funded and provides similar services for them .
Under George Bush , former Voice of America director Kenneth Tomlinson was chairman of CPB ’s Board of Governors until an internal 2005 investigation forced him out for repeatedly braking the law .
On September 16 , 2009 , a CPB press release announced that “ The board of directors ( of the CPB ) today elected Dr. Ernest Wilson III ( as ) chairman and re-elected …
CEO Beth Courtney ( as ) vice - chair . ”
Wilson previously held senior policy positions as Director of International Programs and Resources on the National Security Council .
He was also Policy and Planning Unit Director for the US Information Agency and a member of the Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) .
Beth Courtney is a George Bush appointee , a past chairman of the board of America ’s Public Television Stations and present CPB vice chairman .
Currently she also serves on the boards of Satellite Educational Resources Consortium , the Organization of State Broadcasting Executives , the National Forum for Public Television Executives , and the National Educational Telecommunications Association along with other appropriate credentials for her re-appointment .
In its May / June 2004 “ Extra ” report , FAIR ( Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting ) asked “ How Public Is Public Radio ?
Writers Steve Rendall and Daniel Butterworth quoted past head Kevin Klose saying :
“ All of us believe our goal is to serve the entire democracy , the entire country . ”
Not according to FAIR on “ every on - air source quoted in June 2003 on four of ( NPR ’s ) news shows : All Things Considered , Morning Edition , Weekend Edition Saturday and Weekend Edition Sunday . ”
Each guest was classified “ by occupation , gender , nationality , and partisan affiliation . ”
Combined , 2,334 sources from 804 stories were quoted .
FAIR found that NPR relies on the same dominant sources as the major media that include government officials , professional experts , and corporate representatives nearly two - thirds of the time .
Spokespeople for public interest groups accounted for 7 % of total sources , and ordinary people appeared mostly in “ one- sentence soundbites . ”
Male guests outnumbered women about 4 - 1 , and those quoted most often came from the same elite categories as men .
Overall , NPR represents the same dominant interests as the major commercial media — conservative , pro-business , pro-war , pro-Israel , and very much against the public interest while pretending to support it .
FAIR analyzed PBS ’s flagship NewsHour guest list and drew similar conclusions .
Like NPR , it ’s ideologically right and usually censors progressive content and public interest programming .
In a 1990 NewsHour evaluation , FAIR compared its content to ABC ’s Nightline and found that it presented “ an even narrower segment of the political spectrum . ”
It then conducted an October 2005 - March 2006 analysis of all of its programs , got similar results , and determined that NewHour is even more ideologically right than NPR that tilts far in that direction itself .
FAIR concluded that NPR and NewsHour content “ overwhelmingly represent those in power rather than the public ” they ’re obliged to serve .
While masquerading as public programming , they betray their listeners and viewers by offering the same propaganda and “ junk food news ” as the dominant corporate media .
Considering their funding sources , what else would they do .
An October 6 NPR story is typical of most others .
It charged Hugo Chavez with “ Targeting Opponents For Arrest . ”
Reporter Juan Forero claimed “ dozens of university students ” went on hunger strike outside OAS headquarters in Caracas on September 28 along with others “ across the country … in support of Julio Cesar Rivas , a student who was arrested during an anti-government demonstration in August … . ”
Rivas is the coordinator and founder of Juventud Activa de Venezuela Unida ( United Active Youth of Venezuela – JAVU ) .
Earlier , he was part of a staged , violent street protest against Venezuela ’s new Education Law .
The government says JAVU acts as “ shock troops ” in opposition protests and is liberally funded by the National Endowment of Democracy ( NED ) , International Republican Institute ( IRI ) , and US Agency or International Development ( USAID ) to disrupt internal Venezuelan affairs .
It ’s a familiar scheme , repeated numerous times in the past , to discredit and disrupt the Chavez government in hopes of eventually ousting it .
JAVU has about 80,000 members in most Venezuelan states , and its blog site calls for bringing down the government and supporting the Honduran military coup .
Rivas was released on September 29 , but must appear for trial .
He ’s a Washington - funded provocateur , charged with resisting arrest , instigating crime , conspiracy , inciting rebellion , damaging public property , and using “ generic ” weapons .
While in custody , Venezuela Public Defender Gabriela Ramirez assured him in person that his full constitutional rights will be protected .
Street protests still continue and have been countered by pro-Chavez ones calling for “ peace and tolerance . ”
According to the Federation of Bolivarian students ’ Carlos Sierra :
Opposition “ students are being used and manipulated by the top leadership of the irrational opposition , which , via the ( dominant ) media , send them to generate violence and terrorism in the country ” much like on previous occasions .
But according to NPR ’s Forero , Rivas was “ sent to one of Venezuela ’s most infamous prisons ” where other government opponents are held as political prisoners .
Chavez “ has been jailing dozens of key opponents – some of them students , some of them veteran politicians ” in citing unnamed “ human rights groups and constitutional experts ( claiming ) Venezuela is increasingly singling out and imprisoning its foes in politically motivated witch hunts . ”
Forero did n’t mention that Rivas fomented violence .
Others arrested also broke the law .
No one is a political prisoner , and all Venezuelans get fair and equitable trials , unlike in America where real political arrests , prosecutions and convictions happen regularly against innocent targeted victims — a topic NPR and PBS wo n’t touch except to vilify them publicly on - air .
Nor do they report truthfully on Occupied Palestine .
On October 12 , 2009 , on NPR ’s Morning Edition , reporter Renee Montagne practically extolled Israeli racism in stating :
“ There is a new enemy for some Israelis : romance between Jewish women and Arab men , ( so ) vigilantes have banded together to fight it . ”
She means from “ Jewish settlements ” that “ have sprung up ( in ) traditionally Arab ” East Jerusalem , but wo n’t admit they ’re on stolen Palestinian land .
NPR ’s Sheera Frankel joined a patrol , implied Arabs are inferior to Jews , and suggested they pose a danger to Jewish women and girls .
She described vigilantes on the lookout for “ Arab - Jewish couples ( to ) break up their dates , ” suggesting it ’s the right thing to do , but never questioning the legitimacy of settlements , vigilante violence in East Jerusalem , its lawless disregard for the law , or great harm to innocent people .
Instead she called “ mixed couples a growing epidemic ” of miscegenation — typical of NPR ’s racism and one - sided support for Israel .
The Wall Street Journal ( WSJ )
The WSJ is Dow Jones & Company ’s flagship publication , now a News Corp. one since Rupert Murdoch bought it in August 2007 .
Stating its ideology up front , it says it supports “ free markets and free people ” as well as “ free trade and sound money ; against confiscatory taxation and the ukases ( edicts ) of kings and other collectivists ; and for individual autonomy against dictators , bullies and even the tempers of momentary majorities . ”
In October 2007 , FAIR bemoaned the Murdock takeover because of his “ penchant for using his holdings as vehicles for his personal ( views ) and business interests . ”
Earlier FAIR and the Columbia Journalism Review criticized its editorial page for inaccuracy , extreme bias , and dishonesty .
The Journal is unapologetic in saying its philosophy “ make (s ) no pretense of walking down the middle of the road .
Our comments and interpretations are made from a definite point of view … .
We oppose all infringements on individual rights , whether ( from ) private monopoly , labor union monopoly or from an overgrowing government .
( We ’re ) not much interested in labels but if we were to choose one , we would say we are radical . ”
Radical can be revolutionary and beneficial when it backs fundamental progressive change and reform .
Webster defines it as :
“ marked by a considerable departure from the usual and traditional : extreme ; tending or disposed to make extreme changes in existing views , habits , conditions , or institutions ; of , relating to , or constituting a political ( or perhaps business ) group associated with views , practices , and policies of extreme change ; ( or ) advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs ” such the radical right represented by the WSJ ’s management and editorial writers .
Critics agree that they ’re on the far right extremist fringe , a supporter of voodoo economics , tax cuts for the rich , a staunch defender of executive privilege , and disdainful of anything to the left of their views as witnessed daily by some of the most outlandish , one - sided , pro-business commentaries countenancing no alternatives , with the rarest of rare exceptions showing up to make the paper look fair , which it ’s not .
Consider editorial board member Mary O’Grady in her weekly Americas column on “ politics , economics and business in Latin America and Canada . ”
Her extremism is unmatched .
Her style is agitprop ; her space a truth - free zone ; her language hateful and vindictive ; her tone malicious and slanderous ; her style bare - knuckled thuggishness ; and her material calculating , mendacious , and shameless .
Yet she ’s a WSJ regular and an award - winning op - ed writer , but surely no journalist according to Webster ’s definition :
“ writing characterized by a direct presentation of facts or description of events without an attempt at interpretation . ”
O’Grady fails on both counts .
She ’s a kind of print version of Fox News ‘ Glenn Beck , who promotes himself on glennbeck.com looking arrogant in a uniform reminiscent of the Nazi SS .
Consider O’Grady ’s support for the Washington - backed June 28 Honduran coup ousting a democratically elected president .
It was followed by months of mass arrests , disappearances , killings , targeting the independent media , suspending the Constitution , declaring martial law , and threatening the Brazilian embassy ’s sovereignty where President Manuel Zelaya took refuge after returning .
In one of her many pro-coup articles , O’Grady ( on July 13 ) headlined “ Why Honduras Sent Zelaya Away . ”
In a “ perfect world , ” according to her , he “ would be in jail in his own country right now , awaiting trial .
The Honduran attorney general ( part of the coup regime ) has charged him with deliberately violating Honduran law and the Supreme Court ( stacked with pro-coup justices ) ordered his arrest in Tegucigalpa on June 28 , ” the day of the coup .
“ But the Honduran military whisked him out of the country , to Costa Rica , ” to save itself the embarrassment of jailing a democratically elected leader whose lawful actions were endorsed by the majority of Hondurans wanting progressive constitutional change and a president willing to give it to them .
Yet according to O’Grady , “ Mr. Zelaya ’s detention was legal , as was his official removal from office by Congress … .
Besides eagerly trampling the constitution , Mr. Zelaya had demonstrated that he was ready to employ the violent tactics of ‘ chavismo ’ to hang onto power .
The decision to pack him off immediately was taken in the interest of protecting both constitutional order and human life . ”
In fact , Zelaya neither espoused or practiced violence , and his call for a public June 28 vote on whether to hold a referendum for a new Constitutional Convention at the same time as the November elections lawfully asked for a “ yes ” or “ no ” on one question :
“ Do you think that the November 2009 general elections should include a fourth ballot box ( the other three were for candidates ) in order to make a decision about the creation of a National Constitutional Assembly that would approve a new Constitution ? ”
According to Article 5 of the 2006 Honduran “ Civil Participation Act , ” government officials may hold non-binding inquiries ( referenda ) to determine popular support for proposed measures .
Gauging sentiment for a National Constituent Assembly for a new Constitution is legal .
Yet in her June 28 article titled , “ Honduras Defends Its Democracy , ” O’Grady falsely claimed Zelaya planned “ a constitutional rewrite ( following ) a national referendum ” only the Congress can approve .
In fact , Zelaya called for a vote to assess public sentiment , pro or con , on whether Hondurans want a Constitutional Convention , an act no different from a public opinion poll that ’s perfectly legal or should be anywhere .
But according to O’Grady , Zelaya “ decided he would run the referendum himself . ”
It ’s typical O’Grady truth reversal that earns her weekly space on the WSJ ’s op - ed page .
The BBC ’s Long Tradition As An Imperial Tool
State - owned and funded , it ’s tradition is long , unbroken , and disturbing as the world ’s largest and most influential broadcaster reaching global audiences in 32 languages .
From inception in 1925 , it ’s been reliably pro-government and pro-business , or as its founder Lord Reith wrote the establishment : “ They know they can trust us not to be really impartial . ”
Neither he or his successors disappointed on topics mattering most , including war and peace , corporate crimes , US - UK duplicity , labor rights , democratic freedoms , human and civil rights , social justice , and Western imperialism .
They ’re consistently distorted , suppressed , marginalized or ignored throughout decades of misreporting despite claiming “ honesty ( and ) integrity ( is ) what the BBC stands for ( because it ’s ) free from political influence and commercial pressure . ”
As a propaganda service , its record is uncompromisingly anti-union , pro-business , and dependably safe for Whitehall and its allies .
It moralizes Western aggression , bashes independent democratic leaders , and cheerleads for the powerful at the expense of providing real news and information for millions believing BBC is credible .
For over eight decades , it ’s record is solid and predictable — betraying the public trust to reliably serve the powerful .
The tradition continues .
Prominent TV Demagogues
Among the many , consider a select few .
For example , CNN ’s Lou Dobbs , “ Mr. Independent ” he calls himself .
Critics use more descriptive terms , yet according to his loudobbs.tv.cnn.com bio :
He ’s “ anchor and managing editor of CNN ’s Lou Dobbs Tonight ( and also anchor of ) a nationally syndicated financial news radio report , The Lou Dobbs Financial Report … . ”
In addition , he writes a weekly CNN.com commentary , is an author and award - winning “ journalist , ” most recently in 2005 when “ the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences awarded ( him ) the Emmy for Lifetime Achievement ” for serving the usual special interests nightly on prime time TV .
In June 2004 , he also won “ the Eugene Katz Award for Excellence in the Coverage of Immigration from the Center for Immigration Studies for his ongoing series ‘ Broken Borders , ’ which examines US policy towards illegal immigration . ”
Little wonder in an August 2006 article , this writer called him CNN ’s Vice President of Racism .
He ’s also a paid liar and in America wins awards .
In May 2008 , a Media Matters Action Network report titled , “ Fear & Loathing in Prime Time : Immigration Myths and Cable News ” highlighted undocumented Latino hatemongering by Dobbs , Bill O’Reilly , and Glenn Beck , each claiming :
an alleged connection between undocumented Latinos and crime ; in fact , clear evidence shows they ’re no more likely to break laws than American citizens ;
how they exploit social services and do n’t pay taxes ; in fact , undocumented immigrants are ineligible , without proof of legal status , for Medicaid , food stamps , State Children ’s Health Insurance ( SCHIP ) and welfare ; they do pay income , payroll , property , sales and other taxes and are entitled to public education ; according to the National Academy of Sciences , immigrants provide a net annual gain of up to $ 10 billion to US GDP ; according to Rand Corp.
economist James P. Smith , the “ net present value of the gains from those immigrants who arrived since 1980 would be $ 333 billion . ”
the “ reconquista ” myth about a supposed Mexican plot to take over the US Southwest ; and
an epidemic of Latino voter fraud that , according to Dobbs ’ incessant drumbeat , puts America ’s “ democracy absolutely in jeopardy . ”
He also propagates the myth that undocumented Latinos caused an increase in US leprosy ( or Hansen ’s disease ) .
In an on - air April 2005 report ( among others ) , correspondent Christine Romans quoted “ medical lawyer ” Dr. Madeleine Cosman saying :
“ We have some enormous problems with horrendous diseases that are being brought into America by illegal aliens ( including ) leprosy … . ”
Romans added that , according to Cosman , “ there were about 900 ( US ) cases of leprosy for 40 years .
There have been 7,000 in the past three years . ”
According to a May 2007 60 Minutes report , the National Hansen ’s Disease Program ( NHDP ) of the Department of Health and Human Services ( HHS ) reported that “ 7,000 is the number of leprosy cases over the last 30 years , not the past three , and nobody knows how many of those cases involve illegal immigrants . ”
NHDP added that from 2002 - 2005 ( the timeline of Cosman ’s claim ) , only 398 cases occurred .
To that , Dobbs responded : “ If we reported it , it ’s a fact . ”
Founded in 1971 , the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) is internationally known for its activism against hate groups and scoring legal victories against white supremacists .
It says Dobbs regularly features inaccurate racist reports and features anti-immigrant hatemongers like :
Glenn Spencer , head of the anti-immigration American Patrol , whose web site highlights anti-Mexican vitriol and the idea that Mexico plans a secret takeover of the Southwest ;
Joe McCutchen , head of the anti-immigration Protect Arkansas Now group , that Dobbs calls “ a terrific group of concerned , caring Americans ; ”
Paul Streitz , co-founder of Connecticut Citizens for Immigration Control , who once denounced Mayor John DeStefano , Jr. for “ turning New Haven into a banana republic ; ”
Barbara Coe , leader of the California Coalition for Immigration Reform who routinely calls Mexicans “ savages ; ” and
Chris Simcox , co-founder of the Minuteman Project and a leading anti-immigration figure .
SPLC explains that Dobbs “ doggedly explores and supports the anti-immigration movement ( and ) wo n’t report salient negative facts about anti-immigration leaders he approves of … . ”
Instead , he falsely claims that :
“ just about a third of the prison population in this country is estimated to be illegal aliens ; ”
states have been “ overwhelmed by criminal illegal aliens ; ” and
US borders are “ unprotected ” allowing “ criminal illegal aliens ( to ) murder police officers . ”
In 2007 alone , the connection between illegal immigration and crime was discussed on 94 episodes of Lou Dobbs Tonight , and dozens more focused on an “ army of invaders , ” immigrants not paying taxes , draining social services , and threatening our white Anglo - Saxon culture .
CNN reporters Casey Wian , Bill Tucker , Kitty Pilgrim and others present a steady diet of subtle and overt racism to incite viewers to believe it .
Through constant repetition , it propagates the myth , and according to the Media Matters Action Network report :
Dobbs “ is hailed by the entire spectrum of immigration opponents , from the reasonable to the unreasonable .
And the degree to which extremist elements see ( him ) as an ally indicates at the very least that they believe he is helping their cause ” because they feel he ’s a populist crusader .
Yet according to a July 30 New York Observer report , recent Nielsen data showed that after Dobbs began reporting ( on July 15 ) that Barack Obama ’s birth certificate was fraudulent ( an apparent stunt to increase ratings ) , his viewership dropped significantly — 15 % overall and 27 % in the valued 25 - 54 age category .
Fox News Channel ( FNC )
When it debuted in 1996 , one of its on - air hosts said :
The “ Channel was launched ( because ) something was wrong with news media … somewhere bias found its way into reporting …
Fox … is committed to being fair and balanced ( covering ) stories everybody is reporting — and … stories … you will see only on Fox . ”
Later the Columbia Journalism Review said several former
Fox employees “ complained of ‘ management sticking their fingers ’ in the writing and editing stories to cook the facts to make a story more palatable to right - of - center tastes . ”
But it has n’t hurt ratings .
As of Q 1 2009 , FNC was the second highest rated cable channel in prime time total viewers .
CNN ranked 17th and MSNBC 24th .
The O’Reilly Factor has been # 1 rated on cable news for 100 consecutive months and gained 27 % more viewers year - over - year .
Glenn Beck increased 90 % over the previous year .
Overall , FNC topped CNN and MSNBC combined in prime time total audience .
Fairness & Accuracy in Reporting ( FAIR ) said “ Fox ’s signature political news show , Special Report with Brit Hume ( now with Bret Baier ) was originally created as a daily one - hour update devoted to the 1998 Clinton sex scandal . ”
In the past year , it gained 39 % more viewers .
As for accuracy and being “ fair and balanced , ” FAIR ( in summer 2001 ) called FNC “ The Most Biased Name in News , ” yet according to Murdoch in March 2001 :
“ I challenge anybody to show me an example of bias in Fox News Channel . ”
In FAIR ’s Seth Ackerman article and later ones , FNC ’s blatant manipulation of the news is exposed .
For example , Bret Baier ’s “ Political Grapevine ” is a right - wing “ hot sheet ” featuring a “ series of gossipy items culled from other right - wing ” sources .
It and other reports are blatantly partisan propaganda against “ liberal media bias , ” progressives , environmentalists , anti-war activists , civil rights groups , and others to the left of their views .
According to FAIR , the commentary on political punditry programs like The O’Reilly Factor , the Sean Hannity Show , and The Beltway Boys is so slanted that it ’s like watching “ a Harlem Globetrotters game ( knowing ) which side is supposed to win . ”
FNC ’s Bill O’Reilly
His official bio calls The O’Reilly Factor “ a unique blend of news analysis and hard hitting investigative reporting dropped each weeknight into ‘ The No Spin Zone . ”
He also hosts a syndicated radio show , writes a weekly column carried in over 300 newspapers , and authored several books that according to New York Times writer Janet Maslin were “ either ( done ) with a collaborator or ( O’ Reilly ) was born with a ghostwriter ’s gift for filling space with platitudes … . ”
With good reason , Maslin called him “ one of the most controversial human beings in the world … . ”
In an October 2008 report titled “ Smearcasting , ” FAIR called him an “ Islamophobe ” for spreading “ fear , bigotry and misinformation ” along with 11 other popular figures , including Glenn Beck , Sean Hannity , Michelle Malkin ( another FNC regular ) , David Horowitz , and Pat Robertson .
After 9/11 , FAIR said O’Reilly proposed attacking a list of Muslim countries “ if they did not submit to the US — starting with Afghanistan . ”
On air he said :
“ The US should bomb the Afghan infrastructure to rubble — the airport , the power plants , their water facilities and the roads … .
If they do n’t rise up against this primitive country , they starve , period . ”
Iraq must also be destroyed he said , and “ the population made to endure yet another round of intense pain . ”
As for Libya , “ Nothing goes in , nothing goes out … .
Let them eat sand . ”
FAIR called his penchant for attacking Muslim countries “ an O’Reilly trademark ” , and “ his disregard for Muslim civilians is matched by the anti-Muslim sentiments he frequently expresses on both his nationally syndicated radio show , the Radio Factor , ” reaching 3.5 million listeners , and his top - rated FNC show .
Some of his hateful comments include saying :
areas of London are “ just packed with just dense Muslim neighborhoods , which breed this kind of contempt for Western society .
Why do they let them in ; ”
“ We ’re at war with Muslim fanatics .
So all young Muslims should be subject to ( special ) scrutiny , ( saying it ’s not racial , just ) “ criminal profiling ; ”
“ the most unattractive women in the world are probably in Muslim countries ; ” and
in Iraq , he blamed killing on Islam : “ They ’re all Muslims , and they ’re doing what they do .
They ’re killing each other .
And they ’re killing Americans . ”
O’Reilly is equally racist about Latino immigrants with frequent comments like :
“ The extreme elements in this country want open borders , blanket amnesty , and entitlement for foreign nationals who have come here illegally , and generally want to change the demographics in the USA so political power can be assumed by the left .
That is the end game . ”
He also argues that “ Low - skilled immigrant labor costs the taxpayers today $ 19,000 to ( subsidize ) people who are using the hospitals ( and ) the education system … .
These are rock - solid stats , ” but O’Reilly wo n’t say from where .
They ’re blatantly false and may be from a May 2007 Robert Rector / Christine Kim ( right - wing think tank ) Heritage Foundation paper titled , “ The Fiscal Cost of Low - Skill Immigrants to State and Local Taxpayers . ”
O’Reilly spreads daily misinformation , innuendo , and hateful demagoguery to millions of his daily faithful .
Like the others above , they ’re paid liars delivering what passes for today ’s major media journalism .
It ’s why so much of the public is misinformed and the reason more hate groups than ever proliferate .
According to the Southern Poverty Law Center ( SPLC ) , they numbered 926 in 2008 , up from 602 in 2000 and are “ animated by the national immigration debate . ”
Since Obama took office , they ’re also driven by their hatred of a black president , exacerbated by a growing economic crisis that ’s easy to blame on the undocumented and a non-white head of state .
These groups are ideologically vicious and extremely dangerous when motivated by racist right - wing media commentators reaching far larger audiences than more saner voices drowned out .
It ’s more evidence of social decay and the urgent need for change .
The Right - Wing Media Attack ACORN
Founded in 1970 , ACORN ( Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now ) “ is the nation ’s largest grassroots community organization of low and moderate income people with over 400,000 member families organized into more than 1,200 neighborhood chapters in about 75 cities across the country . ”
As the nation ’s preeminent community organizing group , it backs a living wage , opposes predatory lending and foreclosures , supports affordable housing , better public schools , welfare reform , voting rights , rebuilding New Orleans , and other social and economic justice issues .
For many months as a result , right - wing extremists have tried to discredit its successes online and through the media .
Led by Fox News , Lou Dobbs , and others , it ’s accused of financial corruption , massive voter fraud , and other indiscretions , mostly fabricated to destroy the group ’s credibility , cut off its funding , and harm other community organizing efforts .
However , compared to corporate fraud and abuse scandals , ACORN ’s occasional missteps are minor , insignificant , and undeserving of inflammatory media headlines .
Nonetheless recent news stories featured false accusations that ACORN engages in prostitution nationwide .
The supposed evidence came from two right - wing filmmakers ( Hannah Giles and James O’Keefe ) posing as prostitute and pimp , conveniently videotaped for airing .
In prime time especially , Fox News , Lou Dobbs and others featured it nightly .
On September 14 , Dobbs reported “ another pimp and prostitute scandal at the left - wing activist organization ACORN .
For the third time , ACORN workers for the left - wing advocacy group ( got ) caught on hidden camera breaking the law .
Now calls from Congress to investigate and cut off public funding are growing . ”
According to Fox News ‘ Bill O’Reilly , “ With more than 30 criminal ‘ convictions ’ on its resume , the organization cannot be trusted . ”
Based on no credible evidence , other FNC reports accuse ACORN of “ operat ( ing ) as a criminal enterprise , ” including prostitution , running a prostitution ring , filing false documents with taxing and other government authorities , bank fraud , violating immigration laws , transporting women and children to America for immoral purposes , and impairing the welfare of minors .
More evidence of reprehensible innuendo , distortion , deceit , and misinformation from major media paid liars .
It ’s why web sites like this one gain followers .
Two people died and at least 16 more were hospitalized after they fell ill while sitting in a sweat lodge at a New Age retreat center in Arizona , the authorities said Friday .
The dead and injured were part of a group of about 48 people who were taking part in a ceremony on Thursday evening inside a sweat lodge resembling a large sauna at the Angel Valley Retreat Center in Sedona , the red-rocks - clustered resort town about 115 miles north of Phoenix .
Officials with the Verde Valley fire department said Friday that the event had been going on for about two hours when several people fell sick , complaining of feeling light - headed .
When emergency crews arrived about 5:20 p.m. , they found four people in such bad condition that they were flown to Flagstaff Medical Center , and about 14 others were in need of treatment , the authorities said .
Two of the sick  identified only as a man and a woman  later died .
Officials had not released the cause of their deaths as of Friday night .
That evening , at least three people were still listed in critical condition at Flagstaff Medical Center , the authorities said .
It ’s been a long time since Fox News , which avidly cultivates its outsider status , got to play the underdog .
But after White House aides recently labeled the top-rated cable news channel “ a wing of the Republican Party ” and argued that it is not a news network , Fox News found itself back in a spot it relishes : firing back at a more powerful adversary .
The salvos by administration officials have rallied liberals who complain that the channel has a conservative agenda .
The activist group MoveOn instantly jumped in the fray , urging Democrats to stay off Fox News programs .
But the White House ’s stance also gave extra lift to the network at a time when it is on track to record its best ratings year ever .
This year , Fox News has averaged nearly 1.2 million viewers across all its programming , a 16 % increase over the same period last year , according to Nielsen .
In the two weeks since aides to President Obama took after the coverage , the audience has been 8 % larger than the previous two weeks .
If anything , the Obama administration has succeeded in reinforcing Fox News ’ identity as a thorn in the side of the establishment -- a role the network loves to play .

“ We may be No. 1 , but there is sort of an insurgent quality to Fox News , ” said senior political analyst Brit Hume .
“ And that ’s kind of our attitude : ‘ Hoist a Jolly Roger , pull out our daggers and look for more throats to slit . ’
This is tremendous fodder for us .
My lord , we ’ve been living on it . ”
Glenn Beck , the network ’s newest star , gleefully unveiled a red telephone on his set , saying it was a special line for the White House to use to correct any mistakes he makes .
Sean Hannity proudly labeled his program “ Not White House approved . ”
And Bill O’Reilly repeatedly hammered the White House in his nightly editorial .
“ There is something very disturbing about the Obama administration fighting harder against Fox News than against the Taliban , ” he said last week .
Administration officials said they anticipated that Fox would try to capitalize on their remarks but felt they had to push back against the network ’s torrent of criticism .

“ They were misrepresenting our programs and policies , ” said White House Communications Director Anita Dunn .
“ They were attacking members of the administration .
And they were organizing political opposition on their shows .
We wanted to set the record straight . ”
Fox News executives said the administration is failing to distinguish between their commentators and news programs .
“ They talk about the opinion shows and they say , ‘ See , you ’re not doing journalism , ’ ” said Michael Clemente , the channel ’s senior vice president of news , calling the contention that Fox News is not a news organization a “ smear . ”
“ I think it reinforces the fact that on the news side , we ’re the people that will ask the right questions , whatever those questions are , ” he added .

The back - and - forth is the latest chapter in a tortured relationship between Obama and Fox News .
Early in the 2008 presidential campaign , he mostly steered clear of the channel amid pressure from liberal activists , forcing the cancellation of two Fox - hosted debates .
But as the Democratic primary race moved to swing states such as Indiana , Obama stepped up his appearances on the network .
He even granted O’Reilly a sit - down in September .
Tensions returned after Obama ’s victory .
The network gave ample coverage to the “ tea party ” rallies protesting the administration ’s spending , with its hosts urging viewers to participate .
Beck called Obama a racist and doggedly went after White House aides such as “ green jobs ” advisor Van Jones , slamming him for signing a petition questioning whether the U.S. had a role in the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
Jones ultimately resigned .
The story was belatedly picked up by the rest of the media , prompting editors at the New York Times and other news organizations to say they needed to watch the network more closely .
The idea of Fox News setting the news agenda alarmed White House officials , who decided to vocalize their criticism of its coverage to try to dissuade other reporters from following the network ’s lead .
Advertisement
“ I think the mainstream media has to ask themselves at a time when there are wars , when there is a bad economy , when there are huge challenges facing this country , whether they want to chase a narrow political agenda , ” Dunn said .
It ’s unclear whether the tactic will be effective .
Bill Keller , executive editor of the New York Times , said that “ if someone else breaks a good story , and if -- important if -- our own reporting backs it up , we ’ll run it .
Even if it ’s Fox . ”
Los Angeles Times Editor Russ Stanton took a similar stance , saying , “ We would follow any news story -- after confirming the facts and figuring out a way to advance it -- if we believed it was important to the readers of the Los Angeles Times , regardless of the organization or individual that broke it . ”
News executives at the other broadcast and cable television networks declined to comment on the dust - up .
But there are signs that some in their ranks are uncomfortable with the White House ’s tack .
Last week , ABC senior White House correspondent Jake Tapper quizzed Press Secretary Robert Gibbs about the appropriateness of the White House determining what constituted a news organization .

On Thursday , the Washington bureau chiefs of the networks balked when the Treasury Department sought to exclude Fox from a series of interviews with executive pay czar Kenneth Feinberg that was being filmed with a pool camera .
The bureau chiefs insisted that Fox be included because it was part of the five - network pool , said CBS bureau chief Christopher Isham .
“ There was no debate , ” he said .
A senior administration official said the White House had not told Treasury to exclude Fox , and Gibbs told correspondent Major Garrett it had been a mistake .
On NBC last week , Obama tried to play down the dispute .
“ What our advisors have simply said is that we are going to take media as it comes , ” he said .
“ And if media is operating basically as a talk radio format , then that ’s one thing .
And if it ’s operating as a news outlet , then that ’s another thing .
But it ’s not something I ’m losing a lot of sleep over . ”

Dawn reports that about 30,000 Pakistani troops on Saturday moved into South Waziristan , a stronghold of the Mahsud tribe , whence have sprung important leaders of the Tehrik - i Taliban Pakistan or Pakistani Taliban Movement .
One such leader , Baitullah Mahsud , was killed by a US drone strike this past August .
The fighting continued for a second day on Sunday morning , with the army meeting stiff resistance .
South Waziristan has a population of about 500,000 .
It is estimated to have 10,000 armed religious extremists , of whom about 1500 are foreigners , mostly dissident Uzbeks from secular Uzbekistan just north of Afghanistan .
Pakistani officials allege that 80 % of the terrorism in Pakistan emanates from militants based in South Waziristan .
Aljazeera English reports on the beginning of the Pakistani army campaign against the Taliban and allied tribes in Waziristan .
AP also did a video report on the beginning of the campaign :
Aljazeera English reports on the frantic civilian exodus from Waziristan :
The USG Open Source Center translates an interview at the GEO Urdu- language satellite news station .
This paragraph comparing the new operation to that in Swat last spring struck me as scary : “ Not only that the resistance here would be much stronger than that in Swat but also the Taliban will mainly retaliate in the other parts of the country .
Secondly , the Swat Taliban did not have many routes to flee the area nor was Swat located near the Afghan border from where they could receive reinforcement or where they could flee . ”
Here is the rest :
‘ Pakistan : Analyst Says Stronger Taliban Resistance Likely Against Army Operation
Words within double slantlines as received in English
Geo News TV
Saturday , October 17 , 2009 . . .
Document Type : OSC Translated Text . . .
Now we will discuss Waziristan operation .
We have senior analyst Salim Safi with us on telephone line :
( Begin live relay ) ( anchorperson Gharida Faruqi ) Mr Safi , the Swat operation was very successful and was completed in a short time but certain circles are expressing doubts about Waziristan operation .
You are one of them .
You have also written a / / column / / in today ’s Jang .
Why are you opposing this operation ?
( Safi ) Gharida , in fact , I believe that unless certain other aspects of this issue are resolved we will probably not be able to achieve the desired results only by launching an operation in South Waziristan .
Not only that the resistance here would be much stronger than that in Swat but also the Taliban will mainly retaliate in the other parts of the country .
Secondly , the Swat Taliban did not have many routes to flee the area nor was Swat located near the Afghan border from where they could receive reinforcement or where they could flee
But you can see that foreigners are present in South Waziristan .
Foreigners are also there in Ahmadzai Wazir area .
The operation is not going on in North Waziristan but you see that on the very first day a retaliatory action was taken there .
The other thing is that during this time ….( pauses )
Though the government has made full preparations this time and it seems that in this operation the forces will show greater seriousness than the previous operations and aerial and land power will also be used extensively .
But on the other hand the Taliban have also made full preparations in that area and then they have // sleeper cells / / in different parts of the country who have sent their activists in different areas and especially the banned organizations … ( interrupted )
( Faruqi ) Mr Safi , you are talking about the preparation of the Taliban and you said that this time a stronger resistance might be faced .
What type of greater resistance ?
What type of greater preparation ?
( Safi )
In fact , during the past two or three years when operations were initially launched in Waziristan there were only local Taliban or Arab , Uzbek or Chechen militants with were there them .
But during the past three - four years this development has taken place that the Taliban have established links with the banned organizations of Pakistan — some jihadi and sectarian outfits .
Leadership of most of these organizations is either in their hands or the Al - Qa’ida is providing // coordination / / among these groups .
So , now trained people from those outfits are present in every nook and corner of the country .
As we have seen in the past week mostly these were the elements active in the attack on the GHQ and in the attacks in Lahore .
( Faruqi )
Thank you very much , Salim Safi , for talking to Geo News .

ON BOARD COAST GUARD FLIGHT ABOVE BEAUFORT SEA , Oct 2 ( Reuters ) - Out in the Arctic Ocean , about 200 miles ( 322 km ) north of the nearest human settlement , the future of the world ’s climate is written in the patterns of ice patches on the water ’s surface .
Old , “ multiyear ” ice -- the glue that holds the polar ice cap together and forms the Arctic ’s defense against encroaching warming -- is slowly disintegrating , a process that is plain to see from the air .
Thick ice floes used to be kilometers ( miles ) wide just over a decade ago , said Jim Overland , a sea-ice expert with the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , who has been surveying the site since the 1990s .
Now the narrow floes -- with bright - white tops and a blue underwater glow -- are just meters ( yards ) wide , observed Overland as he studied the patterns from the window of a U.S. Coast Guard C - 130 aircraft .
The dense , high - quality ice is not coming back , Overland said .
“ That ’s a one - way street , ” he said “ We have the same amount of multiyear ice this year as last year , even though we have a little more ice overall . ”
Overland said while there was broad awareness of the harmful effect of sea-ice loss on polar bears and other Arctic animals , its impact on weather elsewhere in the northern hemisphere and the rest of the world was potentially more critical .
A warmed Arctic Ocean emits heat into the atmosphere that drastically alters weather patterns , he said .
“ That ’s the big question : Who cares about the Arctic ?
Well , it ’s going to change the whole heat engine of the planet , ” he said .
Scientists have voiced concern for years about the alarming decline in the size of the Arctic ice cap , which functions as a giant air conditioner for the planet ’s climate system as it reflects sunlight back into space .
As a greater portion of the ice melts , larger expanses of darker sea water are exposed , absorbing more sunlight and adding to the global warming effect attributed to rising levels of heat - trapping greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere by human activity .
SMALL CHANGE , BIG EFFECT
Arctic ice cover this year was 23 percent greater than the record - low levels of 2007 , according to the latest data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado , which has been keeping records for 30 years .
But it was the third - lowest coverage on record , after 2007 and 2008 .
The one - year ice that accounts for the increase over 2007 and 2008 -- pancake - flat pieces with finger - like surface ridges etched by movements of the water -- is no substitute for the thick multiyear ice , Overland said .
“ It ’s thinner .
It ’s more broken up .
And it moves faster , ” he said .
“ And all of that contributes to melting earlier in the season . ”
For the Arctic , incremental temperature changes have multiplied effects .
An increase of just a few degrees -- or even fractions of degrees -- can mean the difference between freeze and thaw .
Thaw leads to more thaw , as dark - colored sea surfaces absorb solar radiation that would bounce off white snow and ice .
The additional warming caused by the melt itself , along with the greater absorption of solar heat into the now - uncovered northern waters , amplifies the warming in the polar region .
That feedback phenomenon is why the Arctic is warming at about three times the global rate and its ecosystems are changing so much , according to the International Panel on Climate Change .
Total summer ice cover in the Arctic Ocean is only about half the level it was in 1950 , according to the IPCC .
This year ’s summer minimum was 20 percent below the 30 - year average , according to the National Snow and Ice Data Center .
In the Beaufort Sea , winter is already encroaching just days after the autumnal equinox .
Evidence is in the thin film of new ice appearing between existing multiyear and single - year chunks .
But the seasonal build - up will be slower than in the past , Overland predicted .
There was “ no indication of freezing whatsoever ” in the open water next to the grouped ice , he said as the C - 130 flew south to land at Barrow , Alaska .
“ In contrast to previous years , there ’s absolutely no freezing outside that cluster . ”
Russian troops surrounded a village in 2000 during the second chechan war and killed all of the 75 prisoners using torture tactics .
I would like to understand why Python is so much more popular than Ruby .
Much of the software I 've seen supports Python for scripting ( e.g. Miro , OpenMoko , XBMC / Boxee ) , and people do n't seem to care so much for Ruby .
At the same time , people agree that Ruby is great for writing DSLs .
I do n't want a flame war or religious arguments .
I would like to understand what made Python win in this space .
Thanks so much for commenting !
A TV with a buy Button ?
I hope this is n’t the way you think of the Internet : A TV With a Buy Button
Unfortunately most businesses make this very assumption .
They assume that the best way to market their products and services online is the same way that we have done through traditional marketing channels like television .
They build marketing strategies using one method : Repetition
But this type of advertising is n’t a feasible strategy for small businesses using the Internet to sell products and services .
Here is why .
There ’s No Money In It
My first attempt at starting a business ( which ended badly ) based its entire marketing strategy around print advertising in newspapers and direct mail .
I burned through a lot of cash .
Fast .
To my larger competitors , this was a great strategy but for a small start up with limited funds , there was no money in it .
I simply could n’t REPEAT my message enough times to my prospects to compete as a brand with these larger , more established businesses .
Chances are , you ca n’t either .
Repetition Is Avoided At All Cost
Traditional advertising strategy is rooted in the repetitive branding that takes place when you see a logo or hear a jingle hundreds if not thousands of times .
The Internet is used by billions of people each day to find information and entertainment .
But once we have seen a message , we do n’t want to see it again .
This does n’t lend itself well to traditional advertising methods .
Escaping your repetitive message is just a “ back button ” away .
There is another way .
Educate Your Market
I write and speak about using Content Marketing to establish yourself as an authority in your industry .
Using valuable and consistent content creation coupled with the free tools available to us on the Internet , you can create marketing that your prospect will SEEK .
I teach that the techniques and strategy around creating consistent and valuable content and delivering it to your target market through social media channels , email and blogging technology .

In the last weeks I played a lot with CouchDB and I love it .
I always used it from ruby but yesterday I tried to use it with flex .
I started a new Actionscript project called CouchDB Flex , you can browse the source from github .
The implementation is inspired by couchrest , but it ’s asynchronous because I use URLLoader internally .
Since the flash player does n’t support the PUT and DELETE HTTP methods , you must create an AIR project if you want to try the library .
You can find a compiled swc here , put it in your libs folder and you are ready to go .
Here a small example , but it ’s still in development , and a lot of functionality are not implemented yet .
CouchdbFlexExample.mxml : the main mxml file , it 's just a window with a textarea that will display the data loaded from CouchDB .
com/gravityblast/couchdbflexexample/Contact.as : the model I 'll save on CouchDB .
By default the model has a name and an email , but I can add more properties since it 's a dynamic class .
package com.gravityblast.couchdbflexexample { import com.gravityblast.couchdb.Document ; public dynamic class Contact extends Document { public var name : String ; public var email : String ; public function Contact ( ) { super ( ) ; } } }
com/gravityblast/couchdbflexexample/App.as : the main application , where I create a new Contact Document , and I load all the contacts using a view created with the Design and View classes .
package com.gravityblast.couchdbflexexample { import com.gravityblast.couchdb.CouchDb ; import com.gravityblast.couchdb.Database ; import com.gravityblast.couchdb.Design ; import com.gravityblast.couchdb.
View ; import com.gravityblast.couchdb.events.CouchRestEvent ; import com.gravityblast.couchdb.events.DocumentEvent ; import com.gravityblast.couchdb.events.ViewEvent ; import mx.events .

document as Contact ; contact.address = " Jack Street updated at " + ( new Date ( ) ) .
toString ( ) ; contact.save(this.contactUpdateHandler ) ; } private function contactUpdateHandler ( event: DocumentEvent ) : void { trace ( event.data ) ; View.load ( " contacts " , " all " , {} , this.contactsLoadHandler ) ; } private function contactsLoadHandler ( event : ViewEvent ) : void { for each ( var contact : Contact in event.documents ) { for ( var property : String in contact.attributes ) { this .log += property + " : " + contact [ property ]

I 'll write more about the library as soon as it's more stable .
Nothing is impossible .
Nothing is out of reach .
That 's the lesson we take away from today , boys and girls ( and men and women ) .
Not long after we switched to Gazelle , and instituted the request bounty system , a request popped up for Microsoft COFEE - a forensic tool supplied by Microsoft to law enforcement offices around the world .
You can Google it for more details , but the gist is that the tool was developed and distributed solely to law enforcement agencies .
Sounds tempting , right ?
And it was .
So much so that user after user voted for the request , adding to the ever - increasing bounty .
Everyone seemed to have a good laugh with it , figuring that no one would ever get their hands on it and actually upload it .
That was the staff consensus , at least .
Several imitators were uploaded and removed , users were warned , and the bounty remained .
Then , today , a user actually did it .
They got a copy of COFEE and uploaded it here .
The resourcefulness of our users never ceases to amaze us .
Suddenly , we were forced to take a real look at the program , its source , and the potential impact on the site and security of our users and staff .
And when we did , we did n't like what came of it .
So , a decision was made .
The torrent was removed ( and it is not to be uploaded here again . )
Just to be clear : we were not threatened by Microsoft or any law enforcement agency .
We have n't been contacted , nor has our host .
This was a decision made by the staff based on our own conversations and feelings about the security impact of having the software here .
We know some of you , perhaps the majority of you , wo n't agree with it .
To those that feel that way , we can only offer an apology and the explanation that we removed it for your security , and ours .
This is not an indication of any policy or rule changes going forward .
This is a one - time decision , for a unique situation .
This is not something we will do with other torrents or requests .
At this point , the software can probably be found elsewhere , for anyone who wants it .
We hope you all understand , and will continue searching out those rare items which attract huge request bounties .
Feel free to discuss this here , but this decision is final .
Thank you , all .
Lord Sacks was knighted in 2005 for services to interfaith relations
Europe is facing a population crisis because of attacks on religion by secular writers , Britain 's chief rabbi has said .
Lord Sacks blamed Europe 's falling birth rate on a culture of " consumerism and instant gratification " .
He said the continent was " dying " and accused its citizens of not being prepared for parenthood 's " sacrifices " .
He made his comments in a lecture for Christian think tank Theos in central London on Wednesday .
The 61 - year - old , who took his seat in the Lords last week , said : " Wherever you turn today - Jewish , Christian or Muslim - the more religious the community , the larger on average are their families .
" The major assault on religion today comes from the neo-Darwinians . "
' Massive sacrifices '
One of the leading " neo- Darwinians " is Richard Dawkins , whose bestseller The God Delusion argues the rise of religious fundamentalism has divided people around the world .
Lord Sacks said Europe was the most secular region in the world and the only continent seeing populations fall .
He said parenthood involved " massive sacrifices " of money , attention , time and emotional energy .
We are undergoing the moral equivalent of climate change and no - one is talking about it
Lord Sacks
Lord Sacks asked : " In [ modern Europe ] ... where will you find space for the concept of sacrifice for the sake of generations not born ? "
He continued : " Europe is dying , exactly as Polybius said about ancient Greece in the third pre-Christian century .
" We are undergoing the moral equivalent of climate change and no - one is talking about it . "
The chief rabbi was knighted in 2005 for services to the community and interfaith relations .
He has been chief rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the Commonweath for 18 years .
Link Building
The other part to SEO is Off - Page Optimization a technique involving link building which helps a website 's rank considerably .
Link building is the process of getting other webmasters to place a link on their site to your website .
Because Google and other major search engines rely on a voting system for their rankings , the process can be described in this simple formula : for each site that links in to your site , you get an extra vote in the search engine world .
In addition , if the site linking in to you has a high value , that is sometimes counted as a double vote .
The main idea is to have many relevant sites linking in to your site to raise your SEO value .
In order for other webmasters to want to link their sites to yours , you need to offer something unique on your site .
This will lead to other sites wanting to link to yours .
Authority to Spy on Americans Unclear as Patriot Act Expires Patriot Act under fire by House Dems , but White House wants renewal .
Nov. 30 , 2009  -- Rushed into law by Congress just weeks after Sept. 11 , 2001 three controversial provisions of the Patriot Act granting officials far - reaching surveillance and seizure powers in the name of national security , are due to expire this New Year 's Eve .
Two differing bills passed by the House and Senate judiciary committees in recent weeks will have to be reconciled in Congress , but only when the Senate is n't backlogged by health care , Democratic aides told ABC News .
" This critical legislation protects our national security , as well as our civil liberties , and the clock is ticking , " said Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner , R - Wisc. , an author of President Bush 's 2001 Patriot Act and former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee during the Bush administration .
Sensenbrenner urged the House and Senate to act quickly in reauthorizing the provisions before they expire at the end of this year .
That timing is unclear .
With so few weeks left in the year and the health care debate just beginning in the Senate , it 's possible that Congress will first vote for a temporary extension to prevent certain Patriot Act authorities from sunsetting , according to an aide .
With full support from the Obama administration , the Senate Judiciary Committee passed a bill last month reauthorizing the law that has in recent years sparked much controversy over rights to privacy protected under the Constitution , with some minor tweaks .
But House Democrats in the Judiciary Committee went much further reigning in executive authorities and raising the threshold of proof needed to legally seize Americans ' personal records and conduct wiretaps on their phones .
It also slapped on more restrictions , and required more government auditing , and reporting showing how the process could be modified to enhance civil liberties .
" We have the opportunity to fix the most extreme provisions of that law and provide a better balance , " said Rep. John Conyers , Jr. , D - Mich. , who introduced the House bill , which allows one provision of the Patriot Act to expire .
In renewing only two of the three sunsetting provisions , the House version has defied the White House , quietly pushing Congress to totally renew its predecessor 's law .
This is not a new debate .
Four years ago , then Sen. Barack Obama , D - Ill. , who taught constitutional law , voted down the same provisions along with all Senate Democrats , and insisted on changes to the bill that better protected libraries , limited clandestine search warrants , roving wiretaps , and FBI gag orders .
The end product was a compromised package that Sen.
Obama said was far from perfect , but that was better than what was passed by counterparts in the House , which in a role reversal voted to renew President Bush 's historically intrusive surveillance policies .
" This compromise does modestly improve the Patriot Act by strengthening civil liberties protections without sacrificing the tools that law enforcement needs to keep us safe , " he said in a speech on the Senate floor .
If passed again as the Obama administration has signaled it wants , the next Patriot Act reauthorization wo n't be until 2013 .
The expiring provisions of the Patriot Act are :
1. The Records provision .
This allows federal investigators with a court order to compel anyone to hand over " any tangible thing " showing " relevance " to a terrorist investigation from all business , hospitals , and some libraries .
According to the U.S. Attorney General 's office , there have been 220 such orders issued , but no major case to date has transpired because of information procured from them .
Both the Senate and the House bills renew the provision , but remove that presumption of " relevance " so that the burden of proof falls on the government to report facts and circumstances justifying what the items sought have to do with an investigation .
A higher threshold of proof is specified for library circulation records and patron lists in both bills , but the House goes further to add booksellers to that group .
2. The Roving Wiretaps provision .
The provision authorizes authorities to track a target by wiretapping any multiple lines of communication without specifically naming a target or what kind of communication they 're using to the FISA ( Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ) courts issuing the warrant .
The FISA court grants about 22 such warrants annually , according to a government document .
The House bill renews the roving wiretaps , but puts more restrictions on the government proving an unnamed target as a specific individual to prevent dragnet operations .
The Senate leaves the provision as is .
3. The Lone Wolf provision .
This provision allows authorities to make use of secret surveillance orders to spy on non-Americans if there is proof that they are engaged in a terrorist activities , but not necessarily involved with a terrorist organization or foreign power .
The Lone Wolf provision has never been used .
The House Judiciary Committee voted to allow the Lone Wolf provision to expire , stating that normal procedures for criminal investigations could be used instead ; the Senate voted to renew it .
Perhaps more important than the expiring provisions is one that is not set to expire at all .
Acquiescing to a coalition of 20 civil libertarian groups , House Democrats used the reauthorization process as the opportunity to place tough restrictions and an expiration date on a provision concerning administration subpoenas , or national security letters ( NSLs ) , fast becoming the central focus of this debate .
The secret letters are used by the FBI to compel third parties -- financial services such as Internet providers , travel and telephone companies -- to hand over client records like bank records , for instance , presuming they 're relevant to a terrorism investigation , but without having to get a court order .
" To fail to narrow this authority would be reckless , " said Michael German , formerly with the FBI and now policy counsel for ACLU 's Washington legislative office .
There were more than 192,000 known NSLs that were issued by the FBI between 2003 - 2006 , according to a government report .
The FBI 's 10 percent review of field office NSLs found at least 640 potential intelligence violations from 2003 through 2006 , according to the Justice Department Inspector General Glenn Fine .
His office issued reports citing underreporting and " serious misuse " of the secret letters issued by the FBI to obtain personal information sometimes not covered by the law .
After two reports since 2007 , the number of secret letters dropped , but rose again in 2008 to 24,744 in that year alone , according to the Department of Justice .
" Where the FBI is investigating a particle person , where the FBI has reasonable suspicion a person is acting for an agent or on behalf of a foreign terrorist organization , they have robust authorities , and that is perfectly appropriate and justifiable , " German told ABC News .
" But what the national security letters do is allow them [ the FBI ] to collect information about people they do n't suspect of doing anything wrong .
And that 's just a bridge too far , " he said .
The House agrees with the ACLU and voted to restrict the secret letters only to cases where officials can prove the suspect is a terrorist , engaged in terrorist activities , or are in contact with terrorists .
" Unless we get it right , I think we risk not just shredding our constitution which I 'm not in favor of , but shredding our way of life , " said Rep. Jane Harman , Ranking Member of the House Intelligence Committee .
But Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner , R - Wisc. , denies that any civil liberties have been violated related to the use of any provision of the Patriot Act , and points out that the same secret letters existed before the Patriot Act was enacted to fight terrorism at home .
" The Patriot Act has been misused by some as a springboard to launch limitless allegations that are not only unsubstantiated but are false and irresponsible .
The fact remains that the USA Patriot Act is vital to maintaining America 's safety , " he said .
" The Obama Administration 's support of these reauthorizations will hopefully put an end to the myths and the hyperbole that surrounds the Patriot Act , as it is a needed piece of legislation to keep America and her citizens safe and secure , " he said .
In recent weeks , the White House gave its blessing to the Senate version , co-sponsored by Judiciary Chairman Patrick J. Leahy , D - Vt. , and Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D - Calif. , extending all three provisions without placing as many restrictions as the House version .
" We believe these measures will promote appropriate standards , oversight , and accountability , especially with respect to how information about United States persons is retained and disseminated , without sacrificing the operational effectiveness and flexibility of the underlying tools need to protect our citizens from terrorism and to facilitate the collection of vital foreign intelligence and counterintelligence information , " U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder wrote in the letter expressing strong support to Leahy and Feinstein .
The government cites the case of Najibullah Zazi , an Afghan man who is a U.S. citizen and found to have trained in al Qaeda camps , as proof that the Patriot Act should be renewed for future interceptions by the FBI .
Zazi was arrested in September on charges he was planning an attack on American soil .
As for the abuse of the secret letters issued by the FBI , the Obama administration said it sees room for more oversight .
U.S. Inspector General Genn A. Fine said in testimony to the Senate :
" As Congress considers reauthorizing provisions of the Patriot Act , it must ensure through continual and aggressive oversight that the FBI uses these important and intrusive investigative authorities appropriately . "
Critics of President Obama accused him of flip - flopping on his position as a candidate when he voted to renew a law last year allowing the use of wiretaps and gave immunity to telecom companies that cooperated under Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program , made public in 2005 .
Canada ’s Intrawest , a pillar in the ski resort development industry and host to next year ’s Winter Olympics in Whistler , is selling Summit County ’s Copper Mountain to Utah - based Powdr Corp .
The deal , announced today , is expected to close in December , pending approval by the U.S. Forest Service .
In a statement released today , company officials said the deal will have no impact on Copper operations , including its pass products and vacation reservations .
Intrawest acquired Copper from a Delaware investment group in 1996 .
The $ 19 - million deal for Copper and Whistler in British Columbia made Intrawest the second - largest ski resort operator in North America , behind Vail Resorts , which in the same year acquired Summit County ’s Breckenridge and Keystone ski hills from Ralcorp Holdings .
The deal marked the beginning of the North American ski industry ’s merger mania , which saw companies paying astronomical prices for ski hills .
The 1996 Copper deal also made Colorado a battleground for the industry ’s biggest players , Vail Resorts and Intrawest .
A season - pass pricing war would soon follow as the behemoths jockeyed for top position in the suddenly red - hot resort real estate game .
When Intrawest landed Copper , company officials promised an immediate injection of $ 26 million for new lifts and other infrastructure .
Over the next decade , the company promised to spend $ 340 million on a new base village .
Powdr Corp. is based in Utah , where it owns Park City Mountain Resort .
The company owns six other resorts : Killington and Pico in Vermont , Mt. Bachelor in Oregon , Boreal and Soda Springs resorts in California and Las Vegas Ski and Snowboard Resort in Nevada .

President Dmitry Medvedev believes Afghan heroin is a security threat Russia is highlighted as the country that bears the brunt of the ill - effects of the Afghan drug trade by a UN Office on Drugs and Crime report .
The BBC's Stephen Eke reports on Moscow 's growing concern about the problem .
The head of Russia 's federal drug control service has recently blamed lack of effective border controls , and accused coalition forces in Afghanistan of doing " next to nothing " to tackle drug production .
The result , he said , is an estimated 2.5 million heroin addicts in Russia alone , creating what he called a lost generation of young people .
President Medvedev calls Afghan heroin a threat to Russia 's national security .
And it has led to serious tensions between Moscow and Washington - Russia accuses Nato , and more often the US , of failing to make enough effort to tackle heroin production in Afghanistan .
Since the collapse of communism , Russia 's southern borders have been much more vulnerable .
Poor border controls
The greater part of Afghan heroin enters the territory of the former Soviet Union through Afghanistan 's borders with Tajikistan and Turkmenistan .
It then travels westwards across Kazakhstan , before entering the central and Ural regions of Russia , where there are intense focal spots of heroin addiction .
It is estimated that there are somewhere between 1.5 million and six million heroin addicts in Russia
Seizures of heroin by police and border guards remain very low .
The Russian medical authorities say overdoses are now killing more than 80 people every day .
In addition , Russia has seen hundreds of thousands of HIV and hepatitis infections , as a result of intravenous drug abuse .
Precise figures are not available , but it is estimated that there are somewhere between 1.5 million and six million heroin addicts in Russia .
Moscow co-operates with the UN and with Western experts in its efforts to tackle heroin addiction , but relations have sometimes been tense .
Many European specialists consider Russian approaches to preventing and treating heroin addiction as confused .
Methadone substitution therapy , for example , is illegal in Russia , a country where alternative , scientifically unproven treatments are often preferred .

In honour of this month being “ Movember ”  I have decided to write about one of the most infamous muzzies .
One might even go so far as to call it the Dirtiest Muzzy of All Time .
I ’m speaking , of course , of that filthy little Adolf Hitler muzzy .
Before we get into the meat and potatoes of this issue , I ’d like to clarify that I am not a Hitler fan , nor do I think anything he did was good .
He was an evil motherfucker .
I ’m speaking only of his facial hair , which retained its innocence throughout its career .
I do n’t believe it ’s necessary to give you any background information on Adolf Hitler but his moustache does have a bit of a back - story .
The correct name for this style of nose neighbour is the “ toothbrush moustache . ” 
It has also been called the “ 1/3 moustache ”  and the “ soul stache . ” 
According to Wikipedia , it became popular in the 1920s as the working class answer to the flamboyant “ Kaiser - style ”  moustaches of the upper class .
Fast forward to today .
If you were to see a man walking down the street sporting combed - over hair and a toothbrush muzzy , you would most likely think to yourself , “ Wow , look at that dirty Hitler moustache . ” 
You can argue , but I believe you would instantly associate negative feelings with that person .
This is amazing and perhaps the only case of its kind in history .
( If you can think of another , I would love to hear it . )
For this reason , you will almost never see the Hitler moustache .
Think about that .
Hitler was so evil that he made a certain type of facial hair socially unacceptable .
Allow that to sink in .
Imagine if you did something so outrageously evil that your current hairstyle was forever associated with your deeds .
Some might say that the Hitler moustache has disappeared because it ’s not fashionable .
I direct your attention to the waxed - tip Texas moustache that you have no doubt seen on occasion .
This moustache is hardly fashionable , yet a few die - hards ( God bless them ) like my Uncle Ron refused to let it go .
I ’d like to remind you of another famous face that celebrated the square lip warmer : Charlie Chaplin’s .
Nobody would ever say “ Look at that Charlie Chaplin moustache .
Is n’t that just lovable ? ” 
Most people would almost certainly see Hitler smiling back at them before they would see The Tramp .
That ’s because Hitler was so godawful that he made you forget anybody else ever wore that style of moustache .
While that ’s not an admirable feat , it ’s definitely noteworthy .
Let ’s have a look at some other notoriously evil figures in history .
There ’s no better place to start than with the Devil himself .
The Devil is popularly depicted as being red , carrying a pitchfork , perhaps with horns and a goatee or one of those skinny molester moustaches ( the molestache ) .
Both of those styles of facial hair are still socially acceptable , though the latter is questionable , and the creator of all evil proudly rocks them .
Even a small child dressing as a devil for Halloween is rarely frowned upon , unless it ’s Junior Healey from Problem Child .
Some historians believe the number 666 actually stands for Nero , the Roman Emperor who was particularly harsh on Christians , and not Satan .
Yet nobody would think you a bad person for having a goofy , curly bowl - cut like Nero did .
The same is true at the opposite end of the spectrum .
If you saw a man with a thick beard and long hair , you would n’t think “ he must possess the qualities of Jesus . ” 
You would think , “ Get a job , you greasy hippie . ” 
If you plan to participate in Movember , No - Shave November , Neck Beard November or whatever the month means to you , be fresh .
Be original .
Be innovative .
While there ’s nothing to be said for being evil , there is something to be said for having a dirty muzzy that will never be forgotten .

Witnesses and students involved in the incident said a group of 15 to 20 men , who some described as MSU football players , stormed into the dormitory and hit and injured about seven students , some of them women .
Police and university officials were tight - lipped Monday about what witnesses have described as a multiple - person assault that happened at about 9:30 p.m. Sunday in the Rather Hall lounge .
Brent Mitchell , a communication junior who said he was sent to Lansing ’s Sparrow Hospital after being punched in the face , said some of the men wore ski masks , but others were recognized as football team members .
“ I walked up and said , ‘ It is n’t worth it . ’
A guy with dreadlocks hit me and in the scuffle slapped , hit females to get them out of the way , ” Mitchell said .
MSU police directed all questions regarding the incident to University Relations , which issued a statement saying police were investigating an altercation involving several people .
MSU spokesman Terry Denbow said the fight involved multiple victims and suspects .
MSU associate athletics director John Lewandowski said questions about the incident should be directed to Denbow .
Denbow said he was not aware of any arrests and did not know further details about injuries sustained by those involved .
“ Investigation is continuing , ” he said .
“ I ca n’t go beyond that . ”
He would not comment on whether the men involved were members of the football team .
“ It ’s always my policy not to identify people by any activity they are involved in , ” he said .
“ You would n’t say members of debate team or Sigma Chi .
It ’s important to be consistent . ”
Mitchell said members of his fraternity , Iota Phi Theta , had just finished a potluck event and were folding chairs in the lounge when the men entered .
The men said they were looking for a man who had been involved in a spat with one of them the night before during an Iota Phi Theta event at The Small Planet , 16800 Chandler Road , Mitchell said .
Mitchell said he was struck after the men realized the person they sought was n’t there .
He said the altercation lasted for about a minute before the men left .
Mechanical engineering sophomore Andrew Green said he saw one of the men hit another student on his way out .
“ He was coming downstairs and looked at him and punched him in the jaw , ” Green said .
Journalism freshman Mitch Lex said he entered the lounge as police arrived .
About eight police officers were in the lobby and blood was on the floor , Lex said .
Before bystanders were asked to leave , Lex said he saw one injured man .
“ There was some medic treating this kid sitting in lounge area , ” he said .
“ It looked like he had a baseball in his cheek . ”
Mitchell said , above all , he was upset the event symbolizing the end of a week of community service ended with violence .
“ Physically , I ’m okay , ” he said .
“ But I ’m just saddened that ( the event ) ended the way it did . ”

Los Angeles could be facing a $ 1 - billion deficit by the time Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa wraps up his second term in 2013 , a dire forecast driven primarily by escalating employee pension costs and stagnant tax revenues , the city ’s top budget analyst said today .
The grim budget outlook comes a day after the city ’s credit rating was downgraded by Fitch Ratings , which will probably make it more expensive for the city to borrow money .
City Administrative Officer Miguel Santana , L.A. 's top budget official , told the City Council that deep , severe cuts to departments and services are unavoidable if the city hopes to repair its finances , and that both the mayor and council must consider creative ways to raise revenue , including privatizing the Los Angeles Convention Center and L.A. Zoo .
Closing the budget shortfalls in the years ahead also will require significant reform of the city pension systems , such as creating a lower tier of benefits for retiring city employees .
That would require voter approval , Santana told the council .

Type fonts is a bit trickier ( but some LaTeX distributions like MiKTeX ease their use ) .
Some bleeding edge distributions like XeTeX even provide support for OpenType fonts , which is the latest and greatest font format .
However , running these distributions with LyX is still tricky ( but might improve in the future ) .
If you want to keep the look of the default fonts , you have several possibilities .
Choose the font AE ( Almost European ) in Document →Settings → Fonts
Caveat : ae are virtual fonts , they ' steal ' the T1 fonts from other packages .
Therefore the characters do not match as good as the ones from a real font .
Also , not all symbols are available with ae , e.g. the French ' guillemets ' .
For using the guillemets with ae , you have to install the package aeguill .
It is loaded in the preamble with
\usepackage[ec ] {aeguill}
A better solution is to use the Type 1 replacement for Computer Modern : Choose the font Latin Modern in Document →Settings →Fonts .
If LaTeX claims that the font is not installed , install the font , reconfigure LyX ( Tools → Reconfigure ) , and try again .
Alternatively , you can also try one of the other Type 1 fonts that ship with LaTeX ; for instance Times or Palatino .
Caveat : Times , as the name indicates , is designed for printing newspaper with small columns .
Therefore the letters are smaller than in other fonts , what makes them improper for one - column documents .
To use Times select
Times as Roman font
Helvetica scaled to 90 % or 92 % ( as you like )
Courier
To use Palatino select
Palatino as Roman font
Helvetica scaled to 90 % or 92 % ( as you like )
Courier
See also section 3.7.2 " Document Font and Font size " in the LyX User 's Guide or the FAQ for the TEX FAQ ( keyword=fonts ) [ tex.ca.uk ] .
This is done in the document settings under PDF Properties
For more information about this , see LyX's User 's Guide manual , section PDF Properties .
What you still can't do is encrypt your document .
If you want to define what the reader is allowed to do with your document , you have to use Adobe Acrobat ( open your PDF with Acrobat and set the properties ) .
Note , however , that quite a range of the properties ( including encryption ) can also be set with the free tool pdftk , which is available for several platforms ( whereas Adobe Acrobat is not available for , say , UNIX ) .
If you are using for example Algorithm floats you run into problems with LyX and hyperref .
hyperref needs to be loaded before the algorithm package .
Unfortunately LyX loads ' native ' packages before the packages defined in Latex Preamble .
A workaround is to _not_ use Algorithm floats ( preventing LyX to load the package ) and instead define your float in ERT .
See http://www.mail-archive.com/lyx-users@lists.lyx.org/msg51007.html for details .
An advantage of this method is that you can define your own caption names e.g. ' Listing '
Yes .
Use the LaTeX package pdfcomment .
Here is a module that adds some native LyX - support for that package .
As of Adobe Acrobat 7 ( pro ) you can set the permissions of a PDF so that other users can insert annotations with the free Adobe Reader >= 7.0 .
By default , this is not allowed .
Unfortunately , there is no way yet to change this special permission outside of Acrobat .
Due to a very rigid licensing policy ( of Adobe ) it is unlikely that this will change in the future .
There are several methods :
Put the text you do not want to export in comments or notes .
( Warning : This will change pagination and may cause problems with cross-references . )
Make a PDF of the entire document , then use Ghostscript to produce a PDF of selected pages , as in the following ( which extracts pages 3 through 5 inclusive from sourcefile.pdf ) :
gsc -dFirstPage=3 -dLastPage=5 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite - sOutputFile=test.pdf -dBATCH -dNOPAUSE sourcefile.pdf
Use a PDF printer driver ( such as PDFCreator for the Windows platform or cups - pdf on Linux ) that can output selected pages .
Generate the entire document in PDF from LyX , load it into your favorite PDF viewer , print it to the PDF driver and extract just the pages you want .
Install the pdftk tool kit and run something like
pdftk sourcefile.pdf cat 130-140 output test.pdf
Look at the \includeonly command ( but note that it does not work in recent releases , due to the handling of temp files ) .
You are using package " hyperref " and you have at least two pages " 1 " . == > recommended hyperref options : plainpages=false , pdfpagelabels
If the pages were labled differently ( for example : documentclass book with \frontmatter and \mainmatter the pages are labeled " i " and " 1 " ) , then the problem is solved .
If there is a title page without a printed page number , you can set the page counter to zero , for example .
Or \ thepage can be redefined , eg :
\ begingroup \renewcommand { \thepage}{title} % commands that generates the title page
ewpage \endgroup
Other options :
If there are no references and such stuff on the pages " 1 " , you can ignore the warning .
Option " hypertexnames=false " solves the warning , but then index links , \autoref will not work correctly .
The following is a short digest of this thread .
The Orientation comment is allowed in eps files .
Unfortunately it is interpreted differently by different programs
Some programs interpret " Orientation Landscape " as " this file is already in landscape orientation " , while others interpret it as " this file should be in landscape orientation , therefore it should be rotated by 90 degrees . "
This makes it difficult to implement a unique solution to eps file conversion in LyX , and to get the same output in dvi , ps , and pdf .
Ghostcript has a - dAutoRotatePages= switch , which is activated by default in ps2pdf and de-activated by default in recent versions of epstopdf .
if the rotation comes after DVI -> PS -> PDF , export to PS and try
ps2pdf -dAutoRotatePages= / None foo.ps
if the rotation comes after pdflatex , each figure should be separately converted using epstopdf ( check with
lyx - dbg files -e pdf foo.lyx
supposing pdf is the format associated to pdflatex ) :
if epstopdf is used , you may upgrade , or add the switch manually .
if ps2 pdf is used , the file is recognised as PS instead of EPS , you may normalize it .
Difference of ps2pdf , dvipdfm (x ) and pdflatex
LyX supports three different ways of producing PDF files .
This is because all of them have their specific pros and cons .
Also see http://mintaka.sdsu.edu/GF/bibliog/latex/LaTeXtoPDF.html
Traditionally , you converted your LaTeX source file to a DVI file , which could then be converted to PostScript with dvips .
This , in turn , can be converted to a PDF file by ps2pdf ( LyX does all those steps automatically for you if you select PDF ( which is in fact ps2 pdf ) as output format :
latex dvips ps2 pdf text .
tex
-------> text.dvi -------> text.ps
--------> text.pdf
This basically requires all the graphics to be EPS files .
But that 's not a major problem , as LyX converts all files to the appropriate format if needed ( however , if you have the choice , using EPS as native format is recommended ) .
The main advantage of this method ( especially compared with PDFLaTeX ) is that the resulting PDF file is almost always much smaller .
Also , dvi and postscript specials are supported ( the former is also true for dvipfdm ( x ) ) .
For instance , LyX's change tracking feature uses dvi specials to mark the changes in the output .
Hence , the change tracking marks are not visible in a PDF produced with PDFLaTeX .
If you do n't need PostScript output , you can save a step by going directly from DVI to PDF format by using dvipdfm or the newer dvipdfmx , which is intended to supersede the former :
latex dvipdfm ( x ) text.
tex -------> text.dvi -------> text.pdf
Once again , the figures must be Encapsulated PS .
So you have compact , scalable graphics – with one less step .
The pdflatex program produces a PDF file directly from the LaTeX source :
pdflatex text.tex --------> text.pdf
That looks pretty painless ; but there 's a catch .
While the previous methods employ EPS exclusively as the graphics format , pdflatex wo n't accept EPS directly at all : all the graphics have to be converted to JPEG , PNG , or PDF (! ) before compiling .
That is n't as bad as it sounds , because EPS can be " wrapped " with PDF headers to become PDF and still have scalable , vector graphics .
And JPEG is a compact format for photographs , while PNG is a very compact way to store images with sharp outlines without introducing compression artifacts . "
And LyX does it again automatically for you , if required .
The advantage of this method is that pdflatex is the most feature - rich converter program .
It features , for instance , character protusion and font expansion ( see this document for explanation ) , two microtypographical features that let your document look even better than " ordinary " LaTeX could ever achieve .
There is a cumbersome way to manually force update in acrobat reader : after you update the pdf file in LyX , go the acrobat reader and type Ctrl+r

If all the fonts are not embedded , and if the file is sent to other people who have not the non-embedded fonts installed , there will happen a font substitution which can make the pdf file unreadable .
This is the reason why most publishers simply do not accept PDF documents with non-embedded fonts ( and with bitmapped fonts , see the previous question ) .
If you want to check font embedding , you may either use the pdffonts command if it is available on your system , or use the File -> Properties - Fonts tag or similar on your favourite viewer .
To make sure that all fonts are embedded :
if you use the Latex -> ps2 pdf way , you have to make sure that GhostScript is called by ps2pdf with the right switches : in the converter section of the LyX preferences , add the following switches to the ps2pdf command ( in the PostScript - > Pdf ( ps2pdf ) converter : -dPDFSETTINGS=/ prepress -dMaxSubsetPct=100 -dSubsetFonts=true -dEmbedAllFonts=true
If this does not work , please check the PDF output level of your ps2pdf command : these switches do not work with output level less than or equal to 12 .
if you use pdflatex , recent distribution are OK with embedded fonts , make sure that you configuration files are correctly set if your distribution is old , cf. e.g. the testflow documentation .
Note that recent versions of the epstopdf script default to embedded fonts creation ( a good source of non-embedded fonts are eps files created by external applications ) .
See ** Help -> Customisation **
Post processing can be done by the Copier of a new File - Format .
This is called to copy the pdf from the temp dir to the destination , and can do any post - processing along the way - e.g. DigitalSigning ( below )
First :
In Tools -> Preferences ->
File Handling ->
File Formats
Create a new file format called " pdf signed ( pdflatex ) " , same as pdf ( pdflatex ) except
- shortname pdf9 ( this is what it will accept ) - shortcut none - copier : c:\sign\signpdf.bat $ $i $ $o
Then :
In Tools -> Preferences ->
File Handling ->Converters
Select " Latex ( pdflatex ) " in From Format and your new format " pdf signed ( pdflatex ) " in To Format Now the Add button can be pressed to create the new converter .
It should be identical in all respects to to the " latex to pdf( pdflatex ) " converter , the post - processing is done by the Copier in the new File Format .
Now you can run file -> export -> pdf signed ( pdflatex )
Unix : < insert a minimal unix script >
Windows :
Unfortunately the file parameters $ $i , $ $o use forward / not backslash \ as the directory separators ( thus dos commands can't find the files ) .
CopyIt. bat is a minimal batch file , which fixes the paths
rem Simple example Copier batch file for Lyx rem Lyx is passing unix paths ie / instead of backslash as dir separator rem you can use Msg to debug what is being passed into your batch files .
rem Msg * " Param1 is : " % 1 " Param2 is : " % 2 rem replace / with \ in path see : http://www.dostips.com/DtTipsStringManipulation.php#Snippets.Replace set P1=%1 set P1=%P1:/=\ % set P2=%2 set P2=%P2:/=\ % copy /y % P1 % %P2 %
Is there a direct way to get valid DOS filenames from $ $i $ $o ?
PDFs can be digitally signed , using an X509 code signing certificate .
Acrobat Reader can show and check signatures .
This can be for two purposes : Certification / Authentication / Tamperproofing ( signed once when created ie a hash check ) , and approvals ( signed by different people as it is read and approved ) .
My interest is in the first - Authentication / Tamperproofing .
Signatures can be just be a hidden digital hash or be visible on page with text ( " Digitally signed by Wimble Inc 2016.07.28 22:43:53 PST " ) and optionally graphics ( like a handwritten signature or logo ) .
PDFs can be signed using a normal code signing certificate or using an Adobe traceable certificate .
Using a normal certificate allows you to verify that files have not been tampered with , and allows people to check the certificate , and who it was signed by .
However Adobe Reader wo n't ( by default , out of the box ) verify the certificate itself .
( users can enable certificates trusted by Windows ( approve sites ) ( below ) certificate store , and this would work fine for company documents , or in a later legal case ) .
If you want an Adobe tracable certificate they appear to only be available on hardware ( usb stick ) and are very limited use eg 500 signs / year @ USD299 .
If you need a normal cert , I got a good deal , and help sorting out problems with Comodo from Mitchell at KSoftware ( approve sites )
§ To make Acrobat Reader DC use the windows certificate store , i.e. accept valid non-adobe certificates :
Edit -> Preferences ->Signatures -> Verification -> Windows Integration ->" Trust All root certificates in the Windows certificate store for : "
Check all checkboxes .
So what I can do is use my normal code signing certificate to provide some tamperproofing of documents put on a website .
While I can do binary compare of pdfs on my own website , once they are copied to other sites - which they are - signing provides some protection against tampering ( adding javascript attacks , changing company name etc ) .
This is also good for emailed quotes where prices or terms and conditions could be altered later .
A digital signature makes it much easier to show in court , 3 years later , that an emailed document was altered , than trying to prove the customers copy is a fake and not your copy
JsignPDF is used to sign the files .
It has a gui , but I want to automatically sign PDF's when printed or uploaded , so I use a batch file signpdf.
bat , below .
The Certificate has been saved as a .
PFX file , same as you use with signtool .
exe to sign EXE files .
A Timeserver is needed to give an externally verifed signing time ( Why ? ( approve sites ) ) .
The signature ( " Digitally signed by Wimble Inc 2016.07.28 22:43:53 PST " ) with no graphics is added on the bottom edge of page 1 .
To automatically sign pdf during export , you must create a new post - processing output format .
Set the Copier field to " c:\sign\signpdf.bat $ $i $ $o "
rem SIGNPDF .BAT Sign PDF file .
Works with LyX. usage signpdf < inpdf > OR signpdf < inpdf > < outpdf > rem change paths below to suit your system .

NamedDestinations are Adobes name for Anchors or Link Targets ie where URL's hyperlink to a specific point of a pdf .
Why ?
PDF 's have a major limitation as web pages : they are too big .
You need to hyperlink into specific information within them .
eg www.xxx.com/some.pdf#nameddest=chapter.4
This is theoretically easy , except that ( unlike bookmarks ) pdf readers do not display the NamedDestinations .
They are not bookmarks and you cannot link to or jump to bookmarks ( braindead as this seems )
How to make them ?
Hyperref generates them automatically , when exported with pdflatex ( ps2 pdf loses them ) .
Here are some from a file I generated with pdflatex .
section *.1 subsection .2.3 section .
2 Doc -Start page .1
The obvious problem with this is that they are named using section numbering , not section titles , so adding a new section breaks the link to content .
In a practical sense it renders them rather useless .
You can create a nameddest directly
Open in LyX a TeX code box by pressing C-L .
Now write : \hypertarget {The_Dest_Name}{} or \hypertarget {The_Dest_Name}{Some Visible Text}
You can create one along with a custom bookmark
Hyperref destination renaming explains hyperef naming .
You can rename the section names with a following label , with destlabel=true Put \usepackage [ destlabel=true ] {hyperref} in the preamble .
Unfortunately document -> properties -> pdf -> hperref options puts destlabel=true into hypersetup , which does not work .
\\ I have yet to find a way to have the section names automatically used as named destinations .
URL Limitations
Avoid spaces in the name - it works , but your URL's will be filled with " % 20 " .
Only one digit following a decimal point is retained for float values .
Individual parameters , together with their values ( separated by & or # ) , can be no greater then 32 characters in length .
You cannot use the reserved characters = , # , and & .
There is no way to escape these
special characters .
How to Explore the Named Destinations ?
Online Named - Destination Lister ( approve sites )
Unless you can find what they are , you can't use them .
Acrobat ( paid version ) appears to be the only gui tool to view named destinations .
Why do n't you request SumatraPDF to add this ( approve sites ) now
ListNamedDestinations.py( approve sites ) lists and sorts them .
( Python is with lyx if you do n't have it e.g. " C: \Program Files\LyX 2.2\Python\python.exe " ListNamedDestinations.py SomePDFFile.pdf
Pdf's are compresssed and unreadable normally .
Put this in the preamble to make them readable .
\ifx\pdfobjcompresslevel\undefined\else\pdfobjcompresslevel=0 \fi % Debug
How to call a named destination ?
www.abc.com/somepdf.pdf#subsection.2.3 www.abc.com/somepdf.pdf#page.3 www.abc.com/somepdf.pdf#AnchorName.0
Or you can explicitly specify ' nameddest '
www.abc.com/somepdf.pdf#nameddest=subsection.2.3
You can also call page numbers directly ( also pagemode , zoom , and view ) ( approve sites )

The case for Clojure is richly detailed and well - documented .
But sometimes you just want the elevator pitch .
OK , but I hope your building has four elevators :
" Concurrency is not the problem !
State is the problem .
Clojure 's sweet spot is any application that has state . "
" Do n't burn your legacy code !
Clojure is a better Java than Java . "
" Imperative programming and gratuitous complexity go hand in hand .
Write functional Clojure and get shit done . "
" Design Patterns are a disease , and Clojure is the cure . "
Any one of these ideas would justify giving Clojure a serious look .
The four together are a perfect storm .
Over the next few months I will be touring the United States and Europe to expand on each of these themes :
" e;Clojure 's sweet spot is any application that has state . " e ;
At Oredev , I will be speaking on Clojure and Clojure concurrency .
I will demonstrate how Clojure 's functional style simplifies code , and how mere mortals can use Clojure 's elegant concurrency support .
" Clojure is a better Java than Java . "
I will be speaking on Clojure and other Java . next languages at NFJS in Atlanta and Reston .
" Design Patterns are a disease , and Clojure is the cure . "
I will sing a siren song of Clojure to my Ruby brethren at RubyConf .
" Write functional Clojure and get shit done . "
At QCon , I will give an experience report on Clojure in commercial development .
Our results so far : green across the board .
Both Relevance and our clients have been pleased with Clojure .
Want to learn about all four of these ideas , and more ?
Early in 2010 , I will be co-teaching the Pragmatic Studio : Clojure with some fellow named Rich Hickey .
If you can't make it to any of the events listed above , at least you can follow along with the slides and code .
All of my Clojure slides are Creative - Commons licensed , and you can follow their development on Github .
Likewise , all the sample code is released under open - source licenses , including

Herschel Walker has had many roles in his life , from dominant college football player to author of a book about his mental health problems .
Along the way there was a stint as one of the faces of the United States Football League and a decade - long career in the N.F.L .
He also competed in the 1992 Olympics in the bobsled .
At age 47 , he is taking on a new challenge : mixed martial arts .
Walker has signed a multifight contract with Strikeforce , an MMA organization that is trying to challenge the Ultimate Fighting Championship .
Walker , who is not the first former N.F.L. player to try to start a career in the cage , has been seen in the crowds at high - profile mixed martial arts events recently .
He has trained in various martial arts going back to his college days .
Despite his age , this is not seen as a publicity stunt .
His background in the sport is more solid than Jose Canseco’s .
Canseco had a few celebrity boxing matches before attempting a high - profile MMA bout in Japan .
Strikeforce , which has a deal to televise some of its fights on CBS , recently beat out the UFC and signed Fedor Emelianenko to a contract .
Emelianenko is widely believed to be the best heavyweight MMA fighter in the world .
Walker , who is a year older than the UFC star Randy Couture , will also compete at heavyweight .
Extra point : Walker is one of the 131 candidates on the preliminary list of modern - era nominees for election to the Pro Football Hall of Fame .
The Pro Football Reference blog has him well down the list of deserving candidates .
Walker was an unforgettable college player , and did n’t live up to expectations in the pros .
But his N.F.L. numbers were n’t shabby : 35th in career total yards from scrimmage and eighth in career all - purpose yards .
Taking into account his time in the U.S.F.L. , do you think Walker deserves a spot in the Hall ?
On August 4 , 1990 , an unidentified flying object was seen hovering in daylight near the town of Pitlochry in Scotland .
Eyewitnesses stated that the diamond shaped object hung in the sky for about 10 minutes as two military aircraft made a series of low - level passes near it .
Almost three weeks later on August 24 , hundreds of tourists and local residents observed formations of luminous spheres for over 30 minutes in the sky near the German city of Greifswald , located close to the coast of the Baltic Sea .
In November of that year , a triangular object was seen by numerous witnesses passing over Saint - Germain in the Champagne - Ardenne region of France .
The object moved slowly at low altitude and emitted beams of light towards the ground before eventually speeding away .
All three events have many common factors , most notably that each one remains unexplained to this day .
But one - the Greifswald incident - is the odd one out .
This is because official documentation on the Pitlochry and Saint - Germain sightings collected by British and French governmental agencies are now available to the public after France and the UK took decisions to open up their UFO files .
Some of the truth is out there
The British and French governments are among a select few in Europe to have declassified previously top secret files and experts believe that , while they may currently be in the minority in revealing their documents , they are certainly not alone in having recorded sightings .
Germany refuses to say whether it has any UFO files
" The French released their UFO files through their space agency in 2007 , Britain is mid-way through a 3 - 4 year program of revealing theirs under the Freedom of Information Act , while the Norwegians and the Danes have already released some files as have the Italians , " Nick Pope , a former investigator of UFO reports and sightings with the British MoD and an expert on the topic , told Deutsche Welle .
" The UFO phenomenon is a global phenomenon ; there are unquestionably sightings all around the world so all European countries will certainly have had UFO sightings . "
Germany is one of the many European countries which have not declassified their UFO files .
In fact , the German government refuses to even admit that it has any UFO files despite the fact that independent organizations record , on average , between 50 and 100 sightings a year in the skies over Germany .
Germany among those remaining silent on UFO phenomena
" Germany has a high level of UFO sightings , " Robert Fleischer , the coordinator for the German Initiative for Exopolitics , told Deutsche Welle .
He said that , since 1974 , over 500 so - called " real " UFO cases - reported sightings that , after careful consideration by specialized experts , cannot be related to any conventional information - have been recorded .
" However , there has never been any official recognition by the German government relating to UFOs or UFO activity , " Fleischer added .
" So if the Germans were to open any files relating to UFOs , all we would find out is that they pass all their information to the Americans . "
Most UFO cases reported over Germany were only revealed when US files were made public .
Germany 's lack of UFO research is possibly due to the fact that " the US assumed that role after the end of World War II , although the Germans have never officially acknowledged this or any interest in UFOs , " he said .
European governments aware of unexplained sightings
So what do the files made public by the likes of France and Britain actually tell the public about the UFO phenomenon in Europe ?
The files do n't claim to have proof of extra-terrestrial life
" What these files do n't say is almost more important than what they do say , " said Nick Pope .
" What they do n't say is that we have proof that any of these things are extra-terrestrial .
What they do say is that European governments have consistently had these things reported to them , sometimes by reliable witnesses such as police officers and pilots . "
Most of the sightings turn out to have conventional explanations , like the misidentification of all kinds of aeronautical and astronomical phenomena , but most European governments which have conducted investigations have found that about five percent of the cases cannot be explained , added Pope .
While neither Nick Pope nor Robert Fleischer could guarantee that the initial European declassifications would eventually pressure all EU governments into opening their files , they both agreed that the revelations made public by those countries willing to divulge information could only improve research into a phenomenon that they believe is an issue for every nation .
Partial declassification giving subject more credibility
" I think this disclosure will lead to a greater understanding of the UFO phenomenon , " said Pope .
" The release of these files shows that governments do have information and if they liaise with each other , we may get further down the line to explaining this mystery because they all have a little piece of the puzzle .
Unfortunately liaison is not common in this field . "
However , the declassification may be discrediting some common UFO myths and lend credibility to sighting claims .
" When you read about sightings in governmental files from all around Europe with testimonies from military pilots , commercial airline pilots , and radar reports which show these things performing maneuvers and speeds that are way beyond our capabilities , it changes the nature of the debate from an underground anomaly to a mainstream issue , " said Pope , " and that has to be a good thing .

Now that I ’ve been an urban cyclist for a couple of months , I gotta confess I ’m not all that crazy about it .
I like walking .
On a bike I just sit , pretty much immobile from the rump up .
It ’s not relaxing at all .
You always have to be on the alert for bumps and dead critters in the road , other cyclists whizzing at or past you , pedestrians ambling mindlessly in front of you , cars resentfully trying to nudge you off the road .
Walking is meditative .
You can amble mindlessly .
When you walk you can absorb your surroundings .
Take in the day , the grass , the leaves , things going .
On bike all you absorb are the bugs that fly up your nose and find their way down your windpipe whenever you inhale .
I feel like I ’m not getting any exercise on a bike .
I ’m pedaling like mad , huffing my way up hills , feeling exhausted and sweaty , but not any fitter .
After an equal amount of time walking I feel refreshed and feel like I ’ve had a gentle head to toe workout .
It might have something to do with breathing or not breathing properly given the hunched over cyclist posture .
Breathing on a bike is tricky ( see aforementioned bugs ) .
Walking you can get into a nice breathing rhythm .
Biking is not comfortable .
The seat ’s annoying .
The stance is unnatural .
The helmet and requisite eye protection are confining and ridiculous looking
And then there are the clothes .
Long pants get caught in the chain unless you clamp them to your leg .
You ca n’t wear a skirt .
You pretty much need solid , tie - up shoes and unless it ’s really hot , a windbreaker of some sort .
So , if you ’re riding to work you have to carry a huge bag of extra clothes and shoes .
And where you do put this huge bag ?
And what becomes of your clothes crumpled up in this huge bag ?
And then what does this huge bag do to your balance on the bike ?
And speaking of balance , biking is a lot more dangerous than walking .
There ’s the whole sharing the road thing , the speed thing and the dependence on your machine functioning correctly thing .
Braking when you need it to for instance .
And , hey – I found out the brakes do n’t work if the tires are too cold or even the slightest bit damp .
So that cuts out cycling for a lot of the days of the year .
Walking you can do any time .
And finally , pedestrians are a lot friendlier than cyclists .
Pedestrians will stop and chat or say hi or at least smile and nod as they pass you .
Cyclists are singularly focused on pumping their grotesquely muscular thighs up and down , up and down , up and down .
If you try to engage them in conversation at a stoplight they avert their eyes and back off like you ’re some lunatic .
I ’m looking forward to when it ’s too dark and / or cold in the mornings to take the bike .

Während in Deutschland das Zugangserschwerungsgesetz von der neuen Regierung für ein Jahr auf Eis gelegt wurde , bemühen sich weltweit Lobbyisten um die Regulierung des Internets zur Durchsetzung wirtschaftlicher Interessen .
Der Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren und Zensur warnt vor den negativen Auswirkungen von geheimen Verhandlungen auf die Kommunikations - und Rezipientenfreiheit .
Seit Mittwoch treffen sich die Verhandlungspartner zur Abstimmung des zukünftigen Handelsabkommens ACTA in einer weiteren geheimen Sitzung in Seoul [ 1 ] .
Im Vorfeld wurde bekannt , dass dort gravierende Eingriffe in die Kommunikationsfreiheit geplant sind [ 2 ] .
Ein propagiertes Ziel des ACTA - Abkommens ist der weltweite Schutz der Verwertungsinteressen von Rechteinhabern durch eine strikte Regulierung des Internets - zum Schaden von Millionen Internet - Nutzern .
Die Umsetzung der Ziele würde die Schaffung eines globalen „ Notaus - Schalters “ bedeuten .
Mit diesem könnten Webseiten , Inhalte und Nutzer effizient vom Netz abgetrennt werden , sollten sie gegen die Interessen der durch die Lobbyverbände vertretenen Rechteinhaber verstoßen .
Die Internet Service Provider sollen dabei als Erfüllungsgehilfen einer Industrie fungieren , deren bisherige Wertschöpfungskette in der digitalen Informationsgesellschaft nicht mehr zeitgemäß erscheint - die gleichzeitig aber auch eine Reform dieses Prozesses um jeden Preis zu verhindern sucht .
Host - Provider würden demnach verpflichtet , im „ Notice and Takedown “ - Verfahren schon bei Verdacht einer Urheberrechtsverletzung Webseiten ihrer Kunden vom Netz zu nehmen .
Zudem sollen Anbieter von Web - 2.0 - Plattformen
Inhalte ihrer Nutzer bereits vor Veröffentlichung auf mögliche Urheberrechtsverletzungen hin untersuchen .
Die neutrale Position der Zugangsanbieter , die im Gleichgewicht des Netzes eine wesentliche Rolle spielt , wird so massiv bedrängt und droht verloren zu gehen .
Schon vor Monaten hatte die Veröffentlichung von geheimen ACTA - Unterlagen wichtige Fragen für Konsumenten weltweit aufgeworfen .
So sieht ACTA unter anderem auch eine Möglichkeit für Zollbeamte vor , die Inhalte von mitgeführten Geräten auf Urheberrechtsverletzungen zu prüfen [ 3 ] [ 4 ] .
Derweil wird vor dem Europäischen Parlament momentan die „ 3 - Strikes “ - Regelung debattiert [ 5 ] .
In einem dritten Anlauf zu „ Zusatz 138 “ des Telekommunikationspakets versucht Verhandlungsführerin Catherine Trautmann die Möglichkeit einer Abschaltung des Internet - Zugangs ohne richterlichen Beschluss durchzusetzen [ 6 ] .
Somit wäre es auf Grund bloßer Behauptungen , außerhalb des ordentlichen Rechtsweges vorstellbar , Menschen von einem heute unverzichtbaren Kommunikations - und Informationsstrang auszuschließen .
Mit einem ähnlichen Schachzug versucht auch die amerikanische Regierungsbehörde GAO ( Government Accountability Office ) die Netzneutralität anzugreifen [ 7 ] :
Ein veröffentlichtes
Papier des GAO bewertet eine durch die Schweinegrippe ausgelöste globale Pandemie und eine daraus resultierende stärkere Nutzung und „ Verstopfung “ des Internets durch Privatanwender tagsüber als eine Gefahr für den freien Handel .
Der Zugriff auf „ kritische Telekommunikationsinfrastrukturen “ müsse für „ broker - dealers and other securities market participants “ sichergestellt werden .
Nachdem sich Bürgerrechtler in den letzten Monaten heftig gegen die Scheinargumente und Propaganda des Wahlkampfs zur Wehr gesetzt haben , gibt die Tendenz , fundamentale Themen der Kommunikationsfreiheit auf internationaler Ebene im Geheimen und hinter verschlossenen Türen zu verhandeln , Grund zu tiefer Sorge .
Der AK Zensur ruft die Bundesregierung dazu auf , hier eindeutig Stellung zu beziehen und solch weitreichenden Eingriffen in die Grundrechte ihrer Bürger mit aller Kraft entgegenzutreten .

Über den Arbeitskreis gegen Internet - Sperren ( AK Zensur ) :
I drew this cartoon this morning , while thinking about a conversation I had a couple of years ago :
I was on the phone to an old friend of mine , a guy in his late for­ties , who was born and bred in Michi­gan , and is living there now .
He was telling me about his uncle , who , about four deca­des ago , got his highschool sweetheart preg­nant .
So ins­tead of going off to college , he found him­self with a new wife , a child on the way , and an assembly - line job at Gene­ral Motors .
But even though this situa­tion clip­ped his wings con­si­de­rably , he still ended up having a nice life in the end , with a home , a big yard , two cars , a steady paycheck , wee­kends fishing or hun­ting deer , and vaca­tions in Hawaii every year or so .
“ The days where a blue collar guy like my uncle could have a nice life without doing much , ” my friend said , “ those days are gone .
Gone fore­ver . ”
And in the back of my mind , I ’m thin­king the same is star­ting to hap­pen to white collar guys more and more , as well .
But it ’s not quite out in the open yet .
Society ’s not quite ready to have that con­ver­sa­tion .
I also heard a statistic a couple of weeks ago that there are at least thirty million children in China currently taking piano lessons .
Thirty .
Million .
We live in interesting times …
[ Update : ] ” Thousandists ” :
My long - time Spanish blog buddy , Nia left an interesting comment below :
Toxic mortgages and credit card losses through defaults are rising at a rapid pace .
This was also apparent in the earnings report from JP Morgan that reported positive earnings because of non-retail banking activities .
Yet the media for whatever reason is n’t highlighting more carefully where the gains are coming from .
For example , JP Morgan which swallowed up Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns , posted losses on credit cards and home mortgages yet doubled its earnings from last year in its investment banking division .
Here is one of the key examples of why removing Glass - Steagall is such a major problem .
The recent meteoric rise in stock prices merely reflects hot money trying to find ground .
If we look at actual loan losses they are still on the rise :
Source : New York Times
And banks are not lending more as they stated initially with the request for bailout funds .
The premise was that trillions were needed or lending would completely dry up .
Lending has dried up .
Take the mortgage market for example .
Loans that are FHA insured now make up the bulk of the market .
For non-FHA loans , banks seek to have loans backed by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , or Ginnie Mae .
In other words , banks are unwilling to lend their own money and will only lend funds backed by the government ( aka the American taxpayer ) .
This behavior is most pronounced with credit cards .
With rising defaults companies are using bailout funds to plug up additional losses .
Yet they are also combining the easy money to play their hand on Wall Street .
The mix of retail and commercial banking is still occurring even after our economy nearly tanked and we are still in recession nearly 2 years later .
I had an experience with the credit card companies recently that shows what is occurring .
One of my cards had a line of $ 10,000 but I rarely use it .
If I did use it , I would pay it off every month .
Credit card companies look at people that pay off their balance every month as deadbeats .
So last month , I receive a letter stating my balance was lowered to $ 3,000 simply because my lack of use .
Keep in mind that this line had been open for 7 years .
So I call up the bank and they tell me I can either stay with the new terms or close my account .
This is how banks are playing the system and stealing money from taxpayers .
Do n’t be fooled , they are pulling credit back :
Banks are still pulling credit cards out of the system on top of the 8 million that were pulled in the first quarter of 2009 .
Let us look at how JP Morgan turned a $ 3.6 billion profit in the third quarter more carefully .
“ New York , October 14 , 2009 – JPMorgan Chase & Co. ( NYSE : JPM ) today reported third - quarter 2009 net income of $ 3.6 billion , compared with net income of $ 527 million in the third quarter of 2008 .
Earnings per share were $ 0.82 , compared with $ 0.09 in the prior year .
Jamie Dimon , Chairman and Chief Executive Officer , commented : “ Our net income of $ 3.6 billion in the quarter reflected the strong earnings power of the company , with broad - based growth across the Investment Bank , Asset Management , Commercial Banking and Retail Banking .
However , credit costs remain high and are expected to stay elevated for the foreseeable future in the Consumer Lending and Card Services loan portfolios .
Accordingly , we have added $ 2.0 billion to our consumer credit reserves , bringing the firmwide total to $ 31.5 billion , or 5.3 % 1 of total loans .
Tier 1 Common Capital , another key element of our fortress balance sheet , was also strengthened through capital generation during the quarter , to $ 101 billion , or 8.2 % . ”
In other words , JP Morgan made a bulk of its profits in sectors that pre-1999 ( Glass - Steagall ) would not have been allowed for commercial banks .
They are operating as a gigantic hybrid of old school banking with casino style investment banking on Wall Street .
Keep in mind JP Morgan is one of the too big to fail darlings .
Instead of opening consumer credit , they are pulling back on it to the tune of $ 2 billion in reserves for future losses .
The below comes from their 8 - K filing .
How much of that $ 3.6 billion came from their i-bank division ?
Over 50 percent of it :
A large chunk of it came from the investment banking division .
I do n’t think the American public had in mind when they handed trillions to the banks that they would be using the money to gamble on Wall Street .
Surely they are doing something through their retail side ?
Nope .
In fact , this is where they are adding loss provisions to the continued deterioration of the Washington Mutual loans .
Average total deposits decreased over the quarter by 2 percent .
Branch sale of credit cards were down 18 percent .
As you would imagine , they are losing money through their credit card division :
So much for the average American .
But where else did the big money come in for the $ 3.6 billion in profits if it was n’t through the average Joe and Mary on the street ?
Corporate and private equity :
And there it is .
You might as well label JP Morgan the new Lehman Brothers because they are operating like an investment bank .
So much for those bailouts helping the average American .
The media really needs to scrutinize how these companies make their earnings .
They are simply using hot and easy money to double down in the Wall Street casino on the taxpayer dime .
No reform has happened since the collapse of Wall Street because these banks own our politicians .

Information Overload existiert seit der Bibliothek von Alexandria .
Die Annahme , die Informationsüberflutung sei erst mit dem Internet über uns gekommen , ist falsch .
Spiegel Online hat über Google Wave geschrieben , den neuen Google - Dienst , für den die ersten 100.000 Leute Zugänge erhalten haben .
Noch bevor der Dienst in der Öffentlichkeit ankommt , wird auf SPON vermutet , dass Google Wave über das Ziel hinausschiesst .
Warum ?
Es führe zu mehr Informationen .
Und davon habe bereits der Early Adopter an sich heute zu viel .
Diese negative Sichtweise auf neue Entwicklungen ist eine in Deutschland leider weit verbreitete .
Man kann das als Innovationsphobie bezeichnen .
Wie verbreitet diese Sichtweise ist , sieht man an den vielen den Artikel applaudierenden Tweets .
Im SPON - Artikel steht :
De facto aber tut das Internet das gleiche wie jedes neue Informations - und Kommunikationsmedium seit Erfindung der Keilschrift - es nimmt mehr Zeit , Aufmerksamkeit und damit Energie in Anspruch , als es freisetzt .
Das ist natürlich kompletter Unsinn .
Würde es doch bedeuten , dass die Gesellschaft , die bei der Keilschrift bleibt - oder diese wieder einführt - auf einmal im Vorteil gegenüber den anderen wäre .
Sie hätte mehr Zeit , Aufmerksamkeit und Energie frei .
Das kann nicht einmal der kulturpessimistischste Deutsche glauben .
Auch wenn es immer wieder behauptet wird :
Es gibt keinen durch das Internet erzeugten Information - Overload .
Nur ein Versagen der Filter .
So fasst Clay Shirky den Diskurs rund um die Informationszunahme durch das Web zusammen ( u.a. hier ) .
Die Annahme , wir hätten heute auf einmal zu viele Informationen , die auf uns einprasseln , suggeriert , dass das früher nicht so gewesen wäre .
Tatsächlich gibt es zu viele Informationen , als eine Person verarbeiten kann , seit der Bibliothek von Alexandria .
Niemand geht heute in die nächstgelegene Bibliothek und stöhnt ob der Tatsache auf , dass man nie alle dort verfügbaren Bücher wird lesen können .
Warum ?
Weil wir mit dieser Tatsache aufgewachsen sind .
Aber jetzt gibt es das Internet .
Auf einmal erscheinen selbst für Leute mit obskuren Hobbies und Interessen mehr interessante Artikel jeden Tag , als sie tatsächlich lesen könnten .
Horror !
Wirklich ?
Nein .
Wir müssen den Umgang mit dieser Informationsexplosion lernen .
Es ist eine quantitative und qualitative Explosion .
Das ist gut so .
Und das gilt auch für Emails , IM und andere Kommunikationsformen im Netz .
Die Tools und das Netz per se machen uns produktiver .
Wenn wir lernen , damit umzugehen .
Die Veränderung des Informations - und Workflows ist nicht per se mit einer Steigerung der Informationen verbunden .
In erster Linie geht es um Effizienzsteigerung .
Diese führt meist zu mehr Informationen , weil man nun mehr verarbeiten kann .
Google Wave wird im besten Fall zur einer stark verbesserten Effizienz führen .
Für nichts auf der
Welt würde ich wieder ohne Internet , Blogs und all die verschiedenen Online - Tools , die hier täglich zum Einsatz kommen , weiter leben wollen .
Ich bin heute besser informiert als jemals zuvor .
Das ist das einzige was in diesem Zusammenhang zählt .
Mein GoogleReader zeigt permanent " 1000 + " ungelesene Artikel an .
Die tatsächliche Zahl dürfte an die 10.000 heranreichen .
Permanent .
Na und ?
Ich muss sie nicht lesen .
Ich muss mich davon nicht verrückt machen lassen .
Das Einzige , was mich verrückt machen würde , wäre , nicht mehr diese großartigen Artikel zu lesen , die ich täglich in Blogs selbst vorfinde und von anderen empfohlen bekomme .
Brauchen wir bessere Filter ?
Ja. Google
Wave könnte auch ein solcher werden , je nachdem , was darauf noch gebaut wird .
Wenn Wave die Emails und das Instant Messaging , dass ich täglich nutze , teilweise oder ganz ersetzen wird , dann nur , weil es effizienter die Aufgaben erledigt .
Natürlich werden dann auch wieder mehr Informationen entstehen .
Warum ?
Weil ich dann produktiver bin .
Willkommen beim Prinzip Fortschritt .
Eine Einschätzung von Google Wave in Kurzform von Christian Scholz :
Das was man heute als den Google Wave - Client sieht , ist nur die Spitze des Eisberges dessen , was sich darunter verbirgt , nämlich die Möglichkeit , Dokumente in Echtzeit auch bei schwankender Latenz im Netzwerk relativ konfliktfrei über mehrere Server und Clients zu synchronisieren .
Diese Operational Transforms genannte Technik hat meiner Meinung nach enormes Potential .

WASHINGTON --
When 25 - year - old Army specialist Chancellor Keesling killed himself in Baghdad this summer , his family was flown to Delaware 's Dover Air Force Base to receive his casket .
He then received a full military burial , complete with a 21 - gun salute .
But Spec.
Keesling 's grieving family has not received a condolence letter from President Barack Obama .
The White House said a longstanding policy prevents him from sending such a letter to families of troops who have committed suicide .
The Keesling family is mounting a lobbying effort to get that policy overturned .
With the military being hit by a record number of suicides , the Keeslings -- backed by a bipartisan array of lawmakers from their home state of Indiana -- argue that the rule is archaic .
" If the president wants to destigmatize mental health , and destigmatize military suicide , why does he stigmatize families like ours by pretending that our son did n't die ? " said Spec. Keesling 's father , Gregg Keesling .
" If Chance had been struck by lightning in Baghdad or hit by a car , we would have gotten a letter .
We should n't be treated differently because he died by suicide . "
The family 's efforts are running up against a longstanding institutional belief within the military that suicide is a sign of weakness and that troops who take their own lives should n't receive the same military honors accorded to troops who die in combat or from accidents in the war zones .
Historically , the appearance of recursive exceptionalism is a highly predictive harbinger of republican ( and , as it happens , imperial ) decline , eventual fragmentation ( typically violent in character ) and collapse .
It was no accident that the Roman Republic 's decline followed hard upon the unspoken disposal of two - consul rule ( no matter if you believe that this actually began with Pompey , Caesar or Octavian ) .
Likewise , it is instructive that the progression towards
The Principate after 400 some years of a Roman republic was also driven significantly by the conflict between the remnants of Roman monarchy , the aristocracy , and the plebes .
If you find yourself a supporter of Ludwig von Mises , you might also note currency debasement , price controls , tariffs and restrictions on the free movement of labor and goods among the similarities to contemporary conditions .
Self - inflicted economic wounds notwithstanding , once you stop following your own rules , " all bets are off , " and it can only be a matter of time before you find that rem ad Triarios redisse ( or rem ad Federal Reserve redisse , as the case may be ) .
In this connection , today we find it instructive to direct the modest beam of the Zero Hedge searchlight onto the boxy , greenroof - topped , marble facade of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation .
This post marks the beginning of a week - long Zero Hedge series on the FDIC .
On September 28 , 2009 , Arthur J. Murton , Director of the FDIC's Division of Insurance and Research penned a memo to the Board of Directors on plans to prevent the Deposit Insurance Fund from total depletion ( which threatens imminently even as we type this ) .
That memo is actually most interesting primarily for its quick summary of the exceptions made to the general statutory requirement that the DIF maintain a minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 % .
In short , the memo noted that an October 2008 exception permitting the FDIC to take five years to return to statutory compliance was modified only four months later to grant seven years of extension only to be boosted three months later to an eight year respite .
The prospect of almost a decade of non-compliance with the original ( and clearly already insufficient ) statutory reserve ratio is instructive .
If you are reminded of the now obviously useless national debt ceiling originally set in 1917 , you are not alone .
In 1919 that limit was $ 43 billion .
By 2001 it stood at just under $ 6 trillion .
Today , obviously , it floats just above $ 12 trillion ( and just above the total debt figure as well ) .
The ritualistic farce that now accompanies the regular and totally unopposed raises to the limit is , unfortunately , characteristic of recent statutory shenanigans by Federal authorities in the United States in legal disciplines ranging from bankruptcy to bailout authorization to agency finances .
The FDIC , ( along with the Federal Housing Administration , Fannie , and Freddie ) , appear to have been so totally co-opted from their original purpose as to make a mockery of the authorizing legislation for the entities ( not that these were organized properly - or indeed , justifibly - in the first place ) .
But this should not surprise us .
Moreover , looking deeper , and touching on an increasingly common theme here on Zero Hedge , we find that agencies and departments of the Federal government appear to enjoy a great deal of latitude with respect to setting their own rules ( and self - non - enforcing them ) .
A footnote in the above referenced memo is illuminating in this regard :
In setting assessment rates , the FDIC ’s Board of Directors is authorized to set assessments for insured depository institutions in such amounts as the Board of Directors may determine to be necessary .
12 U.S.C. § 1817 ( b ) ( 2 ) ( A ) .
In so doing , the Board shall consider : ( 1 ) the estimated operating expenses of the DIF ; ( 2 ) the estimated case resolution expenses and income of the DIF ; ( 3 ) the projected effects of the payment on the capital and earnings of insured depository institutions ; ( 4 ) the risk factors and other factors taken into account pursuant to 12 U.S.C. § 1817 ( b ) ( 1 ) under the risk - based assessment system , including the requirement under such paragraph to maintain a risk - based system ; and ( 5 ) any other factors the Board of Directors may determine to be appropriate .
( Emphasis added ) .
We would point to the absolute insanity of permitting " projected effects of the payment on the capital and earnings of insured depository institutions " as a criteria for determining what amount to risk - based insurance premiums as item ( 3 ) above explicitly authorizes , but item ( 5 ) pretty much allows the Board of Directors to use any criteria they like in any event , so it is not clear to us what the point of the preceding assessment rate criteria limitations are , other than as a continued employment act for government attorneys .
Similarly , we might ask why ...
... the term ‘ disaster - recovery FMAP adjustment State ’ means :
a State that is one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia , for which , at any time during the preceding 7 fiscal years , the President has declared a major disaster under section 401 of the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act and determined as a result of such disaster that every county or parish in the State warrant individual and public assistance or public assistance from the Federal Government under such Act and for which — ‘ ‘ ( A ) in the case of the first fiscal year ( or part of a fiscal year ) for which this subsection applies to the State , the Federal medical assistance percentage determined for the State for the fiscal year without regard to this subsection and subsection ( y ) , is less than the Federal medical assistance percentage determined for the State for the preceding fiscal year after the application of only subsection ( a ) of section 5001 of Public Law 111 –5 ( if applicable to the preceding fiscal year ) and without regard to this subsection , subsection ( y ) , and subsections ( b ) and ( c ) of section 5001 of Public Law 111 –5 , by at least 3 percentage points ; and ‘ ‘ ( B ) in the case of the second or any succeeding fiscal year for which this subsection applies to the State , the Federal medical assistance percentage determined for the State for the fiscal year without regard to this subsection and subsection ( y ) , is less than the Federal medical assistance percentage determined for the State for the preceding fiscal year under this subsection by at least 3 percentage points .
... immortalized in recent health care legislation is n't simply written in its more commonly known form ( " Louisiana " ) .
It becomes increasingly difficult not to feel that one 's intelligence is being insulted .
This bit of language is quite telling with respect to the entity 's view of the public confidence it [ lacks / enjoys ] ...
The final rule also provided that if , after June 30 , 2009 , the reserve ratio of the DIF were estimated to fall to a level that the Board believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level that shall be close to or below zero at the end of any calendar quarter , the Board , by vote , may impose up to two additional special assessments in 2009 ...
.. in that it anticipates that a lack of public confidence criteria alone once the reserve ratio falls below zero might not be enough to trigger special action .
Could it be that the public has already priced in total FDIC insolvency ?
Why , exactly , do we tolerate this bit of FDIC folly ?
We 're not sure , but watch this space in the days to come to follow our exploration of exactly this topic .
( CNN ) --
Could a little - known freshman Democrat from a conservative - leaning Florida district be just what the doctor ordered for liberals wary of what they view as a timid president too ready to compromise on overhauling health care ?
Rep . Alan Grayson , D - Florida , attracted attention for a tirade in the House against the GOP 's health care plan .
A little more than a week ago , few Americans had heard of Rep.
Alan Grayson , who represents the Orlando area , and more than a handful of his congressional colleagues may not have been able to pick the 6 - foot - 4 , 51 - year - old out of a lineup .
But that was before the combative Bronx - born congressman and Harvard - educated lawyer took to the floor of the House of Representatives last week , shocking the few Republicans within earshot when he dramatically declared the GOP health care plan is " Do n't get sick , and if you do get sick , die quickly . "
The after - hours tirade quickly made the rounds online and on television the next morning , energizing Republicans and Democrats alike -- many of whom from both parties appear eager to keep the rhetoric surrounding the health care debate at a fever pitch .
Watch the congressman on the House floor »
For Republicans , Grayson was the long - sought answer to Rep. Joe Wilson , the South Carolina Republican who yelled " You lie " to President Obama last month and faced a torrent of Democratic criticism for breaching congressional protocol and basic principles of human decency .
But many Democrats so outwardly critical of Wilson 's behavior quickly rallied to Grayson 's side , seemingly thrilled a Democrat finally had showed a level of brazenness that 's long been more characteristic of those on the other side of aisle .
" People want to see a congressman with guts , " Grayson told CNN .
" And America likes to hear the truth . "
But for liberals , many of whom say they feel their party is all too willing to roll over amid GOP attacks , it was n't just Grayson 's initial comments that drew acclaim but also the Florida Democrat 's hardhearted refusal to recant his statements in the face of Republican criticism .
After all , following GOP calls for an apology -- along with a threat of a congressional resolution condemning the remarks -- Grayson returned to the House floor to apologize instead to the " dead . "
" What happened was his floor speech and the fact that he did n't back down set a new standard for how Democrats deal with Republican hissy fits , " said David Dayen , a liberal blogger who often writes on the Daily Kos Web site .
" He 's been a hero to Democrats since his term started , but now he 's a hero on health care . "
To be sure , Grayson already had shown he was a different kind of freshman congressman before the " die quickly " speech , having forcefully taken Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to task in what was an instant YouTube moment at a House Committee hearing less than a month into the job .
He also held up a vote on global warming legislation until he secured a $ 50 million hurricane research center in his district -- a move more characteristic of the chamber 's longtime lawmakers .
And he 's won liberal support for his steadfast support of ACORN , even as many Democrats voted to defund the community organizing group , and for his forceful anti-war stance .
But it was the late - night diatribe last week -- presumably seen by no more than a few dozen C - SPAN viewers before going viral -- that netted Grayson more than $ 500,000 from 5,000 donors around the country .
It 's also garnered a media tour worthy of a national celebrity peddling a tell - all book , appearing on a bevy of cable and national news programs to amplify his attacks on Republicans .
Grayson appears to be reveling in the newfound political celebrity , having sent a string of fundraising e-mails in recent days with one proclaiming " in a town where everyone can only tell lies , he 's just invented the truth . "
No doubt recognizing his popularity among the Democratic base , neither House Speaker Nancy Pelosi nor the White House was willing to call the comments over the line , instead advocating for a more conciliatory tone in general from both parties .
Meanwhile , the few Democratic commentators who did say Grayson 's actions were beyond the pale risked a backlash from liberal readers hungering for a fight after a summer in which the health care debate appeared to be dominated by loud opponents on the right .
" I'm in trouble with some of my readers for not lionizing Alan Grayson , [ because I am ] a person who has said , ' I would like to bring facts back to this debate ' and who has criticized the death panel rhetoric , ' " said Joan Walsh , editor in chief of Salon.com .
But Grayson 's bona fide heroic status with the left is n't likely to play well back in Florida 's 8th Congressional District , a jagged swath of the Sunshine State that includes Orlando and cuts through some of its northern suburbs .
The district tilts toward the GOP , but with the help of Obama 's coattails and his own deep pockets , Grayson narrowly unseated a four - term Republican in 2008 .
Florida Republicans , who already were eager to reclaim the seat , see their window open wide now that Grayson has become a liberal icon .
" We are positive he 's going to lose ; we are going to trounce him , " said Lew Oliver , Republican Party chairman in Orange County , where Grayson 's district lies .
Oliver made his comments to the Southern Florida Political Report on Tuesday .
A small problem :
No one 's lined up to take on Grayson yet .
But that does n't seem to worry Oliver .
" A random Republican off the street could beat him , " he said .

BEIJING , Sept 28 ( Reuters ) - China ’s cabinet , the State Council , has formally approved the construction of Shandong Haiyang Nuclear Power Station , State Nuclear Power Technology Corp ( SNPTC ) said on Friday .
The power station in eastern Shandong province is the second in the country that will be based on the third - generation AP1000 technology imported from U.S. - based Westinghouse Electric Co. , owned by Toshiba Corp.
6502.T .
Two nuclear power generating units , each with a capacity of 1.25 gigawatts ( GW ) , would be brought online in 2014 and 2015 respectively , SNPTC said in a post on its website ( www.snptc.com.cn)
SNPTC is in charge of third - generation nuclear power technology imports and localisation .
A formal ceremony to mark the beginning of construction would be held in mid-October , the official Xinhua news agency reported over the weekend .
China would start building five nuclear plants this year , two based on Westinghouse technology , one based on technology from France 's Areva CEPFi .
PA and two on domestic technology , a deputy head of the National Energy Administration said in April .
China has launched a series of measures to boost the supply of alternative energy , including nuclear , wind and solar power , and reduce its dependence on coal .
But government and industry officials have warned that blind expansion and the risk of overcapacity could undermine healthy development of clean energy sources .
Zhang Guobao , head of the National Energy Administration , said on Sunday that China may have to put the brakes on the construction of nuclear power plants to ensure they are safe .

The presidential oath of office contains a pledge to defend and protect the Constitution of the United States , and by implication the liberties of the American people that the document is intended to preserve .
In light of this , can you name which of the delegated powers in the U.S. Constitution allow the president to invade his own country , mass murder his own American citizens , and bomb , burn and plunder their cities ?
Can you explain how such acts would be consistent with protecting the constitutional liberties of those unfortunate citizens ?
If you think you can , then congratulations , you are a u201CLincoln Scholar.u201D
If not , do not despair .
You are in decent company , including the five living past presidents as of 1861 , namely , Martin Van Buren , John Tyler , Millard Fillmore , Franklin Pierce , and James Buchanan .
Lincoln ’s predecessor , President James Buchanan of Pennsylvania , stated the truth when he said the following :
Has the Constitution delegated to Congress the power to coerce a State into submission which is attempting to withdraw . . . from the Confederacy [ of states ] ?
If answered in the affirmative , it must be on the principle that the power has been conferred upon Congress to declare and to make war against a State .
After much serious reflection , I have arrived at the conclusion that no such power has been delegated to Congress or to any other department of the federal government ( Senate Journal , 36th Congress , 2nd Session , 4 December 1860 , 15 — 16 ) .
Unlike Lincoln , James Buchanan was a constitutionalist .
His opinion that a president has no constitutional right to invade his own country and murder his fellow citizens has relegated him to the bottom of every ranking of American presidents by the American history profession for generations .
This does n’t mean he was wrong , only that a large segment of the history profession is hopelessly corrupt .
Buchanan understood , as did nearly everyone prior to Lincoln , that the states did not give up any of their sovereignty when they ratified the Constitution ; they merely delegated several distinct powers to the central government that was designed to act for their mutual benefit .
Buchanan ’s position on secession is described in some detail by John Avery Emison in his new book , Lincoln ber Alles : Dictatorship Comes to America .
It ’s high time that Americans grow up , says Emison , and confront the reality of their own history , as opposed to the childish fairy tales concocted by the court historians of the Church of Lincoln .

As for the other living presidents mentioned above , the New Yorker Millard Fillmore , a former Whig , opposed the war for its duration and never joined the new Republican Party after the Whig Party imploded , as did most Northern Whigs .
Franklin Pierce of New Hampshire was a fierce critic of the war and especially of Lincoln ’s Stalinist , police - state tactics in suppressing political opposition in the North .
New Yorker Martin Van Buren died in 1862 but opposed the war , and John Tyler of Virginia , who also died in 1862 , actually served in the Confederate Congress .
These men were all patriotic Americans who understood that waging war against the citizens of any state was an act of treason .
They understood this because , unlike Lincoln , they had read , understood , and believed in the Constitution .
As Emison points out , Article III , Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution defines treason as follows : u201CTreason against the United States , shall consist only in levying War against them , or in adhering to their Enemies , giving them Aid and Comfortu201D ( emphasis added ) .
As with all the founding documents , u201CUnited Statesu201D is in the plural , signifying that the free and independent states are united for some specific purpose , in this case in delegating certain powers to the central government , mostly for foreign policy reasons .
Treason meant waging war against the citizens of the states , not the government in Washington , D.C. Lincoln ’s war was nothing if it was not a war prosecuted by the Republican Party against the Southern states .
It was therefore the very definition of treason under the U.S. Constitution .
The Lincoln Cult sometimes claims that the so - called u201 Cinsurrection clauseu201D of the Constitution ( Article 4 , Section 4 ) gives the government the ability to wage war on its own citizens , but this is a gross misreading of the document .
Article 4 states : u201CThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government , and shall protect each of them against Invasion ; and on Application of the Legislature , or of the Executive ( when the Legislature cannot be convened ) against domestic violence .

Lincoln Unmasked : What ...
Thomas J. Dilorenzo Best Price : $ 5.95 Buy New $ 9.85 ( as of 07:10 EST - Details )
Lincoln violated the first part of Article 4 by imprisoning members of the Maryland legislature in 1861 and by occupying various southern states , ruling over them with military dictatorships during the war .
The war was not a domestic insurrection within the Southern states .
But even if one assumes that it was , as Lincoln falsely did , it is important that the second part of Article 4 denotes that the central government cannot interfere in an insurrection within any state unless first invited to do so by the legislature or governor of that state .
The governors of the Southern states never invited Lincoln to invade them , bomb their cities , and murder their citizens by the thousands .
But then again , Lincoln believed that he was more important than the Constitution .
In his chapter entitled u201CSecession , the Constitution , and the Law , u201D Emison devastatingly critiques Lincoln Cultist James McPherson ’s one - sentence quip in his ( McPherson ’s ) book , Battle Cry of Freedom , that the states that entered the union after the original thirteen were creatures of the central government and therefore were not sovereign over it and had no right to secede .
This quip has been endlessly repeated by Lincoln cultists in their defense of Lincoln ’s war despite the fact that it is historically and constitutionally baseless .
It is baseless because of what the Supreme Court has called the u201CEqual Footing Doctrine .
u201D
When Tennessee became the third new state in 1796 , for example , it was admitted u201 Con an equal footing with the original states in all respects whatsoever , u201D phraseology that has been used ever since , Emison reminds us .
This means that , just as the original thirteen states were sovereign over the central government , so are all the others .
All states are equal under the Constitution .
The Real Lincoln : A Ne ... Dilorenzo , Thomas J. Best Price : $ 4.25 Buy New $ 7.48 ( as of 07:05 EST - Details )
This fact motivates Emison to ask the obvious question : u201CIf all the states are equal , do any states or combination of states have the legal or moral authority to destroy another state and replace its lawfully elected government with one imposed by military occupation ?
If so , which states have such authority ?
How did they get it ?
Lincoln ’s answer to these questions was , essentially , u201 Cthe side with the most bayonets makes the rules .
u201D
In his chapter entitled u201CWar Crimesu201D Emison details just how Lincoln u201 Cprovedu201D his new theories about the absolute and omnipotent powers of the federal government to be u201 Ccorrect .u201D
He explains how the Lincoln regime reignited the horrors of total war in the world , including the waging of total war on one ’s own citizens .
Among the language used to describe the waging of total war on Southern civilians is u201 Crampage , u201D u201 Ctheft and indiscriminate destruction of property , u201D u201 Crob , tyrannize , threaten , u201D u201 Cnumerous reports of rape , u201D and u201 Cwoe betide the region ’s unprotected black women , against whom acts of the most beastly an infamous characteru201D were perpetrated by Union Army soldiers .
Much of this barbarism was the work of the u201 Cheroicu201D General Sherman .
Emison scoured numerous biographies of Sherman and found him to be described in the following ways by those who knew him best : u201CA near emotional crippleu201D ; a dangerous manu201D ; u201 Ctraumatized , marginalized , and self - loathingu201D ; u201 Ca caged lion . . . angryu201D ; suffering from u201 Cdelusional misjudgmentu201D ; u201 Csuicidal impulsesu201D ; u201 Cconfessed to his wife a death - wish for himself . . .u201D ; u201 Ca man of primal rage.u201D
u201CSherman ’s gone in the head , he ’s luny [ sic ] , u201D said Assistant Secretary of War Thomas Scott , as quoted by Emison .
u201CIt would be dangerous to give [ Sherman ] command , u201D said General Henry Halleck .
Of course , Lincoln not only gave Sherman command , but made him one of the top commanders , and the Republican Party turned him into a national icon after the war .
( Sherman spent the next 25 years after the war orchestrating the campaign of genocide against the Plains Indians . )
Emison documents with Sherman ’s own words how the man seemed to hate just about everyone especially blacks , Mexicans , Jews , and Indians .
He was not an enlightened egalitarian devoted to black equality , as the buffoonish Lincoln cultist Victor Davis Hanson has contended .
This mentally - deranged maniac u201 Cjustifiedu201D his mass killing of civilians by inventing the u201 Cdoctrine of military necessity , u201D which essentially said that anything goes in war , even the murder of innocent women and children .
Sherman ’s armies would later perfect this barbaric ideology during the Indian Wars , as Emison recounts .
When backed into a corner the Lincoln Cult usually resorts to the preposterous claim that everything the Lincoln regime did ( or did not do , such as peacefully ending slavery , as the rest of the world did in the 19th century ) was justified because Northerners were enlightened about race and Southerners were not .
Evil Southerners had to be civilized , the story goes , even if that meant killing them by the hundreds of thousands .
But as Emison writes , u201CThe idea that . . . white Northerners . . . fought the Civil War to end slavery , or were on the right side of the racial justice issue , is preposterous .
u201D
It is u201 Cnothing short of gullible self - deception , bordering on simple - mindedness.u201D
Your author is not as generous as Emison in this regard .
James McPherson , Doris Kearns - Goodwin , Arthur Schlesinger , Jr. , and other Lincoln cultists are not simple minded .
They know what they are doing , and they know that it pays very well careerwise and moneywise to be a court historian .
In another attempt to allow Americans to wean themselves from childish self - deceptions about their own history , Emison devotes a chapter to race in American history .
He discusses how slavery existed for hundreds of years in the North , especially in New York , Boston , and Newport , Rhode Island , the hubs of the transatlantic slave trade .
The transatlantic slave trade u201 Cwas one of the foundations of New England ’s economic structureu201D for generations .
The slave trade was also u201 Cone of the cornerstones of New York ’s commercial prosperity in the eighteenth century .

How Capitalism Saved A... Dilorenzo , Thomas J. Best Price : $ 2.18 Buy New $ 7.37 ( as of 12:45 EST - Details )
Emison documents the truth behind Tocqueville ’s statement in Democracy in America that u201 Cthe problem of raceu201D was even worse in the North than it was in the South in the early nineteenth century .
He presents a table of seventy - six Northern Jim Crow Laws that were enacted beginning with Vermont in 1777 and ending with New York in 1868 .
Jim Crow laws were a Northern invention .
In the decade preceding the War to Prevent Southern Independence alone , California , Utah Territory , Indiana , Ohio , Kansas Territory , Nebraska Territory , Wisconsin , Minnesota , Iowa , and Oregon disenfranchised all free blacks .
In 1839 Ohio ’s legislature passed u201 Ca resolution that Negroes have no right to petition the legislature for any purpose whatever .
u201D Massachusetts banned interracial marriage in 1836 , after Rhode Island did so in 1822 ; during the same year ( 1836 ) , state legislator Abraham Lincoln voted for an Illinois resolution that u201 Cthe elective franchise should be kept pure from contamination by the admission of colored votesu201D ;
In 1833 Connecticut criminalized u201 Cthe establishment of any school for persons of the African raceu201D ; Ohio , Indiana and Illinois required u201 Cgood behavior bondsu201D from free blacks ; many Northern states enacted u201CNegro Exclusion Lawsu201D ; the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled that blacks were not citizens twenty years before the famous Dred Scott decision ; and Illinois amended its Constitution in 1862 to add a Negro exclusion provision .
One very interesting aspect of Lincoln ber Alles is Emison ’s discussion of the preponderance of u201CGerman Forty - Eightersu201D in the Lincoln administration and at the upper levels of his army .
These men were German immigrants who participated in an 1848 European political revolt that advocated highly centralized government , despised state ’s rights , and believed that citizens needed to subordinate their personal interests to the state .
u201CMany Forty - Eighters were Marxists ; some considered themselves communists .
One of the Forty - Eighters was Marx ’s own brother - in - law . . . the Forty - Eighters saw themselves as international agents of change .

One of the more prominent German immigrants in the Lincoln administration was Francis Lieber , who Lincoln employed to write the military code for the U.S. Army , which was known as the u201CLieber Code.u201D
Another was General Franz Sigel , and officer in the Prussian army who fled Europe and became a Union army general who gained notoriety for his defeat in the Battle of New Market at the hands of VMI cadets .
Sigel apparently believed he would teach the sons of Virginia , including a descendant of Thomas Jefferson ’s who was killed in the battle , what it meant to be an American .
Emison describes numerous other German u201 Crevolutionaries u201D who were given important commands in Lincoln ’s army .
A great many German immigrants settled in the Midwest and were instrumental in Lincoln ’s nomination and election .
Abe recognized this , and purchased several German - language newspapers in order to bolster his German immigrant support .
Emison makes a very persuasive case that it was German immigrants who u201Cput him over the topu201D in six key states ( Indiana , Iowa , Michigan , Minnesota , Ohio , Wisconsin ) in the 1860 election .
This perhaps explains why so many prominent Germans , some of whom barely spoke English , were commissioned as colonels , majors , or generals in Lincoln ’s army .
Emison views Lincoln ’s relevance to modern America very differently than Mario Cuomo and Harold Holzer , authors of Why Lincoln Matters : Today More Than Ever. Cuomo and Holzer celebrate the fact that Lincoln has long been the image / poster boy of America .
In a textbook example of the kind of childish simplemindedness that Emison refers to , Holzer has even said that u201 Ceverything goodu201D in all of American history since 1865 is due to Abraham Lincoln .
Emison agrees that Lincoln ’s influence is tremendous , but writes that u201CAmerica is haunted by Lincoln ’s blood lust for a coercive , dominant , unitary , unaccountable , debt - laden central governmentu201D whose principle function is u201 Cthe plunder of society and the redistribution of wealth to the politically privileged elite [ like the Cuomo family ] and their collection of political sycophants [ like Lincoln cultists ] who help keep them in power .
u201D
In this regard , u201 Cthe two major parties have become the party of Lincoln , each a metastatic twin of the other .
u201D Abraham Lincoln u201 Copened the door to the Leviathan central state that mandates , manipulates , and regulates virtually every aspect of life in America and seeks unilateral hegemony around the globe.

The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
Beyond bolstering the ability to conduct a first strike , the improvements to U.S. counterforce weapons also allow war planners to design nuclear options that will make the weapons more “ usable ” during high - stakes crises .
Nuclear planners face many choices when they consider striking a given target .
First , they must choose a warhead yield .
The American arsenal includes low - yield weapons such as the B - 61 bomb , which can detonate with as little explosive force as 0.3 kilotons ( one - fiftieth the power of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima ) , and high - yield weapons such as the B - 83 bomb , which can yield 1,200 kilotons ( 80 times the strength of the Hiroshima bomb ) .
For a military planner , high - yield weapons are attractive because they ’re very likely to destroy the target — even if the weapon misses by some distance .
Low - yield warheads , on the other hand , can be more discriminating , if planners want to minimize civilian casualties .
A second key decision for war planners is whether to set the weapon to detonate at ground level or in the air above the target .
A groundburst creates enormous overpressure and ground shock , ideal for destroying a hardened target .
But groundbursts also create a lot of radioactive fallout .
Dirt and other matter is sucked up into the mushroom cloud , mixes with radioactive material , and , after being carried by the wind , falls to earth in the hours after the blast , spreading lethal radiation .
Airbursts create smaller zones of extremely high overpressure , but they also generate very little fallout .
If the detonation occurs above a threshold altitude ( which depends on the weapon yield ) , virtually no heavy particles from the ground mix with the radioactive material in the fireball .
The radioactive material rises into the high atmosphere and then falls to earth over the course of several weeks in a far less dangerous state and over a very wide area , greatly reducing the harm to civilians .
In the past , a nuclear attack on China ’s arsenal would have had horrific humanitarian consequences .
The weapons were less accurate , so an effective strike would have required multiple high - yield warheads , detonating on the ground , against each target .
The Federation of American Scientists and the Natural Resources Defense Council modeled the consequences of such an attack — similar to the submarine attack described above — and published their findings in 2006 .
The results were sobering .
Although China ’s long - range missiles are deployed in a lightly populated region , lethal fallout from an attack would travel hundreds of miles and kill more than 3 million Chinese civilians .
American leaders might have contemplated such a strike , but only in the most dire circumstances .
But things are changing radically .
Improved accuracy now allows war planners to target hardened sites with low - yield warheads and even airbursts .
And the United States is pushing its breakthroughs in accuracy even further .
For example , for many years America has used global - positioning systems in conjunction with onboard inertial - guidance systems to improve the accuracy of its conventionally armed ( that is , nonnuclear ) cruise missiles .
Although an adversary may jam the GPS signal near likely targets , the cruise missiles use GPS along their flight route and then — if they lose the signal — use their backup inertial - guidance system for the final few kilometers .
This approach has dramatically improved a cruise missile ’s accuracy and could be applied to nuclear - armed cruise missiles as well .
The United States is deploying jam - resistant GPS receivers on other weapons , experimenting with GPS on its nuclear - armed ballistic missiles , and planning to deploy a new generation of GPS satellites — with higher - powered signals to complicate jamming .
FIJA , of course , is the Fully Informed Jury Association , and the “ informed ” part of the name alludes to a juror ’s right quâ human being , to nullify unjust laws by returning “ not guilty ” verdicts in spite of the law as a matter of moral principle .
Some people argue that a juror ’s responsibility is to determine matters of fact , reserving determinations on matter of law to the judges or magistrates .
I respectfully disagree : perhaps the single most important fact in any trial is whether the law is just on moral principles .
Any usurper or criminal gang can write laws , and hire goons to enforce them , but so long as they wish to maintain the pretense of “ justice ” by making accomplices of their victims , those victims need to excercise their moral obligations towards their brethren .
It is absurd to say that [ juries ] have no moral responsibility for the use that may be made of their verdict by the government , when they have reason to suppose it will be used for purposes of injustice .
— Lysander Spooner , Trial by Jury
When telling the truth leads inevitably to the commission of an injustice , the only moral option is to lie .
— No Third Solution archives , Jury Nullification : The Only Moral Option
Others argue that nullification and FIJA is a waste of time , because it does n’t really win .
OK , so it is n’t perfect .
But if more people practiced it , and practiced it consistently , any number of unjust laws would either be exposed for the tyranny that they are , or rendered practically impotent by the people .
The effects of widespread nullification would be numerous acts of non-violent civil disobedience , the likes of which would make La Boetie proud , as citizens refusing to assist any longer in their own oppression cast off the yokes and chains of bondage .
FIJA activism represents possibly the only opportunity for citizens to fight the government on its own turf : as a juror , you may have to be a slave , but you do n’t need to participate in the perpetuation of your own bondage .
Better still , you may help the pendulum of public opinion swing in favor of nullification and against tyranny .
What can you do ?
If this message resonates at all with you , share the links mentioned above , and look for more resources on the topic .
Understand the principled approach to nullifying unjust laws and explain these positions to people when the opportunity presents itself .
Let them know that it ’s natural to feel remorseful ( an admission of wrongdoing ) when you sentence a non-violent “ criminal ” offender to prison .
If they beg you about civic duty , inform them that your civic duty is to remain vigilantly intolerant of injustice .
Graham Dugas sums it up nicely :
… I have often wondered how someone ’s conscience could be bothered if they told a policeman or a judge a “ half - truth ” but they are not bothered by voting to convict their fellow man of some evil law and subjecting him to draconian punishment for it .
If I am going to err , let it be on the side of my fellow man .
John of Blagnet offers some additional advice in the comments , which I ’ve subsequently added to this post :
If you ’re conscripted for jury duty and you want to serve ( for the reasons discussed in this post : to protect your fellow man from predatory law ) , do n’t openly advertise to the prosecutor or judge that you support jury nullification , because that is grounds for immediate dismissal .
They do n’t want anyone who thinks for themselves or who might consider contradicting what the State decrees .
Most importantly , let them know that they do n’t have to participate in such a mockery of justice ; that they are perfectly within their rights ( afforded by what little freedom remains in this country ) to abide morality rather than “ law ” .
BALTIMORE --
The cheat sheet goes everywhere .
To the ballpark .
To the bathroom .
On dates .
The cheat sheet folds in half , rests comfortably next to Zack Hample 's dollar bills , never leaves his wallet .
Neatly typed in Geneva font , it features 34 phrases in 34 different languages , written phonetically , all asking the same thing :
Please throw me a ball .

CHOH - toh , boh - OR - roo oh NAH - geh - tay KOO - dah - sigh .

Watch out for batted balls ... and for Zack Hample .
" You 'll have to get me the translation , " he says .
" I 'll add it .
Just in case . "
Understand : Hample has rules , ethics , an entire self - generated moral code .
No hawking baseballs from little kids .
Minor league games do n't count .
For the cheat sheet , however , he makes no apologies .
Because players have both ears and balls .
Because the cheat sheet works .
It 's scorching , sweltering late afternoon in August , a miserable evening for a miserable game between two miserable last - place teams , the Baltimore Orioles and the visiting Oakland A's .
Hample could n't be happier .
Lousy weather means fewer fans .
Fewer fans means less competition .
Less competition means more baseballs .
Not that Hample needs them .
Over the past 19 years , the 32 - year - old has snagged exactly 4,166 baseballs from major league parks across the country -- fouls , home runs , waterlogged balls from the bottom of the right - field fountain at Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City -- and tonight he hopes to pad his stats .
Expects to , really .
Hope is for amateurs , the guys with beers in one hand and HIT IT HERE signs in the other , praying to the baseball gods , angling to catch dingers in the soft pockets of their flipped - over caps .
Hample is a pro .
He carries a cap for the home team and the visitors ( more on that shortly ) .
He has a streak to maintain ( at least one ball per game attended since 1993 ) , a reputation to uphold ( he 's written a book about ball - snagging , which essentially makes him the Dan Brown of books about ball - snagging ) and an ongoing competition to win ( he 's currently in first place in an online ball - snagging league , and yes , there actually is an online ball - snagging league ) .
More to the point , Oriole Park at Camden Yards is ... a snagger 's stadium .
( Note : This is exactly what I wrote down in my notepad . )
" This is as good as it gets , " Hample says .
" I 've considered moving to Baltimore , just to attend tons of games here .
Maybe the O's will get blown out .
More room for me to run . "
He pauses , grinning .
" If only it was April .
There 'd be even fewer fans . "
The sun hangs high .
We 're walking along the warehouse side of the stadium , across from the light rail tracks , heading toward a center - field gate .
Batting practice begins shortly .
Hample is ready .
Ten balls , he says .
At least .
That 's the goal .
His Oriole Park career average .
( And yes , he keeps track .
Duh . )
Hample does the math .
A ball every five minutes would be extraordinary ; every 20 minutes , unfathomably tragic .
One ball per 10 minutes would be just about right .
Only ... what about the heat ?
Players could skip practice altogether , robbing Hample of a prime ball - collecting opportunity .
He 's heard disturbing rumors from Texas , whispers that the Rangers have bailed on BP .
Can a big league club actually be that cheap ?
I mention that I did n't bring a glove .
" Good , " Hample says with a laugh .
" More balls for me . "
Hample brought a glove .
Always does .
A beat - up , broken - down , decade - old Mizuno , refurbished and undead .
Blessed with a fold that cups baseballs just so , perfectly shaped for Hample 's glove trick .
The glove trick trumps the cheat sheet .
It 's something MacGyver might have come up with , if disarming rouge nuclear warheads required plucking balls from outfield warning tracks .
Hample crouches in the stadium 's shade .
He wants a moment .
To hide .
He removes his glove from a backpack .
Attached to the glove is 25 feet of string .
Hample wraps the string around his hand , over and over , tucks the finished coil inside the glove .
The string is a fishing line :
If Hample sees an unattended ball on the field , he 'll prop the glove open with a magic marker , wrap a rubber band around the outside to form a pocket , lower the glove onto the ball and reel the whole thing in like a hooked marlin .
The trick has netted Hample more than 70 balls this season .
He can pull it off in as little as 15 seconds .
He places his glove back in the pack .
" I do n't want to do this in front of security and make a scene , " he says .
" It 's not illegal .
I need to be able to drop quickly and stealthily if a ball is on the warning track .
Before an usher sees or a player gets to it . "
Hample wears a white T - shirt , brown cargo shorts ( more pockets = more balls ) and an Orioles cap .
Inside his backpack are an Oakland cap and a matching green A's T - shirt , both awaiting a quick change , the better for Hample to lobby the visiting team for balls .
Sometimes Spanish is n't enough .
" Put this on , and I might be the only A's fan in Maryland , " he frets .
" I 'm worried that players tomorrow will be like , ' Oh , yeah , he 's that guy .
I 'm not tossing another ball .
Screw him . ' "
We come to the gate .
People say hello .
People know Hample .
They know his book , know his MLB.com blog , know him from YouTube clips and appearances on " The Tonight Show " and NPR .
The kids at the front of the line have even e-mailed Hample , ancient Delphians beseeching the Oracle , asking for ballhawking advice .
Tip : Show up early for BP .
Tip : Bring a glove .
Tip :
Be alert and mobile .
Tip :
Have large breasts .
Two lines over , a man in a yellow tank top holds what appears to be a fishing net .
Wait .
It is a fishing net , also yellow , used to scoop ground balls .
Hample frowns .
How unimaginative .
How lacking in skill .
" Look at this guy , " he says .
" Part of me is , ' Ah , that 's cheap . '
But then again , with all of my tricks , who am I to judge ? "
Every ball is a victory .
Scratch that .
Every ball is a freaking triumph .
Because Hample is not a cute kid , the parent of a cute kid , a sweet and semi-pitiable old person or an attractive girl with large breasts .
He 's just some guy .
He receives no charity balls , nothing dropped on his doorstep .
He has to work the angles , worm his way into players ' heads , use an online hit tracker to figure out the best place to stand .
Go out there and get the balls , even when they 're literally falling from the sky .
" I 'm just sort of weird , " he admits .
" My whole existence is strange .
I 'm aware of that . "
Hample is eating noodles .
We 're sitting in a Thai restaurant , a few blocks from Oriole Park , an hour before the gates open .
Like a Disney Channel heroine -- or maybe Bruce Wayne -- Hample lives two lives .
In the first , he resides in Manhattan .
Works at his family 's bookstore .
Has a girlfriend .
Belongs to a fiction - writing group .
In Hample 's second life , an old bedroom in his parents ' house contains five filing drawers filled with 144 baseballs apiece ... alongside seven 32 - gallon barrels holding 400 balls each .
Hample has written two books , " How to Snag Major League Baseballs " and " Watching Baseball Smarter : A Professional Fan's Guide , " the latter boasting a laudatory quote from Keith Hernandez .
( Short story :
He has a friend whose ex-girlfriend is married to Hernandez 's best friend .
Now you know . )
Hample caught two of the last 10 home runs belted at old Yankee Stadium -- earning a nod on SportsCenter -- and the final homer hit at Shea Stadium .
( He also nearly flipped a railing trying to snag a ball at the House that Ruth Built .
Occupational hazard . )
This season , he 's ballhawking for charity :
For every ball he snags , Hample is asking blog readers to donate money to an organization that distributes used baseball equipment to impoverished children around the world .
( Totals so far : 40 games , 346 balls , 117 donors , $ 24.74 per ball , $ 8,560.04 given . )
" Snagging can be a burden , " he says .
" On the first date ?
Worst thing ever .
I have to hide it .
It 's the last thing I talk about when I 'm away from baseball . "
Hample caught his first four balls in 1990 , added 14 more in 1991 .
The next year , he became obsessed .
He was 14 years old , with no friends and no other hobbies .
Just Topps cards and playing baseball .
Since Hample already rode the subway to and from school , his parents allowed him to attend games solo .
He went to 80 Mets and Yankees contests , collected 128 balls .
Not enough .
Hample could be at the movies , a birthday party , wherever .
If a baseball game took place in New York and he was n't on hand , he emotionally shut down , distraught at the thought of missing a single ball .
" My parents were deeply concerned about me for a while , " he says .
Hample went to Guilford , a small Quaker college in Greensboro , N.C , five hours from the nearest major league park ( Atlanta 's Fulton - County Stadium ) .
The distance was intentional .
He wanted to give up ballhawking .
And he did .
Sort of .
He picked up Scrabble instead , spent an hour a day memorizing four - letter words , went scorched - earth on the dictionary until he reached the P's .
Suddenly , he stopped .
What are you doing ?
Go enjoy yourself .
Hample met a girl , fell in love for the first time .
He rode the bench as a freshman pinch - hitter on the school 's baseball team , batting .429 ( 6 - for - 14 ) .
Realizing he would never play in the majors -- never ever -- he quit .
Just like that .
" I did it that instant , " Hample says .
" If I can't reach the highest level of something , why do it at all ? "
The first book brought him back .
Changed everything .
Published in 1999 , Hample 's ball - getting guide sports a cover cutline reading " more than 100 tested tips that really work , " superimposed over a photo of the author clutching eight (! ) baseballs in two hands .
Hample looks young and earnest , slightly ( very ) dorky .
And yet , the book took the stigma out of Hample 's obsession .
It made him legit .
Earned him respect .
Helped his parents relax .
Fans began to recognize him .
Ushers .
Stadium security .
The beer guys .
Even players .
He started interacting with people , making his self - described " obsessive stadium ball - snagging mode " a social affair .
Ballhawking was fun again -- still compelling , not as consuming .
Hample worked for a minor league baseball team in Idaho , lived in Paris , interned at the American School for the Deaf .
He snagged his 2,000th ball on a toss from Joe Roa -- who later added an autograph -- and his 3,000th ball from the Yankee Stadium warning track ( glove trick ) .
He researched and wrote a second book , caught Barry Bonds ' 724th home run , lent a ball to CBS for a segment with Charlie Sheen , started a cottage business in which aspiring snaggers accompany him to games , learning the tricks of the trade .
He never did settle down with an office job , sitting in a cubicle all day , spending his evenings chitchatting at cocktail parties .
The mere thought makes him antsy .
Hample often feels like the world 's biggest 6 - year - old , like he has " unofficial ADD times 10 . "
Nearly a decade ago , Hample set the world record for high score in the 1986 blast - 'em - up arcade game Arkanoid .
Correction : Hample broke his previous world record by racking up 1,658,110 points in a play session that stretched a single quarter across two hours .
This is probably not a coincidence .
" Where do you draw the line between obsession and passion ? " Hample says .
" You can't be a master of anything if you 're not obsessed .
I 'm not saying put me on a level with Tiger Woods .
I just think you can't achieve greatness without devoting yourself . "
Hample grins .
He mentions that he used to get made fun of at sleepaway camp .
All the time .
" On a very small scale , and not to be cocky , but I know what it means to be the best in the world at something , " he says .
" It 's a cool feeling . "
Hample is hawking blind .
Ca n't see the batter , ca n't see the game , ca n't see anything save a couple dozen beer - drinking fans leaning on the fence above the right - field warning track .
We 've come to Oriole Park 's standing room only section , where Hample hunches by a large metal trash can , glove on his hand and hands on his knees , under a green and white sign reading WATCH OUT FOR BATTED BALLS .
An alcohol compliance officer in a bright orange shirt walks past , casing the fence - leaners .
Hample points to one of them , a fellow ballhawk named Erik , also with glove , standing on his tiptoes .
" He 's making a common mistake , " Hample says .
" Maybe it works for him .
If he gets a short home run , he 's all over it .
But anything deep ... "
Hample gestures to the rather large and imposing foam - padded flagpoles dotting the right - field plaza , each topped with an American League team flag , an obstacle course of potential Grade 1 concussions .
" ... and I 've got it .
It 's easier to move forwards than backwards . "
Like a manager making a late - game switch , Hample is playing the odds .
He always plays the odds .
Has to .
Game - used balls do n't come easy .
A third out ball -- that is , when a player flips a baseball to fans above the dugout -- happens once a game .
A foul ball happens every other game .
A home run ?
In all his years of chasing baseballs , Hample has caught nine of those , ever , one with a self - imposed asterisk .
( The ball bounced on the field and was tossed to Hample , which he dubs an assisted play . )
Balls are the product of circumstance , he says .
And so he runs .
Probably more than most of the players .
( Now I understand the Thai noodles : needed carbohydrates . )
Hample scampers around Oriole Park until his shirt is soaked with sweat and -- what the hell ?
-- dirt , dodging peanut vendors and red - faced fans with tottering trays of beer .
He spends an inordinate amount of time pretending not to run , too , the better to pacify scolding ushers .
When a left - handed batter such as Oakland 's Adam Kennedy comes up to bat , Hample stations himself in a concourse tunnel , behind home plate and to the right , the best spot in the stadium to snag a foul ball ; when a right - handed batter comes up , he moves to the opposite tunnel ; when a power - hitter like the A's Jack Cust digs in , Hample sprints along the aisles to the SRO section in right .
( In this regard , he probably trumps Billy Beane as a " Moneyball " beneficiary : Increased major league plate discipline means more time to shuttle back and forth without missing a batted ball . )
Hample can tell you the best ballparks to catch fouls ( Milwaukee , Arlington ) and the worst ( Philadelphia , a " crowded place with no aisle , and it's not like I 've lost my athleticism " ) , plus the one place where changing into the road team 's jersey will get you pushed and elbowed ( Yankee Stadium , either iteration ) .
He has scouting reports on players and ushers .
( Of one Oriole Park usher : " She 's trouble . "
Shaking hands with another : " Nice guy .
His name is Lamont . " )
If Hample can't see the action on the field , he 'll have his girlfriend , Jona , flash him hand signals .
" People e-mail me , ' Who are the nicest guys to throw balls ? ' "
Hample says .
" I always say , ' Do n't focus on the players .
Focus on the situation . ' "
Back among the right - field flags , Hample waits .
He studies the foul pole , the same pole that once robbed him of a Nick Markakis home run .
A pause in the game .
The Orioles are changing pitchers .
Please be a righty .
A right - handed reliever would increase the chances of the A's deploying left - handed batters , in turn upping Hample 's chances of snagging a homer .
He runs to the fence .
No !
" A lefty ! " he says .
" Mark Hendrickson .
Mark effin' Hendrickson . "
Hample pulls a homemade team roster out of his pocket .
If not for Hendrickson , the next batter would have been left - handed .
He shakes his head .
" The home run gods are against me . "
Maybe so .
But not during batting practice .
A few hours earlier , I spot Hample in the left - field stands , three rows above the 364 FT wall marker .
He waves , promptly ignores me .
Someone on the Orioles is hitting bombs .
Two balls land near Hample , one after the other , smacking against the green plastic seats .
Hample collects both .
He flashes three fingers .
Another ball lands behind him .
Two other fans converge , but Hample beats them to the prize .
( Hustling from row to row , he is deceptively , disturbingly fast .
Like , magic fast . )
Moments later , he catches another ball on the fly , right in his glove .
Five balls .
Eight minutes .
Pretty good .
Between BP rounds ,
Hample removes the balls from his cargo pockets , marks each one with a number : 4168 , 4169 ...
" What 's the most you 've ever gotten in a game ? " asks Matt Hersl , a 43 - year - old city employee who works down the street .
" Thirty - two , " Hample says .
" Thirty - two ?
What happened ? "
" Kansas City .
That 's what happened . "
It 's true :
In mid-June , Hample snagged a personal -- and possibly world , but who 's counting ? -- record 32 baseballs during a single game at Kauffman Stadium , clambering down into a gap between the bullpen and an outfield wall to grab 11 balls and using a homemade strings - and - kitchen - colander contraption to capture three more .
( True story :
To get the hang of using the using the colander , Hample fished tennis balls out of a lake .
Willingly . )
A fly ball sails overhead , hitting the concrete steps behind us before ricocheting onto the field .
" I misjudged that one , " Hample says , surprisingly nonplussed .
" One thing that makes me feel better is that if you watch a major league outfielder , even he will be drifting to the last second .
He 'll break a step the wrong way .
Out here in the seats , I do n't have that luxury .
I have to dodge seats and the railing . "
The Orioles conclude BP .
The A's are forthcoming .
Hample changes into a green Oakland shirt .
So does Erik Jabs , a Spanish teacher from Pittsburgh who founded the online ballhawk league , which tracks Average Balls per Game , Balls Caught by Device and other metrics you 've almost certainly never heard of .
Looking around , I notice a half - dozen kids pulling the two - shirt trick .
This is what Hample hath wrought .
Jabs says he 's working a 71 - game streak , and that he once rolled his ankle chasing a ball .
Hample counters that he previously cracked a rib .
" Zack 's the king of ballhawks , " Jabs acknowledges .
The sun slips behind the upper deck .
The left - field seats are filling up .
The King of Ballhawks is getting antsy , stuck on eight balls .
He paces his row , tugging his shorts , no room to run .
Too many bodies .
An usher leads a family of five to their seats .
Hample has to move .
Who comes and sits in their seats during batting practice ?
He asks an Oakland player for a ball in Spanish .
The player flips a ball to someone nearby .
All around , fans are jabbering on cell phones , hooting and hollering , exchanging fist bumps , excited if a ball lands anywhere near them .
Hample is quiet .
Stone - faced .
He points at an usher .
" If she does n't look over here , " he says , " I 'll have a ball in two minutes . "
Zack Hample
Make enough great grabs and you 'll find yourself on TV more often than not .
Between the bullpen and the left - field seats is a concrete walkway , a 20 - foot drop from where we 're perched .
Atop the walkway lies a baseball .
Hample stands on a seat , leans against a chicken wire safety fence .
Trick time .
He lowers his glove , string attached .
It hits the ball ... but pushes it farther away .
Hample winces .
Horrendous , he says .
I just botched it .
A cop walks through the bullpen .
" Sir , may I please have a ball ? "
No luck .
Hample peers through the fence .
He looks up .
Looks down .
Nobody 's watching .
He sticks a marker back in his glove .
Lowers it again .
Closer ... closer ... almost there .
The usher approaches .
" Young man , may I see your ticket , please ? "
Defeat .
We retire to the seats above the Oakland dugout , gulp bottled water , take a breather .
Hample lays out his dream : sponsorship for a full season , maybe from a glove company .
Five games per stadium .
A thousand balls .
For charity , of course .
He scans the field .
Oakland 's coaches and catchers are tossing balls down the left - field line .
Sometimes , he says , he still feels like he could be down there .
Like he was meant to be a ballplayer .
If you can't reach the highest level of something , why do it at all ?
" What would Adam Kennedy be if he was n't a ballplayer ? "
Hample says .
" And then I realize , you 're looking at it .
I 'm the answer to my own quest -- "
Kennedy emerges from the dugout .
Hample makes a beeline , A's shirt yanked over his shoulders .
" Adam , right here ! " Ball No. 9 . He jogs to the coaches .
Checks his pocket roster .
" Hey Ron !
Toss one up ! "
Oakland bullpen coach Ron Romanick happily obliges .
Ball No. 10 .
Hample returns with his tongue jutting out -- first strutting , then dancing along the aisle .
" I got my 10 ! " he says .
" As I should have . "
A slight pout .
" But again , I should be at 11 or 12 now . "
About that cracked rib :
The injury happened in Anaheim , about a year ago , and did not involve : ( A ) running into another ballhawk , ( B ) falling over a safety rail while performing the glove trick , ( C ) getting beat up after swiping a ball from a little kid .
No , the rib was pure stupidity , entirely Hample 's fault .
( His words , not mine . )
Hample was working the right - center seats during batting practice , no one within 20 feet .
A ball went over his head , landed a few rows behind him .
It bounced .
Trying to snag the rebound , Hample lost his balance , then fell sideways into a metal armrest .
" I can't remember if I picked it up off the ground , but I got the ball , " he recalls .
" My 1,000th ball outside New York . "
So it was worth it ?
" It was totally not worth it , " he says .
" It hurt !
The worst pain I 've ever experienced in a baseball situation . "
Reaching for a ball at Yankee Stadium , Hample tore off a thumbnail .
A tipped home run ball once hit him in the face , breaking his nose .
( " Slightly , " Hample clarifies .
" The whole thing was n't disintegrated . " )
He shows me a yellow - purple mark on his leg , a two - week - old bruise produced by the wrong end of a folded - down seat .
We 're sitting under the Oriole Park upper deck , waiting out a rain delay .
Hample is eating pizza .
Milli Vanilli wafts from the stadium P.A. system -- softly , painfully -- while out on the field , the infield tarp glistens under the lights .
" Wow , " Hample says , " this is beautiful . "
Biting .
Chewing .
" Also , players are going to have to warm up their arms .
I might get a ball out of this that I would n't otherwise . "
The rain subsides .
The grounds crew emerges .
Tonight is Hample 's 41st game of the season .
Years ago , he would attend 80 - plus .
He used to show up solely for batting practice , focused and determined , far less mindful , hurdling railings and jumping seats , gobbling balls like Pac - Man .
No longer .
He 's getting older .
He has his girlfriend , his blog , the ballhawk community , a third book underway ( about baseballs , of course ) .
He makes a point of giving away balls , particularly to children .
He has a growing appreciation for the moment , a far greater appreciation for game - used balls -- each one a memento , a tangible reminder of beating the odds .
" They are so hard to get , " Hample says .
" Game home run balls are the holy grail . "
Baltimore 's pitchers come out of the bullpen , make their way across the outfield grass .
Is Hample obsessed ?
Strange ?
I 'm not sure he's all that different from the ballplayers below -- or from the rest of us .
Everyone scheming and sweating and striving .
Everyone at the mercy of fate -- a baseball falls your way , or it does n't -- yet still determined to massage the odds , to bend the long arc of luck toward opportunity .
" I wonder if those guys have a ball , " Hample says .
" Ahhh .
The ushers wo n't let me all the way down there , anyway . "
Hample narrows his eyes , unblinking .
" Oh my God !
He has a ball in his hand !
Let me out ! "
Hample scrambles down the concrete steps , glove in hand .
From the still - soaked lower concourse walkway -- a good 30 feet from the field -- he gestures frantically , a man with a plan and a cheat sheet in his wallet .
Throw me a ball !
Right here !
Throw it to me !
The world will always belong to those who swing from the heels .
As for the balls ?
It helps to know a little Swahili .

The conservative columnist George Will once said football combines the two worst things about America : violence punctuated by committee meetings .
As a designer who occasionally gets caught up in the fury of the game , I ’d like to add graphic design to what ’s wrong with football .
With the help of Skycam I spend as much time enjoying the color , patterns and graphics that add to the spectacle of the sport , as I do enjoying a deftly - completed pass .
Now that the Yankees have won the World Series and the season shifts from batting balls to banging heads , I ’ve been musing about NFL helmet design .
For inspiration ( and some truly bizarre helmet design ) , I visited the Art of the
Samurai : Japanese Arms and Armor at The Metropolitan Museum of Art in
New York .
Created centuries ago , these designs ( left ) are more about shock and
awe than waging battle but are truly extraordinary .
Today ’s high - tech helmet with its wireless headset and polycarbonate visor has come a long way from the padded leather ones of yesterday .
It not only serves its essential protective function but is also a gleaming sign for a team ’s brand .
Yet in many cases the graphics are blunt and formulaic , usually involving slapping the team ’s primary logo on both sides of the helmet .
This bilateral approach is sometimes successful for teams such as the Minnesota Vikings , St. Louis Rams and Philadelphia Eagles .
Horns and wings usually come in twos making these symmetrical designs feel natural .
The Dallas Cowboys ’ blue star on a silver field is crisp and a clear reference to the Lone Star state .
As for simplicity , I guess the Cleveland Browns score highest .
They use no logo at all but why do the Browns have orange helmets ?
Sept. 30 , 2009  -- Remember CIT ?
The major lender to small and medium - sized businesses that came back from the brink of bankruptcy in July ?
Now , CIT Group Inc. is back on the brink .
The company is furiously trying to work out a deal with bondholders that would wipe out around 30 to 40 percent of its more than $ 30 billion in debt , a source in the financial industry told ABC News , confirming a story in today 's Wall Street Journal .
If the bondholder deal falls through , the company will likely have to file for bankruptcy .
At this point , the source told ABC News , the century - old company is " hanging by their fingernails . "
CIT had no comment .
The last - ditch effort to avoid bankruptcy is the latest chapter in a saga that has gone on for months .
CIT accounts for around 60 to 70 percent of financing for small and medium - sized businesses such as Dillard 's department stores and Dunkin ' Donuts .
But the company ran into problems after diving into subprime mortgage lending and student lending .
In late July , CIT secured a $ 3 billion agreement with bondholders to stave off bankruptcy .
The bondholder agreement came days after the government said it would give no additonal bailout money to the company , after providing $ 2.3 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds in December .
Before the bondholder agreement was reached , CIT had asked the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. to allow it to issue debt backed by the government , enabling the company to bring in cash and continue lending .
But the FDIC balked , so CIT turned to the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve .
But the effort ended in vain .
On July 15 , the Treasury said , " Even during periods of financial stress , we believe that there is a very high threshold for exceptional government assistance to individual companies . "
The government 's decision was a testament to the improvements in the financial system in the past year .
If CIT had failed last fall or last winter , its collapse could have been catastrophic .
But , this year , even though a CIT bankruptcy could be one of the biggest Chapter 11 filings in the country 's history , the government was no longer compelled to help .
There has already been enough blogger outrage and cable host sputtering on the absurd notion that Army Maj .
Nidal Malik Hasan was suffering from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder ( PTSD ) when he shot 40 people last week at Ft. Hood , Texas , despite the fact that he had never served in a war zone .
( In a masterful bit of don't - mention - the - war hypothesizing , Time magazine suggested that Hasan , an Army psychiatrist , could be suffering from some type of secondhand PTSD . )
Evidence did quickly accumulate that Hasan was , in fact , afflicted with an excess of religious belief , something his fellow soldiers recognized after viewing Hasan 's PowerPoint presentation on Islam , informing them that he , as a Muslim , loved death more than they , filthy kaffirs the lot of them , valued life .
The huffing and puffing pundits , who correctly identified the murder of Dr. George Tiller an act of domestic terrorism , who rightfully bemoan Fred Phelps - ian religious extremism in almost all of its manifestations — with the emphasis on almost — were perplexed .
What could have motivated an advocate of suicide bombing , a man who refused to be photographed with women ?
What could have inspired the pious chap who attended the same radical mosque as two 9/11 hijackers , the gun-toting psycho psychiatrist that shouted Allahu Akbar while shooting unarmed servicemen and women in the back ?
It 's a mystery that would doubtless confound even Hercule Poirot .
On the other end of the debate , though , religious weirdos of a very different sort warned against allowing Muslims to serve in the military , at least while the United States was engaged in combat against an enemy that prays towards Mecca .
One need n't look very far to find lunkheaded bloggers and rent - an - Islamologists suggesting that , after weakening American security by preventing gays from working as Arabic translators , the military should go one step further and scrutinize — or sack — the 15,000 Muslims currently serving in uniform .
A minority position for sure , but a troubling one nevertheless .
If Muslims are incapable of fighting within ( or alongside ) the American military , this will come as news to those who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside native translators and members of the local armed forces ; those who do n't believe that a common faith prevents them from hunting down a co-religionist responsible for blowing up the Al - Askari Mosque in Samarra .
If we are to give creedence to the mad ravings of Hasan and Osama bin Laden , and exonerate their mutually held view that Islam is engaged in perpetual warfare with non-believers , one might have a difficult time explaining the brutal Iran - Iraq War , which — regardless of a century 's old Sunni - Shiite schism — pitted Muslim against Muslim .
And if there is indeed a Muslim fifth column operating in our military ranks , they 've certainly taken their sweet time in unleashing jihad .
So it is n't unreasonable for Gen.
George Casey to express concern that Hasan 's radical vision of how a Muslim should serve the Prophet might have adverse consequences for other active duty Muslim soldiers .
But this was soon followed by warnings from President Barack Obama , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano , and countless pundits and journalists , that there existed a very real possibility of a backlash against Muslim - Americans .
The Guardian , shaking in fear at the prospect of an American pogrom , offered this headline : " Obama acts as anti-Muslim anger threatens to engulf US . "
Other headlines emphasised that American Muslims are currently crippled by " fear and frustration " over increased " racial tensions . "
But as long as the press is busting myths related to Islam and terrorism , perhaps it is time to revisit the deeply entrenched idea that America experienced a post - 9/11 backlash against Muslim - Americans — and will likely experience a new wave of Islamophobia .
After months of hand - wringing from the national media , who clearly distrusted those rubes in flyover country to restrain their " get the Muslims " anger , the tragic tally was one American — a
Sikh gas station owner in Arizona — shot and killed as " revenge " for the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon .
An act , incidentally , perpetrated by a man , according to the court that sentenced him , suffering from " mental illness and [ a ] low IQ , " and unclear on the differences between Islam and Sikhism .
A 2002 investigation by The Washington Post found there to be " little proof of [ a ] post - 9/11 backlash " against Muslims .
And while the FBI reported a large increase in hate crimes against Arab and Muslim - Americans , the number of incidents were still microscopically small , the offenses often vague ( most falling under the category of " intimidation " ) and rarely violent , and still significantly lower than those classified as anti-Semitic .
Indeed , the Pew polling service found that Americans were more positive towards Islam and Muslim - Americans after September 11 .
According to a 2005
Pew report , " the day of the first terrorist attacks in London [ the July 7 subway attacks by Islamic supremacists ] , and July 17 , finds a majority of Americans ( 55 percent ) saying they have a favorable opinion of Muslim - Americans .
That is roughly the same proportion that expressed positive opinions of Muslim - Americans in Pew surveys conducted in July 2003 and March 2002 , and significantly higher than the 45 percent holding favorable views in March 2001 , prior to the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon " ( emphasis added ) .
After September 11 , former Washington
Post religion reporter Gustav Niebuhr set out in search of the great backlash against Muslims , finding instead anecdotal evidence in support of the Pew figures : " In the very week when the nation suffered a grievous injury from a stateless criminal gang that identified itself by its members ' religion — as Muslims — some Americans chose to express concern and friendship toward their Muslim neighbors . "
So despite having the mother of all opportunities for a national convulsion of violence and discrimination against a religious minority , America , for the most part , chose investigation over emotion : , lay conversations about the tenets of Islam were ubiquitous , books detailing doctrinal differences between Muslim sects flew off the shelves , and the president beseeched his fellow Americans to understand that , despite acts of violence in its name , Islam was a religion of peace .
One can always find , in a nation of 300 million people , examples of boorish behavior towards religious minorities .
But if Muslims that embrace violence against non-Muslims are a tiny minority , it is time to acknowledge that attacks on Muslims by non-Muslims in the United States are perpetrated by an even tinier minority .
That the United States does n't do backlashes needs to be restated frequently and forcefully , rather than ignored in favor of exploiting a " teachable moment " of religious tolerance .
So let 's stop frightening our fellow Americans , telling them that they will soon be " engulfed " in ethnic and religious violence , and acknowledge that we have , once again , acquitted ourselves rather well .
Michael C. Moynihan is a senior editor of Reason magazine .
Clement Attlee enjoyed the superiority of a postwar Englishman when he dismissed European unity in 1967 with a contemptuous sniff .
" The Common Market .
The so - called Common Market of six nations .
Know them all well .
Very recently , this country spent a great deal of blood and treasure rescuing four of 'em from attacks by the other two . "
For Germany and Italy , which had suffered under fascist dictatorships , and for France , Holland , Belgium and Luxembourg , which had suffered under fascist occupation , there was nothing in the war years to be superior about .
The Common Market promised liberation from a terrible past .
And continued to promise it .
Greece , Portugal and Spain confirmed their break with dictatorship and reaction when they joined .
After the fall of the Berlin Wall , Europe expanded its borders by offering the once subject peoples of the communist empire a better life in a democratic haven .
Nazis and communists never occupied Britain .
Our leaders sold us Europe as a smart investment opportunity rather than a democratic advance and we never felt the idealism behind European dream .
Lech Walesa knew better .
On the eve of Poland 's accession , he said : " I fought for our country to recover everything it lost under communism and the Soviets … and now my struggle is over .
My ship has come to port . "
Europe replaced the terrors of totalitarianism with human rights conventions and peace treaties .
It is easy to become exasperated by the monotony of its composite resolutions and interminable meetings .
But tens of millions accepted the chance of trading national sovereignty for freedom from the dictatorships of their day .
That deal is no longer on offer .
The dictatorships of our day come in many types , but the dominant form is a state capitalism or oligarchy in which the boss or ruling clique control public assets and the sinecures that go with them .
Strictly speaking , they are not full dictatorships .
Rulers tolerate elections as long as their results can be manipulated and allow criticism as long as it does not reach the masses .
The campaign group European Alternatives defined modern crony states thus : " In a country where television channels represent the only source of information for over 80 % of the population , control over the media must not of necessity assume the draconian and totalitarian methods its 20th - century precedent .
Manipulation of the principal , mass media of a country can today perfectly coexist with the maintenance of dedicated ' Indian reserves ' of opposition , flag bearers of a merely procedural freedom of expression . "
If the authors sound like high - minded European liberals lamenting far - away miseries , I should add that they were not discussing Putin 's Russia or Chávez 's Venezuela but Berlusconi's Italy .
Because the British care so little for Europe , no one apart from constitutional lawyers studies the < a href = " http://europa.eu/lisbon_treaty/glance/index_en.htm " title= " Charter of Charter of Fundamental Rights in the Lisbon Treaty .
In Brussels , however , Eurocrats pretend to take it seriously .
Article 11 guarantees freedom of the press and media pluralism , but Europe is happy to see Berlusconi exercise direct control of the three Mediaset private channels , his publishing house , advertising company and cinema distribution business and indirect control through his sycophants of Italy 's public television channels and the vast advertising budgets of the Italian government .
Last week in the European Parliament , socialist delegates tried to turn the rotten state of Italy into a European issue , only to see the " moderate " conservatives of the European People 's party turn on them .
Nicolas Sarkozy 's ally , Joseph Daul , was outraged that leftists could dare suggest Italy was anything other than " a democratic country where the rule of law was respected " .
The supporters of Angela Merkel refused to accept that Europe needed to defend Italians ' fundamental rights .
So angry were the supposed moderates at the insult to Berlusconi 's good name that they not only argued against intervention , but tried to prevent the debate taking place .
When David Cameron led the Tories out of the European People 's party to march in step with the SS veterans of the Latvian Fatherland and Freedom party , I and many others accused him of abandoning the European mainstream .
I should have added that the mainstream in Brussels has dark depths of its own .
When its outwardly respectable democrats find that a fellow conservative is creating a crony state at the heart of Europe , they do not protest but direct all their energy and passion into berating his opponents .
You could say , and " moderate " conservatives were saying in Brussels , that the Italian judiciary had proved Italy remained a liberal democracy by stripping Berlusconi of immunity from prosecution .
Yet Berlusconi has seen off the judges before .
In any event , even if he falls or , more likely , retires , Italians will not expect his corrupt system to go .
Berlusconi's private channels are unlikely to become beacons of public - service broadcasting after his departure .
The quaintly titled " post - fascist " leader Gianfranco Fini will not give up a system of patronage and censorship in which the state can organise advertising boycotts of critical papers and force out editors who report unwelcome news .
The most telling feature of the caudillos of our day is the ease with which they put aside nominal ideological differences and recognise each other as members of an international freemasonry of autocrats .
Berlusconi denounces investigating magistrates as " communists " and yet calls the former KGB man Vladimir Putin " his great friend " .
The nominal socialist Chávez allies with the Islamist reactionary Ahmadinejad .
What unites the boss men of the 21st century is more important than what divides them .
Democratic Europe , however , will not unite against them by standing up for its best values .
Its silence about Berlusconi – by turns both cowardly and compromised undermines its ability to stand up to corrupt politics anywhere else in Europe , most notably in the weak democracies of the post - Soviet east , and makes a nonsense of its condemnations of abuses of democratic rights beyond its borders .
For the first time in its history , Europe 's reputation as a force for good in the world feels precarious .
Soon it will feel fraudulent .

The pumpkin did not blow up at all .

Half of the resumé ( such as STR / INT etc. , and the 07. mm Pacer part , the games you like on the 2nd page ) is redundant info , and though I understand this kind of resumé suits a game designer job opening perfectly , you can barely see the forest for the trees .
IMHO , it'd be better to leave some of the redundant ' game character ' parts out of this , and re-position the rest so there is some space in between the separate parts / stats .
It 'll be easier to read , and hence not test the employer 's patience .
Furthermore I 'd recommend you to choose a different font than Times New Roman since this is heavily outdated and looks dull .
Also , unless certification in hospitality is a specific name for something a bit different than the name implies , I 'm not sure you should put that in your resumé .

Beyonce is just one of the acts signed to the Sony label
Playlouder MSP , launching at the end of September , will let its customers share Sony licensed music with others on its network .
In return , Playlouder will pool some of its broadband subscriptions to share with music rights owners .
The deal is seen as a groundbreaking move to use file - sharing legally .
" Ensuring record companies are adequately and reliably recompensed for the use of their copyrights on the internet is the number one issue for our business , " said BPI - the UK recording industry body - chairman Peter Jamieson .
" The BPI welcomes the innovative thinking which has gone into the creation of Playlouder MSP and we give it our full support . "
Acts under the Sony BMG umbrella include Beyonce , David Bowie , Macy Gray , Oasis , Travis , Will Young , Outkast , Alicia Keys and Dido .
Broadly welcomed
The deal signals the first time that music fans can use existing popular peer - to - peer ( P2P ) applications such as Kazaa , eDonkey and Limewire , to share music in an unrestricted and sanctioned way .
It has been widely welcomed by figures in the music industry , which has tried to battle illegal file - sharing for several years .
It retains the sense of community and spontaneity which makes P2P and super distribution so attractive to consumers
Clive Rich , Sony BMG
Napster boss : Life after piracy
Although legal threats exist , it has had mixed success .
P2P sharing is still proving a popular and efficient way to distribute files that people want , quickly .
Sony BMG's Clive Rich recognised that the Playlouder service had tried to keep some of the features that have continued to attract file - sharers since the early illegitimate days of Napster .
" It retains the sense of community and spontaneity which makes P2P and super distribution so attractive to consumers , whilst ensuring that this activity takes place within a framework in which the music can be tracked and rights owners get paid " he said .
In a recent survey of more than 800 online music fans for Playlouder , more than half said they would prefer to download music using legitimate P2P networks over other legal download services , such as iTunes and Napster .
Playlouder said it would use digital fingerprinting techniques to track the sharing of music in any format over its own network .
It added that if all broadband net service providers followed this model , the music industry would have a revenue source of more than £ 300 m a year in the UK , and $ 13.5 bn globally .
The music - based net service provider will offer its basic 1 M bps broadband package at £ 26.99 a month , and says its network has been specifically designed for downloading files , such as digital music .
What is called " deep packets search " technology is used in Playlouder 's network to spot file - sharing traffic so it can be re-routed to Playlouder 's " walled garden " , allowing only other Playlouder subscribers access to it .
The technology behind Playlouder 's service is provided by Audible Magic .
BUSHEHR , Iran ( Reuters ) - Russia plans to start up Iran ’s first nuclear power station in March 2010 to coincide with the Iranian New Year , two sources closely involved with the project told Reuters .

Russia agreed in 1995 to build the 1,000 megawatt nuclear power plant at Bushehr on the Gulf coast in south - western Iran , but delays have haunted the $ 1 billion project and diplomats say Moscow has used it as a lever in relations with Tehran .
The sources , who asked not to be identified because of the sensitivity of the situation , both said that Russia had ordered that the plant be ready for operation by the holiday which falls in the second half of March .
“ We have been given the task of launching the plant by Iranian New Year , ” said one of the sources .
“ There is still a lot of work to do . ”
The second source added that testing at the plant was going well .
During a visit to the nuclear plant on Monday , Russian Energy Minister Sergei Shmatko said it would be finished soon but refused to give a time .
“ The Bushehr plant will be finished in the nearest future , ” said Shmatko , who before he was made energy minister used to head the Russian state company that is helping to build Bushehr .
The atomic power station was once a source of disagreement between Russia and the West , which suspected the Islamic Republic would try to use it to build nuclear weapons .
But in recent years , the United States has dropped its opposition and says the plant removes any need for Iran to have its own enrichment program .
Russia says the plant is purely civilian and cannot be used for any weapons program as it will come under International Atomic Energy Agency supervision .
Iran will have to return all spent fuel rods to Russia .
IRAN DEFIANT
Russia , a veto - wielding permanent member of the United Nations Security Council , is a key player in efforts to force Tehran to allay Western fears about its nuclear program .
Moscow has previously supported UN sanctions against Iran only after insisting they be watered down and has so far refused to publicly support calls by the United States for the threat of additional sanctions against the Islamic Republic .
Russia has even been censured by some in Tehran for using Iran as a “ pawn ” in the diplomatic poker game over Iran ’s nuclear ambitions .
At a news briefing in Bushehr on Monday , Shmatko was pressed by Iranian reporters about why Moscow had failed to deliver S - 300 air - defense missile systems that could defend Iranian nuclear facilities against any potential strike by Israel .
“ Thank God , not everybody in Iran thinks that Russia has made some sort of deal against Iran , ” said Shmatko .
The head of Iran ’s Atomic Energy Organization , Ali Akbar Salehi , was asked why Russia had supported a U.N. nuclear agency resolution that rebuked Iran for keeping an enrichment plant secret .
Salehi dismissed the question , saying that Tehran and Moscow had good cooperation and that Russia would be given priority for participating in Iran ’s plans to build an extra 20,000 megawatts of new power generation over the next two decades .
“ For these projects Russia will have a priority , ” he said .
“ Cooperation between Iran and Russia is of a strategic character . ”
Moscow agreed to build the Bushehr station in 1995 on the site of a plant begun in the 1970s by German firm Siemens .
This project was disrupted by Iran ’s 1979 Islamic revolution and the 1980 - 88 Iran - Iraq war .
Conseil Stratégique Industries Santé CSIS
Sarkozy aides financières
Nicolas Sarkozy en sauveur de l'industrie pharmaceutique , qui amasse des milliards tout en licenciant massivement ...
Non , non , vous ne rêvez pas .
Le 26 octobre 2009 , le Conseil Stratégique des Industries de Santé ( CSIS ) , réunissant les dirigeants des principaux groupes pharmaceutiques français , était reçu à l'Elysée .
L'heure est grave .
Le secteur pharmaceutique hexagonal sera ( peut - être ) bientôt dans le rouge .
En 2012 , les brevets des médicaments les plus vendus expireront .
Certains y voient l'effet d'une nette baisse de l'effort de recherche des labos , qui préfèrent de loin se concentrer sur le marketing et le lobbying .
Pas Nicolas Sarkozy .
En conclusion de cette petite sauterie , le chef de l'Etat a en effet confirmé point par point les revendications des grands groupes .
Bingo !
" Les revenus de vos entreprises vont baisser de 20 , 30 ou 40 % " a déclaré Nicolas Sarkozy , le regard sombre , devant les patrons du CSIS .
Pour le président , cette " chute historique " est exclusivement due à la " générication " des médicaments .
La solution est donc toute trouvée : il faut aider financièrement l'industrie pharmaceutique .
Un fonds d'investissement dans les biotechnologies de la santé sera créé , doté d'emblée de 130 millions d'euros et financé pour moitié par l'Etat .
La suppression de la taxe professionnelle allègera de 16 % les charges des entreprises du secteur , le Crédit impôt recherche réformé en 2008 et reconduit pour 2010 permettra aux entreprises de se voir rembourser 30 % de leurs dépenses de recherche et développement ( R&D ) , tandis qu'à l'avenir , " l'emprunt national [ notez l'absence du terme " grand " ] pourrait financer certains investissements " , notamment la création d'instituts hospitalo - universitaires en partenariat avec le privé .
Cinq de ces établissements seront d'ailleurs labellisés en 2010 ...
Cinq , soit exactement le nombre de firmes représentées au sein du Conseil stratégique ( modestement surnommé G5 par ses membres ) : Sanofi-Aventis , Pierre Fabre , Servier , Ipsen et le Laboratoire de fractionnement des biotechnologiques .
Heureux hasard ...
L'art de subventionner des entreprises ultra-bénéficiaires qui licencient ...
Pas peu fier de ses annonces , Nicolas Sarkozy a finalement donné rendez - vous à ses interlocuteurs en 2012 pour une nouvelle réunion du CSIS .
" Nous pourrons alors constater , j'en forme le voeu , que vous aurez investi et créé des emplois en France " a - t - il déclaré .
Un voeu qui restera pieu , à n'en pas douter .
Ne riez pas trop fort ...
Cet été , Sanofi - Aventis a présenté son projet de " réorganisation " se traduisant par plus de 1200 suppressions de postes liés à la R&D , soit 20 % des effectifs .
Comme le labo représente 50 % des effectifs totaux de R&D de l'industrie pharmaceutique française , ce sont 10 % des effectifs nationaux qui disparaitront ainsi du secteur .
Tout cela alors que Sanofi - Aventis a vu ses profits augmenter de 22 % au premier semestre 2009 , qu'il a réalisé des acquisitions pour 6,2 milliards d'euros et que les retombées de la vaccination anti-grippe A s'annoncent plus que juteuses ...
L'heure est grave , puisqu'on vous le dit .
La recherche pour le public , les bénéfices pour le privé
D'ailleurs , Marc Cluzel , responsable de la branche R&D de Sanofi - Aventis , l'a clairement affirmé lors de l'annonce du plan de licenciement : " Pourquoi voudriez - vous qu'on continue à financer 100 % de notre recherche interne alors qu'à l'extérieur , les organismes de recherche publique , les biotechs , les universités sont financés en tout ou partie par l'état et les collectivités territoriales " .
Analyse partagée par le DG de l'INSERM
( Institut national de la santé et de la recherche médicale ) , André Syrota , qui a récemment confirmé que " les industriels de la pharmacie vont externaliser entre 20 % et 30 % de leurs recherches vers des laboratoires académiques " .
Et par Claire Roussel , directrice des partenariats chez Roche France ( Les echos ) : " la productivité de nos laboratoires est en chute libre alors que les coûts de R&D ont doublé .
Le tuyau de l'innovation se tarit " .
En clair , la recherche coûte trop cher à l'industrie pharmaceutique , pour des résultats médiocres .
Les firmes s'en désengagent donc massivement , préférant licencier ses chercheurs pour s'appuyer sur les laboratoires publics , en grande partie financés par l'Etat .
Chercheurs en solde
Résumons .
En France , la part de la recherche est passée de 2,24 % du PIB en 2002 à 2,02 % en 2008 , selon l'association " Sauvons la recherche " .
Et depuis son arrivée au pouvoir , Nicolas Sarkozy n'a de cesse de chercher les chercheurs .
D'où l'engagement des pouvoirs publics à " poursuivre la simplification de l'organisation de la recherche en Sciences de la Vie et de la Santé et à maintenir leur effort de soutien public aux projets de recherche partenariale dans le domaine de la santé " .
Comprenez : on assèche les financements de la recherche publique française ( qui est vraiment nulle ) pour mieux la contraindre à accepter des partenariats public - privé ( puisque les labos la trouve super efficace ) ...
Ça ne vous rappelle pas quelque chose ?
Pôle emploi ( " lessivé par l'Etat , essoré par le privé " ) par exemple ... le scénario est bien rôdé .
Au final , au moment de négocier , les instituts publics se retrouvent en situation de faiblesse , et les labos privés se goinfrent !
La recherche pour le public , les bénéfices pour le privé .
Les Big pharma n'auraient pas rêvé mieux ...
[ NB : Les labos publics sont relativement favorables aux partenariats publics - privés , mais ce sont les conditions dans lequel ils sont signés , le pistolet sur la tempe , qui pose problème ]

Two weeks ago I sent out a Tweet to my friends telling them I was “ confined to my apartment by the PLA [ China 's military ] ” for the entire night , and that “ they would n’t even let me out for dinner ! ”
Well , it ’s happening again , for the third time this month , and the whole crazy thing is starting to make world headlines , so I figure I ought to relate the full tale of what ’s going on here in Beijing .
October 1st is China ’s “ National Day , ” commemorating the day in 1949 when Chairman Mao stood atop Tiananmen ( the main gate to the Forbidden City ) and announced the formation of the People ’s Republic of China ( PRC ) .
Every ten years there is a big parade along Chang ’an Avenue , Beijing ’s main east - west boulevard , and through Tiananmen Square featuring – but not limited to – a military review of goose - stepping soldiers , tanks , and nuclear missiles reminiscent of the Cold War .
This year is the 60th Anniversary of the PRC , and the Chinese government is determined to dazzle the world with some artistic “ shock and awe . ”
The parade is expected to showcase some of China ’s newest long - range missiles and other advanced weapons systems .
John Curl , For All the People : Uncovering the Hidden History of Cooperation , Cooperative Movements , and Communalism in America ( Oakland , CA : PM Press , 2009 ) .
Curl ’s history of cooperative and communal movements in America is set against the backdrop of one overpowering trend : the transition from an almost completely self - employed work force at the time of Independence , to a present - day labor market in which self - employed workers are almost as much of an anomaly as free blacks ca. 1850 .
Two hundred years ago , wage labor was viewed as a form of bondage , something submitted to only when absolutely unavoidable .
The majority of wage laborers were apprentices and journeymen , who viewed their status as a temporary stage on the way to the normal status of self - employment .
In the course of his history , Curl stands on its head a great deal of the pious “ received account ” most of us learned in the public schools ’
American history classes .
Most of us are probably at least vaguely familiar with Bradford ’s account of Plymouth Plantation , for example .
But from Curl ’s version , unless you ’re really good at reading between the lines , you ’d never get any idea of the role that either class struggle , or the designs of a corporation called the Merchant Adventurers , played in the story .
The Mayflower Compact , as it has been passed down to us from Bradford via the Received Account , was the inspiring first example of American self - government through a written charter .
What ’s left out of this edifying account , as Curl points out , is that most of the emigrants to Plymouth were indentured servants ; signing onto a Compact en route to America , which declared the signatories free and equal , amounted to a servile insurrection .
The free workers sided with the indentured servants , and the masters — presented with a fait accompli—signed the Compact in the face of necessity ( p. 21 ) .
We also get , from the second - hand version of Bradford ’s account adopted by American political culture , a patronizing narrative in which those idealistic Puritans at first attempted to “ have all things in common ” ( just like the primitive church in the Book of Acts ! ) , but then abandoned their primitive communism in the face of reality ( and starvation ) by farming their own family plots individually .
What you might not guess from Bradford ’s account is that this edifying tale of misguided idealism was actually the story of a peasants ’ revolt against the manorial authority of the Merchant Adventurers .
What actually happened was that , in the original articles of incorporation , the colonists were permitted to work two days a week on their own family plots , and the other four days would work on the Corporation ’s land as its employees .
The Merchant Adventurers soon changed these terms , fearing that the colonists would devote most of their effort to their own plots and do as little as they could get away with on company land .
Instead , the colonists were to work six days a week for the Merchant Adventurers , and be provisioned by the company .
To the colonists , most of them peasants from the open fields of Nottinghamshire , this amounted to reducing them to serfdom .
Their decision to work the land for themselves was the kind of land reform that would have gotten them slaughtered by CIA - backed death squads , if they ’d done it today .
In other words the story , rather than being a simple morality play that foreshadowed the 20th century revolt against Soviet collectivism , was more a reflection of the peasantry ’s relations with the landed classes in the old country .
The Plymouth colonists were , for all intents and purposes , tearing down an Enclosure — more like the Diggers on St. George ’s Hill than kulaks ( pp. 20 - 21 ) .
There ’s a great deal of interesting information in Curl ’s book , like his account of the vibrant American working class movement from the turn of the 20th century to WWI and its liquidation under A. Mitchell Palmer , or attempts at self - organized alternatives to capitalism ( like the Unemployed Exchange Organization ) during the Great Depression .
The countereconomic networks of consumer cooperatives , alternative newspapers , rural communes , free schools , and the like that arose in the 1960s and 1970s are also fascinating .
But my main focus is on Curl ’s book at it relates to matters of interest to the P2P and Open Manufacturing communities .
The most important generalization I derived from the book is the importance of capital outlay requirements in determining the viability of self - employment and cooperative employment .
The first major wave of worker cooperatives was under the auspices of the National Trades ’ Union in the 1830s ( p.4 ) .
Like the Owenite trade union cooperatives in Britain , they were mostly undertaken in craft employments for which the basic tools of the trade were relatively inexpensive .
From the beginning , worker cooperatives were a frequent resort of striking workers .
In 1768 twenty striking journeyman tailors in New York , the first striking wage - workers in American history , set up their own cooperative shop .
Journeyman carpenters striking for a ten - hour day in Philadelphia , in 1761 , formed a cooperative ( with the ten - hour day they sought ) and undercut their master ’s price by 25 % ; they disbanded the cooperative when they went back to work .
The same was done by shoemakers in Baltimore , 1794 , and Philadelphia , 1806 ( p. 33 ) .
This was a common pattern in early American labor history , and the organization of cooperatives moved from being purely a strike tactic to providing an alternative to wage labor ( p. 34 ) .
It was feasible because most forms of production were done by groups of artisan laborers using hand tools .
By the 1840s , the rise of factory production with expensive machinery had largely put an end to this possibility .
As the prerequisites of production became increasingly unafforable , the majority of the population was relegated to wage labor with machinery owned by someone else ( pp. 35 , 47 ) .
The corporate transformation of the economy was a revolution imposed from above .
A high - volume , centralized railroad network was key to the creation of a national corporate manufacturing economy — and in this the state played an indispensable role .
This included the land grants , which included not only rights of way , but also enormous swaths of land ( amounting to “ a full half of all the Western lands , ” all told ) on either side whose appreciating value was intended to serve as a source of capital .
But it did n’t even stop there .
The railroads also used their political muscle to secure the direct appropriation of capital from the taxpayers .
And on top of that , once in operation they used their rate - setting power to promote the concentration of industry , simultaneously gouging small farmers and urban consumers , while giving volume rebates to large manufacturers ( p. 78 ) .
An alliance of industrial plutocrats and southern landed oligarchs seized political power in the Compromise of 1877 ( otherwise known as the Great Betrayal ) .
In return for ending military reconstruction in the South , and handing power in the region back to the prewar planter class , the corporate oligarchy secured southern backing for its power grab at the national level .
The southern states switched enough electoral votes to the Hayes ticket to overturn a decisive Democratic majority ( pp. 86-87 ) .
The top - down imposition of the factory system , the seizure of national power by Gilded Age plutocrats , and the resistance to it by workers and farmers , amounted for all intents and purposes to a civil war .
The corporatization of the American society provoked an all - out resistance by artisan laborers , factory workers , and small farmers — together called the “ Great Upheaval ” by Curl .
The first and largest wave of the Great Upheaval was associated with the Grange and the Knights of Labor .
The Greenback - Labor Party elected fifteen congressmen in 1878 , and supported legislation at the state level regulating the freight rates charged by the state - created and state - subsidized railroads .
The railroad barons and bankers , fighting a ruthless counter - revolution , refused credit or shipping to Grange enterprises ( p. 79 ) .
They viewed the Knights of Labor and its network of cooperatives as a serious threat to the whole capitalist system ( p. 93 ) .
The Knights won their biggest victory in the Union Pacific Railroad strike of 1885 , forcing Jay Gould to recognize the union and arbitrate all labor disputes .
The ensuing influx of new members swelled Knights of Labor ranks to nearly a million in 1886 ( p. 102 ) .
The two most dramatic confrontations of the Great Upheaval , the railroad strike of 1877 and the eight - hour day movement , were defeated by decisive state action .
The railroad strike , which turned into a nationwide general strike , was broken ( “ to prevent national insurrection ” ) by Hayes ’ troops ( p. 87 ) .
The eight - hour day movement , which rose to a crescendo in nationwide general strike of 1886 , culminated in the post - Haymarket repression .
That reaction , comparable to the Red Scare under Woodrow Wilson , saw the near - total liquidation of the labor movement and full - scale war against the Knights of Labor cooperatives .
Railroads refused to carry cooperatives ’ products , manufacturers refused to sell them machinery , wholesalers refused them raw materials , and banks refused credit .
The local community support on which the Knights depended was undermined by a press campaign against labor radicalism and “ anarchism , ” much like the Red - baiting hysteria under A. Mitchell Palmer thirty years later ( pp. 106-107 ) .
Most attempts at worker - organized manufacturing , during the Great Upheaval , failed on account of the capital outlays required .
For example , when manufacturers refused to sell farm machinery to the Grangers at wholesale prices , the Nebraska Grange undertook its own design and manufacturing of machinery .
( How ’s that for a parallel to modern P2P ideas ? )
Its first attempt , a wheat head reaper , sold at half the price of comparable models and drove down prices on farm machinery in Nebraska .
The National Grange planned a complete line of farm machinery , but most Grange manufacturing enterprises failed to raise the large sums of capital needed ( p. 77 ) .
The Knights of Labor cooperatives were on shaky ground in the best of times .
Many of them were founded during strikes , started with “ little capital and obsolescent machinery , ” and lacked the capital to invest in modern machinery .
Subjected to economic warfare by organized capital , the network of cooperatives disintegrated ( p. 107 ) .
The economy today is experiencing a revolution as profound as the corporate transformation of the late 19th century .
The main difference today is that , for material reasons , the monopolies on which corporate rule depends are becoming unenforceable .
Another revolution , based on P2P and micromanufacturing , is sweeping society on the same scale as did the corporate revolution of 150 years ago .
But the large corporations today are in the same position that the Grange and Knights of Labor were in the Great Upheaval back then , fighting a desperate , futile rearguard action , and doomed to be swept under by the tidal wave of history .
The worker cooperatives organized in the era of artisan labor paralleled , in many ways , the forms of work organization that are arising today .
Networked organization , crowdsourced credit and the implosion of capital outlays required for physical production , taken together , are recreating the same conditions that made artisan cooperatives feasible in the days before the factory system .
In the artisan manufactories that prevailed into the early 19th century , most of the physical capital required for production was owned by the work force ; artisan laborers could walk out and essentially take the firm with them in all but name .
Likewise , today , the collapse of capital outlay requirements for production in the cultural and information fields ( software , desktop publishing , music , etc. ) has created a situation in which human capital is the source of most book value for many firms ; consequently , workers are able to walk out with their human capital and form “ breakaway firms , ” leaving their former employers as little more than hollow shells .
And the rise of cheap garage manufacturing machinery ( a Fab Lab with homebrew CNC tools costing maybe two months ’ wages for a semi- skilled worker ) is , in its essence , a return to the days when low physical capital costs made worker cooperatives a viable alternative to wage labor .
The first Great Upheaval was defeated by the need for capital .
The second one will destroy the old system by making capital superfluous .

England ’s Daily Express reported on August 4 that thousands of the worst families in England are to be put in ‘ sin bins ’ in a bid to change their bad behavior .
Ed Balls , the Children ’s Secretary , has announced a 400 million pound plan to put Closed Circuit Television ( CCTV ) cameras in 20,000 homes in Britain , says the Express , to ensure that children attend school , go to bed on time and eat proper meals . 
This sin bin program already operates in many parts of the country , and about 2,000 families are presently under observation by their betters in the local bureaucracy .
But Balls wants the program to be universal .
 There should be Family Intervention Projects in every local authority because every area has families that need support ,  he says .
1984 is n’t just a novel anymore ; it ’s happening in England right now , complete with a newspeak vocabulary that equates totalitarian measures with support for families . 

The American Revolution has been described as a conservative revolution , because so little changed .
Unlike the French Revolution , which would usher in a reign of terror and a dictatorship , and the Russian Revolution , which followed the same course , the American fight was largely about reaffirming principles that had evolved under the British constitution — due process , habeas corpus , government by consent , limited parliamentary power , private property and , most important , personal privacy and individual rights .
The fighting had barely begun and Americans were establishing new governments in accordance with these same principles .
It was to the ideal of English governance that American statesmen would repair .
Like the West in general , Britain has been riding a wave of progressivism  for the last century , moving away from a limited - government tradition and towards government growing larger and taking over more areas once left to individuals , communities , churches , and other means of mutual aid .
Taking a moral high ground surrendered by conservatives either afraid or ill - equipped to challenge such pretensions — and often aided and abetted by them , as in this present case — leftists there have created a Nanny State that proudly boasts of cradle to grave protection in the form of unemployment insurance , family allowances ,  national health insurance , government housing programs — the list goes on and on — alongside massive taxes on luxuries  like automobiles and gasoline , incredible powers vested in labor unions , draconian gun control , and extortionate income taxation — to the point that government in the UK controls about 40 percent of GNP and touches just about every area of everyone ’s life .
But it is n’t enough .
It ’s never enough .
Those who crave power over others always want more , and when their attempts to remake society fall short of the intended mark , the blame is always laid on some alleged lack of power and legislation .
Poverty justified  the welfare state .
Then , when the economy subsequently floundered , more welfare was needed .
When the welfare state had undermined individual dignity and a general sense of personal responsibility , rising crime ensued , and it was more police powers and surveillance of society that was demanded .
And now , after Britain has reached the point where your DNA can be taken for a moving violation and there are more CCTV cameras in public places than any other country on earth , we hear , once more , that it ’s not enough .
Private places — people ’s homes — will now feel the eyes of growing state power because little Tommy is n’t doing his homework .
The reason we should be concerned about Ed Balls ’ actions across the pond is because they so closely mirror the actions of our own leaders , who seek more power to wage endless wars , take over industries , spy on the citizenry , detain people without trial , run our health care system , interfere in local matters , and use the military against our people .
Strong and ancient principles that limit government power can and have been eroded beyond recognition in a liberal democracy  like Great Britain , and they can be destroyed here too .
Cameras may soon be coming to a home near you .
Maybe even yours .

Contagion effect is spreading as the weakest link in the Eurozone catches fire .
Livestock account for a significant amount of Austalian emissions
Australian scientists have said they are hoping to breed sheep that burp less as part of efforts to tackle climate change .
The scientists have been trying to identify a genetic link that causes some sheep to belch less than others .
Burping is a far greater cause of emissions in sheep than flatulence , they say .
About 16 % of Australia 's greenhouse emissions come from agriculture , says the department of climate change .
Australia 's Sheep Cooperative Research Council says 66 % of agricultural emissions are released as methane from the gut of livestock .
" Ninety per cent of the methane that sheep and cattle and goats produce comes from the rumen , and that 's burped out , " John Goopy from the New South Wales Department of Industry and Investment told ABC .
" Not much goes behind - that 's horses . "
The scientists in New South Wales have been conducting experiments in specially designed pens where they measure how much gas sheep emit by burping .
They have found , from tests on 200 sheep so far , that the more they eat , the more they belch .
But even taking that into account , there appear to be " significant differences " between individual animals , Mr Goopy said .
The scientists ' goal in the long term is to breed sheep that produce less methane , which produces many times more global warming than carbon dioxide .
" We 're looking for natural variations so we 'll steer the population that way , " said Roger Hegarty , from the Sheep Cooperative Research Council .
Seriously , a box of straw .
I 'm not sure if this is the best or worst marketing idea I 've seen so far , but considering my carpet now has dirt and grit all over it after opening this package unawares , I 'm learning toward the latter opinion .
Nevertheless , I have to praise the sheer effort that went into this .
Dragon Age : Origins was found buried in the straw , in an envelope that had a wax seal on it .
There was a similarly sealed letter as well , telling me I was a Grey Warden .
I feel ten times nerdier than usual .
Also included was some sort of energy drink made to look like a vial of so - called Dragon 's Blood .
Oh , and lots of straw .
Lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of straw .
This is so ludicrous .

Southern Illinois University researchers determined Medicare beneficiaries living in rural areas were 27 % more likely than urban recipients to have total knee or hip replacement surgeries .
Researchers found women were more likely than men to undergo total joint replacement surgeries .
Differences in elective joint surgeries between white individuals and minorities in both rural and urban areas were observed , but were less pronounced in rural settings .
Full findings appear in the in the December issue of Arthritis & Rheumatism , a journal published by Wiley - Blackwell on behalf of the American College of Rheumatology .
Arthritis is the leading cause of disability in the U.S. , and musculoskeletal problems consume roughly 2.5 % of U.S. gross domestic product .
The National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases ( NIAMS ) reported that 773,000 Americans have a hip or knee replaced each year .
Generally , new joints last 10 to 15 years and younger patients may need to have repeated surgeries to replace damaged joints .
The research team , led by Mark L. Francis , M.D. , used the 2005 Medicare Provider Analysis and Review File from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services along with the entire 2005 Medicare denominator file to establish the study group .
This cohort was comprised of close to 6 million rural Medicare beneficiaries and nearly 38 million urban recipients .
Both men and women were represented in the study , with a mean age of 70 for rural and 71 for urban participants .
Racial representation in the rural versus urban areas included white ( 90.8 % vs. 83.2 % ) , African American ( 6.4 % vs. 10.5 % ) , Hispanic ( 0.6 % vs. 2.3 % ) , Asian ( 0.2 % vs. 1.9 % ) , Native American ( 1.3 % vs. 0.3 % ) , and other ( 0.5 % vs. 1.7 % ) .
Of the number of participants in the study , 1.02 % of rural and 0.80 % of urban beneficiaries underwent a total knee or hip replacement surgery in 2005 .
Results showed 27 % more rural beneficiaries were likely to have total knee or hip replacement surgeries than Medicare recipients in urban areas .
" We were surprised by the finding that more rural participants elected to undergo joint surgery than those in urban areas , " said Dr. Francis .
" There was reason to believe that differences in physician access , cultural backgrounds , and the need to travel farther for surgery would deter more rural patients from elective surgical procedures . "
In addition to confirming earlier findings with African Americans and Hispanics , this study also finds similar disparities for Asians and Native Americans .
Although there were some differences among minority groups compared to Caucasians , these disparities were overall less in rural areas .
The current study concurred with prior study results finding that women were more likely to have total joint replacement surgeries compared with men .
However , given the higher prevalence of arthritis in women it is likely that men with arthritis had total joint replacement surgeries relatively more frequently than women noted the authors .
According to a 2006 report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the prevalence of arthritis in women was 25.4 % compared with 17.6 % in men .
" While our study explored differences between rural and urban areas , joint replacement surgeries in suburban populations is an important area for future research , " concluded Dr. Francis .
The authors also emphasized that results from this study are based on an industrialized country with an advanced transportation infrastructure and should not be generalized to less industrialized countries .

Support for the US mission in Afghanistan has slipped to a new low , with 44 percent of Americans now saying the war there has been worth the cost , according to a recently released poll .
Amid mounting divisiveness over what was once one of President Barack Obama ’s top foreign policy issues , the poll by The Washington Post and ABC News also showed ratings for how he has handled the mission there eroding , to 45 percent approving of how he is dealing with Afghanistan and 47 disapproving , compared to 63 percent approval last year .
ADVERTISEMENT
The numbers come as Obama grapples with whether to send more US troops to Afghanistan to boost the fight against a growing Taliban - led insurgency , just a week after a stopover at a US military base in Alaska at the start of his Asia trip when he told US troops he will get “ public support back home ” for the mission .
Only 44 percent now say the war in Afghanistan has been worth fighting — the fewest since early 2007 — and 52 percent say it has not , up 13 points from its low of last December , the news outlets ’ polling divisions said .
And while 55 percent expressed confidence that Obama will forge a successful Afghan strategy , Americans appeared evenly split on whether the president should order large numbers of new troops into the country , with 46 percent supporting a larger US force and 45 percent a smaller one .
Just as many also appeared to trust Republicans in Congress to handle the war as trust the president .
While divisions were evident about the war , Americans clearly doubted the reliability of the government of Afghan President Hamid Karzai , who was declared winner of a second term this month after a fraud - marred election .

“ Just 26 percent of Americans see Karzai as a reliable partner for the United States , and just 38 percent think his government will be able to train an effective army to take over security at some point , ” ABC News reported .
As for whether the risk of a terrorist attack in the United States would rise or fall if US troops withdraw from Afghanistan , nearly two - thirds of Americans said the risk stayed the same whether or not the troops went home .
The poll of 1,001 residents was conducted by telephone and has a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points .
In recent years , Iran has had the highest rate of executions of any nation except China .
That reputation was solidified under President Ahmadinejad , who has presided over a quadrupling in executions , to 346 in 2008 from 86 in 2005 , the year he took office , according to Amnesty International .
Iran does not release statistics on executions , so it is impossible to compare monthly or annual rates .
But in recent days , there has been a flood of reports from around the country of executions , most involving convicted drug dealers or criminals .
On Friday , news reports said that over the previous 10 days , 16 people had been executed in cities including Kerman , Isfahan and Ahwaz .
In mid-October , Behnood Shojaee , who was on death row for committing a murder four years ago at the age of 17 , was executed despite international calls for his sentence to be commuted because he was a minor at the time of the crime .
Drewery Dyke , a researcher with Amnesty International , said that it was not unusual for Iranian officials to step up executions in the wake of a political crisis .
In 1988 , after Iran agreed to a cease - fire with Iraq , the government executed thousands of political prisoners not initially charged with capital crimes and already serving sentences in prison .
“ There does seem to be a greater willingness across the spectrum for the authorities to deploy force in every way , from the police through to the administration of justice , ” he said .
“ There seems to be that much higher level of ruthlessness . ”
According to Amnesty International , there were 196 executions in Iran in the first half of 2009 .
Between the June 12 election and the president ’s inauguration on Aug. 5 , executions surged to an average of two a day , the group said .
So far this year , there have been 359 executions , though an exact tally is hard to come by because the group compiles the data based on reports from government - affiliated news sources .
Since the postelection surge in executions , the government has moved aggressively to impose the death penalty on people linked to separatist insurgent groups , even when they have not been convicted of violent activities themselves , human rights groups said .
Sun Topics Ask Mr. Sun
The headline on the gun shop poster might say so , but the fine print is more complicated .
So before you dash out and fill the hills with lead , there are a few things to be aware of .
First , shooting is prohibited in the Las Vegas Valley .
( After you finish laughing , please read on . )
Beyond the valley ’s borders , federal caregivers have some general restrictions :
• No shooting within 1,000 feet of homes and roads , or over any roadway ;
• Glass targets are prohibited ;
• Always use a safe backdrop and carry out litter , including shell casings .
Each federal agency has more specific restrictions .
In areas controlled by the Bureau of Land Management , shooting is allowed except at Apex , the Nellis Dunes , Red Rock Canyon National Conservation Area , Sloan Canyon National Conservation Area and Sunrise Mountain .
On land controlled by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service — most notably the 1.6 million - acre Desert National Wildlife Refuge north of Las Vegas — shooting is prohibited unless you ’re hunting with the appropriate paperwork .
The Forest Service allows shooting on the 316,000 acres it controls in the Spring Mountains National Recreation Area , provided gunslingers abide by local and state laws .
( A favorite spot is near the Lovell Group Campsite on Lovell Canyon Road , off State Route 160 , officials said . )
Judy Suing , a spokeswoman for the Forest Service , said the agency does ask people using firearms to avoid heavily vegetated areas because of the potential for fires .

The American Civil Liberties Union has sued a north Florida school district , claiming that the Alachua County School District violated students ' rights by not allowing them to wear T - shirts with an anti-Islamic message .
The civil rights organization says that while it does n't agree with the " Islam is of the Devil " message printed on T - shirts distributed by the Dove World Outreach Center , it does support the students ' constitutional right to freedom of speech .
A school dress code prohibits clothing that school officials conclude would " disrupt the learning process " or cause other students to be " offended or distracted . "
The students were sent home for violation of the code after declining to change out of the shirts .
The church was the target of protests after it posted a sign with the same message on its property in July .
In a letter to the ACLU the school board 's law firm said that " a school may regulate a student 's free speech rights if the exercise of those rights materially and substantially interferes with maintaining appropriate discipline at school , or if the conduct impinges on the rights of other students . "

In response to How Being The Slightest Bit Overqualified Can Cost You A Job I received several interesting Emails .
Here is an Email from " PhD In Distress " about overqualified candidates fresh out of college with nowhere to go , competing for jobs that essentially do not exist .
" PhD In Distress " writes :
Dear Mish ,
I very much enjoyed your article today “ How Being The Slightest Bit Overqualified Can Cost You A Job ” .
Although it seemed you and those giving comments seemed to focus on the overqualification of experienced workers , I would like to bring the plight of overqualified students ( particularly PhD students ) to your attention .
I say this as a PhD science student myself .
In case you are not familiar , the “ typical ” PhD undergoes the following path : BS ( usually adding significant debt ) then PhD ( most programs I know of skip masters level and pay about $ 20000 / year and take 5 - 7 years ) then postdoctoral experience ( essentially you do the same work as your PhD for an additional 2 - 3 years in a different lab except you only make $ 35000 / year ) then you can attempt to get a job in either academia , industry or government .
I should also mention that student loans can be put on hold while in a PhD program but not during a postdoc .
The postdoctoral experience has not been traditionally necessary for my field to get a job in industry and I am attempting to do so sans postdoc as I have no academic inclinations .
The problem that I see is that when I look for a job using keywords in my field is that I get one of two postings :
1 ) BS required , MS preferred ( making up about 60 % of postings )
2 ) PhD with 5 + years experience ( making up 20 % of postings and sometimes academic experience such as postdoc wo n’t even count )
This means that I am overqualified for over half the positions that are posted .
Even worse , most of the positions for my level require experiences that I cannot even obtain after my PhD .
My plight is no company in this economy will spend money on an entry level , unproven PhD that will need 2 + years training before he / she is adding significant value to the company .
That leaves me and many others with the only option being a postdoc .
However , there has been a glut of postdocs building since the 90s .
More and more students are chasing fewer and fewer academic positions ( which require a postdoc ) .
Many of them simply give up and start looking for industrial positions .
This has not gone unnoticed by industry and has resulted in more and more companies requiring experience for what should be entry level positions .
The great recession has only exacerbated the problem and now I know of people on their third or fourth postdoc ( mostly looking for academic experience but still well into their 30s and making $ 35000 with a PhD ) .
This makes it even harder for recent grads just to get their first postdoc .
Again , why would a professor hire a new grad when he / she can get someone with 3 + years experience and pay them the same ?
So here I am highly educated with no place for a job .
I ’m overqualified and overspecialized for 60 % of the work yet simultaneously underqualified for the other 40 % .
Moreover , there seems to be no way to rectify the situation .
Therefore , it should come as no surprise that more and more domestic ( US ) students have begun to realize what a raw deal a science PhD has become .
This is reflected in lower numbers of domestic PhD students over the past couple decades .
Though this is particularly bad for the US in the long run as foreign science PhD ’s increasingly return home to work in available and relatively well paying jobs .
I feel particularly bad for the spike of new students entering a PhD program now to avoid the recession .
If we will have structurally high unemployment for a decade ( for which you have made a compelling case ) then we will have 2 more “ generations ” of PhDs in an increasingly bleak situation .
Even if the economy improves it would take massive growth just to get through the backlog of experienced postdocs and laid off scientists seeking positions .
In either case , my approaching graduation has made me more aware and thoughtful of my situation and thought your article was timely and informative .
Keep up the great work spreading the word about real recovery through sound money and policy !
Just in case you would like to share this , please do not use my name or initials .
Science is a very small and intellectually inbred community and not very open to criticism .
Thank you again ,

Al - Zaman reports in Arabic that the Iraqi parliament approved the electoral law to govern the elections scheduled for early next year .
The vote was 141 in favor out of what Al - Zaman said were 175 attending ( the Iraqi parliament has 275 seats , so a simple majority is 138 ) .
AFP estimated attending MPs at 195 .
President Barack Obama hailed the vote as “ an important milestone as the Iraqi people continue to take responsibility for their future . ”
In other words , it means to the Obama administration that the time when they can get out of Iraq is nearer .
US ambassador Christopher Hill is said to have played a key mediating role in pushing the law through after it was voted on and failed to pass numerous times .
Update : Steve Clemons reports that Vice President Joe Biden played a cental role in the negotiations .
Clemons stresses his calls with Kurdistan president Massoud Barzani .
But since the legislation was a big win for the Kurds , the hard talk must have been with Arab leaders such as PM Nuri al - Maliki , who gave up a lot on Kirkuk .
The Kurdistan Alliance scored a major victory insofar as the law agrees to use the 2009 voting rolls for the polls in Kirkuk Province .
The Kurdistan Regional Government began as a provincial confederacy incorporating 3 of Iraq ’s 18 provinces , but over time the original provincial administrations and borders were erased , leaving the KRG as a super - province in its own right .
Kurdistan wishes to incorporate into itself a fourth province , oil - rich Kirkuk , which has a mixed population of Kurds , Turkmen and Arabs .
Turkmen and Arabs on the whole do not wish to become part of Kurdistan .
There has been enormous Kurdish immigration into Kirkuk in recent years .
Kurds say these immigrants had been in Kirkuk but were expelled by Saddam , who brought up Arabs to Arabize the province .
But there were lots of Arabs in Kirkuk before Arabization , and probably a significant proportion of new Kurdish immigrants were not traditionally residents there .
Arabs and Turkmen also charge that the current voting rolls are full of fraudulent names , as Kurds have attempted to pack the registration list .
The Arab and Turkmen members of parliament had wanted the 2004 electoral rolls used , to offset the likelihood of a Kurdish landslide in Kirkuk province that might set the stage for its full incorporation into the Kurdistan Regional Government .
The compromise is that the Kirkuk electoral rolls will be subject to special scrutiny .
If at least 5 % of voter registration in a district is found fraudulent , then any 55 parliamentarians may call for a recount .
Al - Zaman says that during the moments when the vote was taken and the results announced , the chamber was in chaos .
Some members of parliament doubted that the measure actually received 141 votes .
The Kurdistan Alliance MPs went wild with joy at the passage of the law in this form .
Some members of parliament objected to a provision whereby displaced Iraqi outside their own original places of residence are not allowed to vote .
Given the ethnic cleansing of so many Sunni Arabs of Baghdad and environs this provision probably hurts the Sunni Arab parties .
Critics of the measure said it was unconstitutional , since the Iraqi constitution does not tie voting rights for citizens to place of residence .
The election had been scheduled for January 16 , but it is now set for January 23 .
Ambassador
Hill is reportedly pushing hard for that date as final .
Nevertheless , al - Zaman reports that the Iraqi High Commission says that this law was enacted too late to hold the election on time .
He is requesting a 3 - month delay , to April 16 .
This delay would affect Americans , since the US military is being kept in Iraq at this point primarily so that it can lock down the country for 3 days to allow voters to go to the polls without being blown up .
Delaying the date of the election might delay the timeline for taking troops out of the country .
This delay is no doubt what spurred Ambassador Hill to insist that January 23 is the firm date .
Constitutionally , moreover , the election must take place in January .
The law calls for a system wherein voters vote for candidates by name , though these are part of an electoral list or party .
This system should not be confused with the US and British open voting , wherein one can vote for candidates regardless of their party or even vote for independents .
In Iraq , the party lists still put up the candidates .
Iraqis contrast this “ Modified List ” system to the closed list system that had been used for previous elections , where voters only have the option of choosing an electoral list or party when they vote , but had no control over which candidates the victorious party would seat in parliament .
Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani , the spiritual leader of Iraqi Shiites , had campaigned hard for a modified list system , appearing to believe that the closed list encourages sectarianism , and that it is undemocratic insofar as it detracted from popular sovereignty ( the people should have a say in particular politicians elected and not just which party gets to choose them ) .
Al - Sharq al - Awsat reports that the number of seats in parliament will be expanded from 275 to 310 by this law .
The passage of the electoral law now allows Iraq to proceed on something like the timeline envisaged for it in the Status of Forces Agreement .
If the election is held on January 23 , there will probably be months of wrangling over who will be the new prime minister .
But that indecision should not be a bar to withdrawing US troops , who are continuing to come out of Iraq ahead of schedule .

New polymer - based material can change from clear to multi-coloured right through to opaque black at the flick of a switch
A new polymer - based material can change from clear to multi-coloured right through to opaque black at the flick of a switch .
The electrochromic material could find some interesting applications , such as multi-coloured information displays , electronic books and colour changing mirrors .
Electrochromic compounds are those which can change colour in response to electrical signals , but they have previously come with a high price tag and slim range of available colours .
Now , John Reynolds and his team at the University of Florida , US , have developed a cheap polymer - based solution to generate a spectrum of purples and greens , going all the way up to black .
This was achieved by spraying two thin layers of polymer on glass slides , then placing them on top of each other .
Each layer is made from a different electrochromic polymer , based on the structure of poly ( 3,4propylenedioxythiophene ) .
In their neutral state one is dark green and the other is dark purple , making a black colour when overlaid .
Electrical charge can be passed through the device to reversibly oxidise and reduce the polymers - instantly switching between transparent and opaque .
By varying the charge used , a range of shades from lime green to dark blue can be obtained .
The team then integrated a third polymer that switches between opaque white and clear into the device .
This allowsthe device to flick between black and white - something that is important for the design of thin and flexible optical displays - such as electronic paper that can display information without the need for a backlight .
In the future , the team hope to extend this work to include other colour palettes , as well as miniaturising the device into smaller panels .
Devices could also be integrated with light sensors to make ’ smart glass ’ that responds to flashes or is programmed to lighten or darken at set times .
’ This is a useful breakthrough , ’ says Roger Mortimer , an expert in electrochromic materials at the Loughborough University , UK .
’ Using polymers instead of metal oxides has many advantages - they are flexible but also spray - processable , which makes devices relatively cheap . ’

Thirty
Thai men who were “ tricked into a life of forced labor ” after being promised lucrative jobs in the United States are just one symptom of the problem of modern - day slavery , CNN reported Monday .
According to the State Department , there are as many as 200,000 forced laborers in the US , with some 17,500 arriving every year .
“ This is a hidden crime , ” Louis C. de Baca , the State Department ’s ambassador for human trafficking , told CNN .
“ The very nature of this crime masks it from us . ”

CNN reported on the case of 30 Thai men , who were promised jobs picking tobacco on North Carolina by a company called Million Express Manpower .
The company required the men to pay the equivalent of $ 11,000 for the necessary visa and transportation .
But when they arrived in the US , they discovered there were no jobs waiting , and their passports were seized .
The men “ realized they were trapped , ” reports CNN ’s Sean Callebs .
The men say they were taken to New Orleans , where they were forced to gut a condemned hotel without pay , while living on the premises .
They say they had to cook pigeons for food .
“ Some of the men were so stressed out they seemed suicidal , ” one of the men told CNN .
The men eventually won a lawsuit against the company , which did not respond to the allegations against it .
ADVERTISEMENT
The case of the 30 Thai men is somewhat unusual , as human trafficking often focuses on women and children .
The Guardian recently reported on the problem of women and teenage girls being trafficked to the United States for sex and servitude :
In one recent incident a 16 - year - old Mexican girl was found to have been trafficked across the US border .
Doctors noticed the heavily pregnant girl showed clear signs of physical abuse when she was brought into a hospital in Dayton to give birth .
The police were called but the couple who had brought her had already fled .
When the girl ’s story emerged , it became clear she had been kept against her will in the nearby city of Springfield and used for labour and sex .
“ I thought slavery ended a few centuries ago .
But here it is alive and well , ” said Springfield ’s sheriff , Gene Kelly .
US Immigration and Customs Enforcement recently launched a 14 - city pilot project , “ Hidden in Plain Sight , ” to combat human trafficking .
The project involves setting up billboards across the city with an 800 number that victims of human trafficking can call to get help .

Look , I know the whole “ Friday catblogging ” thing has been done to death , but I hope you ’ll forgive me for , just this once , combining two of my favorite addictions : the Life magazine photo archive and adorable cat pictures .
Not only does this post contain your recommended daily allowance of 1940s cat pictures – ten of them !
– but it ’s even fortified with a useless bit of wartime trivia !
So , yes , you might learn something while you ’re pondering what captions to add to these monochrome lolcats - to - be …
There are ten fairly large pictures here , so have patience ; they might take a second or two to load .
Ah , the bliss ; this and the next photo are of a kitten in a pail of milk , according to the original captions .
This image , above , is from 1941 , and shows – according to the original caption – “ the proper way to safely pick up an excited cat in the event of first aid being required due to an air raid ” .

Advertisement Families with more than 10 children are becoming the norm among a group of traditionalist US Christians .
The so - called Quiverfull families believe they are carrying out God 's work , and providing a new generation of moral leaders .
The BBC 's religious affairs correspondent Robert Pigott went to Illinois to meet some of them .
The way Psalm 127 talks about children has an almost military sound .
It describes them as " an inheritance , and arrows in the hands of a mighty warrior , " adding , " happy is he whose quiver is full of them " .
Many Quiverfull families do indeed sense looming battles for Christians , and often see their children as potential future leaders in fighting them .
Rev James McDonald has 10 children , aged between four and 26 - an extraordinary fertility motivated by obedience to the Bible .
" We believe that they are blessings to be raised up in the worship of the Lord and they will be used by him in whatever way God will call them , to fulfil the Great Commission which we find in Matthew Chapter 28 , " he said .
The " Great Commission " - the duty to spread the Christian message throughout the world - is among a number of challenges Mr McDonald sees facing his family .
Among others , he cites divorce , adultery , abortion and internet pornography .
" The societal ills that we have , the challenges we have ... we have rampant disease and bankrupt health systems because we do n't know the truth of the Bible .
But as these truths are lived out in the lives of God 's people , society changes , " he said .
Declining congregations
The McDonalds are being joined in the battle by a growing number of very large traditionalist Christian families equally committed to promoting Biblical values .
When the Sanfords came to lunch , it was to celebrate the departure overseas of Garrison , one of their 13 offspring , to serve with the US marines .
James and Stacy McDonald , with members of their large family
They say his Christian example has already led his comrades to behave better .
When Garrison and the rest of his family drew up in a 15 - seat minibus to be greeted by the McDonalds , a crowd was instantly created on the gravel outside the McDonalds ' house .
The Sanfords - who have no television at home , and who all join in the household chores - give an impression of moderation and discipline .
The siblings address their father as " sir " , and their esprit de corps is enhanced by wearing similar clothes .
Quiverfull families tend to believe in male headship - the principle , also derived from the Bible , that men should lead households .
Feminists are perhaps the fiercest critics of the budding Quiverfull movement .
They accuse it of trying to undo the equality and freedom won for women over decades of struggle , and claim that the idea of automatic male leadership is anachronistic .
But Robert Sanford sees his approach to family life both as authentically Christian , and as the best training for children to take on what he sees as the moral decay afflicting American society .
" I think we should as Christians lead in that way , and we can teach that character and teach those morals , " he said .
" To me the Bible is the best way of doing it .
In my estimation , the Bible is the only way of doing it . "
At Providence Church in Morton , Illinois , the Sanfords occupy two full pews , uniformly dressed in black shirts and beige trousers or skirts .
There are several very large families here , their 15 - seat mini-vans scattered across the car park .
James McDonald , the pastor here , uses the service to baptise a boy , immersing him bodily in a bath - type pool set up on the raised floor at the front of the church .
The boy 's parents watch and wrap a towel around him as he emerges .
Quiverfull families often attend their own , independent churches Pastor McDonald looks out on a sea of children , mostly conservatively dressed , many of the girls with their hair covered .
But , given what he sees in other churches , he is not complacent about their numbers .
" In denomination after denomination their children are leaving in mass exodus , and this is a major major problem especially when most families only have two or three children , " he said .
" Who 's going to fill those pews in the next generation ? "
There is a wider concern too that going beyond the United States to traditionally Christian regions such as Europe , Christianity seems to be dying out .
' Race suicide '
Simply filling the world with white Christians is not what motivated either the Sanfords or the McDonalds - for them having large families was a matter of faith .
The Sanfords have adopted children from around the world .
But many of the traditionalist Christians who make up the Quiverfull movement are perplexed by the low birth rate of their co-religionists .
There is no overt talk about the need to boost white populations but , according to authors who have studied the movement , there is an underlying worry about " race suicide " .
Allan Carlson favours larger families of any background , even though he says he is , as he puts it , a " radical secularist " .
Dr Carlson heads the Howard Center for Family , Religion and Society in Rockford , Illinois , a research group arguing that a shortage of children threatens the world economy .
He says many Quiverfull families want to undermine what they regard as a " contraceptive mentality " in the West .
" The historic Christian view , Protestant and Catholic , prior to 1930 , was that both contraception and abortion were incompatible with Christian faith , " he said .
There is a sense in which these intentionally created large families are seeing themselves as the foundation of a counter - culture , which could grow , and should grow
Allan Carlson
Howard Center for Family , Religion and Society " We 're starting to see some sense among conservative Protestants in America that that was the correct view , and I think that plays into the movement for larger families . "
Many of those families are linked into the wider population of traditionalist Christians by the home - schooling movement , by which it is estimated that more than two million American children are taught at home .
They share concerns particularly about " life " issues - such as abortion and stem - cell research , but about promoting other traditionalist Christian values too , in areas such as marriage .
Mr Carlson - who advocates a reversal of the industrial revolution and a return to home - based businesses centred on the family - says there is a strategic motivation behind the Quiverfull movement .
" There is a sense in which these intentionally created large families are seeing themselves as the foundation of a counter - culture , which could grow , and should grow , " he said .
This counter - culture is still small , in the thousands or tens of thousands perhaps , but it does seem to be emerging as a determined force .
Quiverfull families insist that the government cannot fix America 's problems , but that their children could .

Interesting research : “ Countering Kernel Rootkits with Lightweight Hook Protection , ” by Zhi Wang , Xuxian Jiang , Weidong Cui , and Peng Ning .
Abstract : Kernel rootkits have posed serious security threats due to their stealthy manner .
To hide their presence and activities , many rootkits hijack control flows by modifying control data or hooks in the kernel space .
A critical step towards eliminating rootkits is to protect such hooks from being hijacked .
However , it remains a challenge because there exist a large number of widely - scattered kernel hooks and many of them could be dynamically allocated from kernel heap and co-located together with other kernel data .
In addition , there is a lack of flexible commodity hardware support , leading to the socalled protection granularity gap ­ kernel hook protection requires byte - level granularity but commodity hardware only provides pagelevel protection .
To address the above challenges , in this paper , we present HookSafe , a hypervisor - based lightweight system that can protect thousands of kernel hooks in a guest OS from being hijacked .
One key observation behind our approach is that a kernel hook , once initialized , may be frequently “ read ” - accessed , but rarely “ write ” - accessed .
As such , we can relocate those kernel hooks to a dedicated page - aligned memory space and then regulate accesses to them with hardware - based page - level protection .
We have developed a prototype of HookSafe and used it to protect more than 5 , 900 kernel hooks in a Linux guest .
Our experiments with nine real - world rootkits show that HookSafe can effectively defeat their attempts to hijack kernel hooks .
We also show that HookSafe achieves such a large - scale protection with a small overhead ( e.g. , around 6 % slowdown in performance benchmarks ) .

Those frustrated with the pace of developments in the commercial space industry , like SpaceX ’s Falcon 9 ( above ) , can learn a lesson from another transportation industry two centuries ago .
( credit : SpaceX ) From Fulton to Falcon
There ’s a lot of frustration in the air .
For decades , NASA has been fumbling round going nowhere at the taxpayers ’ expense .
Private enterprise is taking its sweet time to fill the vacuum while dealing with technical problems , financial issues and on and on .
Will we ever be able to buy a ticket to ride ?
But let ’s think about it for a moment .
Is n’t this how it ’s always been with great innovations ?
Giving birth to them is a painful process ; it ’s a game of chutes and ladders , not a linear path to certain success .
Giving birth to innovations is a painful process ; it ’s a game of chutes and ladders , not a linear path to certain success .
History is n’t destiny , but it can be a good teacher helping us to put things into perspective .
Perhaps if we travel back to the late 18th century we may find another story of amateurs who , notwithstanding their lack of knowledge of a key technology , set out to create a new industry through research , trial and error , some serendipitous meetings , as well dealing with geopolitics and the need to find a way round another country ’s export prohibitions .
More than two hundred years later , the nascent private enterprise space industry is working through a similar process — keep this in mind as you read on and think about the parallels .
The need for a reusable craft
In the 18th century , America faced a huge transportation problem : how to sail a boat downriver to the port of New Orleans and make the return trip against the current .
It was impossible .
Once the cargo had been delivered , the only sensible course was to break up the vessel since it was of no further use .
A solution was needed — a boat that could navigate under its own power against the river flow and be used repeatedly .
The problem back then was :
What on - board power source could be used ?
At that time there was only one answer — steam !
And only one problem : England had banned the export to America of any technology or skill .
The challenge was to reinvent the steam engine and design a compact version that could fit in a small boat and deliver enough power to drive it upstream .
The pioneer , John Fitch , became fascinated by the potential of such a device despite only having seen a drawing of a massive Newcomen beam engine in an encyclopedia .
He immediately set out to research the steam engine .
By chance his drinking partner , a German clockmaker , was also eager to build an engine ( serendipitous meeting # 1 ) .
The pair joined forces and within two years they had : constructed a working model of an engine incorporating new technological advancements over the Newcomen / Watt engines ; then built a full - scale engine ; and experimented with various mechanical paddle configurations to drive the boat .
Fitch worked hard to raise funds for the project during a recession ( state legislators declined to invest ) .
He negotiated operating monopoly licenses from Delaware , New York , and Pennsylvania , and , in 1787 , demonstrated the first working steamboat to the delegates at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia .
Here was a vision - driven innovator at work .
He went on to open the world ’s first steamboat ferry service on the Delaware , but traffic was never sufficient to make a profit ( a service on the Hudson would have been a better choice ) .
Fitch set out to build a better , faster boat but it was wrecked on its moorings in a storm .
Depressed , he took his own life having failed to expand beyond the Delaware and realize his dream of conquering the Mississippi .
Yet he died believing that it would happen one day .
Robert Fulton , the most famous of the steamboat pioneers , picked up the challenge of making Fitch ’s dream a reality .
In early 1802 , while seeking his fortune in France , he was introduced to the well - connected American , Robert Livingston , who had acquired the license for ferry services on the Hudson , previously granted to Fitch ( serendipitous meeting # 2 ) .
Their conversation turned to ideas for building a steamboat together .
Livingston had tinkered with ideas for such a boat but was no mechanic while Fulton , who started out as a painter , had moved on to engineering design .
However , he was not about to reinvent the steam engine .
Instead he asked Livingston ( who had been a diplomat ) to find a way to obtain an engine from England .
In the interim he undertook a great deal of research on the design of a steamboat and chose side - mounted paddlewheels as the most efficient way to drive the vessel .
Often , the innovator ’s first step is to make a statement such as : “ There must be a better way . ”
In August , 1803 , after experimenting with a model boat , Fulton ’s first full - scale craft , using a French steam engine , was demonstrated on the Seine .
This was less than 18 months after the first discussion with Livingston .
Despite this triumph , Livingston and Fulton became diverted in other ventures and did not press ahead with the steamboat idea until an engine was finally finagled out of England and shipped to New York where Fulton took possession of it at the end of 1806 .
Having secured an extension to the Hudson license , and with the Mississippi opened up as a result of the Louisiana Purchase ( geopolitics at a fire - sale price ) , the future looked bright .
Fulton ’s first American boat was built at a shipyard on the East River in 1807 .
After a trial run , it was ready for the inaugural trip up the Hudson from New York to Albany .
This voyage took 32 hours , including an overnight stop , which compared very favourably with a sailboat that could take from 3 to 9 days to cover the distance .
From then on , Fulton continuously improved his engines and the design and fitting of his boats to create the first steamboat empire .
From the eastern rivers , he expanded out to the Ohio and the Mississippi .
The first boat from Pittsburgh down to New Orleans arrived in January 1812 .
This was 25 years after Fitch ’s initial demonstration in Philadelphia and the American west was now opened for travel and trade .
It ’s a messy business
What do these stories tell us about the chaotic business of innovation ?
The question .
Often , the innovator ’s first step is to make a statement such as : “ There must be a better way . ”
From there the next step is to frame the crucial question , in this case :
Can a steam engine be used to power a boat against the river current ?
However , the answer rarely leaps fully formed from the mind of the innovator .
Fitch was unschooled in steam technology and had to reinvent ( and miniaturize ) it in America .
Fulton had produced many engineering designs for canals but needed to undertake extensive research before building his first boat in France .
Visionaries who ask the right question do n’t let their lack of knowledge prevent them from seeking the ( sometimes revolutionary ) answer .
Bigelow , Carmack , Bezos , and Musk had no relevant prior experience but they are all achieving great things in NewSpace .
Their starting point was to say : “ There must be a better , cheaper , faster way to get into space than leaving it up to NASA . ” Experiment .
Experimentation was necessary , both in engine design and paddle or wheel configurations , and there was an urge to keep iterating the design to achieve constant improvement , not only in steam technology but in enhancing the onboard facilities to improve the passenger experience .
The SpaceX Falcon , Armadillo ’s lunar lander , and Bigelow ’s Genesis modules have been produced through design iterations .
Virgin Galactic ’s efforts are directed toward creating a compelling experience for its customers .
The research and experimentation parts of the process take as long as they take .
Adopt and adapt .
Innovation does n’t have to start with a blank page , as Fitch did , it can come from adopting what others have already developed — the Fulton approach .
What matters is what the innovator does with it .
Fulton was focused on building a business , not creating a new technology .
There ’s nothing wrong with that — the secret is to implement an idea far more effectively and consistently than anyone else .
Today , many commentators seem frustrated because , in their view , the NewSpace pioneers are working with well - known , even old , technology rather than breaking new ground .
But choosing paddlewheels to drive a boat was simply a repurposing of the waterwheels that had long been used to power mills and in no way diminishes the great innovation of the steamboat .
None of us can know what ’s around the corner and the breakthrough improvements that will emerge ( see Oliver Evans below ) .
Meanwhile like Fulton , Richard Branson has tapped into Scaled ’s success with WK / SS1 rather than build his own ship from scratch .
Such amateurs attempting to work magic are always an affront to the cognoscenti who know what is and is n’t possible .
Ignore the experts .
Bringing an innovation to the world will often incur the disdain or outright hostility of the experts .
There were many who denounced the steamboat as a ridiculous proposition that was doomed to failure .
Another pioneer , Oliver Evans , who invented the high - pressure steam engine , was up against a view that anyone who attempted such a hazardous feat was criminally insane .
Nonetheless he persevered , rightly convinced that all existing low - pressure engines were grossly inefficient .
Innovation is often about making the impossible a reality .
Fitch was something of a drifter who had tried his hand at many occupations .
Fulton was a struggling artist who turned his mind to picturing the possibilities of a fortune from steam navigation .
Such amateurs attempting to work magic are always an affront to the cognoscenti who know what is and is n’t possible .
Today , Congress and some “ experts ” are not wholly convinced that private enterprise has the ability to deliver the goods ( or the astronauts ) any time soon , suggesting that it would be reckless to rely on such high - risk , “ unprofessional ” players .
History says otherwise .
Funding .
The early steamboat ventures had to chase money wherever they could .
Many potential investors sat on their cash , perhaps heeding the “ expert ” naysayers in believing that the steamboat was a dubious proposition .
State legislatures would not part with a penny although they did grant monopoly licenses .
In today ’s economic climate it is n’t easy to raise funds from venture capitalists , many of whom veer towards a short - term view .
Government may provide funds through NASA ’s programs and contests .
We should also note that it has taken several decades for the entrepreneurs behind SpaceX , Blue Origin , Bigelow , and Armadillo to create the wealth that has enabled them to invest in space .
Give them time and be grateful for their dreams .
Regulation .
Any new technology may be inherently dangerous until it develops to maturity .
Explosions happened frequently in early steam engines causing many deaths .
Eventually , and after much deliberation over whether the government had the power to legislate on consumer protection , Congress enacted two groundbreaking pieces of legislation in1838 and 1852 intending to reduce the risks to the travelling public .
Boiler specifications were established along with regular inspections by skilled engineers .
Yet this did not prevent the catastrophic explosion aboard the steamer Sultana at Memphis in 1865 that claimed around 1,800 lives and has become known as the “ Titanic of the Mississippi ” .
NewSpace has benefited from a light - touch regulatory environment , but there has to be recognition that accidents will happen and regulation will inevitably get tougher .
We can only hope that despite the obvious benefits of such regulation , they wo n’t be taken too far too early and strangle an emerging industry .
Markets .
Finally , there ’s the tricky question of markets .
Drawing analogies from the steamboat stories , Fitch had to stay close to his investors and never expanded beyond the Delaware , becoming tied to the equivalent of suborbital hops that never produced a profit — a warning for Virgin Galactic .
Fulton , on the other hand , having achieved success on the Hudson , made the giant leap and sailed down the Mississippi to expand his business empire ; this achievement is a parallel to placing a satellite in earth orbit as SpaceX did with Falcon 1 and following up with the launch of Falcon 9 — the next step up .
We have to wait and see who will find the profitable markets in NewSpace .
The cycle of innovation Today ’s space entrepreneurs are going through the same experiences as the steamboat pioneers .
As frustrating as it may seem , there is a process at work here that ca n’t be sidestepped .
The great French scientist , Antoine Lavoisier , wrote in 1790 that the proper scientific method must be based on precise experiment , close observation , and accurate measurement .
In modern times this was immortalised by Quality guru , William Edwards Deming , in what has become known as the “ Deming Cycle ” .
This is an iterative process of Plan , Do , Check , Act ( PDCA ) .
Private enterprise is alive and well and is the future for space access .
No government in the world will open up space for everyone : it ’s too risky .
Whether used as an approach to experimentation , product development , or as a quality improvement tool , PDCA requires the innovator to : Plan an experiment or trial ;
Do it while making observations and gathering performance data ;
Check on what has occurred and analyse the data to establish what worked and what problems were encountered ; then Act to solve any problems and design improvements .
Then it ’s time to begin the cycle again by planning for the next iteration .
The process may cause the innovator to go back to the drawing board many times or simply to give up the struggle .
But there is no shortcut–all innovations in human history have followed this path .
The future Private enterprise is alive and well and is the future for space access .
No government in the world will open up space for everyone : it ’s too risky .
In a wider context , the work going on in the US provides an answer to those who fret that the nation is losing its capacity for innovation .
As well as the famous names mentioned above , there are many more enterprising pioneers such as UP Aerospace , Orion Propulsion , Masten Space Systems , XCOR Aerospace , Unreasonable Rocket , and others too numerous to list .
In addition , developments in biotech , nanotech , clean energy , and smart infrastructure indicate that we are on the brink of a golden age of innovation , not witnessing the end of an era .
Back in 1802 , the eminent British scientist , Humphry Davy , looking to the future of scientific advancements , said : “ We look for a time that we may reasonably expect , for a bright day of which we already behold the dawn . ”
The sun ’s coming up .
Be patient .

01 of 08 Pro Tips to Lower Your Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mick Wiggins / Ikon Images / Getty Global warming is due to the increased concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
To know where to focus our efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions , we need to understand where they come from .
The top greenhouse gas emitting sector in the United States is electricity production , with 32 % of the total emissions .
Mostly responsible are coal , and increasingly , natural gas fired plants .
Next follows transportation , with 28 % , industrial processes ( 20 % ) , commercial and residential heating ( 10 % ) , and agriculture ( 10 % ) .
So , what are some concrete steps we can take to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions ?

If your heat comes from any of the fossil fuels ( and the same goes for those heating with electricity ) , keep thermostats lower at night , in unoccupied rooms , and when you are out of the house during the day .
Have an energy audit conducted at your home , it will tell you where your house is loosing heat .
Remedy the situation by properly caulking doors and windows and by insulating the attic , for example .
Pro Tip :
Use a programmable thermostat which allows you to preset temperatures for different time periods .
05 of 08 Make Good Transportation Choices : Drive Smart Combining errands to one trip a week cuts down on vehicle use .
UpperCut Images
Keep your vehicle well maintained , and pay special attention to engine efficiency and to the emission systems .
Keep your car tires properly inflated .
Gentle acceleration , smooth driving , and staying at or below the speed limit will reduce emissions .
If you must replace your vehicle , select a model that is fuel - efficient .
Take advantage of car - pooling opportunities .
Pro Tip : Consolidate errands into one weekly trip .

If possible , work from home .
An increasing number of companies allow employees to work from home one , two or more days a week .
Use public transportation .
Consider using a car share program for weekend trips , instead of owning one .
Pro Tip : Commute to work by walking or riding a bike instead of driving your car .
07 of 08 Make Good Food Choices : The Right Fruit and Vegetables With canning , you can enjoy your local harvest all year long .

Choose fruit and vegetables grown locally , and those that are in season .
This way you can avoid much of the environmental costs associated with long - distance transport , plus you can actually go see how your food is grown .
Choose a farmer that you trust , and join their Community Supported Agriculture program to get your produce directly from the farm .
Pro Tip : Can , dry , or freeze produce that is available ( and cheap ) in season , and continue enjoying it the rest of the year .
Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty addresses Iowa Republicans at the Leadership for Iowa event on Nov. 7 in Des Moines .
Pawlenty slams Obama from Iowa
DES MOINES – Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty used his Iowa debut as a potential presidential candidate Saturday to excoriate President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats for not doing more to address the still - wheezing economy .
“ They should be focused like a laser on jobs , not acting like a manure spreader in a wind storm , ” Pawlenty told Iowa Republicans gathered in an exhibition hall at the state fairgrounds , criticizing Democrats for their efforts on health care and energy .

Noting that unemployment in October crested 10 percent , he mocked the Obama administration officials who earlier said that threshold would be breached only if Congress did n’t agree to the stimulus the White House called for , and received .
“ As a senior aide to President Clinton once said :
It ’s the economy , stupid , ” Pawlenty quipped , channeling the 1992 James Carville line .
He proposed making some of the Bush - era tax cuts permanent and cutting the payroll tax and rates on small business and research and development to help bolster the economy .
Speaking for 30 minutes to a crowd of approximately 700 at a fundraising dinner for the Iowa GOP , the second - term governor touted the party ’s victories in Tuesday ’s gubernatorial races to argue that Republicans have begun to come back .
In the state whose first - in - the - nation caucuses have long made it a crucial stop for presidential hopefuls , Pawlenty took several shots at the Obama administration .
Test - driving a new stump speech , he offered a reworking of the president ’s signature call - and - response chant : “ Are you fired up and ready to fight back ? ”
The polite Midwestern crowd , though , received Pawlenty with polite applause throughout his speech , saving their loudest ovation for toward the end of his remarks when he raised “ the importance of thanking and acknowledging God . ”
DNC spokesman Hari Sevugan , responding to Pawlenty ’s speech , said that “ It ’s not a question of focusing on the 'economy stupid . '
It 's a question of not repeating the same stupid economic policies that got us into this mess to begin with . ”
While Pawlenty exhorted the crowd to help re-take the governor ’s mansion here and in other Midwestern states next year , the governor , who is not seeking re-election next year , also used much of his time before a crowd of likely 2012 caucus - goers to introduce himself .
He described his blue - collar roots as the son of a truck driver from South St. Paul and touted his ability to win in an historically - liberal state .
Plainly hoping to offer himself up as regular guy , Pawlenty took the stage to Creedence Clearwater Revival ’s “ Fortunate Son , ” ( even though potential 2012 rival Mitt Romney is in fact a “ governor ’s son ” ) , recalled his deer - hunting expedition into northern Minnesota earlier in the day ( where he said he pioneered a new hunting technique , “ shoot and release ” ) , decried the bailouts and made sure the audience knew that he was essentially from the neighborhood .
“ Minnesota and Iowa have a lot in common , ” he observed .
“ We ’re a state that if you drive across the Minnesota border into northern Iowa , you ca n’t tell that you ’re in a different state in a lot of ways . ”
In another moment of heartland solidarity , he said : “ Some people call us fly - over country . ”
Going further than perhaps some in the Midwestern crowd are used to , though , the governor also noted that he was joined at the dinner by his “ red - hot , smoking wife , ” Mary .
Pawlenty ’s visit came at a time when some Hawkeye State political insiders have begun fretting about the state ’s relevance heading into the 2012 caucuses .
With Sen. John McCain having won the GOP nomination despite a 4th place finish here , the concern is that some presidential candidates may be tempted to de-emphasize or altogether skip the state .
“ I think it ’s a mistake to skip the caucuses and the reason why I think it ’s a mistake because here is really grassroots democracy , ” said Sen.
Charles Grassley ( R - Iowa ) in a brief interview Saturday night before the dinner .
And if the appeal of up - close , retail campaigning is n’t enough to lure candidates back , Grassley noted the state ’s track record of launching candidates to the White House .
“ In one generation , Iowa has elected two presidents , one Carter and the other Obama , ” he said .
Both , though , are Democrats .
Pawlenty avoided any mention of the cherished caucuses during his remarks , but after briefly addressing reporters following the dinner , he stopped before getting into his car to say he hoped they continued to play a vital role in the nominating process .
“ I think that ’s a great demonstration of grassroots democracy that allows people to come forward in an open , transparent , grassroots way , ” he said .
“ And so I think it has served Iowa and it has served the nation well . ”
Earlier in the day , Pawlenty went even further to demonstrate his personal commitment to the caucuses , taking a series of steps that underlined his clear interest in running for president .
Fresh from his hunting trip , and still clad in a blaze orange hat , he met with longtime Iowa GOP strategist Dave Roederer at a downtown hotel here .
Roerder was the state campaign chairman for President Bush ’s re-election in 2004 and McCain ’s 2008 bid .
Later , Pawlenty was the guest of honor at a small fundraiser for the Iowa GOP held at the home of Doug Reichardt , a prominent local insurance executive and Republican donor .
And the governor had sought to sit down with Grassley in the afternoon but the senator had a scheduling conflict .
Though Pawlenty certainly did n’t light the room ablaze with his presence , he seemed to strike solid and familiar chords with the Republicans in the room .
“ I think he is the profile of the kind of candidate who could be very powerful in 2012 , ” said Bill Schikel , a former state representative from Mason City who is on the GOP ’s state central committee .
“ It ’s a combination of his presentation .
It ’s what he says and how he says it . ”
Though some in the audience said privately that Pawlenty ’s remarks lacked a spark , most Iowans were either pleasantly inscrutable or laudatory .
Frank Severnio , a Republican from just outside of Des Moines who approached Pawlenty after the dinner to offer his support , was the most blunt : “ He ’s a fresh face .
We ’ve been there with Romney and Huckabee . ”
Can exercise be too much of a good thing ?
Middle - aged men and women may be risking arthritis if they overdo their exercise regime , research suggests .
A US study of more than 200 people aged 45 to 55 and of " normal " weight found those doing the most exercise were the most likely to suffer knee damage .
Running and jumping may also do more damage to cartilage and ligaments than swimming and cycling , researchers said .
One arthritis charity said it was important to keep fit and most people would not have any problems .
Osteoarthritis - the most common form of arthritis - is a degenerative joint disease that causes pain , swelling and stiffness and affects 8 m people in the UK .
People with higher physical activity levels may be at greater risk for developing knee abnormalities
Dr Christoph Stehling
University of California , San Francisco
It is more common in women , and the risk increases with age and weight .
Presenting the findings at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America , the researchers said their study included people who had not reported any previous knee pain .
Activity Based on a questionnaire designed to work out how much exercise they do , participants were split into low - , middle - and high - activity groups .
A typical high - activity individual would do several hours of walking , sports or other types of exercise per week , as well as gardening and other household chores .
They then underwent MRI scans of the knee , looking for tears , lesions and other abnormalities in the cartilage and ligaments .
The damage seen was associated solely with activity levels and was not age or gender specific , the researchers said .
And it also seemed to be linked to the type of exercise a person did , although the researchers said this needed to be looked at in other studies .
Study leader Dr Christoph Stehling , a researcher at the University of California , San Francisco said : " Our data suggest that people with higher physical activity levels may be at greater risk for developing knee abnormalities and , thus , at higher risk for developing osteoarthritis .
" This study and previous studies by our group suggest that high impact , weight - bearing physical activity , such as running and jumping , may be worse for cartilage health .
" Conversely , low - impact activities , such as swimming and cycling , may protect diseased cartilage and prevent healthy cartilage from developing disease . "
A spokeswoman for the Arthritis Research Campaign said that the gains of exercise far outweighed any potential risks .
" We have known for years that certain high impact sports and jobs are associated with an increased risk of osteoarthritis , particularly of the knee , but for the vast majority of people exercise is good , not only for the cartilage but for total body health .
" Most people can exercise without any problems , but if you have had a joint injury or torn cartilage or ligaments you should be cautious about weight - bearing exercise , and swimming and cycling may provide a better option for you . "
Kate Llewelyn , of the charity Arthritis Care , said : " Osteoarthritis used to be considered wear and tear arthritis , but it's now thought that there are many more factors than age and use that contribute to its development .
" Many people wrongly assume that exercising when you already have arthritis is a no no , but in fact appropriate exercise is one of the best ways to help control pain , boost energy , keep you mobile and strengthen your joints . "

BROOK PARK -- U.S. Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - 10 , Cleveland , wants an extra $ 3 billion awarded to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration for human space flight .
Kucinich said the resultant $ 22 billion for the 2012 budget would restore research " so badly damaged " under the Bush administration .
Kucinich sent supportive letters Sept. 25 to John Holdren , the director of science and technology policy at the White House , and to NASA Administrator Charles Bolden Jr .
Kucinich complained that NASA needed to keep its in - house research and development programs .
" Healthy aeronautics and space R&D programs must once again be the cornerstone " of NASA , Kucinich said .
Kucinich said he feared an expansion of commercial space ventures would lead to more privatization of government functions and loss of civil - service technical jobs .
More outsourcing of NASA ’s technical staff duties " must be rejected , " Kucinich said in his letter .
Kucinich backs an independent office for research and technology to study microgravity science , space biology and expand the Orion - Ares spacecraft , which is to replace the shuttle in 2015 .

A little while back Conal Elliott asked about the memoization of polymorphic types .
I thought it'd be fun to describe how to memoize such functions in the same spirit as Ralph Hinze 's use of tries to memoize non-polymorphic functions .
Along the way I 'll try to give a brief introduction to quantified types in Haskell as well as showing some applications of the Yoneda lemma at work .
You can think of a generalized trie for a function type T as a type that 's isomorphic to T but does n't have an arrow '- >' anywhere in its definition .
It 's something that contains all the same information as a function , but as a data structure rather than as a function .
Hinze showed how to construct these by using the high school algebra axioms on non-polymorphic types .
Polymorphic types are types involving quantification .
So to make suitable tries for these we need to add some rules for handling quantifiers to high school algebra .
At first it seems unlikely that we could memoize polymorphic types .
When Hinze demonstrated how to construct generalized tries he showed how to make a tree structure that was tailored to the specific types in hand .
With polymorphic functions we do n't know what types we 'll be dealing with , so we need a one - size fits all type .
That sounds impossible , but it 's not .
The first thing we need to look at is universal quantification .
Suppose F( a ) is a type expression involving the symbol a .
Then the type ∀a .
F( a ) can be thought of as being a bit like the product of F ( a ) for all possible values of a .
So ∀a .
F( a ) is a bit like the imaginary infinite tupleOne reason you can think of it this way is that all of the projections exist .
So for any type you choose , say B , there is a function ( ∀a . F( a ) ) -> F( B ) .
In Haskell the ∀ is written asand probably the best known example is the Haskellfunction of type .
For any concrete type B , gives us a function of type .
Note that we usually write the signature simply as .
Haskell implicitly prepends afor every free variable in a type .
We have to use the following line of code if we want to be able to useexplicitly ( among other things ) : I 'll approach the tries through a series of propositions .
So here 's our first one : ∀a . a = 00 is the type with no elements .
∀a. a is a type that can give us an object of type B for any B .
There is no way to to this .
How could such a function manufacture an element of B for any B with nothing to work from ?
It would have to work even for types that have n't been defined yet .
( By the way , do you notice a similarity with the axiom of choice ? )
So ∀a . a is the type with no elements .
Here 's the usual way to write the type with no elements :
We also have : ∀a. a= 1
If we have a function of typethen for any element of type a you give it , it can give you back an element of type a .
There 's only one way to do this - it must give you back what you gave it .
It ca n't transform that element in any way because there is no uniform transformation you could write that works for all values of a .
So ∀a. ahas one element , A slightly more interesting proposition is this : ∀a. a= 2A function of typegives you an a when you give it a pair of a's .
As we do n't know in advance what type a will be we can't write code that examines a in any way .
So a function of this type must return one of the pair , and which one it returns can't depend on the value of the argument .
So there are only two functions of this type , andWe can rewrite the last proposition as ∀a . a= 2 .
That suggests that maybe ∀a . a= n for any type n .
We can go one better .
Here 's another proposition :
For any functor F and type n , ∀a. F( a ) = F( n ) I 've already talked about that result .
Here 's an implementation of the isomorphisms : Throughtout this article I 'll use the convention that if f is an isomorphism , f ' is its inverse .
Now it 's time to look at a kind of dual of the above propositions .
Instead of universal quantification we 'll consider existential quantification .
The type ∃a .
F( a ) is a kind of infinite sum of all types of the form F( a ) .
We can imagine it being a bit like the following definition :
The important point is that given any element of any type we can turn it into an element of ∃a .
F( a ) .
You'd think that we could write this in Haskell asbut unfortunately Haskell does things differently .
The idea behind the notation is this : as we can put anything of type F ( b ) into it .
So if X = ∃a .
F( a ) then we have a function F( a ) ->
X for any a .
So we have a function of type ∀a .
F( a ) ->
X . So although this type is existentially quantified , its constructor is universally quantified .
We tell Haskell to make a type existentially quantified by telling it the constructor is universally quantified :
You can think ofas not being a single constructor , but an infinite family of constructors , like , etc. above .
If you have an element of an ordinary non-polymorphic algebraic sum type then the only way you can do stuff to it is to apply case analysis .
To do something with an existential type means you have to perform a kind of infinite case analysis .
So to do something with an element of ∃a .
F( a ) you need to provide an infinite family of functions , one for each possible type .
In other words , you need to apply a function of type ∀a . F( a ) → B to it .
Time for another proposition : ∃a . a = 1 It seems weird at first that the sum of all types is 1 .
But once you put something into this type , you can no longer get any information about it back out again .
If you try doing case analysis you have to provide a polymorphic function that accepts an argument of type ∀a .
a , which is as good as saying you can't do any case analysis .
Proposition 5 is actually a special case of the following : For any functor f , ∃a. ( n , f ( a ) ) = f( n ) Briefly , the reason this is that the only thing you can do with a matching pair of nand f( a ) is apply the former to the latter using .
This is a kind of dual to the Yoneda lemma and I say more about it here
We already know from high school algebra that this is true :=x .
xWe can write the isomorphisms explicitly :
It should be no surprise that the following ' infinite ' version is true as well : = ∀a .
xWe can write the isomorphism directly :
We 're now equipped to start constructing generalized tries for polymorphic functions .
So let 's consider memoizing the type , fora functor .
At first this looks hard .
We have to memoize a function that can take as argument a list of any type .
How can we build a trie if we do n't know anything in advance about the type of a ?
The solution is straightforward .
We follow Hinze in applying a bit of high school algebra along with some of the propositions from above .
By definition , L( a ) =is a solution to the equation L( a ) = 1+a.L( a ) .
So we want to simplify ∀a. f( a ) .
We haveI hope you can see a bit of a pattern forming .
Let 's define T( n ) = f( a ) .
Then
That 's it !
We can translate this definition directly into Haskell .
I 'm using the fact thatis standard Haskell for the type n+1 .
( But note that this equality is only valid when we think of the list type as data , not codata .
So like with Hinze 's original tries , values at infinite lists do n't get memoized . )
To build the isomorphism we need to trace through the steps in the derivation .
At one point we used a +a. L( a ) = a .L( a ) which we can implement as the pair of isomorphisms :
We can put the other steps together with this to give :
Let 's try a few examples .
I 'll use the identity functor for the first example .
Here 's our first test function and some data to try it on :
Inwe'e using a function to represent a kind of ' head ' before the main list .
For the next example we 're leaving the first element of the pair undefined so thatis effectively of list type :
We can test them by building the memoized versions of these functions .
and then apply them It appears to work !
So what 's actually going on ?
We haveNow consider a functionapplied to a list .
If the list is n't an infinite stream then it must have a certain length , say n .
From these elements it builds something of type .
However thisis constructed , each of the elements of typein it must be constructed from one of the n elements in the list .
So if we apply g to the list [ 0,1,2 , ... , n - 1 ] it will construct an element ofwhere eachin it contains a label saying which position in the list it came from .
( Compare with Neel 's comment here ) .
If we use integers we do n't get a perfect trie because there are more elements of typethan there are ways to indicate source positions .
What we need is that for each length of list , n , we have a type with precisely n elements .
And that 's what the type n gives us .
We can memoize many different functions this way , though if the functor f is a function type you 'll need to use some of Hinze 's techniques to eliminate them .
And you 'll notice I have n't used all of the propositions above .
I 've tried to give some extra tools to allow people to memoize more types than just my two examples .
One last thing : I would n't use the type above to memoize in a real world application .
But the methods above could be used to derive approximate tries that are efficient .
One obvious example of an approximation would be to useinstead of the finite types .
Update : I forgot to provide one very important link .

New York ( CNN ) --
For the first time since 1982 , an American man won the New York City Marathon on Sunday .
Meb Keflezighi , 34 , broke the tape in the 26.2 - mile course with a personal best time of 2:09:15 .
Keflezighi emigrated in 1987 to San Diego , California .
One of 11 children , Keflezighi fled with his family from war - ridden Eritrea during its bloody conflict with Ethiopia .
He became a U.S. citizen in 1998 .
He won a silver medal at the 2004 Olympics and was the runner - up in the New York marathon that year .
The female champion , 37 - year - old Derartu Tulu of Ethiopia , was neck and neck with Ludmila Petrova of Russia until the last leg of the race , when she sprinted ahead to victory with a time of 2:28:52 .
Tulu , a two - time Olympic gold medalist in the 10,000 - meter race in 1992 and 2000 , won the London marathon in 2001 .
The defending female champion , Britain 's Paula Radcliffe , took fourth place among women .
Finishing fourth in the men's category was another American , Ryan Hall .
Hall , 27 , is a rising star on the world running circuit and made headlines last year by running the London marathon in a stunning 2:06:17 .
Americans once dominated long - distance running , bringing home consecutive gold medals from 1970 - 82 .
Marathon legend Bill Rodgers won the New York City four years in a row from 1976 to 1979 , and Alberto Salazar took walked away with successive victories from 1980 - 82 .
The marathon , which began in 1970 with a mere 127 runners , now hosts 38,000 athletes from around the globe , according to the marathon 's Web site .
Known for its diverse , punishing terrain , the annual event spans all five of New York 's City 's boroughs , finishing in the heart of Central Park .
Keflezighi and Tulu will each receive $ 130,000 in prize money .
When Maggie Betts wore a $ 400 pair of black silk pants to a formal family dinner , her mother was appalled .
" She said they looked like sweatpants , " the New York filmmaker recalls .
A friend accused her of wearing " droopy drawers , " while her cousin said she resembled Luke Skywalker .
" I feel like I look very chic in my harem pants , " says Ms. Betts , 34 years old , of one of this fall 's hottest fashion trends .
" Anybody who makes fun of me does n't know the truth and is a loser . "

Zimbabwe 's Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai has said his MDC party has " disengaged " from the unity government over the treatment of his senior aide .
He said all outstanding issues of a power - sharing deal had to be dealt with before the MDC would work with Zanu - PF .
Senior MDC member Roy Bennett was later released on bail after two days in prison , but Mr Tsvangarai 's spokesman insisted the boycott would continue .
Mr Bennett was detained for alleged arms and terrorism offences .
Mr Tsvangirai said the detention showed Zanu - PF was an " unreliable " partner .
" It has brought home the reality that as a movement we have an unreliable and unrepentant partner in the transitional government , " AFP quotes him as saying .
Until confidence has been restored we can't continue to pretend that everything is well
Morgan Tsvangirai Mr Mugabe and Mr Tsvangirai agreed to share power in February after disputed elections last year marred by violence .
But since then their parties have failed to agree on appointees for provincial governors , the central bank governor and the attorney general .
The Movement for Democratic Change also accuses Zanu - PF of persecuting its legislators and activists .
Zimbabwean journalist Brian Hungwe told the BBC Mr Tsvangirai said the MDC was not yet pulling out of the coalition government and was open to talks to break the impasse .
But the prime minister also accused Zanu - PF of beginning to set up militia bases in the countryside , and militarising state institutions ahead of future elections .
' Persecuted '
Mr Tsvangirai said the MDC was officially pulling out of cabinet and council of ministers meetings as well as routine Monday meetings between the leaders of the three parties in the national unity government .
ROY BENNETT
Former coffee farmer 2000 : Elected MP 2004 : Jailed after pushing minister in parliament 2006 : Accused of plot to kill President Mugabe 2006 : Fled to South Africa 2009 : Nominated as deputy agriculture minister ; arrested
Profile : Zimbabwe 's political farmer " Until confidence has been restored , we can't continue to pretend that everything is well , " AP news agency quotes Mr Tsvangirai as saying .
MDC spokesman Nelson Chamisa told the BBC that despite Mr Bennett 's release , the MDC would not co-operate with Zanu - PF until other outstanding issues are resolved .
The BBC's Jonah Fisher in South Africa says the announcement is a sign of deal under intense stress - but in itself it may not make much difference to the operation of Zimbabwe 's government .
He says the MDC has been ignored over some key decisions .
MDC ministers will however continue to hold their positions - and try to exercise their powers .
Mr Bennett , who has been nominated as deputy minister for agriculture , is due to stand trial on 19 October on charges of terrorism , insurgency , sabotage and banditry .
If convicted he could face a life sentence in jail .
" Roy Bennett is not being prosecuted , he is being persecuted , " Mr Tsvangirai said .
Mr Bennett was initially arrested and jailed in February , on the day ministers in the coalition government were sworn in .
He was released on bail in March before a judge ordered that he return to prison on Wednesday .
" In my view the applicant stands to lose more by absconding trial .
He has foiled his previous record , therefore he is entitled to an order that he seeks , " Justice Charles Hungwe said on Friday , announcing his bail release , AFP reports .
Mr Bennett , a white farmer whose land was seized under Mr Mugabe 's land reform programme , fled to South Africa in 2006 saying he feared for his life , before returning to serve in the government .

What are these ?

You 're a billionaire but you do n't want anyone , least of all the taxman , to know .
What do you do ?
Head for a palm - fringed island paradise or a snow - covered Alpine micro-state ?
Wrong .
The world 's most opaque jurisdictions – the ones that will best shield you and your cash from the light – are mostly in the heart of the most sophisticated and powerful global financial centres .
London , Luxembourg and Zurich are in the top five most secretive jurisdictions , according the first comprehensive index of financial transparency ever compiled .
Yet top of the pile , beating the British Virgin Islands , Belize or Liechtenstein as the best place to hide wealth , is Delaware .
One of the smallest states in the US , it offers the best protection for anyone who does not want to disclose their identity as a beneficial owner of a company .
That is one very good reason why the East Coast state hosts 50 % of the US 's quoted firms and 650,000 companies – almost equivalent to one company per Delaware resident .
The Financial Secrecy Index took 18 months to compile , was researched by senior academics , accountants and investigators under the banner of the Tax Justice Network , and runs to 1,800 pages .
It uses findings from the Financial Action Task Force , the high - level global body combating money laundering and terrorist finance , and the International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , as well as 12 key indicators involving bank secrecy rules , disclosure of beneficial ownership and trust law .
It finds that Delaware – the political power - base of the US vice - president , Joe Biden – offers high levels of banking secrecy and does not make details of trusts , company accounts and beneficial ownership a matter of public record .
Delaware also allows companies to re-domicile within its borders with minimal disclosure , and allows the existence of privacy - enhancing " protected cell " or " segregated portfolio " companies , among many other stratagems useful for protecting the identity of those who do business there .
The only financial privacy indicator on which Delaware scores positively is that it is party to a large number of international tax information sharing agreements , but this is because those agreements are signed by the United States .
Delaware state officials say it is not the ability to protect identities that attracts so many companies and individuals to register businesses ; rather , it is the state 's sophisticated judicial system , which has evolved , they say , into the top corporate dispute resolution centre in America .
But lawyer Jack Blum , a former US Senate staff attorney who has worked on high - profile fraud cases , including the BCCI investigation , says : " Secrecy in Delaware has been a massive problem and has been for sometime .
They have a lot of rules that … make it so advantageous to be there that it is breathtaking . "
And , he adds , requests for legal assistance from other countries fall on deaf ears .
" The requests pile up in district courts .
It 's beyond embarrassing .
It 's a disgrace . "
Delaware 's top position in the index will be greeted with raised eyebrows in Switzerland , which has just emerged from a bitter two - year legal dispute with the US over Swiss bank UBS 's role in facilitating tax evasion on a vast scale .
Both jurisdictions are joined in the top five by the UK .
Though Britain does not have many of the features of a secrecy jurisdiction – for instance , accounts are publicly available and companies cannot change their domicile without trace – London has been dragged into the list because of its sheer scale as a financial centre and its capacity to facilitate money - laundering and terrorist finance .
In a devastating appraisal of the UK's financial investigation powers , the Financial Action Task Force , in its most recent assessment two years ago , stated : " There are not adequate measures in place to ensure that there is adequate , accurate and timely information on the beneficial ownership and control of legal persons that can be obtained or accessed in a timely fashion . "
Not surprisingly , representatives from the Caymans and Luxembourg , which made it into the top five , are aggrieved at their inclusion .
Anthony Travers , chairman of Cayman Finance , the islands ' business representative body , says : " Anybody who claims to have evidence that Cayman is opaque has n't read the IMF and Financial Action Task Force reports nor the US version from the General Accountability Office ...
[ This ] report [ has a ] selective bias and [ is ] totally discredited , and will be seen as such by everybody in the financial world . "
Luxembourg 's Association of Banks & Bankers ( ABBL ) takes a similar line : " The ABBL does not consider Luxembourg to be a ' secrecy jurisdiction ' .
In both penal and fiscal matters , Luxembourg already co-operates more fully on an international basis than 80 % of countries in the world . "
But John Christensen , a director of Tax Justice Network and a joint author of the report , says : " The secrecy jurisdictions are found in North America , the former British empire and Europe .
These are the regions which have driven the neo-liberalisation project that has skewered financial markets and turned them into criminogenic markets .
They can attract capital with no questions asked .
What this reveals is the massive hypocrisy of OECD states . "
The world 's most powerful countries will aim to clamp down further on offshore tax havens at the G20 finance ministers ' meetings in Scotland later this month .
The question of whether they should extend the measures they take to their own jurisdictions will not , in all likelihood , be on the agenda .
The top five secrecy jurisdictions
Delaware , US :
The world 's top secrecy jurisdiction .
Register a company here and no one will ever know .
If you have overseas income , it will be tax exempt .
Luxembourg : Europe 's most powerful investment management centre .
It does require company accounts to be publicly available .
But in virtually every other category secrecy rules .
Switzerland :
The traditional home of the opaque bank .
For years , it resisted international requests for tax information exchange .
Cayman Islands : The Caribbean island has a serious budget crisis .
Its leaders take a dim view of having the " good name " of the most powerful hedge fund centre tarnished by accusations .
City of London , UK : The International Narcotics Control Strategy Report said last year : " Illicit cash is consolidated in the UK and then moved overseas where it can readily enter the legitimate financial system . "
It adds : " Drug traffickers and other criminals are able to launder substantial amounts of money in the UK despite improved anti-money laundering measures . "
I bought a car this past weekend .
Actually , my wife and I bought a car this past weekend .
But since I rarely drive ( except slow on the driveway every Saturday ) , it is mostly a purchase for her .
The process of buying a car is equivalent to having root canal work done on the back of a camel while riding through It ’s A Small World at Disney .
We should probably just load every terrorist from Guantanamo Bay onto a boat and send them to the nearest car dealership .
If every day is the endless process of car buying , you ’ll really start to view us as the Great Satan ( or Saturn , take your pick ) .
Regardless , the process is n’t enjoyable in the least .
Our experience was better than most , I suppose .
The dealership was one of those “ no negotiation ” setups , so we had already price checked it before even going to look at it .
Even after using the mighty Internet to check prices , I ’m still certain we got ripped off .
I think everyone feels this way when buying a car .
No matter how friendly the salesperson , you ’re fairly certain they ’re up to something .
Oddly , I do n’t feel this same way when purchasing celery from my local grocer , and that guy is a hell of a lot creepier .
One explanation might be that , in general , we know very little about the way cars are priced or what any of their features mean .
I think my new car has something on it called ODO Trip , but I have little clue what that button does .
Worse yet , I ’m afraid to push it .
If it does mess something up I have to head all the way back to the dealership so they can rub in the fact that I am completely clueless about the thing I just paid them my non-existent child ’s future college tuition for .
Basically , I bought a car .
So yeah , I ’m an idiot .
Most American elections are n’t particularly competitive .
So an off - year election cycle with only a few important offices at stake does n’t have any business being interesting .
But the 2009 political season has been surprisingly entertaining .
True , the Virginia governor ’s race looks increasingly like a Republican cakewalk .
But tomorrow ’s other two noteworthy elections , in New Jersey and far upstate New York , have become fascinating free - for - alls .
And in both cases , a third - party candidate provided the spark .
If it were n’t for Chris Daggett , a former E.P.A. administrator turned independent candidate for governor , the race for the Garden Statehouse would have been a dull , grinding contest between an unpopular incumbent , Jon Corzine , and a cautious challenger , Chris Christie , who has spent his campaign promising not to be Jon Corzine and not much else .
If it were n’t for Doug Hoffmann , a Lake Placid accountant running on the Conservative Party line , the battle to represent New York ’s 23rd Congressional District would have been a Tweedle - Dee - Tweedle - Dum affair , featuring a Republican , Dede Scozzafava , who ’s arguably more liberal than her Democratic opponent , Bill Owens .

You start with a question : how do you perceive the need to isolate a material from the environment ?
I think most people would begin to answer that by looking at the nature of the material .
Wherever that material is currently , we make sure that there is either a thick wall or a deep layer of water to protect the people working around it .
That ’s what ’s being done at a reactor : when spent fuel comes out of a reactor , it ’s taken out remotely with no one present , and put into a water basin that ’s deep enough that there is no radioactive shine from the spent fuel escaping out of that water .
If the pool is getting full , after five years or so of cooling , then the utility company will take the material out of the pool — remotely manipulated from behind leaded - glass windows — and put it into dry storage .
Dry storage uses very thick steel and concrete .
And there it will sit until someone disposes of it , or until it ’s reprocessed .
Now , in most countries , what they have done next is asked :
What geology would be very good for isolating this material from the environment ?
And what geologies are available in our country ?
The Swedes have gone to their granites , because their whole country is basically underlain by granites .
The French looked at granites , salts , and clay , and decided to go with clay .
The Belgians and Dutch are looking at clay and salts ; and the Germans are looking at salts right now , but also at granites and clay .
The Swiss are looking at clay , mostly , although they did look at crystalline rock — meaning rock with large crystals , like granite , gabbros , and that kind of thing .
But they decided that , in their particular instance — since the Alps are still growing and slopes are not all that stable over hundreds of thousands of years — to look instead at their deep basins of clays close to the Rhine River as a repository location .
We ’re all looking to isolate this material for about a million years .
In the U.S. we did a sweep of the country , looked at all the available geologies , and we decided that we had many possible sites .
We investigated some , which basically involved looking at what we knew from geological surveys of the states , and then we made a recommendation to go look at three of the possibilities in greater detail .
There was then a decision process : it went from nine sites , to five , to three .
At that point , Congress stepped in .
They started looking at the huge bills associated with site - specific studies — excavation is not cheap — and they said : let ’s just do one site and see if it ’s suitable .
If it is not , then we ’ll go back and see what else we can do .
So that ’s how Yucca Mountain , basically , was selected .
It was a cost - saving measure over the other two that were in the running for a repository .
Those were a bedded salt site in Texas and a basalt site — a deep volcanic rock site — in Washington State .
But all three were looked at , and all three were judged to be equally safe for the first 10,000 years — which , at that time , was the regulation .
Since the selection of Yucca Mountain , the regulation has been bumped up to a million years , which is pretty much where the rest of the world is looking : a million years of isolation .

Now , the reason that you want to isolate this material for a million years is that the spent fuel — meaning fuel that no longer supports the chain reaction that keeps reactors making electricity — contains
At Yucca Mountain we took the attitude that , since we basically have a dry mountain in a dry area with very little rainfall , we would use a material that can stand up to oxygen being present .
The material we selected was a metal alloy called Alloy 22 .
Our design involves basically wrapping the stainless steel packages , in which we would receive the spent fuel , in Alloy 22 and sticking them inside this mountain with a layer of air over the top .
What we know is that when water moves through rock or fractured materials , it tends to stay in the rock rather than fall — unless that rock is saturated .
Yucca Mountain is unsaturated , so water ought not be a major issue for us at Yucca Mountain — yet it is .
We have to worry about future climates , because , right now in Nevada , we are in a nine year drought — and , basically since the last Ice Age , we have been in a 10,000 - year drought .
80 % of the time , if we look a million years into the past , we have , on average , twice the precipitation we have now .
Most of the past is — and the future will be — wetter and cooler .
Which is nice for Nevada ! [ laughs ]
In any case , we tried to take advantage of the natural setting , as well as take advantage of a metal that stands up very well to oxidizing conditions .
That is how , in our safety analyses , we showed that we are basically safe for well beyond a million years — if we do exactly what we said we would do in that analysis .

Other countries have decided not to go in a similar direction to us .
The only other country that ’s contemplating a similar repository to ours is Mexico .
All the other countries in the world are looking at constructing something that is very deep — and under the water table .
If you go under the water table deep enough , there is no oxygen in the water , and if there is no oxygen than the solubility of a sizable number of the radionuclides is a non-problem .
Many are just not soluble unless there is oxygen in the water .
Going that deep then allows those countries to use a different set of materials , ones that last a long time when there is no oxygen present .
For example , the Swedes are using granite — so are the Finns , by the way , and the Canadians , though the Canadians might decide to go for clays .
With the granites , the older they are , the more fractured they are , and they ca n’t predict a million years into the future where the fracture zones are going to be .
So they have chosen a copper container for their spent fuel ; copper is thermodynamically stable in granite .
In fact , copper deposits naturally occur in granite .
They then wrap a very thick layer of
Those are basically the three rock types that the whole world is looking at in terms of repositories .
So you can rely more on the engineered system or more on the natural system .
Either way , it ’s the combination of the two systems that allows you to predict , with relative security , that you ’re going to isolate a material for well over a million years .
By that time , the natural decay of the material that you ’ve hidden away has pretty much taken care of most of the risk .
In fact , by about half a million years , most of the spent fuel is less radioactive than the ore from which it was created .
That ’s a wonderful argument — but the spent fuel still is n’t safe at that point .
You still need to continue to isolate it , just as you do n’t want to live on top of uranium ore , either .
It ’s a dangerous material .
In a nutshell , that ’s our philosophy of containment .

BLDGBLOG : I ’m interested in how you go about testing these sorts of designs .
Do you actually build scale models , like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ’ hydrological models , or do you rely on lab tests and computer simulations , given the timescale and complexity ?
Van Luik :
What we do is safety assessments that project safety out to a million years .
What I used to say to my troops , when I was a manager of this activity , was : “ Safety assessment without any underlying science is like a confession in church without a sin : without the one , you have nothing to say in the other . ”
To collect the science needed to make credible projections of system safety , we have dug several miles of tunnels under this mountain ; we ’ve done lots of testing of how water can move through this mountain , if there was more water ; and we ’ve done testing of coupons of the materials that we want to use .
These tests were performed using solutions , temperature ranges , and oxygen concentrations that we think are representative over the whole range of what can be reasonably expected at Yucca Mountain .
Those kinds of physical tests we have done .
We have also utilized information from people who have taken spent fuel apart in some of our national laboratories and subjected it to leaching tests to see how it dissolves , how fast it dissolves , and what dissolves out of it .
We have done all of that kind of testing , and that ’s what forms the basis for our computer modeling .
One thing we have not done , and ca n’t do , is a mock - up of Yucca Mountain .
It just does n’t work that way .
It ’s too complicated , too large , and too long a time - scale .
[ Image : Yucca Mountain , courtesy of Wikipedia ] .
In compensation for that spatial - and time - scale difficulty , what we have done is looked for similar localities with uranium deposits in them , like Peña Blanca , Mexico , just north of Chihuahua City .
There , we have rock very similar to Yucca Mountain ’s rock , and we have probably a 30 - million year old uranium deposit — quite a rich one — that was going to be mined until the price of uranium dropped considerably .
We ’ve studied that piece of real estate — it has roughly similar rock , sitting under similar conditions except for more summer rainfall — and we ’ve looked at the movement of radioactivity from that ore body .
From that we ’ve gained confidence that our computer modeling can pretty much mimic what was seen at that uranium site .
We ’ve looked for natural analogues of other possible conditions — for example , the climate at Yucca Mountain during an ice age .
We ’ve studied six or seven sites that mimic what we would see during a climate change here .
And , in terms of materials , there are some naturally occurring materials that have a passive coating on them .
We ’ve studied metals found in nature that are similar in the way they act to the metals that we are using for our waste packages .
So we have gone basically all through nature looking for analogous processes — but none are exact matches for Yucca Mountain .
It ’s going to need something more unique than that .
I think the same is true for every other repository being contemplated .
We have worked in cooperation with fourteen other countries through the European Commission ’s
In some cases , the natural analogues we ’ve studied are billions of years old .
We ’ve looked at the
On top of all that , we have the problem of unlikely volcanic events , as well as strong earth motions from equally unlikely seismic events , at Yucca Mountain .
These are problems you wo n’t have at most of the other repository sites being considered in the world .
To study that , we brought in expert groups with their own insights and models to evaluate what the chances are , from a risk perspective , of a volcanic event actually interrupting or disrupting the repository .
They also looked at the possibility of a very large ground motion adding stress and causing eventual failure of one or more of the waste packages .
Although volcanic events are highly unlikely — as are very large ground - motion events — they must be factored into our analyses , based on the likelihood of their occurring over a one - million year time span .
We have basically done all safety - evaluation analyses from the perspective of the things that could happen , given the nature of this geologic setting .
Looking at analogues for processes in nature has given us confidence that what we expect to see at Yucca Mountain is what we have seen nature produce elsewhere .
These are indirect lines of evidence that support us — but we have also made a lot of direct measurements and observations , as well as testing in laboratories of materials and processes , to make sure that we ’re on the right track .
The

BLDGBLOG : Could you discuss the material selection process in more detail ?
I ’d like to hear how you found Alloy 22 , for example .
Also , when my wife and I visited Yucca Mountain a few years ago , we were given a black glass bead at the information center — what role does that glass play in the containment design ?
Finally , are the materials you ’ve chosen specifically engineered for the nuclear industry , or are these simply pre-existing materials that happen to have the requisite properties for nuclear containment ?
Van Luik :
No , the materials are not specifically engineered for the purpose of nuclear containment .
Let ’s look at Alloy 22 first .
We looked at the whole range of what is commercially available , in terms of pure metals and metal alloys .
We also looked at things like ceramic coatings .
There are some very , very hard ceramic coatings that , for example , are used on bearings for locomotives .
There are also ceramics that the military uses on projectiles to penetrate buildings .
There are some very good ceramic materials out there , but we had a problem with the predictability of very , very long - term behavior in ceramics .
That ’s why we decided to go with a metal ; a metal will fail by several different corrosion mechanisms , but not by the breakage that is typical of ceramics .
One of the things that the metals industry has been doing — for the paper - pulp industry , for example , which creates the worst possible chemical environment you can imagine — is that they have been developing more and more corrosion - resistant materials .
One of the top of the line of these corrosion - resistant materials was Alloy 22 .
We tested it alongside about six other candidates in experiments where we dripped water on them , we soaked them in water , and we had them half in and out of water , with varying solutions that we tailored for what we would expect in the mountain over time .
The one that stood out — the most reliable in all of these tests — was Alloy 22 .
The black glass that you saw is not something that the waste is wrapped in .
This material will be made at
We also have little pellets of imitation spent fuel , similar to pencil lead in color , to show visitors what the fuel rods look like inside of a reactor .
The fuel rods are ceramic , coated on the outside with an alloy .
[ Image : Nuclear fuel rods ] .
Edible Geography : Could you walk us through the planned process of loading the waste into the mountain , all the way up to the day you close the outer door ?
Van Luik : Sure .
The process , depending on whether Yucca Mountain ever goes through , politically speaking , will be as follows .
From the cooling pools or dry storage at the reactor , we ’ve asked the nuclear utility companies to put their spent fuel — or waste — into containers that we have designed and that we will supply to them .
The waste will be remotely taken out of whatever container it is in now , put into our containers , which are certified for shipping as well as disposal , and then we would slide those containers onto trains .
We want to use mostly trains — we try to avoid truck use .
Rail shipping containers currently in use are massive — some approaching two - hundred tons fully loaded .
The trains would bring the containers to us and then we would up - end them remotely and take the material out in a large open bay — all done remotely , again .
If it comes in the shipping cask that we have provided , we will be able to put it directly into the Alloy 22 and stainless steel waste package and weld it shut .
Then , with a transporter vehicle that ’s also remotely operated , we would take it underground and place it end - on - end , lying down in our repository drifts .
That ’s what we call the tunnels ; tunnels without an opening are called drifts .
We would basically fill the drifts until we get to the entrance , put a door on , and then move on to the next one .
That ’s the basic scheme of how this would be done .
Everything is shielded , of course , so that people are not exposed to radiation ; workers are protected , as well as the public .
[ Image : The " drifts " inside Yucca Mountain ; view larger .

Edible Geography :
How many containers could you fit inside a single drift , and how many drifts do you actually have in the mountain ?
Van Luik :
The drifts are each about 600 to 800 meters long .
They vary a little bit , depending on where they are in the mountain .
We will have 91 emplacement drifts — with an average of about 120 waste packages , set end - to - end , in each drift — to take care of the 70,000 metric tons that we are authorized to have .
If we receive authorization to have more than 70,000 metric tonnes , then we ’re prepared to go up to 125,000 metric tonnes of heavy metal .
That metric tonnage figure does n’t represent the total weight that goes into the mountain , by the way — it means that the containers have the equivalent of that many tonnes of uranium in them .
In other words , 70,000 metric tons is about 11,000 containers that weigh about ten metric tons each , so it ’s a huge amount of weight .
Each container contributes a significant amount of weight in itself : the steel and the Alloy 22 are very heavy .
In terms of what the repository would look like , if built , it would be a series of open tunnels , one after the other , with a bridging tunnel that allows the freight to be brought in on rail .
Everything is done remotely .
The 40 km of tunnels would all be filled up at some point , and then we would seal up the larger openings to the exterior , but leave everything else inside the mountain unsealed .
This is very different , by the way , from every other repository in the world , which would tightly compact material around the waste packages .
We want to leave air around the waste packages , because of our situation .
We have unsaturated water flow , rather than saturated flow , and as I ’ve mentioned , water does not like to fall into air out of rock — it would rather stay in the rock , unless it ’s saturated and under some degree of pressure ( such as from the weight of water above it ) .
So if we put something like bentonite clay around our packages , that would actually wick the water from the rock toward the waste packages — which is a silly thing to do if you ’re trying to take advantage of an unsaturated condition .
[ Image : An engineer uses ultraviolet light to analyze water - movement through rocks ; courtesy of the Department of Energy ] .
Edible Geography :
What process have you designed for sealing the exterior door ?
Does that also require a uniquely secure set of material and formal choices ?
Van Luik : Sealing the repository would n’t happen for at least 100 years , so what we have done at this point is basically left that decision for the future .
We have done a preliminary design , which uses a heavy concrete mixture — as well as rock rubble for a certain portion — to seal the exits from the main tunnel that goes around and feeds all the smaller tunnels .
The idea is that these openings have nothing to do with how the mountain itself functions , because the mountain is a vertical - flow system .
Coming in from the sides , as we are , has nothing to do with how the water behaves in the repository , or with the containment system we ’ve designed .
So we just want to block the side exits and make it very difficult for someone to reenter the mountain — to the point where they would basically be much better off reentering it by drilling a whole new entryway beside one of the old ones that ’s filled in .
Then there are going to be about seven vertical shafts for ventilation that will be sealed at the time of final closure .
Those will be filled to mimic the hydrological properties of the rock around them ; we do n’t want them to become preferred pathways of water , because those will point directly into the repository .
So there are two different closure schemes for the two different types of openings : three large entryways that will be completely sealed off to prevent reentry , and seven ventilation shafts that will be filled with materials that have been engineered to mimic the hydrological properties of the rock around it .
[ Image : A diagram of hypothetical water - movement around the waste packages at Yucca Mountain ; courtesy of the Department of Energy ] .
Edible Geography :
And the ventilation shafts are required because the material is so hot ?
Van Luik : Yes .
Once we put the waste in , we want to blow air over it by drawing in air from the bottom and blowing it out the top to take heat away until we shut off the vents for final closure .
The idea is to take enough heat out of the system so that , when we close it , it does n’t exceed our tolerances for temperature .
Edible Geography :
Is there any chance that having such a large amount of heavy material at Yucca Mountain could actually pose a seismic risk for the region ?
Van Luik :
When we selected this particular location , we looked very carefully at faults .
But you ’re right : if you get beyond a certain amount of weight , as under a growing mountain range , you do start shifting things in the ground .
If you build something right on a fault line you can probably change the frequency of vibration at that location , and maybe aggravate the earthquake that ’s eventually going to happen .
However , even if we fill this repository to 125,000 metric tons , that is only something like .01 % of the weight of the mountain itself .
Plus , we are surrounded by two major faults , on both sides of the mountain , and even though there ’s movement occasionally on those faults , the block in the middle — where Yucca Mountain sits — is like a boat , riding very steadily .
It ’s been like that for the past twelve million years , so we do n’t see that it ’s going to change in the future .
That said , we are in an area that ’s moving all the time .
The entire area now is moving slowly to the northwest , and the basin and range here is still growing — the distance between Salt Lake and Sacramento is already twice what it was twelve million years ago , and they will continue to be pulled apart .
We ’re well aware of the consequences of basin and range growth , and the possibility that the faults Yucca Mountain is sitting next to could be active again in the future .
We factored that in .
In fact , it ’s those earthquakes that might actually lead to failures in the system that would allow something to come out before a million years — otherwise nothing would come out until beyond a million years .
But you ca n’t put enough weight in that mountain to change the tectonic regime in the area .
[ Image : Future warning signs scattered across the Yucca Mountain site , part of " the monumental task of warning future generations " ; courtesy of the Department of Energy ] .
BLDGBLOG : Of course , once you have sealed the site , you face the challenge of keeping it away from future human contact .
How does one mark this location as a place precisely not to come to , for very distant future generations ?
Van Luik :
We have looked very closely at what WIPP is doing —
the
What we have done is Oh — let ’s not go underground here . ”
Now if people see these things and decide to go underground anyway , that becomes advertent , not inadvertent , intrusion — and we ca n’t protect against that , because there ’s no way to control the future .
All we ’re worried about is warning people so that , if they do take some action that ’s not in their best interest , they do so in the full knowledge of what they ’re getting into .
The markers that we ’re trying to make will be massive , and they will be made of materials that will last a long time — but they ’re just at the preliminary stage right now .
What I have been lobbying for with the international agencies , like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency is that before anybody builds a repository , let ’s have world agreement on the basics of a marker system for everybody .
Whoever runs the future , tens of thousands of years from now , should n’t have to dig up one repository and see a completely different marker system somewhere else and then dig that up , too .
They should be able to learn from one not to go to the others .
Of course , there ’s also a little bit of fun involved here : what is the dominant species going to be in 10,000 years ?
And can you really mark something for a million years ?
What we have looked at , basically , is marking things for at least 10,000 years — and hopefully it will last even longer .
And if this information is important to whatever societies are around at that time , if they have any intelligence at all , they will renew these monuments .
[ Image : Aerial view of Yucca Mountain ; courtesy of the Department of Energy ] .
BLDGBLOG : What kinds of projects might you work on after Yucca Mountain ?
In other words , could you apply your skills and a similar design process to different containment projects , such as carbon sequestration ?
Van Luik : I think so — if we ever get serious about carbon sequestration .
I do n’t know if you know this , but we laid off a lot of people here because there were budget cuts , and many of those people , because of the experience they had with modeling underground processes , are now working on carbon sequestration schemes for the energy sector and the Department of Energy .
No matter what happens to Yucca Mountain — whether it goes through or not — dealing with spent fuel and other nuclear waste will still be a problem , and that ’s the charter that was given to our office .
What I ’m hoping is that , as soon as Yucca Mountain gets completely killed or gets the go - ahead , I can go back to what I loved doing in the past , which was to look at selecting sites for future repositories .
One repository wo n’t be enough for all time ; it will be enough for maybe a hundred years , at the very most .
You have to plan ahead .
As long as you create the nuclear waste , you need to have a place to put it .
Even if you reprocess it — even if you build fast reactors and basically burn the actinides into fission products so that they only have to be isolated for 500 years rather than a million — you still have to have a place to put that material .
Even if we can build repositories less and less frequently , we will still be creating waste that needs to be isolated from the environment .
BLDGBLOG : You mentioned that your favorite pastime was looking for repository sites .
If you had the pick of the earth , is there a location that you genuinely think is perfect for these types of repositories , and where might that location be ?
Van Luik :
My ideal repository location has changed over time .
When I worked on crystalline rock , like granites , I thought crystalline rock was the cat ’s meow .
When I worked for a short time in salt , I thought salt was the perfect medium .
Now that I have worked with the European countries and Japan for the past twenty - five years , learning of their studies of various repository locations , I ’m beginning to think that claystone is probably the ideal medium .
In the U.S. , I would go either to North or South Dakota and look for the Pierre Shale , where it grades into clay : there , you get the best of both worlds .
I have been quoted by MSNBC , much to the chagrin of my bosses , saying that , if I were to get the pick of where we go next , that ’s where I would go .
They really did n’t like that — I was supposed to praise the Yucca Mountain site .
But let ’s get real : Yucca Mountain was chosen by Congress .
We have shown that it ’s safe , if we do what we say in terms of the engineered system .
But it was not chosen to be the most optimal of all optimal sites , the site - comparison approach was taken off the table by Congress .
As long as a chosen site and its system are safe , however , that is good enough .
Our predicted performance for Yucca Mountain , lined up to what the French are projecting for their repository in clay , and next to what the Swedes are projecting for their repository in granite , shows about the same outcome , over a million years , in terms of potential doses to a hypothetical individual .
We ’re safe as anybody can be — which is what our charter requires .
We told Congress in 2002 that , yes , it can it be done safely here — but it ’s going to cost you , and that cost is in Alloy 22 and stainless steel .
Congress said OK and it became public law .

Edible Geography :
Are any countries actually using their repositories yet ?
Van Luik :
They ’re getting very close to licensing in Finland and Sweden .
Those are going to be the first two .
We have a firm site selection in France , which means that they ’ll be going into licensing soon .
Licensing takes several years in every country .
In fact , we ’re in licensing now , except we had a change of administration and they ’ve decided that they really do n’t want to do Yucca Mountain anymore .
They want to do something else .
They have every right to make those kind of policy decisions — so here we are .
No one is actually loading high - level waste or spent nuclear fuel into a repository yet .
We have our own repository working with transuranic waste from the Defense program , in New Mexico , and both the Swedes and the Finns have medium - level waste sites , which are basically geological disposal sites , that have been active for over a decade .
The Swedes and Finns have a lot of experience building repositories underground , and their situation is interesting .
The Swedes are building a repository under the Baltic Sea , but in granites that they can get to from dry land .
When there is a future climate change , however , there ’s going to be a period when the repository area will be farmable ; it will be former ocean - bottom that is now on the surface .
Their scenario is that , at the end of the next ice age , you might actually get a farmer who drills a water - well right above the repository .
The Finns actually have a very pragmatic attitude to this .
They have regulations that basically cover the entire future span , out to a very long time period — but they also say that , once the ice has built up again and covered Finland , it wo n’t be Finland .
No one will live there .
But it does n’t matter whether anyone lives there or not : you still have to provide a system that ’s safe for whoever ’s going to be there when the ice retreats .
We — as in the whole world — need to take these future scenarios quite seriously .
And these are very interesting things to think about — things that , in normal industrial practice , you never even consider .
The repository program in England , meanwhile , went belly - up — because of regulatory issues , mostly — but it ’s coming back , and it ’s probably going to come back to exactly the same place as it was before .
That ’s a sedimentary - metamorphosed hard - rock rock site at Sellafield , right by the production facility .
No transportation will be involved , to speak of .
That ’s not a bad idea , but they had to prove that the rock was good .
The planning authority rejected their proposal the first time , so they dissolved the whole waste management company and now the government is going to take over the project ; it ’s not going to be private anymore .
In the end , the government takes over this kind of stuff in most places because the long - term implications go way beyond the lifetime of one corporation .
If there ’s any country that ’s setting a good example for waste disposal , it ’s Germany .
They ’re the only country I know of who have the same kind of regulations for hazardous waste and chemical waste as they do for nuclear waste .
There are two or three working geological repositories for chemical waste in Germany , and they have been working for a very long time .
They ’re the only ones in the world .
The chemical industry in the U.S. has basically said , no , no , do n’t go there !
[ laughs ]
[ Images : Like a scene from Poe 's " Cask of Amontillado " — as rewritten by the international chemical industry — hazardous materials undergo geological entombment ] .
But I think Germany is right : if one thing needs to be isolated because it ’s dangerous , then the other thing — that never decays and is also dangerous — needs to be treated in the same way .
The EPA does have a standard for deep - well injection of hazardous waste — they have a 10,000 - year requirement for no return to the surface .
That was comparable to what we had here , until the standard for Yucca Mountain got bumped up to a million years by Congress .
But with some chemicals , regulations only require a few hundred years of isolation — that ’s all .
Those things do n’t decay , so that does n’t make sense to me .
Anyway , I applaud Germany for their gumption — and they ’re very dependent on their chemical industry for income .
It ’s not like they ’re trying to torpedo their industry .
They ’re just saying : you have to do this right .

This autumn in New York City ,
For other interviews in our quarantine series , check out
More interviews are forthcoming .
Abraham Van Luik is a geoscientist with the U.S. Department of Energy ; he is currently based at the nuclear waste - entombment site proposed for Yucca Mountain , Nevada .
Yucca Mountain , a massive landform created by an extinct supervolcano inside what is now Nellis Air Force Base ’s Nevada Test and Training Range , 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas , is the controversial site chosen by Congress for the storage of nuclear waste .
Its political fate remains uncertain .
Although the Obama Administration has stated that Yucca Mountain is “ no longer … an option for storing nuclear waste , ” Congress has since voted to continue funding the project — albeit only with enough funds to allow the licensing process to continue .
As part of our ongoing series of quarantine - themed interviews , Nicola Twilley of Edible Geography and I spoke to Van Luik about the technical nature of nuclear waste storage and what it means , on the level of geological engineering , to quarantine a hazardous material for more than one million years . :
How did you start designing a project like Yucca Mountain , when you ’re dealing with such enormous timescales and geological complexity ? :
You start with a question : how do you perceive the need to isolate a material from the environment ?
I think most people would begin to answer that by looking at the nature of the material .
Wherever that material is currently , we make sure that there is either a thick wall or a deep layer of water to protect the people working around it .
That ’s what ’s being done at a reactor : when spent fuel comes out of a reactor , it ’s taken out remotely with no one present , and put into a water basin that ’s deep enough that there is no radioactive shine from the spent fuel escaping out of that water .
If the pool is getting full , after five years or so of cooling , then the utility company will take the material out of the pool — remotely manipulated from behind leaded - glass windows — and put it into dry storage .
Dry storage uses very thick steel and concrete .
And there it will sit until someone disposes of it , or until it ’s reprocessed .
Now , in most countries , what they have done next is asked :
What geology would be very good for isolating this material from the environment ?
And what geologies are available in our country ?
The Swedes have gone to their granites , because their whole country is basically underlain by granites .
The French looked at granites , salts , and clay , and decided to go with clay .
The Belgians and Dutch are looking at clay and salts ; and the Germans are looking at salts right now , but also at granites and clay .
The Swiss are looking at clay , mostly , although they did look at crystalline rock — meaning rock with large crystals , like granite , gabbros , and that kind of thing .
But they decided that , in their particular instance — since the Alps are still growing and slopes are not all that stable over hundreds of thousands of years — to look instead at their deep basins of clays close to the Rhine River as a repository location .
We ’re all looking to isolate this material for about a million years .
In the U.S. we did a sweep of the country , looked at all the available geologies , and we decided that we hadpossible sites .
We investigated some , which basically involved looking at what we knew from geological surveys of the states , and then we made a recommendation to go look at three of the possibilities in greater detail .
There was then a decision process : it went from nine sites , to five , to three .
At that point , Congress stepped in .
They started looking at the huge bills associated with site - specific studies — excavation is not cheap — and they said : let ’s just do one site and see if it ’s suitable .
If it is not , then we ’ll go back and see what else we can do .
So that ’s how Yucca Mountain , basically , was selected .
It was a cost - saving measure over the other two that were in the running for a repository .
Those were a bedded salt site in Texas and a basalt site — a deep volcanic rock site — in Washington State .
But all three were looked at , and all three were judged to be equally safe for the first 10,000 years — which , at that time , was the regulation .
Since the selection of Yucca Mountain , the regulation has been bumped up to a million years , which is pretty much where the rest of the world is looking : a million years of isolation .
Now , the reason that you want to isolate this material for a million years is that the spent fuel — meaning fuel that no longer supports the chain reaction that keeps reactors making electricity — contains actinides .
These are metal elements , from 90 to 103 on the Periodic Table , most of which are heavier than uranium ( which is 92 ) .
Actinides are generally very slow to radioactively decay into smaller atoms — which then decay more rapidly — and some of the actinides actually do remain hazardous for a million years and beyond .
The trick is to isolate them for that length of time .
At Yucca Mountain we took the attitude that , since we basically have a dry mountain in a dry area with very little rainfall , we would use a material that can stand up to oxygen being present .
The material we selected was a metal alloy called Alloy 22 .
Our design involves basically wrapping the stainless steel packages , in which we would receive the spent fuel , in Alloy 22 and sticking them inside this mountain with a layer of air over the top .
What we know is that when water moves through rock or fractured materials , it tends to stay in the rock rather than fall — unless that rock is saturated .
Yucca Mountain is unsaturated , so water ought not be a major issue for us at Yucca Mountain — yet it is .
We have to worry about future climates , because , right now in Nevada , we are in a nine year drought — and , basically since the last Ice Age , we have been in a 10,000 - year drought .
80 % of the time , if we look a million years into the past , we have , on average , twice the precipitation we have now .
Most of the past is — and the future will be — wetter and cooler .
Which is nice for Nevada !
[ In any case , we tried to take advantage of the natural setting , as well as take advantage of a metal that stands up very well to oxidizing conditions .
That is how , in our safety analyses , we showed that we are basically safe for well beyond a million years — we do exactly what we said we would do in that analysis .
Other countries have decided not to go in a similar direction to us .
The only other country that ’s contemplating a similar repository to ours is Mexico .
All the other countries in the world are looking at constructing something that is very — and under the water table .
If you go under the water table deep enough , there is no oxygen in the water , and if there is no oxygen than the solubility of a sizable number of the radionuclides is a non-problem .
Many are just not soluble unless there is oxygen in the water .
Going that deep then allows those countries to use a different set of materials , ones that last a long time when there is no oxygen present .
For example , the Swedes are using granite — so are the Finns , by the way , and the Canadians , though the Canadians might decide to go for clays .
With the granites , the older they are , the more fractured they are , and they ca n’t predict a million years into the future where the fracture zones are going to be .
So they have chosen a copper container for their spent fuel ; copper is thermodynamically stable in granite .
In fact , copper deposits naturally occur in granite .
They then wrap a very thick layer of bentonite clay around the container , which they put in dry .
When that clay gets wet , as it will do eventually , it expands .
When there is a fracture zone that is created by nature , the clay will basically decompress itself a little bit , fill the fracture zone , and you will still have a lot of protection from that clay layer .
It ’s a similar set up with salt or clay repositories , they eventually close up against the waste packages .
Nothing moves through clay or salt very rapidly .
Those are basically the three rock types that the whole world is looking at in terms of repositories .
So you can rely more on the engineered system or more on the natural system .
Either way , it ’s the combination of the two systems that allows you to predict , with relative security , that you ’re going to isolate a material for well over a million years .
By that time , the natural decay of the material that you ’ve hidden away has pretty much taken care of most of the risk .
In fact , by about half a million years , most of the spent fuel is less radioactive than the ore from which it was created .
That ’s a wonderful argument — but the spent fuel still is n’t safe at that point .
You still need to continue to isolate it , just as you do n’t want to live on top of uranium ore , either .
It ’s a dangerous material .
In a nutshell , that ’s our philosophy of containment . :
I ’m interested in how you go about testing these sorts of designs .
Do you actually build scale models , like the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ’ hydrological models , or do you rely on lab tests and computer simulations , given the timescale and complexity ? :
What we do is safety assessments that project safety out to a million years .
What I used to say to my troops , when I was a manager of this activity , was : “ Safety assessment without any underlying science is like a confession in church without a sin : without the one , you have nothing to say in the other .
” To collect the science needed to make credible projections of system safety , we have dug several miles of tunnels under this mountain ; we ’ve done lots of testing of how water can move through this mountain , if there was more water ; and we ’ve done testing of coupons of the materials that we want to use .
These tests were performed using solutions , temperature ranges , and oxygen concentrations that we think are representative over the whole range of what can be reasonably expected at Yucca Mountain .
Those kinds of physical tests we have done .
We have also utilized information from people who have taken spent fuel apart in some of our national laboratories and subjected it to leaching tests to see how it dissolves , how fast it dissolves , and what dissolves out of it .
We have done all of that kind of testing , and that ’s what forms the basis for our computer modeling .
One thing we have not done , and ca n’t do , is a mock - up of Yucca Mountain .
It just does n’t work that way .
It ’s too complicated , too large , and too long a time - scale .
In compensation for that spatial - and time - scale difficulty , what we have done is looked for similar localities with uranium deposits in them , like Peña Blanca , Mexico , just north of Chihuahua City .
There , we have rock very similar to Yucca Mountain ’s rock , and we have probably a 30 - million year old uranium deposit — quite a rich one — that was going to be mined until the price of uranium dropped considerably .
We ’ve studied that piece of real estate — it has roughly similar rock , sitting under similar conditions except for more summer rainfall — and we ’ve looked at the movement of radioactivity from that ore body .
From that we ’ve gained confidence that our computer modeling can pretty much mimic what was seen at that uranium site .
We ’ve looked for natural analogues of other possible conditions — for example , the climate at Yucca Mountain during an ice age .
We ’ve studied six or seven sites that mimic what we would see during a climate change here .
And , in terms of materials , there are some naturally occurring materials that have a passive coating on them .
We ’ve studied metals found in nature that are similar in the way they act to the metals that we are using for our waste packages .
So we have gone basically all through nature looking for analogous processes — but none are exact matches for Yucca Mountain .
It ’s going to need something more unique than that .
I think the same is true for every other repository being contemplated .
We have worked in cooperation with fourteen other countries through the European Commission ’s Research Directorate in Brussels , and the Nuclear Energy Agency in Paris , to compare notes on natural analogues and discuss what is useful and what is not for which concept .
All these countries are doing the same kind of thing : looking at natural occurrences that are hundreds of thousands , if not hundreds of millions , of years old .
In some cases , the natural analogues we ’ve studied areof years old .
We ’ve looked at the Oklo mining district in Gabon , Africa .
We studied several occurrences in that mining district where , for the last few million years , ore bodies have been subjected to oxidizing conditions , because uplift of the land brought them above the water table .
We ’ve looked at these natural reactor zones , which were active two billion years ago when the earth was much more radioactive than it is now , to see what we could learn about the movement of radioactivity in an oxidizing zone .
We can use that data for corroborating the modeling of Yucca Mountain .
On top of all that , we have the problem of unlikely volcanic events , as well as strong earth motions from equally unlikely seismic events , at Yucca Mountain .
These are problems you wo n’t have at most of the other repository sites being considered in the world .
To study that , we brought in expert groups with their own insights and models to evaluate what the chances are , from a risk perspective , of a volcanic event actually interrupting or disrupting the repository .
They also looked at the possibility of a very large ground motion adding stress and causing eventual failure of one or more of the waste packages .
Although volcanic events are highly unlikely — as are very large ground - motion events — they must be factored into our analyses , based on the likelihood of their occurring over a one - million year time span .
We have basically done all safety - evaluation analyses from the perspective of the things that could happen , given the nature of this geologic setting .
Looking at analogues for processes in nature has given us confidence that what we expect to see at Yucca Mountain is what we have seen nature produce elsewhere .
These are indirect lines of evidence that support us — but we have also made a lot of direct measurements and observations , as well as testing in laboratories of materials and processes , to make sure that we ’re on the right track .
The National Academy of Sciences has reviewed our research and our situation , and they ’ve agreed that we have predictability for about a million years .
That judgment influenced the EPA , who then gave us a standard for a million years :
Could you discuss the material selection process in more detail ?
I ’d like to hear how you found Alloy 22 , for example .
Also , when my wife and I visited Yucca Mountain a few years ago , we were given a black glass bead at the information center — what role does that glass play in the containment design ?
Finally , are the materials you ’ve chosen specifically engineered for the nuclear industry , or are these simply pre-existing materials that happen to have the requisite properties for nuclear containment ? :
No , the materials are not specifically engineered for the purpose of nuclear containment .
Let ’s look at Alloy 22 first .
We looked at the whole range of what is commercially available , in terms of pure metals and metal alloys .
We also looked at things like ceramic coatings .
There are some very , very hard ceramic coatings that , for example , are used on bearings for locomotives .
There are also ceramics that the military uses on projectiles to penetrate buildings .
There are some very good ceramic materials out there , but we had a problem with the predictability of very , very long - term behavior in ceramics .
That ’s why we decided to go with a metal ; a metal will fail by several different corrosion mechanisms , but not by the breakage that is typical of ceramics .
One of the things that the metals industry has been doing — for the paper - pulp industry , for example , which creates the worst possible chemical environment you can imagine — is that they have been developing more and more corrosion - resistant materials .
One of the top of the line of these corrosion - resistant materials was Alloy 22 .
We tested it alongside about six other candidates in experiments where we dripped water on them , we soaked them in water , and we had them half in and out of water , with varying solutions that we tailored for what we would expect in the mountain over time .
The one that stood out — the most reliable in all of these tests — was Alloy 22 .
The black glass that you saw is not something that the waste is wrapped in .
This material will be made at Hanford and maybe at Idaho , too — and at Savannah River they are making that black material right now .
It ’s an imitation volcanic glass — a borosilicate glass — in which radioactive materials are dispersed .
Material would be released from that if the waste package breaks , and if the material is touched by water or even water vapor .
It would then start to alter , and as it alters it would start to release the radioactivity inside .
So what you and your wife were looking at was basically a glass waste - form .
We do n’t make it here — that ’s how radioactive waste will be delivered to us from the Defense Department and Department of Energy .
We will receive it in huge containers , not as beads .
We also have little pellets of imitation spent fuel , similar to pencil lead in color , to show visitors what the fuel rods look like inside of a reactor .
The fuel rods are ceramic , coated on the outside with an alloy . :
Could you walk us through the planned process of loading the waste into the mountain , all the way up to the day you close the outer door ? : Sure .
The process , depending on whether Yucca Mountain ever goes through , politically speaking , will be as follows .
From the cooling pools or dry storage at the reactor , we ’ve asked the nuclear utility companies to put their spent fuel — or waste — into containers that we have designed and that we will supply to them .
The waste will be remotely taken out of whatever container it is in now , put into our containers , which are certified for shipping as well as disposal , and then we would slide those containers onto trains .
We want to use mostly trains — we try to avoid truck use .
Rail shipping containers currently in use are massive — some approaching two - hundred tons fully loaded .
The trains would bring the containers to us and then we would up - end them remotely and take the material out in a large open bay — all done remotely , again .
If it comes in the shipping cask that we have provided , we will be able to put it directly into the Alloy 22 and stainless steel waste package and weld it shut .
Then , with a transporter vehicle that ’s also remotely operated , we would take it underground and place it end - on - end , lying down in our repository drifts .
That ’s what we call the tunnels ; tunnels without an opening are called .
We would basically fill the drifts until we get to the entrance , put a door on , and then move on to the next one .
That ’s the basic scheme of how this would be done .
Everything is shielded , of course , so that people are not exposed to radiation ; workers are protected , as well as the public . :
How many containers could you fit inside a single drift , and how many drifts do you actually have in the mountain ? :
The drifts are each about 600 to 800 meters long .
They vary a little bit , depending on where they are in the mountain .
We will have 91 emplacement drifts — with an average of about 120 waste packages , set end - to - end , in each drift — to take care of the 70,000 metric tons that we are authorized to have .
If we receive authorization to havethan 70,000 metric tonnes , then we ’re prepared to go up to 125,000 metric tonnes of heavy metal .
That metric tonnage figure does n’t represent the total weight that goes into the mountain , by the way — it means that the containers have the equivalent of that many tonnes of uranium in them .
In other words , 70,000 metric tons is about 11,000 containers that weigh about ten metric tons each , so it ’s a huge amount of weight .
Each container contributes a significant amount of weight in itself : the steel and the Alloy 22 are very heavy .
In terms of what the repository would look like , if built , it would be a series of open tunnels , one after the other , with a bridging tunnel that allows the freight to be brought in on rail .
Everything is done remotely .
The 40 km of tunnels would all be filled up at some point , and then we would seal up the larger openings to the exterior , but leave everything else inside the mountain unsealed .
This is very different , by the way , from every other repository in the world , which would tightly compact material around the waste packages .
We want to leave air around the waste packages , because of our situation .
We have unsaturated water flow , rather than saturated flow , and as I ’ve mentioned , water does not like to fall into air out of rock — it would rather stay in the rock , unless it ’s saturated and under some degree of pressure ( such as from the weight of water above it ) .
So if we put something like bentonite clay around our packages , that would actually wick the water from the rock toward the waste packages — which is a silly thing to do if you ’re trying to take advantage of an unsaturated condition . :
What process have you designed for sealing the exterior door ?
Does that also require a uniquely secure set of material and formal choices ? :
Sealing the repository would n’t happen for at least 100 years , so what we have done at this point is basically left that decision for the future .
We have done a preliminary design , which uses a heavy concrete mixture — as well as rock rubble for a certain portion — to seal the exits from the main tunnel that goes around and feeds all the smaller tunnels .
The idea is that these openings have nothing to do with how the mountain itself functions , because the mountain is a vertical - flow system .
Coming in from the sides , as we are , has nothing to do with how the water behaves in the repository , or with the containment system we ’ve designed .
So we just want to block the side exits and make it very difficult for someone to reenter the mountain — to the point where they would basically be much better off reentering it by drilling a whole new entryway beside one of the old ones that ’s filled in .
Then there are going to be about seven vertical shafts for ventilation that will be sealed at the time of final closure .
Those will be filled to mimic the hydrological properties of the rock around them ; we do n’t want them to become preferred pathways of water , because thosepoint directly into the repository .
So there are two different closure schemes for the two different types of openings : three large entryways that will be completely sealed off to prevent reentry , and seven ventilation shafts that will be filled with materials that have been engineered to mimic the hydrological properties of the rock around it . :
And the ventilation shafts are required because the material is so hot ? :
Yes .
Once we put the waste in , we want to blow air over it by drawing in air from the bottom and blowing it out the top to take heat away until we shut off the vents for final closure .
The idea is to take enough heat out of the system so that , when we close it , it does n’t exceed our tolerances for temperature . :
Is there any chance that having such a large amount of heavy material at Yucca Mountain could actually pose a seismic risk for the region ? :
When we selected this particular location , we looked very carefully at faults .
But you ’re right : if you get beyond a certain amount of weight , as under a growing mountain range , you do start shifting things in the ground .
If you build something right on a fault line you can probably change the frequency of vibration at that location , and maybe aggravate the earthquake that ’s eventually going to happen .
However , even if we fill this repository to 125,000 metric tons , that is only something like .01 % of the weight of the mountain itself .
Plus , we are surrounded by two major faults , on both sides of the mountain , and even though there ’s movement occasionally on those faults , the block in the middle — where Yucca Mountain sits — is like a boat , riding very steadily .
It ’s been like that for the past twelve million years , so we do n’t see that it ’s going to change in the future .
That said , we are in an area that ’s moving all the time .
The entire area now is moving slowly to the northwest , and the basin and range here is still growing — the distance between Salt Lake and Sacramento is already twice what it was twelve million years ago , and they will continue to be pulled apart .
We ’re well aware of the consequences of basin and range growth , and the possibility that the faults Yucca Mountain is sitting next to could be active again in the future .
We factored that in .
In fact , it ’s those earthquakes that might actually lead to failures in the system that would allow something to come out before a million years — otherwise nothing would come out until beyond a million years .
But you ca n’t put enough weight in that mountain to change the tectonic regime in the area . :
Of course , once you have sealed the site , you face the challenge of keeping it away from future human contact .
How does one mark this location as a place precisely not to come to , for very distant future generations ? :
We have looked very closely at what WIPP is doing — the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico .
They did a study with futurists and other people — sociologists and language specialists .
They decided to come up with markers in seven languages , basically like a Rosetta Stone , with the idea that there will always be someone in the world who studies ancient languages , even 10,000 years from now , someone who will be able to resurrect what the meanings of these stelae are .
They will basically say , “ This is not a place of honor , do n’t dig here , this is not good material , ” etc .
What we have done is adapt that scheme to Yucca Mountain — but we have a different configuration .
WIPP is on a flat surface , and their repository is very deep underground ; we ’re basically inside a mountain with no resources that anybody would want to go after .
We will build large marker monuments , and also engrave these same types of warnings onto smaller pieces of rock and metal , and spread them around the area .
When people pick them up , they will think , “ — let ’s not go underground here .
” Now if people see these things and decide to go underground anyway , that becomes , not , intrusion — and we ca n’t protect against that , because there ’s no way to control the future .
All we ’re worried about is warning people so that , if they do take some action that ’s not in their best interest , they do so in the full knowledge of what they ’re getting into .
The markers that we ’re trying to make will be massive , and they will be made of materials that will last a long time — but they ’re just at the preliminary stage right now .
What I have been lobbying for with the international agencies , like the International Atomic Energy Agency and the Nuclear Energy Agency is that before anybody builds a repository , let ’s have world agreement on the basics of a marker system for everybody .
Whoever runs the future , tens of thousands of years from now , should n’t have to dig up one repository and see a completely different marker system somewhere else and then dig that up , too .
They should be able to learn from one not to go to the others .
Of course , there ’s also a little bit of fun involved here : what is the dominant species going to be in 10,000 years ?
And can you really mark something for a million years ?
What we have looked at , basically , is marking things for at least 10,000 years — and hopefully it will last even longer .
And if this information is important to whatever societies are around at that time , if they have any intelligence at all , they will renew these monuments . :
What kinds of projects might you work on after Yucca Mountain ?
In other words , could you apply your skills and a similar design process to different containment projects , such as carbon sequestration ? :
I think so — if we ever get serious about carbon sequestration .
I do n’t know if you know this , but we laid off a lot of people here because there were budget cuts , and many of those people , because of the experience they had with modeling underground processes , are now working on carbon sequestration schemes for the energy sector and the Department of Energy .
No matter what happens to Yucca Mountain — whether it goes through or not — dealing with spent fuel and other nuclear waste will still be a problem , and that ’s the charter that was given to our office .
What I ’m hoping is that , as soon as Yucca Mountain gets completely killed or gets the go - ahead , I can go back to what I loved doing in the past , which was to look at selecting sites for future repositories .
One repository wo n’t be enough for all time ; it will be enough for maybe a hundred years , at the very most .
You have to plan ahead .
As long as you create the nuclear waste , you need to have a place to put it .
Even if you reprocess it — even if you build fast reactors and basically burn the actinides into fission products so that they only have to be isolated for 500 years rather than a million — you still have to have a place to put that material .
Even if we can build repositories less and less frequently , we will still be creating waste that needs to be isolated from the environment . :
You mentioned that your favorite pastime was looking for repository sites .
If you had the pick of the earth , is there a location that you genuinely think is perfect for these types of repositories , and where might that location be ? :
My ideal repository location has changed over time .
When I worked on crystalline rock , like granites , I thought crystalline rock was the cat ’s meow .
When I worked for a short time in salt , I thought salt was the perfect medium .
Now that I have worked with the European countries and Japan for the past twenty - five years , learning of their studies of various repository locations , I ’m beginning to think that claystone is probably the ideal medium .
In the U.S. , I would go either to North or South Dakota and look for the Pierre Shale , where it grades into clay : there , you get the best of both worlds .
I have been quoted by MSNBC , much to the chagrin of my bosses , saying that , if I were to get the pick of where we go next , that ’s where I would go .
They really did n’t like that — I was supposed to praise the Yucca Mountain site .
But let ’s get real : Yucca Mountain was chosen by Congress .
We have shown that it ’s safe , if we do what we say in terms of the engineered system .
But it was not chosen to be the most optimal of all optimal sites , the site - comparison approach was taken off the table by Congress .
As long as a chosen site and its system are safe , however , that is good enough .
Our predicted performance for Yucca Mountain , lined up to what the French are projecting for their repository in clay , and next to what the Swedes are projecting for their repository in granite , shows about the same outcome , over a million years , in terms of potential doses to a hypothetical individual .
We ’re safe as anybody can be — which is what our charter requires .
We told Congress in 2002 that , yes , it can it be done safely here — but it ’s going to cost you , and that cost is in Alloy 22 and stainless steel .
Congress said OK and it became public law . :
Are any countries actually using their repositories yet ? :
They ’re getting very close to licensing in Finland and Sweden .
Those are going to be the first two .
We have a firm site selection in France , which means that they ’ll be going into licensing soon .
Licensing takes several years in every country .
In fact , in licensing now , except we had a change of administration and they ’ve decided that they really do n’t want to do Yucca Mountain anymore .
They want to do something else .
They have every right to make those kind of policy decisions — so here we are .
No one is actually loading high - level waste or spent nuclear fuel into a repository yet .
We have our own repository working with transuranic waste from the Defense program , in New Mexico , and both the Swedes and the Finns have medium - level waste sites , which are basically geological disposal sites , that have been active for over a decade .
The Swedes and Finns have a lot of experience building repositories underground , and their situation is interesting .
The Swedes are building a repository under the Baltic Sea , but in granites that they can get to from dry land .
When there is a future climate change , however , there ’s going to be a period when the repository area will be farmable ; it will be former ocean - bottom that is now on the surface .
Their scenario is that , at the end of the next ice age , you might actually get a farmer who drills a water - well right above the repository .
The Finns actually have a very pragmatic attitude to this .
They have regulations that basically cover the entire future span , out to a very long time period — but they also say that , once the ice has built up again and covered Finland , it wo n’t be Finland .
No one will live there .
But it does n’t matter whether anyone lives there or not : you still have to provide a system that ’s safe for whoever ’s going to be there when the ice retreats .
We —as in the whole world — need to take these future scenarios quite seriously .
And these are very interesting things to think about — things that , in normal industrial practice , you never even consider .
The repository program in England , meanwhile , went belly - up — because of regulatory issues , mostly — but it ’s coming back , and it ’s probably going to come back to exactly the same place as it was before .
That ’s a sedimentary - metamorphosed hard - rock rock site at Sellafield , right by the production facility .
No transportation will be involved , to speak of .
That ’s not a bad idea , but they had to prove that the rock was good .
The planning authority rejected their proposal the first time , so they dissolved the whole waste management company and now the government is going to take over the project ; it ’s not going to be private anymore .
In the end , the government takes over this kind of stuff in most places because the long - term implications go way beyond the lifetime of one corporation .
If there ’s any country that ’s setting a good example for waste disposal , it ’s Germany .
They ’re the only country I know of who have the same kind of regulations forwaste andwaste as they do forwaste .
There are two or three working geological repositories for chemical waste in Germany , and they have been working for a very long time .
They ’re the only ones in the world .
The chemical industry in the U.S. has basically said , no , no , do n’t go there !
[ But I think Germany is right : if one thing needs to be isolated because it ’s dangerous , then the other thing — thatdecays and is also dangerous — needs to be treated in the same way .
The EPA does have a standard for deep - well injection of hazardous waste — they have a 10,000 - year requirement for no return to the surface .
That was comparable to what we had here , until the standard for Yucca Mountain got bumped up to a million years by Congress .
But with some chemicals , regulations only require a few hundred years of isolation — that ’s all .
Those things do n’t decay , so that does n’t make sense to me .
Anyway , I applaud Germany for their gumption — and they ’re very dependent on their chemical industry for income .
It ’s not like they ’re trying to torpedo their industry .
They ’re just saying : you have to do this This autumn in New York City , Edible Geography and BLDGBLOG have teamed up to lead an 8 - week design studio focusing on the spatial implications of quarantine ; you can read more about it here .
For our studio participants , we have been assembling a coursepack full of original content and interviews — but we decided that we should make this material available to everyone so that even those people who are not in New York City , and not enrolled in the quarantine studio , can follow along , offer commentary , and even be inspired to pursue projects of their own .

When I was last in Costa Rica , I was on the lookout , as usual , for interesting things .
And I found plenty of them : sloths , leaf cutter ants , poison dart frogs , volcanoes , and so on .
I was not , however , on the lookout for lawn ornaments , under the assumption that decorative stone sculptures were not particularly interesting .
I should have known better than to make such an assumption — after all , I saw Amélie , which cast an entirely new light on garden gnomes .
Shortly before the end of my trip , a fellow tourist asked me if I knew about the stone balls .
“ What stone balls ? ” I asked .
“ There are these mysterious ancient balls , ” he said , “ that are so perfectly round , they could not have been carved by hand .
Nobody knows where they came from or how they were made , but they ’re scattered all over the country , and people like to find them and use them as lawn ornaments . ”
Sure enough , as we drove along , I spotted stone balls in a few yards , but I did n’t have a chance to photograph one .
It seemed strange to me that artifacts with such obvious archeological significance would end up as the Costa Rican equivalent of plastic pink flamingos .
Rolling With the Bunches
The first discovery of the unusual stone balls was made around 1940 .
The United Fruit Company was preparing large tracts of land in the Diquis Delta on the southern Pacific coast to be used for banana plantations .
In the process of clearing the land , they unearthed several dozen balls , ranging in size from a few centimeters to over two meters in diameter .
Subsequent archeological research identified and catalogued hundreds of the balls , some of which appeared in other parts of the country .
As news of the find began to spread , the balls were rounded up ( sorry ) by collectors and treasure hunters ; today , only six are known to remain in their original positions .
No one knows exactly how old the balls are , because Costa Rica had no recorded history before 1502 , when Columbus arrived there on his fourth transatlantic voyage .
Archeologists have made educated guesses by dating pottery and other artifacts found near the balls or buried at a similar depth .
Assuming the balls were made at about the same time as the surrounding objects , they could have been carved anywhere between 200 and 1500 CE , with most estimates in the range of 800 to 1200 CE .
So they ’re old , but not that old — unlike , say , the pyramids or Stonehenge .
Most of the balls are made of a hard , volcanic stone called granodiorite , though a few are composed of coquina , a type of limestone .
The quarry from which the granodiorite came is located in the Talamanca mountain range , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) from the area where the balls were located .
This discovery of course led to speculation as to how such massive stones could have been moved such a long distance without modern transportation .
I see no mystery here ; spherical objects have been known to roll rather readily , especially downhill ; presumably they were carved before being moved .
There are , however , two very interesting questions about the balls :
How were they made , and why ?
Round , Round , Get Around
There ’s nothing particularly tricky about carving stone ; many ancient cultures all over the world made complex statues .
But according to some accounts , these spheres are so perfectly round that not even modern equipment could have produced something with such precise tolerances .
This seems to imply either a lost technology , or — as some have predictably conjectured — help from aliens .
These claims of perfection have some problems , however .
For one thing , few of the balls have actually been measured with any precision , and in some cases , measurements that appeared to be mysteriously perfect were made on only a portion of a partially buried ball .
For another thing , many of the balls have been subjected to centuries of wear and erosion from sunlight , wind , and rain , so no meaningful statements can be made about how round they might once have been .
And even the best specimens have ( and probably always had ) rough surfaces , making truly precise measurement a lost cause .
That said , it is certainly true that at least some of the balls , having been preserved nicely over the years by layers of soil , are surprisingly round .
This fact , interesting though it may be , does not require a belief in extraterrestrials .
Geologists have noted that when granodiorite is heated and then quickly cooled , a thin layer of stone comes off in flakes .
It ’s simple enough to pile some hot coals under a rock and then splash some cold water on it .
If this procedure is performed repeatedly and with care , a fair approximation of a sphere can result .
The stones could then have been chiseled or ground to a more perfect ball shape using simple guides fashioned from wood or even rope .
It would have been difficult and tedious , for sure , and would have required a fair amount of mathematical sophistication on the part of the carvers .
Thus the precision is interesting — perhaps even astonishing — but not unbelievable .
My , What Big… Ornaments You Have
The only real mystery , then — and it ’s a doozy — is why so many of these extraordinary sculptures were created .
Dozens of reasons have been advanced , but in the absence of written records , there ’s no way to say for sure .
One popular theory is that they were used as markers of some sort — as signposts , celestial references , or indicators of property lines .
Unfortunately , if this was indeed the case , we ’ll never know , since nearly all the stones have been moved from their original positions .
Some people believe the stones functioned as antennae in an ancient power grid , or that they were part of a receiver for alien communications .
Or they may have had ceremonial significance in religious rituals .
My favorite theory , however , is the one that says they were created as status symbols .
In other words , they were in fact designed to be the lawn ornaments they now are .
Besides the fact that most of the spheres have lost any positional meaning they may once have had , many have been damaged by agricultural machinery , worn away by the elements , or even destroyed by people who believed a popular myth that gold was hidden inside them .
So they are , in a sense , yet another addition to Costa Rica ’s endangered species list .
