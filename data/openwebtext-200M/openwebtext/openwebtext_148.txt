SLAVERY divided not only the United States , but also its churches .
The Methodists , Presbyterians , Baptists and others all split North from South , and some did not reunite for more than 100 years .
Others , like the Southern Baptist Convention , never did .
Now some of these same churches are facing a rift over homosexuality that is proving more intractable than any social issue since slavery .
It is not an explosion , but a slow burn that has been smoldering in some denominations for about 30 years — longer than the battle over women ’s ordination .
Women won those battles in mainline Protestant churches , and though the churches bled some members , they stayed largely intact .
But it is far from clear whether the strife over homosexuality will end the same way .
That is why all eyes are now on the Episcopal Church .
With 2.3 million members , it is only the 15th - largest in the United States , but it is a venerable , wealthy institution that has produced one out of four United States presidents , the Washington National Cathedral — and a civil war over homosexuality that has brought it closer to schism than any other church .
Last week , Episcopalians were handed an ultimatum by the top leaders in the Anglican Communion : stop authorizing blessings of gay couples and ordaining gay bishops — or face banishment from the Communion .
They were given until Sept. 30 to decide .
The Presbyterians , Lutherans and Methodists have also had battles over homosexuality , but the conflict in the Episcopalian Church is magnified because it is playing out on an international stage .
The Episcopal Church is a member of the Anglican Communion , a global affiliation of 38 member churches that grew out of the Church of England .
The Communion claims a membership of 77 million — making it the world ’s third - largest church body after the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches .
Friends ,
It is far too early to be thinking about elections , but they are being forced upon us and legitimate issues are being pushed from the headlines …
… like Lindsay … Paris ? … or was it Brittany this week ?
Anyway …
I encourage everyone to work with the Green Party at every turn and support their ( our ) every step .
The Green Party represents the highest principles and ideals that we should all be striving toward .
I am a registered Democrat as that has been the best way to challenge , confront and dis-empower the NeoCon stranglehold on our nation , but when a viable Green OR Progressive Democratic candidate emerges in any election , help get them elected .
Blind party loyalty is a mental illness .
It is a disease .
When the principled Progressive faction of the Democratic Party presents a legitimate people ’s candidate such as in my home state of Minnesota : Keith Ellison , Becky Lourey or Jack Nelson - Pallmeyer – GREAT !
Support that candidate .
What I cannot abide is supporting the “ lesser of two evils ” candidate from the outset because “ the Green Candidate does n’t have chance ” .
That is how we wind up with two virtually indistinguishable Minnesota Senators dedicatedly voting to perpetually fund this illegal , immoral and endless “ War on Terror ” Military Industrial Complex construct .
Now is the time – while party platforms are being formed and candidates are feeling their way based upon what WE COMMUNICATE TO THEM AS OUR EXPECTATIONS – to insist that candidates such as Mike Ceresi and Al Franken NOT COMPROMISE and stand strongly for the very highest values and principles that we want them to uphold .
This is NOT the time to declare unquestioning and unbending allegiance to a candidate and get that bumper sticker on your car .
That is lazy politics – the candidates have n’t even fully defined their platforms yet .
I strongly encourage supporting candidates according to the highest values of your conscience all along and then voting strategically in the polls …
There is no difference between the Green Party and what is best about the Democratic Party ( people before profits , the health of children over and above corporate rights ) .
Unfortunately , there is also no difference between the Republican Party and what is the worst about the Democratic Party – especially at the national level ( corporate sell - outs in many cases , not representing the people , putting political expediency over what is best for our nation and our children ’s future ) .
Now is the time for me , when the DFL is calling for financial and other support , to make perfectly clear that I will not support ANY candidate from ANY party that is asking me to support them in their quest to win an election and gain the privilege to swear the oath to “ support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign AND DOMESTIC ” when they have n’t even taken a moderately strong stand against confirmed domestic enemies to the Constitution : Dick Cheney , George W. Bush , Alberto Gonzales , et al .
I confronted Minnesota Senatorial candidate Al Franken about this at the Pride Festival .
I like Al , but Al is not ready to swear that oath .
Hopefully that will change – but only if we do not accept anything less from him .
Al will be as good a Senator as we insist that he be if elected .
Support for any candidate absolutely MUST be conditional at this point or we are contributing to the disconnect between elected officials and their constituents .
All of our political support must be conditional or else we are simply ‘ brownshirts ’ and ‘ yes men ’ on the other side of the aisle .
Pick your candidate now unconditionally and you might as well sign them over to special interests and corporate lobbyists as you are giving them carte blanche to do and be whomever they might be influenced to become while in office .
Why should I trust those who do n’t hold these White House criminals fully accountable to their oath to be put in a position to swear the same or similar oath ?
If you as a candidate do not support impeachment , then you are not ready to take that oath and you will not get my support , financial , volunteer or otherwise .
Whether impeachment happens or not , it is most certainly justified and absolutely in the best interests of the nation , and thus support for it is a litmus test for the political awareness and integrity of Democratic candidates .
We have enough sold - out and otherwise compromised ‘ public servants ’ , we most certainly do n’t need to aid and abet getting more elected .

Concerned about dissenters who want to hand this nation over to the terrorists by stopping the war ?
Worried that Democrats and disaffected Republicans will impeach the President and end torture as we know it ?
Patriots for Corporate Rights invites you to join up with other concerned citizens on Friday , February 9th , between 4:00 and 7:00 p.m .
We will gather in Minneapolis at Lagoon & Hennepin , Uptown ( in front of the library ) , to celebrate our nation ’s willingness to go to war and to torture people in order to preserve freedom here and abroad .
Bring a sign or a friend .
Be a part of the movement opposing dissent in our nation !
The following rally is a tactic .
The idea is to get people to wake up and see the ridiculousness of supporting war and torture , which is what they are inadvertently doing by being complacent .
It becomes harder to put the fact that our nation is actually torturing people out of your mind when there are people standing up in defense of the right to do it .
And if the population is n’t outraged when they see us , media reports on the lack of that outrage can be an effective way of getting our message across as well .
We ’re betting that signs like “ Dissent is unpatriotic , ”  “ 3,000 Soldiers is worth it ” and “ War is good for business ”  will show the true colors of Bush and his supporters .
This kind of dissent is in the tradition of groups like The Yes Men ( http://www.theyesmen.org/).
This could motivate progressive thinkers who might otherwise have stayed at home to take action , make people sitting on the fence think about the issue and realize how ridiculous pro-Bush people are being , and give us more media attention , as the media is fairly accustomed to anti-war protests .
Reactions to news of our rally ?
“ i agree .
i mean , they behead us on tv and declare their unwavering hate and lust for killing americans .
if it saves innocent american lives , i’m not opposed to torturing some bad guys . ”

HONG KONG ( Reuters ) - A Hong Kong woman who blinded her boyfriend in one eye in a fight six years ago has been jailed for jabbing a chopstick into his other eye , a newspaper reported on Wednesday .
Last November , Po Shiu-fong , 58 , accused long - time boyfriend Kwok Wai-ming , 49 , of having an affair , the South China Morning Post reported .
During the row ,
Po stabbed a plastic chopstick into his left eye , which she had already blinded six years ago when she poked it with her finger .
“ Po became hysterical when she saw the wound and mopped it with a towel .
The pair then went to bed , ” the paper said .
“ The next morning they had another argument in which she grabbed a chopstick and stabbed Kwok ’s right eye , ” it said .
Two days later , he sought medical treatment and filed a police report against Po , whom he had dated since 1993 .
The paper said he did n’t report the attack six years ago , telling the court his silence was “ a love sacrifice . ”
Kwok lost 10 to 20 percent vision in his right eye , the paper said .
Po was jailed for six months on Tuesday .
“ If I forgive her , God would not forgive me , ” the paper quoted Kwok as saying .
“ No matter what , nothing could compensate for the loss of my eye . ”
Claim :
Water boiled in a microwave oven can suddenly “ explode . ”
TRUE
Example : [ Collected via e-mail , 1999 ]
Microwaving Water to Heat it Up Microwaving Water to Heat it Up I feel that the following is information that any one who uses a microwave oven to heat water should be made aware of .
About five days ago my 26 - year old son decided to have a cup of instant coffee .
He took a cup of water and put it in the microwave to heat it up ( something that he had done numerous times before ) .
I am not sure how long he set the timer for but he told me he wanted to bring the water to a boil .
When the timer shut the oven off , he removed the cup from the oven .
As he looked into the cup he noted that the water was not boiling but instantly the water in the cup “ blew up ” into his face .
The cup remained intact until he threw it out of his hand but all the water had flew out into his face due to the buildup of energy .
His whole face is blistered and he has 1st and 2nd degree burns to his face which may leave scarring .
He also may have lost partial sight in his left eye .
While at the hospital , the doctor who was attending to him stated that this a fairly common occurrence and water ( alone ) should never be heated in a microwave oven .
If water is heated in this manner , something should be placed in the cup to diffuse the energy such as a wooden stir stick , tea bag , etc .
It is however a much safer choice to boil the water in a tea kettle .
Please pass this information on to friends and family .
Origins : Exploding water ?
In a nutshell ,
yes , water can “ explode ” in the fashion described above .
However , it takes near perfect conditions to bring this about , thus “ exploding water ” is not something the average hot beverage drinker who would otherwise now be eyeing his microwave with trepidation need fear .
Odds are , you ’ll go through life without ever viewing this phenomenon first - hand , and if you ’re one of the rare few who does get to see it , you will likely not be harmed by the experience ( that would take your standing right over the cup at the instant it happened , and the liquid ’s bolting up and hitting your skin ) .
The Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) has advised consumers :
This type of phenomenon occurs if water is heated in a clean cup .
If foreign materials such as instant coffee or sugar are added before heating , the risk is greatly reduced .
If superheating has occurred , a slight disturbance or movement such as picking up the cup , or pouring in a spoon full of instant coffee , may result in a violent eruption with the boiling water exploding out of the cup .

If superheating has occurred , a slight disturbance or movement such as picking up the cup , or pouring in a spoon full of instant coffee , may result in a violent eruption with the boiling water exploding out of the cup .
What Can Consumers Do to Avoid Super - Heated Water ?
Follow the precautions and recommendations found in the microwave oven instruction manuals , specifically the heating time .
Do not use excessive amounts of time when heating water or liquids in the microwave oven .
Determine the best time setting to heat the water just to the desired temperature and use that time setting regularly .
The e-mailed warning quoted above a model of non-specificity ( no names , date , or locale ; only the detail that the “ victim ” was 26 years old , presumably to enforce the idea that this accident could not be blamed on a child ’s typical lack of caution ) , leaving us able to address only its theoretical aspects .
Nearly every science writer who has tackled the topic notes that the “ severe superheating ” phenomenon is real but likely not nearly as common as the message cited above might make it sound .
In an article for New Scientist , Richard Barton wrote :
A portion of the water in the cup is becoming superheated — the liquid temperature is actually slightly above the boiling point , where it would normally form a gas .
In this case , the boiling is hindered by a lack of nucleation sites needed to form the bubbles . . .
I imagine that by keeping the cup still and microwaving for a long time , one could blow the entire contents of the cup into the interior of the microwave as soon as you introduced any nucleation sites .
It is this sometimes explosive rate of steam production that means you should take great care when using a microwave oven .
From the How Everything Works web site :
Glass containers are clearly the most likely to superheat water because their surfaces are essentially perfect .
Glasses have the characteristics of frozen liquids and a glass surface is as smooth as… well , glass .
When you overheat water in a clean glass measuring cup , your chances of superheating it at least mildly are surprisingly high .
The spontaneous bubbling that occurs when you add sugar , coffee powder , or a teabag to microwave - heated water is the result of such mild superheating .
Fortunately , severe superheating is much less common because defects , dirt , or other impurities usually help the water boil before it becomes truly dangerous .
That ’s why most of us avoid serious injuries .
From the Unwise Microwave Oven Experiments article :
Things are different in a microwave oven .
The water gets hot but the container usually does not .
There are no “ boiling - bubbles ” triggered by a hot metal pot .
Without those bubbles to cool it , the temperature of the water rises far higher than 100C° .
We call this “ superheated water . ”
Superheated water is just waiting for some sort of trigger which will let bubbles form and allow boiling to commence .
If the water becomes hot enough , a few bubbles will appear , but these quickly rise and burst , and the water is n’t cooled much at all .
In the microwave oven , even if your mug of water is bubbling slightly , do n’t trust it , since it ’s temperature has risen so high above 100 C° that bubbles are appearing spontaneously .
If some unwitting victim should pour a soluble powder into the superheated water , this will carry thousands of tiny air bubbles into the water .
Each of these micro bubbles expands into a 1 cm steam bubble , and the result is a huge “ explosion ” of hot froth .
It ’s just like dumping ice cream into root beer , but the froth can be so violent that the hot water sprays into the air .
If you ’re worried about explosions over superheated liquid , you can virtually eliminate the possibility of its happening to you by simply leaving some non-metallic object ( such as a wooden spoon or stir stick ) in the cup or bowl when you boil liquids in your microwave .
It may not be necessary , but it wo n’t hurt anything either .
Peace of mind rarely comes so cheaply .

Even by astronomical standards , Roger Angel thinks big .
Angel , a leading astronomer at the University of Arizona , is proposing an enormous liquid - mirror telescope on the moon that could be hundreds of times more sensitive than the Hubble Space Telescope .
Using a rotating dish of reflective liquid as its primary mirror , Angel 's telescope would the largest ever built , and would permit astronomers to study the oldest and most distant objects in the universe , including the very first stars .
" It 's an idea that 's been around , and we decided to flesh it out , " Angel says .
Angel , a member of the National Academy of Sciences , a MacArthur Fellow and a Fellow of the Royal Society , is currently concluding a study to determine the feasibility of constructing a lunar liquid mirror telescope , or LMT , for NASA Institute for Advanced Concepts , an NASA - funded space think tank .
LMT's have been built on Earth – the Large Zenith Telescope in British Columbia is the third largest telescope in North America – but the moon 's low gravity and lack of atmosphere would allow for a truly gigantic instrument .
Angel dreams of a 100 - meter mirror , which would be larger than two side - by - side football fields and would collect 1,736 times more light than the Hubble .
Even a 20 - meter instrument , which is more likely in the near term , would be 70 times more sensitive than the Hubble and could detect objects 100 times fainter than those that will be seen with the James Webb Space Telescope , a next - generation orbiting observatory scheduled for launch in 2013 .
" At first , it sort of sounds like a crazy idea , " says Paul Hickson of the University of British Columbia , one of two Canadian LMT experts who collaborated with Angel on the study .
" But when you go through it in some detail , you realize it could actually work . "
NIAC director Bob Cassanova agrees .
" It 's quite feasible , " he says .
" The debate about this is about some of the details . "
The biggest advantage is the relative low cost .
Liquid telescopes cost 10 to 20 times less to build than polished aluminum mirrors of similar size , in part because they need n't be engineered to the same tolerances .
And even the largest liquid mirrors do n't require the sophisticated support structures that are needed to prevent solid ones from sagging under their own weight .
" The forces of nature conspire to give them the right shape , " Borra says .
Although the final cost of the project is yet to be determined , a 20 - meter lunar LMT ought to be a bargain in comparison to the James Webb Space Telescope , which is expected to carry a $ 4.5 billion price tag .
It would also make the JWST look like a child 's spyglass .
" There 's very good science to be done , and you 're not going to make a telescope of that size and sensitivity in space without spending an ungodly sum of money , " Angel says .
There are many advantages to building a deep - space telescope on the moon .
A lunar LMT would be free from the atmospheric distortion that afflicts terrestrial telescopes of all kinds , and from the self - generated winds that produce troublesome waves in the largest earth - based LMTs .
The light from the universe 's most distant stars is intensely red-shifted , and the airless lunar deep - freeze would be ideal for infrared observation – as would a liquid mirror :
While they perform as well as conventional mirrors at visible wavelengths , liquid mirrors do even better in the infrared .
Alas , the same low temperatures that would facilitate infrared observation would also turn mercury , the liquid used in terrestrial LMTs , into a solid .
So the greatest technical challenge for Angel 's team lies in finding reflective liquids with low freezing points and vapor pressures – liquids that would neither freeze nor evaporate into space .
That task fell to Ermanno Borra , a physicist and liquid - mirror pioneer at Laval University in Quebec who first made the case for a lunar LMT in 1991 .
Recently , Borra has been experimenting with metal liquid - like films , or MELFFs , that reflect light as effectively as aluminum .
Borra declined to comment on his results until they 've been published in the journal Nature later this summer .
But his teammates were impressed .
" It looks very promising , " Hickson says .
Borra 's MELFFs are new , but liquid mirrors have been around for a while .
Sir Isaac Newton first recognized that gravity and centrifugal force would cause a rotating liquid to assume a parabolic shape .
In 1850 , Italian astronomer Ernesto Capocci suggested that a spinning dish of mercury could serve as the primary mirror in a telescope .
And the American physicist Robert W. Wood built several working mercury - mirror telescopes in the early 1900s .
Still , the earliest LMTs were beset with problems .
They could n't maintain stable rotation speeds , and their crude bearings caused the mirrors to vibrate .
And since liquid mirrors cannot be tilted in order to track objects as they move across the sky , early efforts at liquid - mirror astrophotography generated streaks of light that quickly exited the field of view .
( While fixed pointing precludes some kinds of astronomical work , it does n't interfere with studies of the most distant stars and galaxies .
thanks to the homogeneous and isotropropic nature of the universe , these objects are found wherever one might look . )
In recent years , however , Borra and Hickson have overcome these obstacles .
Ultra -smooth air bearings and synchronous motors governed by crystal oscillators and optical sensors eliminated the vibration and unstable rotation that plagued early LMTs .
( Air bearings would n't work on the moon , so Angel proposes using superconductor magnetic bearings instead . )
The tracking problem was solved with a technique called drift - scanning , in the rotation of the moon is taken into account by software .
Digitization also allows images from many nights ' observation to be combined , resulting in extremely long cumulative exposure times .
With Borra 's help , Hickson built the < a href = " http://www.astro.ubc.ca/lmt/lzt/gallery.html "
>
Large Zenith Telescope , a 6 - meter LMT that is now the third largest telescope in North America .
Hickson is currently working on a plan to build an 8 - meter instrument in Chile .
Borra and Hickson 's success , coupled with the Bush Administration 's renewed commitment to sending manned missions to the moon , caught Angel 's attention .
" We understand how to do these things .
It 's really a question of funding , " Cassanova says .
And despite the technical viability of a lunar LMT , he doubts any money will be spent until more progress is made on sending human beings back to the moon .
A relatively small lunar LMT could be deployed robotically , its rotating dish unfurling like an umbrella .
But building a 20 - meter or 100 - meter instrument would require human hands .
" Without a return to the moon , it 's unlikely people would be interested in putting that much money into it , " Angel says .

Apex would spend three years studying the space rock
More details
The 300 m - wide ( 980 ft ) rock , known as Apophis , will fly past Earth in April 2029 at a distance that is closer than many communications satellites .
Astrium , based in Stevenage , Herts , wants a probe to track the asteroid so its orbit can be better understood .
The concept will compete for a $ 50,000 ( £ 25,000 ) Planetary Society prize , but a full mission would cost millions .
The British design calls for a small , remote - sensing spacecraft , dubbed Apex ( Apophis Explorer ) , which could rendezvous with Apophis in January 2014 .
It would then spend the next three years tracking the rock , sending data back to Earth about the object 's size , shape , spin , composition and temperature .
From this information , orbit modelling would enable a more accurate prediction of the risk of any future collision .
Astrium says that if its concept won the prize , it would donate the money to charity .
" The real prize for us would be if the European or US space agencies thought there was merit in our proposal and asked us to carry the feasibility study forward , " said Dr Mike Healy , the company 's space science director .
A full mission would be expected to cost about $ 500 m ( £ 250 m ) dollars to develop , launch and operate .
Early warning
Apophis caused some consternation in 2004 when initial observations suggested there was an outside chance it might hit Earth in 2029 .
Further study by ground - based telescopes indicated there was virtually no possibility of this happening , and the expectation is that the object will whiz past the Earth at a close but comfortable distance of just under 36,000 km ( 22,400 miles ) .
APOPHIS - SPACE ROCK Orbits the Sun every 324 days , crossing Earth 's orbit twice Not spherical , diameter of 300 m ; a mass of 27 m tonnes Name : Ancient Egyptian god Apep ( ' The Destroyer ' )
Discovery :
In 2004 by a University of Hawaii team
However , there is always some uncertainty associated with an asteroid 's orbit .
One reason is the Yarkovsky effect .
This describes what happens when an asteroid radiates energy absorbed from the Sun back into space .
Releasing heat in one direction nudges the object in the opposite direction .
The resulting acceleration is tiny , but over the centuries acts like a weak rocket and could make the difference between a hit or a miss in some circumstances .
The close encounter with Earth in 2029 will also perturb Apophis ' orbit gravitationally .
A mission like Apex to track and study the rock would help reduce uncertainties and give solid predictions about the rock 's course long into the future .
Political support
At the moment , scientists stress Apophis is not thought to be a serious danger to Earth .
But were such a rock to hit the planet , it could cause devastation on a country - wide scale , leading possibly to the deaths of many millions of people .
An Apophis - like object striking at about 20 km /s ( 45,000 mph ) would gouge a crater 5 km ( three miles ) wide .
Even standing 30 km ( 18 miles ) away from the impact site , a thermal blast would ignite your clothes and the ground would shudder with an earthquake measuring more than six on the Richter Scale .
The dinosaurs are thought to have suffered in a space impact
Given sufficient warning , though , a potential impactor could be deflected out of Earth 's path , scientists believe .
Some have suggested such a rock might be nudged on to a safe trajectory by hitting it with a small mass .
Others have proposed flying a spacecraft next to the object , to use gravity to tug the asteroid clear of the planet .
The issue of asteroid or comet strikes is a topical one as researchers continue to gather more information about their frequency during Earth history .
At least one of the planet 's mass extinction events - which included the demise of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago - has been attributed to the impact of a large space object .
Liberal Democrat MP
Lembit Opik has campaigned for the research area to be given more funding .
His grandfather , renowned Estonian astronomer Ernst Opik , did much to raise science 's understanding of Earth - crossing comets and asteroids .
The politician told the BBC News website : " The question is n't whether Earth is hit by an asteroid - it is when .
" Good luck to Astrium ; they are showing that if we have the political will , we certainly have the technical know - how to do something about threatening objects . "
The US - based Planetary Society has organised its competition in co-operation with the European Space Agency ( Esa ) , the US space agency ( Nasa ) , the Association of Space Explorers ( ASE ) , the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics ( AIAA ) , and the Universities Space Research Association ( USRA ) .
The winning entry will be submitted to space agencies to see if they want to carry the ideas through .
Cheney impeachment bill gains yet another co-sponsor Nick Juliano

Get breaking politics headlines with RSS .
On Tuesday , a northern Virginia Democrat decided to add his support to a growing movement in the House of Representatives to impeach Vice President Dick Cheney .
A spokesman for Rep. Jim Moran told RAW STORY that the congressman had decided to co-sponsor the impeachment bill introduced in April by Rep. Dennis Kucinich , D - Ohio .
When he announced the bill , Kucinich , who is currently seeking the Democratic nomination for president , said that he would n't push his fellow lawmakers to sign on .
But the bill has gradually gained support since then , garnering at least 10 co-sponsors , including Moran , according to the Library of Congress .
AfterDowningStreet.org lists 12 co-sponsors to the impeach - Cheney bill .
Despite vocal protestations on and off - the - record by Democratic Congressional leaders , the movement to impeach Cheney or President Bush has begun to pick up steam .
According to a recent poll , a majority of Americans favor the vice president 's ouster from office , and anti-war activist Cindy Sheehan announced that she would run against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi if the San Francisco Congresswoman does not introduce articles of impeachment within the next two weeks .
A group of progressives in California opened an " Impeachment Center " on Independence Day to serve as a clearinghouse for information and activism , while another group is planning to fly a pro-impeachment banner over AT&T Park in San Francisco before Tuesday 's All Star Game .
Additionally , a rally is scheduled for July 23 , which will include a march by demonstrators , including Sheehan , from Arlington National Cemetery to Rep. John Conyers ' Capitol Hill office .
Conyers , D - Mich. , is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , which would consider Kucinich 's impeachment bill before deciding if it should go to the full House .
Conyers said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC over the weekend that he hoped the rising public sentiment in favor of impeaching Bush and Cheney would lead the president to be more cooperative with congressional investigators he has so far continued to stonewall .
" I did n't put impeachment on the table , " Conyers said on This Week .
" I was just telling you that 46 % of the American people polled want Bush impeached . "
This morning on " Meet The Press " Karl Rove sat down with David Gregory to talk about his career , Iraq and the state of the Republican party today .
Gregory actually asks some tough questions and follows up on them , but the Master of Spin refuses to answer most of the questions directly and as expected , attempts to rewrite history and put a positive face on his scorched earth brand of politics and the worst president in American history .

The Star Wars
by
George Lucas
Rough Draft [ First of four major screenplay drafts ]
Lucasfilm Ltd. 5/74 1 . FADE IN : SPACE
A sea of stars is broken by the vast blue surface of the planet , Utapau .
Five small moons slowly drift into view from the far side of the planet .
The main titles are followed by a roll - up : Until the recent Great Rebellion , the Jedi Bendu were the most feared warriors in the universe .
For one hundred thousand years , generations of Jedi perfected their art as the personal bodyguards of the emperor .
They were the chief architects of the invincible Imperial Space Force which expanded the Empire across the galaxy , from the celestial equator to the farthest reaches of the Great Rift .
Now these legendary warriors are all but extinct .
One by one they have been hunted down and destroyed as enemies of the New Empire by a ferocious and sinister rival warrior sect , the Knights of Sith .
A small silver spacecraft emerges from behind one of the Utapau moons .
The deadly little fightercraft speeds past several of the moons , until it finally goes into orbit around the fourth moon .
2 . WASTELAND - FOURTH MOON - UTAPAU
A harsh gale blows across the bleak grey surface of the Fourth Moon .
The leaden sky presses down on a lone figure , Annikin Starkiller , a tall , heavy - set boy of eighteen .
He slowly makes his way across the canyon floor .
The heavy winds whip at him and make the going extremely difficult .
His face is covered by a breath mask and goggles .
He stops for a second to adjust the shoulder strap on his chrome multiplelaser rifle .
Something in the sky catches his eye , and he instinctively grabs a pair of electrobinoculars from his belt .
He stands transfixed for a few moments , studying the heavens , then turns and rushes back in the direction from which he came .
3 . SUPPLY HUT - FOURTH MOON - UTAPAU
A spacecraft , half buried in the dust , rests next to the remains of an abandoned supply shack .
Annikin makes his way across the colorless landscape and rushes into the crumbling building .
The interior of the hut is shabby , but manages to abate the howling winds .
Seated in front of a thermoheater are Annikin 's father , Kane , and his young brother , Deak .
Kane is a large , burly man , wearing the distinctive robes of a Jedi .
Deak is ten years old , with dusty blond hair and a large scratch on his cheek .
Annikin slams the door and removes his gear .
His ruggedly handsome face is caked with many layers of dust .
ANNIKIN Dad ! Dad !... They 've found us !
Deak looks up from a small cube he has been studying .
His father whacks him across the shoulder with a braided wire connector .
KANE Continue with the problem .
Your concentration is worse than your brother 's . ( to Annikin ) How many ?
ANNIKIN
Only one this time .
A Banta Four . KANE Good .
We may not have to repair this old bucket after all .
Prepare yourself .
DEAK
Me too !
KANE
Do you have the answer ?
DEAK
I think it 's the Corbet dictum : " What is , is without . "
Kane smiles .
This is the correct answer .
Annikin is strapping on a utility belt with chrome laserpistols and lasersword .
Kane rises and starts for his equipment .
DEAK ( Con't ) Ahhh , Pop ... KANE
Deak , do you feel you 're ready ?
DEAK
Yes , sir .
I 've outmarked Annikin in twelve disciplines .
I 'm as good ...
KANE
All right , son , get your gear .
Deak jumps up with the enthusiasm available only to a ten - year - old and grabs his gear .
His father frowns and shakes his head .
4 . WASTELAND BLUFF - FOURTH MOON - UTAPAU
Kane Starkiller and his two sons carefully make their way up a rock bluff overlooking the parked silver Sith spacecraft .
Kane inspects the craft with his electrobinoculars .
KANE
No tracks .
Bi-lock has n't been opened .... Interior systems are still on ....
ANNIKIN
Are we going to wait for him to come out ?
KANE
He 's not in there ....
He 's baiting us .
I 'm surprised they only sent one this time .
We must be wearing them down , or they must think this knight is something special .... Stay on guard , and keep hidden .
I 'm going to work my way across the ridge and call his bluff .
Better we meet in open combat than wait for him to ambush us .... Keep your guard !
Kane leaves his two sons and moves off along the obscured ridge .
Annikin and Deak watch him intently .
Annikin throws down his multiplelaser rifle in disgust .
ANNIKIN
He should have let me go with him ....
He 's getting too old to make an open challenge .
DEAK
He 's not too old to realize you 'd just get in the way .
Annikin ignores his little brother 's remark and sneaks a look over the ridge at the Sith spacecraft .
Kane moves out of the rocks some distance away and starts toward the starship .
Deak moves to the ridge next to his brother , his chrome laserrifle sparkling in the reflected light of Utapau .
DEAK
He 's making his move ....
ANNIKIN
Watch your guard ... and cover that weapon .
It shines like a beacon .
Deak reluctantly move away and watches the other direction .
Kane has almost reached the Sith spacecraft and still there is no sign of its occupant .
DEAK
What 's happening ?
ANNIKIN Nothing .
I do n't like it .
Kane carefully moves to the main hatch of the starship .
He kicks a valve and the hatch drops open with a loud clank and rushing gas .
Annikin becomes more tense as his father carefully moves inside the spacecraft .
Everything is still .
Even the continual winds seem to have died down .
Moments pass with no sign of activity inside the enemy starship .
Annikin watches the craft with his electrobinoculars .
The waiting becomes unbearable .
ANNIKIN Something 's happened !
He 's been in there too long .
DEAK
Let me look !
Stand my guard .
Deak takes the electrobinoculars from his brother and studies the silent spacecraft .
Annikin impatiently scans the opposite horizon .
DEAK I think the power just went off .
We 'd better wait here until someone comes out .
ANNIKIN
What if he needs help ?
DEAK
The power went back on again ....
With the aid of the electrobinoculars , Deak watches the running lights of the starship flash on and off .
Suddenly , something huge moves in front of his field of view .
Before either of the two young boys can react , a large , sinister Sith warrior in black robes and a face mask looms over them .
He carries a long lasersword which cuts young Deak down before he or his brother are able to raise their weapons .
The startled Annikin backs away in horror , then settles down and ignites his lasersword , which creates an eerie red glow .
He stumbles over rocks as he attempts to avoid the charging Sith knight .
The evil warrior swings his mighty lasersword , but Annikin manages to deflect the intended deathblow .
Finally , Annikin is able to assume a defensive stance , and the two warriors stand , sizing up each other .
The black knight is at least seven feet tall , and dwarfs the young Jedi .
They stand for a few moments , almost frozen , then in a flurry of blows , laserswords clash with the sound of electric snapping and popping .
Annikin is barely able to hold his own against the experienced knight .
Many blows are exchanged before the Sith warrior is able to back Annikin up against a deep crevasse .
Annikin stumbles and almost falls over the cliff to his death .
The black knight suddenly senses something behind him and whirls around to face Annikin 's father , Kane Starkiller , a Jedi Bendu master .
The Sith warrior raises his lasersword , but is cut in two before he can bring it down again .
Kane moves to the fallen black knight , and studies him carefully .
Annikin , still a little wobbly from the whole experience , attempts to stand .
Kane sees his dead son Deak , and goes to him .
He lifts him into his arms and begins to weep .
Annikin stands bewildered , watching his father cradle his dead brother .
5 . INTERIOR SITH STARSHIP - WASTELAND CANYON - UTAPAU
Kane Starkiller slides into one of the four seats of the small Sith starship .
Through the front viewing canopy , he watches Annikin drag his younger brother 's body to a small crevasse .
Annikin places a small locket around his brother 's neck , makes a complicated sign with his hand , and dumps the body into the shallow depression .
The giant engines of the spacecraft begin to whine , kicking up large clouds of dust .
Annikin climbs into the seat beside his father and removes his breath mask and goggles .
There are tears in his eyes .
Father and son look out across the wasteland towards Deak 's grave .
The thunderous clap of an explosion is followed by a small mushroom cloud rising out of the depression .
Annikin throws a container down in a fit of rage .
ANNIKIN
How many more of them are there ?
I want to finish it , once and for all !
I 'm sick of running ... when will it stop ?
Annikin 's father waits silently until his son's tirade is finished .
Annikin sits silently for a few moments .
ANNIKIN ( con't ) I 'm sorry .
KANE Son , plot a course for Aquilae .
Annikin lights up like a Bantha at feeding time .
ANNIKIN Aquilae !!
You mean we 're going home ?
KANE
We both need a rest .
Kane pulls back on the throttle , and the powerful spaceship lifts off the surface of the Fourth Moon of Utapau .
6 . CLOUD SEA - ALDERAAN
A title card appears over a sea of billowing clouds on the gaseous planet of Alderaan : Alderaan : Capital of the New Galactic Empire .
The towering white oxide clouds pass , revealing the Imperial city of Alderaan .
The magnificent domed and gleaming city is perched , mushroom - like , on a tall spire , which disappears deep into the misty surface of the planet .
The peacefulness of this nebulous idyll is broken by the increasing wail of ion engines .
Four sleek stardestroyers , from the Imperial Third Fleet , burst from one of the huge cumulus range .
The craft are flying in a tight formation as they bank steeply , and head toward the Imperial capital of the galaxy .
7 . INTERIOR OF STARDESTROYER - ALDERAAN
Stardestroyers are two - man spacecraft crammed with sophisticated electronic weaponry .
The pilot and gunnery officers sit side - by - side , surrounded by lighted readouts and switches .
They wear the gleaming black uniforms of the Empire .
PILOT Tok - One to chicks :
Shape it up .
Let 's make it good .
CHICK -ONE
Does that glare bother you ?
PILOT
Use your face shield , Chick - One .
The pilot is cold and professional as he maneuvers his craft closer to the others .
The positions of the ships are displayed on a readout , along with a graphic representation of the city .
The pilot gives the gunner a quick look before he flips his sunshield over his eyes .
PILOT
Here we go .
Count : three , two , one , now !
8 . REVIEW STAND - PLAZA OF THE DADERS - ALDERAAN
On a huge , austere platform stands the dark Cos Dashit , Lord of Alderaan , Consul to the Supreme Tribunal , and ruler of the Galactic Empire .
He is a thin , grey - looking man , with an evil mustache which hangs limply over his insipid lip .
Standing at rigid attention on his right are several generals , dressed in the black and grey uniform of the realm .
Five members of the Supreme Tribunal sit off to the side .
On the emperor 's left stands Crispin Hoedaack , newly appointed Governor of the Aquilaean Systems , a young , treacherous man with stone - cut , angular features and piercing grey eyes .
They all gaze skyward , as the four gleaming stardestroyers scream low overhead in an impressive barrel - roll formation .
As the sound of the spacecraft resonates throughout the glass canyon of the Plaza , the group of dignitaries return their attention to the parade of Imperial shock troops , and giant air tanks ( which ride magically two to three feet above the ground ) .
The Plaza of the Daders is filled with a hundred rows of troops as the last brigade marches into position .
The sound of a thousand men snapping to attention is followed by a strange silence .
A light wind blows the great red banner of the Empire , creating a subtle flapping sound .
The emperor 's amplified voice startles many of the troops as it cuts through the quiet .
EMPEROR
Upon this battle depends the survival of the Galactic Empire .
Upon this battle depends the life and long continuity of our civilization .
Not since the great Jedi Rebellion has our destiny been placed in such a balance .
This is to be the most magnificent campaign of all !
You have never been called without doing something to be remembered , something notable and striking .
The conquering of the Aquilaean System , the last of the independent Systems , and the last refuge of the outlawed , vile sect of the Jedi , will have such important and lasting consequences , that I can't but consider it as an epoch in history .
To the rear of the Plaza , watching the spectacle over the shoulder of a curious bureaucrat , stands Clieg Whitsun , a tall , blond young man about twenty years old .
He seems interested in what the emperor has to say , but keeps looking around nervously as if someone were after him .
His arm rests across his head , as he carefully but coolly adjusts a glowing blue ring on his index finger .
The emperor nears the end of his speech .
Crispin Hoedaack has moved up to stand next to the sinister monarch .
The troops shout an Imperial salute in response to a particularly partisan statement .
EMPEROR ( con't ) ... I have personally asked the Aquilaeans to accept this Treaty of Alliance .
During the long period of negotiation , they have only decided to be undecided .
We will barter no longer .
Governor Hoedaack has been appointed the First Lord of the Aquilaean System and Surrounding Territories .
This is the last frontier and the final stone in the great wall of the Galactic Empire .
The troops cheer , ad the emperor escorts Hoedaack inside .
Whitsun moves quickly away from the Plaza , passing through several check stations , where he is forced to show his identification .
9 . NIGHT CLUB - ALDERAAN
Whitsun walks into the glass and chrome splendor of one of the famous nightclubs of Alderaan .
He moves to the long mirrored bar , and sits next to a rough - looking man , Bail Antilles , dressed in the distinctive gold and furs of the Galactic traders .
WHITSUN
Your glass is empty .
Whitsun speaks into a small intercom on the bar front .
WHITSUN ( con't ) A dantic and ...
He looks in Antilles ' glass .
ANTILLES
No thanks , Whitsun .
I 've had enough .
WHITSUN Just a dantic then .
Bail , it 's not like you to refuse a drink .
You 're going to give Galactic traders a bad name .
A drink appears magically from a small elevator in the bar .
Whitsun takes it , and then places a pen- like transmitter he has taken from his pocket next to the intercom .
It creates a low electronic buzz .
10 . BAR OBSERVATION CENTER - ALDERAAN
A controller sitting in front of a row of monitors taps his headphones , then flips a switch back and forth a couple of times .
He is obviously annoyed .
CONTROLLER
Number eighteen is out again .
Give me a maintenance check .
The controller yawns and puts his feet up on the control panel .
11 . NIGHTCLUB - ALDERAAN
Whitsun leans in close to Antilles .
He is suddenly very serious .
ANTILLES
Whitsun , we 've got problems .
They 've just grounded all spacecraft , including trade frigates .
Even the ships under Imperial registry can't move .
Something big is up .
WHITSUN I 'm afraid they 're not waiting for the Alliance Treaty .
They 're already moving against the System .
I 've got to get word back .
ANTILLES
The chrome companies are protesting the embargo , but it 's going to take some time .
WHITSUN Is n't anything moving ?
ANTILLES
Military ships , but ...
They are interrupted by an Imperial officer , and several stormtroopers .
The officer shouts over the P.A. system , as the troops rush to block the exits .
Whitsun and the Galactic trader are tense , but remain cool .
OFFICER Attention : all Captains and First Officers of Guild Trade frigates will accompany me to the Ministry of Transport immediately .
Antilles gives
Whitsun a hopeless look as the troops check their papers , and then take Antilles away .
A small fight breaks out in the back of the nightclub as one of the trader captains expresses his dislike of the Empire .
Whitsun slams his glass to the bar in a gesture of hate and frustration .
12 . GOVERNOR HOEDAACK'S QUARTERS - ALDERAAN
The large , white - on - white executive quarters resound with the high - pitched laugh of the evil Governor Hoedaack .
He slaps Darth Vader , a tall , grim - looking general , on the back , and the general 's mouth makes the slightest gesture at a smile .
HOEDAACK
Success , I told you .
We are no longer under the control of the Great Families ....
We 've gained a true advantage .
Vantos Coll , a member of the Supreme Tribunal , and a man of the grossest dimensions , appears to be a little worried .
COLL A rather dangerous advantage .
You still have a System to conquer .
HOEDAACK
But this System will bring us more scientific wealth than that of any other House in the Tribunal .
We will easily gain control of the directorship .
COLL Do n't underestimate the armies of Aquilae .
They 're lead by a Jedi .
HOEDAACK I 've told you about Commissioner Lars , General .
He worries a lot .
VADER
It 's a myth that any Jedi still exist .
COLL General Skywalker is no myth .
When I first arrived at court , he was the First Bodyguard to the emperor ... He lead the Jedi Rebellion .
VADER Seig Darklighter lead the Rebellion .
COLL
So the emperor would have you think , but I was there .
VADER
Then why was n't he hunted down like the others ?
COLL
Because he is too dangerous , too clever .
Besides , his presence on Aquilae is still only a rumor .
HOEDAACK
Then why do you believe it ?
COLL Because I knew him .
He 's there , alright .
I can sense it .
Mark my words : Aquilae will not be easily conquered .
13 . COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE
A low , sleek " landspeeder , " ( an auto - like transport which travels a few feet above the ground on a magnetic field ) , glides into the courtyard of the palace of Aquilae .
The planet is desert wilderness , but the palace is a sparkling oasis , with low concrete walls and great turrets spilling over with foliage from rooftop gardens .
The speeder stops before an enormous shaded corridor .
Fountains line the beautiful and highly polished , tiled walkway .
Two young boys , Biggs ( 7 ) and Windom ( 5 ) are helped out of the speeder by Amber , a one - armed bodyguard dressed in the flowing white robes of the Aquilaean military .
The two boys run through the long corridors , yelling and screaming , their little footsteps echoing throughout the palace .
14 .
The palace library is a dim , cool room projecting an aura of time - worn comfort and security .
In the distance , the children can be heard screaming through the corridors .
King Kayos , silver - haired but amazingly youthful under a tanned and leathery face , motions for one of his aides to shut the partially closed door .
He is in the middle of an emergency meeting of the Aquilaean High Senate .
The twelve men sit in overstuffed chairs , placed in a large circle .
A large , sallow - eyed Galactic trader named Aay Zavos fiddles nervously with a small scrap of leather as he speaks .
ZAVOS My Lord , the chrome companies are with you in spirit , but you must understand , they can't openly support you .
Imperial trade restrictions are very unfavorable , and we , of course , favor your independence .
KAYOS
If there were to be war , would your frigates still supply us ?
ZAVOS
Your bluntness is to be commended .
It could be arranged .
Count Sandage , a corrupt noble of the Senate , jumps to his feet in a rage .
SANDAGE
This is nonsense !
We have no choice but to approve the Treaty .
If there is war , the Empire will destroy our entire System with a snap of the finger .
General Skywalker is a dreamer if he thinks he can mount any meaningful resistance ....
And you 're dreamers if you believe him .
So much trust in one aged man .
You must see ...
At that moment , all heads turn as someone enters the room .
It is General Luke Skywalker , Commander of the Aquilaean Starforce .
He is a large man , apparently in his early sixties , but actually much older .
Everyone senses the aura of power that radiates from this great warrior .
Here is a leader : a Jedi general .
He looks weary , but is still a magnificent - looking warrior .
His face , cracked and weathered by exotic climates , is set off by a close silver beard , and dark , penetrating eyes .
Sandage is somewhat embarrassed and quietly sits down .
GENERAL
Is there anyone here so naive he believes the Empire would even bother negotiating if they were contemplating destruction of this System ?
Your Excellencies , this is more than a simple raid on your resources .
You must reach a decision .
Mir Nash , a thin , birdlike senator , turns to the general .
NASH General Skywalker , war is a serious business ... a deadly business .
GENERAL Procrastination is a deadly business , Senator .
War is my business .
Have you approved my defense measures ?
The Grande Mouff Tarkin wears the long , black robes of the Aquilaean religion .
He speaks with a high , cracking voice .
TARKIN
An actual war with the Empire is still only a remote possibility .
As a military treatise , your proposal has certain merits , but in the harsh light of reality , an attack against the Empire appears to be a somewhat extreme defense .
NASH
You must understand , General , we are interested in avoiding a war , not starting one .
GENERAL
There are times when offense makes the best defense .
If that Alliance Treaty is n't signed , we will need all of the advantage we can get .
KAYOS Count Sandage , I want you to head the delegation to Alderaan .
You will leave tomorrow with our answer regarding the Treaty .
My decision will be forthcoming .
The senators whisper among themselves .
KAYOS ( con't )
All right , then .
May the force of others be with you all .
The senators leave in a flurry of hushed conversation .
The general is lost in thought , and remains in his chair .
Biggs and Windom ( Windy ) , the king 's two young sons , storm through the existing senators and rush on to Kayos ' lap .
The king is obviously very proud of the two young princes .
He throws Biggs into the air , and then catches him again .
WINDY
Me too !
Me too !
BIGGS Leia 's leaving !
Leia 's leaving and you gotta say good - bye .
The king picks up Windy and swings him around , then puts him down .
KAYOS
Okay , whippersnapper , go tell your mother and your sister that I 'm on my way .
The two boys run out of the room and are heard yelling and screaming down the hallway .
The king starts out , but stops in front of the general .
KAYOS
Luke , my daughter is leaving for the academy at Chathos .
Wo n't you come and wish her well ?
It would mean a lot to her .
She truly idolizes you , you know .
Come on , the war will wait .
GENERAL
Of course .
I 'm sorry , My Lord .
Politics always seem to distress me .
The general rises , and as they head for the door , Kayos pats him on the back .
KAYOS I know , Luke .
I feel the Force also .
15 . COURTYARD - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE
A large , four - seat speeder sits gleaming in the sun-soaked courtyard .
The Princess Leia , about fourteen years old , possessing a soft beauty and iron will , is embracing her mother , Queen Breha , a warm , silver - haired matron .
There are tears in the princess ' blue eyes .
Biggs and Windy jump around inside the speeder , disrupting the efforts of the one - armed Amber to pack several plaxiform cases .
Leia embraces the king as he approaches with the general .
LEIA
Oh , Daddy , I 'll miss you so .
KAYOS
The semester will be over before you know it .
You 'll have a grand time .
There are so many new things to learn .
I wish I were going .
He gives her a fatherly smile , and she hugs him again .
The general stands rather formally to one side .
The princess , her long auburn hair tied in braids , moves to the general and he bows before her .
GENERAL
May your studies do you honor .
Leia is somewhat embarrassed by the general 's formality and can only manage an awkward smile before returning to her parents at the speeder .
BREHA Hurry Leia .
You must make it to Yuell before nightfall .
The princess ' maids - in - waiting , Alana , a short , stocky girl , and Mina , more comely ( somewhat the same stature as Leia ) with long dark hair , giggle and straighten Leia 's dress before she enters the speeder .
The princess and Mina hug Alana , whose giggles have turned to tears .
The two boys scramble out of the speeder as Amber helps the princess and her maid into the back seat .
The speeder is piloted by a trooper of the First Order .
Amber jumps into the seat beside him , and the speeder starts with a low buzzing sound .
The princess waves to her family , and Mina waves to Alana as the speeder slowly glides out of the courtyard .
16 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The war room is a mass of glass enclosures , electronic wall displays , monitors , and computer stations .
General Skywalker enters a control station , followed by a covey of military aides of various ranks .
As the group hurry through the crowded room , men rise and salute the new arrivals .
The general stops before a giant display of the galaxy .
Small symbols flash on and off over various portions of the big board .
The general studies it intently .
GENERAL Montross !
Captain Montross , one of the general 's aides , snaps to attention .
MONTROSS Sir! GENERAL
What 's the TQ on this ?
MONTROSS
The last frigate to leave the Imperial capital was at twenty - three forty , Sir. GENERAL
Have any ships at all left the planet ?
( to another aide ) Check with the Guild on Horton three .
MONTROSS
At twenty four hundred , a full battalion of stardestroyers left for what is projected to be Anchorhead , or a nearby System .
GENERAL
And no word from Whitsun .
He should have reported by now .
Captain Prue !
An older , academic looking aide , steps forward .
PRUE Sir! GENERAL
What do you make of this ?
PRUE A battalion is invasion force ... but the Empire controls that entire part of the galaxy ....
A revolution , maybe .
At any rate , they 're going in the wrong direction to be any trouble for us .
The general ponders this for a few moments , then speaks almost to himself .
GENERAL I do n't know ...
It does n't feel good .
MONTROSS Sir? GENERAL
Put 'em on alert .
A loud uproar is heard on the far side of the war room .
Everyone turns to see a foreign dressed warrior pushing his way past several guards and war - room bureaucrats .
The warrior , with his long hair tied in an odd bun on the top of his head , is Kane Starkiller .
He is followed by his son , Annikin , who rudely pushes the pesky bureaucrats out of the way .
BUREAUCRATS
It 's restricted .
You 'll have to wait ... ( etc. ) KANE
Get out of my way , boy , before I grind you into the surface ...( etc . )
As the dauntless Starkiller approaches the general , the guards stop in bewilderment as General Skywalker rushes up to the warrior and embraces him .
The two Jedi warriors laugh jubilantly and slap one another , as the aides and bureaucrats look on in amazement .
GENERAL Kane Starkiller - you old muscle - rat !
What a sight !
We heard that you had been executed .
KANE
So the Empire would like to believe .
I 've been in the Kessil System .
You remember little Annikin .
Kane puts his arms around his son , who has been making eyes at one of the cute young female aides .
He bows before the General .
GENERAL
He takes after his mother !
( They laugh )
It 's so good to see you .
KANE
It 's wonderful to be with another Jedi again .
There are so few of us left .
The cute aide goes back to her duties , flirting with Annikin as she passes .
The young warrior pinches her on the ass , which startles her , but she goes on like nothing happened .
GENERAL
What a sight !
The two Jedi stand looking at one another , hardly believing the other is real .
Finally , the general realizes his aides are standing around , gawking at the duo .
GENERAL ( to the aids )
Wake up , gentlemen .
You 're on alert .
Keep me posted on that battalion .
17 . CONTROL STATION - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general , Starkiller , and his son enter a small glass enclosed control office .
They sit , and an awkward silence passes as each man waits for the other to speak .
KANE I 've come for your help .
GENERAL
Anything you ask .
You 're a Jedi brother .
We 're one .
KANE
My friend , we 've been through much together ... I 've been through much since we parted .
I 've lost much ...
The Empire has chased us half way across the galaxy ...
There is no refuge .
One day they will come here ...
Take my son as your Padawan Learner .
He would be a Jedi .
I 've trained him from birth .
He 's reached the fifth stage .
He fought in the Kessilian civil wars and commanded a Hubble expedition to the Cone Systems .
He 's a good boy , Luke , and one hell of a fighter .
The general looks down , somewhat embarrassed .
He scratches his head , then smiles .
GENERAL
Old friend , you do me too much honor .
I was never a match for you .
Why do n't you finish his training yourself ?
KANE I 'm too old , Luke .
I can't go on ...
You must finish it .
GENERAL
What kind of talk is this ?
You 're not the old Starkiller I remember .
Too old ?!?
Starkiller suddenly ignites in a rage and swings his left forearm down with a mighty blow across the solid chrome desk the general is sitting on .
The old Jedi warrior 's forearm cracks in two , spewing forth wires , and many fine multicolored electronic components .
The artificial limb flops lifelessly to Starkiller 's side .
The warrior rips open his tunic , revealing a plastic chest stuffed with flashing electric parts .
KANE ( angrily ) I 'm not the same .
There is nothing left but my head and right arm ...
I 've lost too much , Luke ... I 'm dying .
The general bows his head in sorrow for one of the greatest warriors in the galaxy and a dear friend .
GENERAL I 'm sorry ...
KANE I 'm sorry .
I keep losing control .
I 'm very tired ... Take my son !
The Jedi- Bendu must survive .
We must pass it on .
Only a Jedi can stop the Empire .
We 're very old , Luke .
A new generation of Jedi must be started .
Take him ; teach him the way of the Jedi-Bendu ...
Captain Montross bursts into the office and somewhat excitedly salutes the general .
MONTROSS
Sir , we have picked up something !
An asteroid , or solid comet moving away from the Anchorhead System .
18 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general rushes out of the control station and back to the giant Galactic display .
He is followed by Montross , Starkiller and his son .
GENERAL
Are you sure it's not the battalion ?
MONTROSS A solid object .
It 's as big as our Third Moon .
PRUE
It 's too large to be man-made , and it 's too slow to be a comet .
GENERAL Analysis ?
MONTROSS
It 's too far out .
GENERAL I 'll be with the king .
Report as soon as you can get a reading on it .
( turning to Kane 's son ) Captain Starkiller , from now on you stick close to me .
The older Starkiller smiles , and puts his good arm around his old friend .
19 . DINING CHAMBER - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE King Kayos moves his arm around Breha 's waist as they stand on a balcony watching the giant twin suns of Aquilae disappear behind a distant dune range .
The general enters , rather in a rush , followed by the young Starkiller , who is now dressed in the white uniform of the Aquilaean starforce .
( He still wears the distinctive Kessilian hair knot . )
They bow before the king .
KAYOS ( pointing to the suns )
Are n't they beautiful , General ?
" Always and never the same . "
You 're just in time for dinner .
GENERAL
I have come for other reasons .
Could ....
KAYOS Relax , General .
We will discuss it , but over dinner .
There are times , Luke , when I find you a bit too rigid .
Is this your new disciple ?
Starkiller is ill at ease and bows again .
STARKILLER Annikin Starkiller , Sir. KAYOS
Where 's Kane ?
GENERAL
He left for the spaceport at Gordon to visit an old friend , Han Solo , the Ureallian .
KAYOS
We are becoming quite a refuge .
The group sits at a large table , and food is brought in by servants .
They eat .
Starkiller is nervous and watches the general , to make sure he is being proper .
GENERAL My Lord , several events have occurred which lead me to believe we are in imminent danger of attack .
There is no longer time for discussion and debate ...
KAYOS
What events ?
GENERAL Whitsun , our best agent , has disappeared in the Imperial capital .
There is unusual military traffic in the S - 4 sectors ...
KAYOS
Unless you have direct , concrete proof of a pending attack , there is nothing I can do .
GENERAL
By the time we have proof , it may be too late .
KAYOS
Luke , I 'm leaving tonight for Amsel .
I 'm meeting with the full assembly first thing in the morning .
I am not going to approve the Alliance Treaty , and I will get your defense measure approved .
Just be patient .
You will have the war code .
GENERAL Tomorrow may be too late .
My Lord , I need the war code now .
We must get our forces into space .
KAYOS
But it must be done legally , with everyone 's approval .
Tomorrow you will have that .
I doubt the Empire would attack before receiving our answer .
The separation of war powers is the one condition upon which you assumed command of our forces .
You 're a friend , Luke , and I trust you .
But you 're also an outlander who controls a great deal of power .
I can't forsake my oath any more than you can .
Just be patient .
You will have the code tomorrow .
Captain Montross enters the large chamber and bows before the king .
MONTROSS I bring a report to General Skywalker , My Lord .
KAYOS
You may deliver it .
MONTROSS
Sir , the asteroid has disappeared from our scopes .
There is no trace of it .
GENERAL
Were they able to analyze it ?
MONTROSS
It never came within range , Sir .
The general rises , quickly followed by Starkiller .
GENERAL Excuse us , My Lord .
We 'd better get back .
I will wait patiently for the approval .
The general and Montross exit the chamber .
Starkiller takes one last bite of his dinner , then dashes after his mentor .
20 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general sits rigidly , facing the big Galactic display board .
Several aides and bureaucrats rush to and fro , ignoring the general .
he is asleep .
Captain Prue approaches the general and snaps to attention .
The general 's eyes open .
GENERAL
What are the results ?
PRUE Negative , Sir. GENERAL
Are you sure ?
PRUE Absolutely .
GENERAL
It 's just not possible .
Something that size can't just disappear without a trace ... Check it again .
PRUE
That 's the tenth negative , Sir. GENERAL I said check it again .
Captain Prue retreats to a computer station .
The general looks around for Starkiller .
GENERAL Starkiller !
Everyone near the general turns , but Starkiller does n't show .
GENERAL
Where is that boy ?
Montross !
Montross rushes to the general and snaps to attention .
GENERAL Page Starkiller .
Montross goes back to his station and a few moments later , Starkiller is paged over the P.A. system .
The general waits , watching the big board .
Eventually , Starkiller stumbles out of an enclosed computer closet , fastening his pants and tucking in his tunic .
A moment later , the cute female aide rather sheepishly exits the computer closet .
She is also in the process of putting her uniform back together .
Starkiller rushes up to the general and snaps to attention .
The general lets him stand there for a moment , not acknowledging his presence ; then , suddenly , without warning and in one masterful flash motion , the general stands , grabs a small baton attached to his belt ( which immediately ignites into a four - foot glowing lasersword , ) and swings at the young warrior 's head .
In an equally quick movement , Starkiller ignites his lasersword and blocks the general 's blow .
Everyone in the war room is surprised and startled .
After a moment , they rush to the general .
Starkiller and the general stand motionless for a few moments , with laserswords locked in mid-air , creating a low buzzing sound .
Finally , the general grins , and Starkiller hesitantly relaxes .
They lower their swords and turn them off .
GENERAL
You are trained well , but remember , a Jedi must be single - minded , a discipline your father obviously never learned , hence your existence .
Clean yourself up .
Discipline is essential .
Your mind must follow the way of the Bendu .
STARKILLER
It wo n't happen again , Sir .
There are many new ....
P.A. General Skywalker , white com .
The general moves to a control station and picks up a phone .
PHONE VOICE Sir , Captain Whitsun has just been admitted to Med Vac. GENERAL
What 's his condition ?
PHONE VOICE No data , Sir. GENERAL
I 'm on my way .
21 . MED VAC EMERGENCY ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS
Captain Starkiller waits in an outer chamber as General Skywalker rushes into the Med Vac emergency room where several doctors are working on the prostrate Whitsun .
GENERAL
What 's his condition ?
Is he conscious ?
DOCTOR Partially .
He 's be all right - a few bruises , primary exhaustion ....
Whitsun thrashes around in a semi-conscious state .
He sees the general .
GENERAL
What happened , boy ?
What 's going on ?
WHITSUN ( with difficulty )
The Imperial Starforce is already on its way , not far behind me ...
They 're going to attack .
GENERAL
Are you sure ?
WHITSUN I have tapes ... A giant space fortress ....
He struggles to give General Skywalker his ring .
GENERAL
As big as our Third Moon ?
WHITSUN Bigger .
It 's unlike anything I 've ever seen .
Sophisticated deflection systems .... work in opposition to the suns .
GENERAL
They will show up on our screens at sunrise .
They 'll attack before that .
The general rushes into the outer chamber where Captain Starkiller is waiting for him .
GENERAL
Take the fastest landspeeder to Chathos .
Pick up Princess Leia ... and only Princess Leia .
Return by way of the Great Reef .
Most speed .
Starkiller exits and the general goes to an intercom and pushes several buttons .
GENERAL Montross .
MONTROSS Sir! GENERAL
Full alert .... everything !
Get the Royal Family back here .
MONTROSS
The princess is at Chathos .
There are no transports ....
GENERAL I 've already sent Captain Starkiller for her !
Contact the king , first priority .
He 's probably still en route to Amsel .
Use the scan com .
I 'm on my way .
22 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The war room is on full alert .
Everyone is at attention , waiting for the command that will put them into action .
The general enters a communication center , followed by many aides .
Captain Montross and the com aide salute .
MONTROSS
We 're having a problem getting through , Sir .
There is a great deal of interference .
PRUE
It could be jamming .
GENERAL
Try a surface link through Amsel .
The aides go back to the com-link system to try to get a line through to the king .
PRUE
We should be able to spot them at sunrise .... That 's not too far off .
GENERAL
They 'll attack with sunrise .
Until the king gives us that code to start the war computers , we 'll just have to sit tight .
PRUE
All units are on alert , Sir. GENERAL ( to Montross )
Have you made contact yet ?
( to himself )
This is one hell of a way to run a war .
PRUE Sir? 23 .
COURTYARD - ACADEMY OF CHATHOS - AQUILAE
A landspeeder roars into a courtyard of the Academy at Chathos .
Starkiller jumps out , and runs up to the large , heavy doors of the academy .
They are locked .
He bangs madly on the carved metallic door , until finally an old woman manages to swing it open .
Starkiller rushes past her into the main courtyard where Princess Leia and her hand - maiden , Mina , struggle with two large cases .
They are followed by two very old matrons , dragging several more cases .
STARKILLER
Forget the cases - we 've no time .
LEIA
These are my things .
They must ...
STARKILLER
I said forget them , and hurry ...
LEIA
Just who do you think you are ?
Starkiller grabs the princess by the arm , and hauls her to the speeder .
Mina and the old women run after them .
LEIA I will not be treated like this !
You bring my things ....
My father will have your head ... ( etc. )
Leia struggles to break away from the young warrior 's grasp as he opens the door of the speeder .
STARKILLER
Settle down !
When the door to the speeder is opened , Mina starts in , and Starkiller stops her .
STARKILLER
You must stay .
Here , take the Crest .
Starkiller rips the royal crest from the princess ' neck , and hands it to the startled handmaiden .
The old women gasp in horror .
The princess starts hitting Starkiller with little result .
PRINCESS
Mina 's not staying ... I 'm not leaving her .
You can 't ....
Starkiller punches her square on the jaw and knocks her cold .
Mina is panic stricken , one of the old women faints , and another starts for Starkiller with a large staff .
STARKILLER
She 'll be all right .
I 'm taking her to safety ... as ordered .
You will wear the crest and continue as before .
The authority of Starkiller 's voice stops the old lady .
He places the princess into the speeder , and maneuvers it out of the courtyard .
Mina puts on the crest as the speeder races away from the academy .
24 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE Queen Breha , Biggs and Windy are escorted into a rest area of the war room .
General Skywalker sits rigidly in a chair in the communications area , apparently asleep .
MONTROSS
Sir , we 've made contact !
The general opens his eyes and takes the intercom mike .
KAYOS
What is it , General ?
GENERAL
The Empire will attack on the rising of the sun .
My agent made it back .
I now have proof .
I need the war code ...
KAYOS I 'll relay it directly to the computer .
Is Breha ...?
GENERAL The Royal Family is safe .
Starkiller has gone after Princess Leia ...
KAYOS
I 'm on my way back .
25 . RED PLAINS - AQUILAE
The small caravan of four speeders sits motionless on the vast red plains of Aquilae .
The king returns the intercom to the pilot and takes a small metallic card from around his neck and gives it to the co-pilot .
KAYOS
Send this sub-land , priority one .
( to the pilot ) Get us back to Calvas immediately !
The four speeders turn around and scream away in the direction they had come .
They pass a huge ultrasleek powerplow , planting green fungus in endless furrows .
Two clay - covered farmers , riding atop the ponderous machine , watch the speeders disappear over the horizon , and into the rising twin suns .
A bright object , twinkling in early morning heavens , catches the eye of the older of the two farmers , and he brings the machine to a lumbering halt .
The younger farmer also notices the object , and stares skyward , shading his eyes to get a better view .
Suddenly there is a huge , bright atomic flash on the horizon .
A few moments later , a thunderous shaking , followed by high winds , tumbles the older farmer from his perch .
A second flash on the opposite horizon brings another jolting earthquake , and the younger farmer collapses , terror frozen on his face .
26 . READYROOM - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - AQUILAE
Chaos .
Red scramble lights are flashing .
Alert horns and attack buzzers create an unbelievable cacophony .
Air warriors , with the distinctive circle and cross medallion on their white space suits , scramble out of the low , concrete readyroom , grabbing helmets and spacepacks as they race out of the door .
27 . ATTACK RUNWAY - SPACEPORT OUTPOST - AQUILAE
Twelve pilots and navigators dash in unison to a line of waiting two - man starships of the destroyer class .
Ground crews scurry back and forth , loading last - minute armament , and unlocking power couplings .
Pilot Leader , a rugged , handsome boy of twenty , gives his ground crew a signal that his is okay .
He has a winning smile and a distinctive scar along the side of his face .
His crew chief pats him on the back .
CHIEF
Knock them all the way back to Alderaan .
The canopy is closed and the powerful starship moves onto the runway .
Other crewmen say good - bye to their pilots , some grin , some kidding - all with a great deal of hidden emotion .
The din of two dozen retrorockets cuts through the uproar , and six silver spacecraft leave the runway , and disappear into the morning cloud cover .
28 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general stands before a giant display of the Aquilaean solar system .
Montross signals the general .
MONTROSS
They 're away , Sir. Six from Gordon .
All other spaceports were hit .
The king has n't arrived yet .
GENERAL Keep checking .
Put those fighters ' intercom over the P.A .
The general sits at one of the intercom panels , and puts on a headphone .
A row of monitors is before him .
He turns to Montross .
GENERAL
Where are they ?
29 . SPACE - AQUILAE IN ECLIPSE
The eerie , reddish - yellow planet of Aquilae slowly drifts into view from total eclipse .
A small , bright speck , orbiting the planet , sparkles in the light of the twin suns .
The six deadly Aquilaean starships settle ominously into the foreground , moving swiftly toward the orbiting speck .
As the sleek starships move closer , the orbiting speck is revealed to be a gargantuan space fortress .
The moon - sized satellite fortress dwarfs the approaching fighters .
Every few moments , explosions create blinding flash on the planet 's surface , as the fortress bombards the planet with a fusillade of laser bolts .
30 . AQUILAEAN STARSHIP - INTERIOR
Pilot Leader , in the first ship , signals to his navigator who sits in a small , isolated glass bubble to the rear of the craft .
General Skywalker is seen on one of many monitors .
A view of the space fortress is on another .
The rest are filled with various computer readouts and displays .
One of the other starships reports to Pilot Leader .
DEVIL SIX ( intercom )
Look at the size of that thing !
Hey , Bowman , I hope you remembered to bring your pop gun , ' cause I think we caught us a big one this time ....
PILOT LEADER Cut off , Devil Six .... Stand by .
GENERAL ( monitor )
It looks like they 're still using the basic quad- tristation configuration .
Use a " ranger defense . "
Concentrate on breath ports and lock areas .
PILOT LEADER Affirmative base ... Copy and transmit .... Devil Two , check your rotation plates .
DEVIL TWO Roger , Boss .
We 're getting a threshold disturbance on gyro - three .
GENERAL ( monitor ) Switch over , Five , cover it !
... Devil pack , generate a spread six formation ... May the force of others protect you .
PILOT Settle in ... Devil pack , stand by .
Mark five ... break off .
Here we go .
God save us all .
31 . SPACE - AQUILAEAN STARSHIP
Fuel pods are jettisoned .
The half - dozen fighters break off into a powerline attack on the huge fortress .
Multiple laserbolts streak from the starships , creating small explosions on the complex surface of the fort .
32 . INTERIOR MAIN CORRIDOR - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
The chaos of battle echoes through the vast corridors of the fortress .
Walls buckle and cave in , sucking debris and personnel into the vacuum of outer space .
Alarm sirens scream as soldiers scramble to large turbo - powered laser gun emplacements .
Sergeants yell orders through the smoke and confusion .
Men and robots of various shapes and sizes run to their battle stations .
33 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The monitors with pictures from the starships suddenly go blank .
Technicians check channels as others in the war room silently listen to the action over the intercom .
The general remains calm , but concerned .
PILOT LEADER ( intercom ) Tighten it up ...
Devil
Two , tighten it up .
Watch those towers ....
DEVIL TWO ( CHEWIE )
Heavy fire , Boss .
Twenty - three degrees .
PILOT LEADER I see it .
Pull in ... we 're picking up some interference .
DEVIL SIX
Wow , I 've never seen such fire power .
PILOT LEADER Pull in , Devil Two ... Pull in !
Chewie ???!!
DEVIL TWO ( CHEWIE )
I 'm all right , Boss .
I 've got a target .
DEVIL SIX
There is too much action , Chewie .
Get out !
PILOT LEADER Break off , Chewie .... Acknowledge .
Devil Six , can you see Devil Two ?
DEVIL SIX I 've lost him .
There 's a very heavy fire zone on this side .
My radar 's jammed .
DEVIL FIVE
He 's gone .... no , wait .
There he is ...
Fin damage , but he 's all right .
A sigh of relief sweeps across the war room .
The monitors flash on , then off again .
DEVIL FOUR ( intercom )
Watch your back , Boss !
Watch your back !!
34 . AQUILAEAN STARSHIP
The speedy little fighters dart back and forth across the soft underbelly of the fortress , leaving a trail of destruction behind them .
PILOT LEADER Converge on south axis point , point three nine four .
It appears accessible .
I 'm going to map the surface .
Devil Four , cover me !
Pilot Leader and Devil Four dive in unison through a forest of radar domes , antennae , and gun towers .
Devil
Four fires into the protrusions as the two starships criss - cross the surface of the fortress .
Suddenly , a dense barrage of laserfire erupts from a tower , catching Devil Four broadside .
The spacecraft bursts into a million flaming pieces .
Pilot Leader reacts to the loss of his wing man , but continues on his mission .
35 . SUB - HALLWAY - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
Constant explosions rock the interior of the fortress .
Civilians , including women and children , scurry for safety in the panic - ridden hallways .
Two construction robots , Artwo Detwo ( R2D2 ) and See Threepio ( C3P0 ) , are blown , slipping and sliding across the hallway floor into some freight canisters .
Both robots are rather old and battered .
Artwo is a short , ( three feet ) claw - armed tri-pod .
His face is a mass of computer lights , surrounding a radar eye .
Threepio is a tall , gleaming android of human proportions .
He is thin , with a totally metallic surface of an Art Deco design .
The robots attempt to get out from under the canisters , but rushing gas from a broken pipe keeps knocking them over .
THREEPIO
This is madness ; we 're going to be destroyed .
I 'm still not accustomed to space travel .
ARTWO
The external bombardment does appear to be concentrated in this area .
The structure has exceeded the normal stress quotient by point four , although there appears to be no immediate danger .
THREEPIO
No immediate danger !
You 're faulty .
This is madness !
Artwo gives Threepio a sheepish look and clings to a siderail for dear life , as debris flies through the hallway .
36 . AQUILAEAN STARSHIP
Devil Two ( Chewie ) , a young hotshot of about sixteen years , miraculously dives his ship through a virtual wall of laser fire , and blasts a huge radar disc into dust .
Chewie signals his navigator , who lets out a whooping cheer , as the craft veers into a victory roll .
PILOT LEADER Great moves , Chewie .
Regroup at point two , zero one .
Coincide , Devil Six .
GENERAL
Mace , your map projection shows a weak point at south portal : niner point six .
Concentrate the attack on that point .
Coordinate .
PILOT LEADER
I see it ...
It looks good .
Devil Five and Devil
Three bob and weave in formation toward a giant transformer jutting from the fort 's surface .
DEVIL THREE I 've got a ...
We 're hit .
We 're hit .
PILOT LEADER Eject ... Eject .
Babs , Babs , do you read ?
DEVIL THREE I 'm okay .
I can hold it .
Clear me a little , Devil Five ...
Watch it !
Watch it !
Devil
Three wobbles a little , then drops away sharply , plowing into a lasergun emplacement , causing a hideous series of chain reaction explosions .
37 . SUB - HALLWAY - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
A huge explosion rips a large hole in the ceiling of a subhallway .
Artwo and Threepio are in a state of shock as they scramble through the rubble .
There is a constant sound of creaking and snapping as the sections of the hallway resettle in the fortress superstructure .
ARTWO
You 're a mindless , useless philosopher ...
Come on !
Let 's go back to work ; the system is all right .
THREEPIO
You overweight glob of grease .
Quit following me .
Get away .
Get away .
Suddenly , the hallway lurches , and a dead trooper falls through a gaping hole in the ceiling .
The foot of the carcass is caught in the rubble and it hangs upside down , staring at the two robots .
Artwo grabs Threepio , and they cling to each other in terror .
ARTWO
We 're lost .
We 're destroyed .
Three sharp blasts from an airhorn send the two androids running for cover in a burned - out doorway .
Five grim - faced troopers riding small rocket platforms pass the two mechanical men .
38 . GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
The five troopers race through several hallways , and finally stop in front of an important looking office complex .
Two officers dismount and enter the complex .
They pass through several heavily guarded doorways until they reach the main chamber .
Seated behind a large , cluttered desk surrounded by generals and attaches is Governor Hoedaack .
General Vader paces in front of a row of blank monitors .
The two officers salute General Vader .
FIRST OFFICER
All com-link power is out .
Twenty - two transformer sections have been destroyed .
The situation is grave on all southern levels .
Com -link communication should be repaired shortly .
The officers salute , turn and leave the chamber .
The general turns to Governor Hoedaack , who looks a little worried .
VADER
Do n't look so worried .
Not even a Jedi could penetrate this fortress ...
We 've already wiped out most of their forces .
HOEDAACK
If it goes on too long , we 'll run over budget .
When do the landings begin ?
VADER
As soon as the attack has been broken : not long .
A short , stocky attache salutes the general .
ATTACHE Contamination has set in on quadrants B - 5 and R - 4 .
All sections are sealed .
We 've lost two major power stations in the southern quadrants .
That puts section 5 - 1 in serious trouble .
The general turns away in controlled anger and embarrassment .
39 .
WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general sits in a glass enclosed computer station , watching the battle progress on several monitors .
An officer enters and salutes the general .
OFFICER Analysis reports those ZQ configurations are definitely power transformers ...
Everything in the southern sectors of the fortress is out .
GENERAL SKYWALKER
I 'm surprised they are still using external power units .
It 's a definite weak point .
Concentrate on searching for the main crosslink transformer .
The officer exits as Montross rushes in .
MONTROSS
The senate has voted to end the war .
GENERAL
They can't do anything without the king 's approval ; which gives us a little time ... Have you been able to regain contact with the king ?
MONTROSS No , Sir .
All ground communications are jammed .
GENERAL
Send four men.. from third squad , to meet the king , and escort him back .
Let me know before he arrives .
Is Starkiller back with the princess ?
MONTROSS No , Sir .
They 're long overdue .
Pilot Leader checks in over the intercom .
PILOT LEADER
All right , base one , we 're in position .
An officer with headphones looks to the general .
He signals to attack .
40 . AQUILAEAN STARSHIPS
All four starships dive in formation toward a main transformer area , flanked by several solar towers .
PILOT LEADER
Hold your fire until we 're within point zero five four ...
Make it count .
Several ack - ack lasers begin to open fire on the approaching spacecraft .
The starships direct their fire at a large black transformer , which when hit , spurts bright blue and white electrical arcs .
One of the starships ( Devil Five ) explodes and careens out of formation , leaving an erratic trail of smoke , before eventually crashing into a solar panel .
41 . SUB - HALLWAYS - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
The impact of the exploding starship can be felt throughout the giant fortress .
The tall , gleaming Threepio races through several corridors , yelling at Artwo , who struggles vainly to e keep pace with his stubby mechanical feet .
THREEPIO .... I do n't care what you do , but I 'm getting out .
All the power 's out .
Those explosions are coming from the reactor section .
This is the end .
Abandon ship .
ARTWO
Our work - we can't leave !
It 's desertion .
It 's not possible .
It 's not possible .
THREEPIO
Your programming is so limited .
My first order is preservation .
You stay .
I 'm going to eject before the whole thing goes up .
Threepio breaks open the seal on an emergency lifepod .
A red warning light begins to flash , and a low hum is heard .
The lanky chrome android works his way into the cramped four - man craft .
ARTWO
These lifepods are n't for us !
It 's not right !
A new explosion , this time very close , sends dust and debris through the narrow passageway .
Flames lick at the two robots .
The runt - sized Artwo jumps into the lifepod .
ARTWO
It 's the end .
Eject .
Eject .
The safety door snaps shut , and the pod ejects from the fortress .
42 . AQUILAEAN STARSHIPS
The terrified androids in the lifepod speed away from the fortress , and pass the attacking starships .
DEVIL TWO Object approaching .
Attack bearing ...
DEVIL FOUR
It 's a lifepod .
Forget it .
We 've got ...
Devil
Four is hit by laser fire , and disintegrates , leaving a trail of flaming particles .
The two remaining craft continue the assault .
Chewie and Pilot Leader watch the remains of Devil Four disappear .
The general appears over one of the monitors .
GENERAL Analysis indicates transformer code zero three is the main relay .
Hit it , and the whole thing goes dead .
PILOT LEADER
We 're on our way .
43 . GOVERNOR'S QUARTERS - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
A row of monitors and the main overhead lights go on , and a trooper appears on one of the screens .
TROOPER Internal relays operative .
All power restored .
All contaminated areas sealed .
An officer appears on another monitor .
OFFICER
Only two enemy craft remain operative .
We calculate victory by zero three hundred .
General Vader switches to another monitor .
VADER
Alert the invasion forces .
( turning to the governor ) .
The planet is ours .
A three hour war .
You expected longer .
Jedi or not , we 've beaten him , and the culture is intact .
HOEDAACK A truly great prize for the Empire .
They have a treasure of biotic science .
Genetics , cloning - they 've added two - hundred years to a lifespan .
Remember , you must capture at least one member of the Royal Family alive .
The Aquilae family has ruled this system for ten thousand years .
The people will follow no other .
If the royal line is broken , there is a good chance the entire population will destroy themselves and their knowledge before submitting to our rule .
The general is interrupted by a call on one of the monitors .
OFFICER ( on monitor )
We 've received a message from the planet ....
44 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
General Skywalker watches a giant computer display of the space fortress mapped by the starships .
An aide approaches .
AIDE Sir !
The king 's convoy has destroyed at Caldin .
All the bodies were contaminated .
GENERAL
I will audience with the queen ....
Who knows of this ?
AIDE Many .
It came through civilian sources .
GENERAL Confine Senator Sandage to his quarters .
Use any pretext .
Where is the senator now ?
Sandage and several other senators enter the computer station .
SANDAGE
Right here , General ... It 's over .
We 've already relayed peace terms to the Empire , and they 've been accepted .
Your war has ended .
The general is angry and stands pointing at the senators .
They jump back , as if the general were pointing a gun at them .
GENERAL Senator , this war is n't over .
It 's just begun .
I take my commands from the Royal Family .
SANDAGE
The queen concurs .
I have her written decree .
It is to be implemented immediately ..... I order you to cease the attack .
GENERAL
Not likely ...
SANDAGE Treason ?
Revolution ?
The people wo n't follow you , General ... nor will your troops .
I suggest you follow your orders .
General Skywalker stands angrily pondering the situation .
Sandage and the other senators are tense , a little afraid that he might cut them down on the spot .
SANDAGE Well , General ?
45 . LIFEPOD - SKY OVER AQUILAE
The reddish - yellow mass of Aquilae seems to engulf the tiny lifepod containing the two fleeing androids .
ARTWO
It 's desertion .
They 'll destroy us .
How could this happen ?
THREEPIO
That 's funny .
The damage does n't look as bad from out here .
46 . AQUILAEAN STARSHIPS
Pilot Leader and Devil
Two make a second dive on the now smoldering transformer area .
All firing from the fortress suddenly stops .
Pilot Leader looks back to his navigator , who is equally puzzled .
The two fighters continue to attack the now silent fortress .
CHEWIE ( DEVIL TWO ) I do n't get it .
What do you think , Boss ?
General Skywalker appears on the monitors .
GENERAL ( with difficulty ) Base one to Devil Leader ... Scramble code niner .
Break your attack , and return to base .
Repeat , break your attack .
Confirm .
PILOT LEADER
They 're hurt , Sir , but they still have power .
We should finish ....
GENERAL Break off .
The war is over .
Run on white lights .
Get back here , Mace .
We 're going to need you .
PILOT LEADER Confirmed , base one .
We 're on our way .
Did you copy , Chewie ?
DEVIL TWO Roger , Boss .
The two starfighters break off the attack and start back toward the planet .
Without warning , the fort directs concentrated fire at the two starfighters .
Devil
Two instantly bursts into flames , then disintegrates .
Pilot Leader 's tail section is hit , and the ship pinwheels toward the planet .
Blood covers Pilot Leader 's immobile face .
PILOT LEADER'S NAVIGATOR
We 're under fire ... They 're still shooting .
I thought it was over .
We 're hit !
We 're hit !
Pilot is dead .... Ejecting .
The dead " Pilot Leader " is jettisoned free of the craft , but the navigator 's eject panel is dead .
He struggles with it , then bangs on the canopy to no avail .
The navigator is still trapped in the craft when it explodes , leaving only a puff of pink smoke reflected in the rim light of the planet .
47 . DESERT NEAR OUTPOST - AQUILAE Pilot Leader 's dead body drifts toward his arid mother - planet .
Automatic rockets kick - in occasionally , to direct and soften the landing .
Two grey - clad troopers stand next to a military " landspeeder ; " watching the descending airwarrior through electrobinoculars .
Mace 's corpse hits the ground rather hard , creating a whirlwind of dust , and the two troopers rush over to the pilot .
The younger of the two troopers , a young boy in his teens , cradles the dead starpilot in his arms and begins to cry .
48 . WAR ROOM - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
General Skywalker sits alone , meditating in the deserted war room .
Montross approaches the contemplative general .
MONTROSS
No sign of Starkiller or the princess .
There was much damage in that area ... The queen will see you at ten hundred .
The general does n't reply .
49 . ASSEMBLY - DEPARTURE AREA - IMPERIAL SPACE FORTRESS
General Vader stands behind a row of men at computer control panels .
A commander reports to the general .
COMMANDER
All enemy craft destroyed .
First and fifth division , troops and equipment standing by .
The general gives a sly smile of approval and takes a microphone from one of the computer technicians .
He speaks to the troops and pilots waiting in their huge war machines for the invasion order .
VADER
The war is won .
With the conquering of this System we have ushered in a new millenium for the Empire ; which will echo throughout the universe .
Our reward is the knowledge this system possesses .
This planet must be controlled with a minimum of force , but you must not think lightly of this enemy .
They have exacted a heavy toll .
Today you will make the Empire complete .
Do so with pride and care .
Vader puts down the mike , and turns to his commander .
GENERAL
Let the invasion begin .
50 .
EDGE OF THE DUNE SEA - AQUILAE Jundland , or " no man 's land , " where the rugged desert mesas meet the foreboding dune sea .
The two helpless astro robots kick up clouds of dust as they clumsily work their way across the desert coastline .
The short Artwo struggles desperately to keep up with the long - legged Threepio .
ARTWO
It 's not possible .
We 're not built for this .
You 're nothing more than a dim - witted , emotion - brained intellectual .
Why you were created is beyond my logic systems .
Thanks to you , we 're deserters , and will probably be destroyed on sight .
And on top of that , you 're going the wrong way !
All this filth is getting ....
The towering Threepio stops short and turns on the blabbering mechanical runt .
THREEPIO
I 've had enough of you , you pragmatic , nearsighted scrap pile .
You go your own way .
He picks up the tiny robot and tosses him several feet into a large sand dune .
Threepio starts off in the direction of the dune sea .
Artwo struggles to his feet , and shakes a metallic claw arm at his disappearing ex-partner .
ARTWO
You 'll be malfunctioning within a day .
You 're going the wrong way , but your way is always the wrong way .
Threepio stops and yells to the smaller android .
THREEPIO
And do n't let me catch you following me , begging for help , because you wo n't get it from me .
Artwo's reply is a rather rude sound , which only an electronic person could make .
He turns and trudges off in the opposite direction into the rocky desert mesas .
51 . DUNE SEA - AQUILAE
Threepio , hot and tired , struggles up over the ridge of a dune , only to find more dunes , which seem to go on for endless miles .
He looks back in the direction he came .
THREEPIO
You little malfunctioning twerp .
This is all your fault .
You tricked me into going this way , but you 'll do no better !
He sits in a huff of anger and frustration , knocking the sand from his joints .
52 . DESERT MESA - AQUILAE
Artwo stumbles through a narrow canyon until he climbs over a small boulder and sees before him a sight he first thinks is a mirage .
Nestled in a rock formation is a deserted landspeeder .
Once the little robot is convinced that he is alone , he approaches the battered speeder and begins to analyze it .
He climbs into the pilot 's seat , and attempts to start the unfamiliar transport .
He hears a sound , and stops for a moment .
He sees nothing , so he continues to fiddle with the control panel until the speeder lurches forward with a start , banging into a large rock .
The stubby android is shaken , but neither he , nor the speeder , seems to be damaged .
Shivers run down Artwo's metal spine , and again he has an eerie feeling that he is being watched .
He slowly looks around , and sees a large man , Captain Starkiller , standing directly behind him .
He is startled , then terrified .
STARKILLER
Where is your master ?
The little robot clicks and rattles , but does n't speak .
STARKILLER ( Con't )
Ca n't you speak ?
How do you relate your data ?
You 're of Karollian manufacture ... You should be able to talk .
Are you damaged ?
Starkiller pokes at the machine , but does n't see any damage .
Artwo eyes him suspiciously .
The robot turns with a start and discovers a young girl , Princess Leia , has been standing next to him for some time .
PRINCESS ( sarcastic )
Well , General , who 's your friend ?
STARKILLER
I do n't know .
He does n't seem to be able to talk .
Damaged , probably .... Jettisoned from a damaged ship ...
PRINCESS
What do you intend to do with it ?
STARKILLER
We 'll take it with us .
Could be a storehouse of valuable information .
Starkiller guides the android into the small luggage area behind the front seat , then hops into the driver 's seat .
PRINCESS
I do n't want to ride with that hing .
I order you to destroy it immediately .
STARKILLER
Get in !
We 've got to hurry if we 're going to get across the " dunehedge " by nightfall ... You 're coming , one way or the other .
Will you join us peaceably ?
The princess reluctantly gets into the speeder , and it starts with a jolt .
53 . LANDSPEEDER - DESERT MESAS - AQUILAE
The speeder flies along , a foot or so above the landscape .
PRINCESS
You are such a barbarian .
I 'll have my father cut you into little pieces when we get back ... and I 'll take pleasure in feeding you to the Gonthas .... a little bit each day .
I may save your eyes though .
I 'll have them petrified and made into a necklace .
STARKILLER
Your sweetness is only surpassed by your beauty .
Just try to remember , I 'm only following orders .
PRINCESS ... to beat me and abuse me ?
STARKILLER
I 'm afraid I 've only learned one way to treat wild animals .
Artwo thrashes about , trying to relieve the pressure on his crumped legs .
PRINCESS
You stay out of this .
54 . DUNE SEA Threepio struggles to the top of a large dune .
He is dirty and hot .
His plight seems hopeless .
He searches the horizon for any sign of life .
A glint of reflected light in the distance reveals an object speeding toward him .
The chrome android waves frantically , and yells at the approaching speeder .
The sleek landspeeder races past him about a hundred yards away .
He runs after it , screaming in desperation , until he stumbles and falls head over heels down an enormous sand dune .
Silently , the speeder sweeps around in a circle and stops behind the immobile robot .
Starkiller jumps out of the landspeeder and is quickly followed by Artwo .
PRINCESS
We 're in a hurry , remember !
If you 're going to stop for everyone unfortunate along the way , we 'll never get back .
We 're lucky you got the speeder running as it is .
Artwo waddles up to his fallen partner and starts pulling on his leg , then runs up and starts pulling on his arm .
ARTWO Function !
Function !
It 's me .
Come on , function .
STARKILLER
Well , my little friend , you 've found your tongue .
ARTWO
We must help him ...
We 've been lost .
STARKILLER
Where did you come from ?
The little robot runs around his fallen partner giving him small electric charges from his claw hand .
Threepio shudders from head to toe , then regains consciousness .
THREEPIO
What happened ?
ARTWO
You 're overheated .
STARKILLER
Where did you come from ?
ARTWO
We were jettisoned from six twenty - nine , P.R. one .
STARKILLER
I 'm unfamiliar with that ship .
What type is it ?
THREEPIO
It 's a class M station , not a conventional craft .
Threepio then stands and shakes the young Jedi's hand .
THREEPIO ( Con't ) I 'm Seethreepio , Human - Cyborg Relations .
Your kindness is greatly appreciated .
Starkiller and the two robots walk back to the speeder .
55 . Both Artwo and Threepio are stuffed into the tiny luggage compartment .
It is late in the day when the speeder rumbles to a stop in a small desert canyon surrounded by steep cliffs and broken boulders .
STARKILLER
We 'll rest here .
THREEPIO
At last .
The transport is welcome but my joints are frozen .
Everyone climbs out of the low - slung speeder .
Starkiller watches the two androids as they stretch their mechanical limbs .
ARTWO I 've got a bad case of dust contamination .
I can barely move .
THREEPIO
What a foresaken place this is .
We seem to be made to suffer .
It 's our lot in life .
Sir , could you tell ....
Threepio turns and notices that Starkiller and the princess have disappeared .
He looks all around .
THREEPIO
Where did they go ?
They 've disappeared .
ARTWO
Maybe they were attacked !
I sense danger !
55 . HIDDEN FORTRESS ENTRANCE - DESERT CANYON - AQUILAE [ scene number - sic ]
Captain Starkiller and Princess Leia hurry through a maze of large boulders , until they reach a sheer rock face .
Starkiller looks around to see if they were followed .
Suddenly , a large section of the rock slides away , revealing a well - lit corridor carved out of the rock .
They enter , and are greeted by two jubilant guards .
Starkiller gives them some orders and points in the direction of the speeder .
The secret rock door silently slides closed .
57 . MAIN HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
Starkiller and the princess are greeted by General Skywalker and Montross .
They bow before the princess .
PRINCESS ( angrily pointing at Starkiller ) General , I want you to do something with this .. this barbarian .
Where 's my father ?
GENERAL
The king is dead , Your Highness .
All anger suddenly drains from the princess .
She almost timidly asks the next question .
PRINCESS
My mother ?... and brothers ?
GENERAL
She 's here .
She 's safe ... so are your brothers .
They 're in the main chamber .
Leia , now looking more like a frightened young girl than a vindictive princess , runs down the hallway toward the main chamber .
She vainly attempts to hold back the tears .
58 . DESERT CANYON - AQUILAE
The two puzzled androids sit on the landspeeder , pondering the disappearance of their saviour .
THREEPIO
Do you suppose we 're in danger ?
ARTWO
The logic of this environment escapes me .
As night begins to fall , and the shadows begin to lengthen , the two robots begin to get a little edgy .
The sound of approaching feet startles Artwo , and he ducks behind his taller friend .
Two guards approach the robots .
GUARD
You will remain calm , and you will remain here .
THREEPIO Certainly .
I 'm Seethreepio , Human - Cyborg Relations .
Your kindness is gratefully appreciated .
Artwo sits rather suspiciously behind his extroverted friend .
59 . ROYAL CHAMBER - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE General Skywalker bows low before Princess Leia .
She sits on a raised platform , dressed in the royal robes of a planetary ruler .
The queen sits off to one side on a smaller platform .
The princess waits for a few moments before she allows the general to rise .
QUEEN
The senate has been corrupted .
GENERAL
They can not rule without your wish ... QUEEN I rule by marriage .
With the king dead , I am not strong enough to stop them ...
Leia is now the true queen ...
She must be protected .
The line must be preserved .
I am placing the future of our people in your hands .
You must deliver Leia and her brothers to the Ophuchi System .
They will be safe there .
General , you must understand , I had no alternative but to condone an end to the hostilities .
I deeply believe your campaign could have been successful , but there are things that ...
GENERAL I understand , Your Highness ...
QUEEN
The chrome companies on Ophuchi have offered to supply you with the men and ships necessary to return Leia to the throne .
GENERAL
Can the chrome companies be trusted ?
QUEEN
The price for their cooperation is high .
It is waiting for you in Med Center blue .
Guard it as you would the princess herself .
No - one must know of this mission .
There are those among the trusted who would wish us ill .
Take only two of your best officers with you , the most loyal .
May the force of others be with you .
LEIA
Mother , you must not stay .
QUEEN
I am too old for such a journey .
The Empire already controls the spaceport cities .
You have a long way to travel .
It wo n't be easy .
GENERAL
We will have to travel in disguise .
I must have full command .
No - one can suspect wealth or royal training .
I fear the new queen will not stand for this .
LEIA ( angry )
Do not put words into my mouth .
I will stand for what is necessary .
The general simply smiles .
60 . SUB - HALLWAY - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general walks briskly through an isolated hallway , closely followed by Montross .
GENERAL
How is Captain Whitsun 's recovery ?
MONTROSS
Very good ; he 's up and around .
GENERAL Fine !
Have Whitsun and ... ah , Starkiller report at zero three hundred .
I want two converted transports : agricultural type , two days ' provisions , travel papers , weapons .
Contact Han Solo at the Gordon spaceport ... I 'll talk to him ... with speed !
Montross turns and rushes down another hallway .
61 . MEDICAL CENTER BLUE - UNDERGROUND FORTRESS - AQUILAE
The general enters a stark white waiting area filled with scholarly looking gentlemen .
An attendant greets General Skywalker and takes him into a small observation chamber overlooking a large operating theatre .
An elderly doctor greets him .
DOCTOR
Good to see you , General .
I 'm afraid we 're not quite ready yet .
Thank God you 'll be the one taking them , though .
An attendant brings in one of the scholars from the waiting area and places him on a large operating table surrounded by strange looking equipment .
An ominous looking clamp is placed on the man 's head .
GENERAL
How many are going ?
DOCTOR
Thirty - three of the greatest scientific minds in our System ... A high price for freedom .
GENERAL
Thirty - three scientists !
Transporting a group that size , undetected ... I do n't ...
DOCTOR
Don't worry , General .
All you 'll be taking are their minds .
The doctor moves over to a safe - like cabinet guarded by two attendants .
The doctor gingerly picks up a small clear vial filled with grey fluid .
It has a label which reads : Faubun , Astro- dynamics ...
In the background the scholar on the operating table is undergoing a form of mechanized brain surgery .
GENERAL " Bloodory 's distillation ? " DOCTOR Yes .
It has been greatly perfected .
The brain is condensed into five ounces of fluid .
Cloning cell samples are included so that a structural duplicate of the scientist can be reproduced .
When the duplicate child reaches the age of six , he or she begins a series of injections of the brain fluid .
By the age of ten years , they have received all the knowledge and memory of an experienced scientist : an old mind in a young body .
We have prepared a special shock - belt to carry the vials .
In the background , the limp body of the scholar on the operating table is removed and another scientist is escorted into the operating threatre .
Dr. Bloodory , a portly doctor in his forties , enters the room and shakes hands with the general .
DOCTOR General , this is Doctor Bloodory .
He 'll be making the trip with you .
BLOODORY
It 's an honor to meet you , General .
I 'm sure I could n't be in safer hands .
GENERAL
The chrome companies are exacting a high prince indeed .
Politics will be the ruin of us all .
BLOODORY Careful .
If we could rid ourselves of the politicians , generals would no longer be necessary .
DOCTOR
We should be ready by zero three hundred .
The doctors exit , leaving the general alone to watch the huge machine extract another brain .
62 . SPACEPORT - OBSERVATION DECK - AQUILAE
Governor Hoedaack , General Vader walk down a boarding ramp to an observation deck overlooking the conquered city of Gordon .
They are followed by a number of aides and officers from the Imperial fleet .
Below them air tanks and other military equipment and supplies are being unloaded .
VADER
Not much of a planet .
HOEDAACK Darth , you 've done well .
Do you think you will have the Royal Family by nightfall ?
VADER
An advance expedition is already on its way to their underground hideaway .
They should reach it by nightfall ... but only if this Count Sandage can be trusted .
HOEDAACK
A man hungry for power can always be trusted ... to betray those in power .
I 'm sure his information is correct .
63 . HIDDEN FORTRESS CANYON
The huge rock face of the canyon opens , and two shabby agricultural landspeeders are pushed into the late afternoon sun .
Artwo and Threepio stand on the far side of the canyon with their guards , watching in amazement .
The general and Captain Starkiller walk behind the men pushing the landspeeders .
GENERAL
We 'll take them with us .
They know more about that fortress than any ten men .
They will be very useful .
STARKILLER
Can they be trusted ?
GENERAL Loyalty can't be programmed .
They can be trusted never to harm a living creature , and to always give accurate information ... as they know it , to anyone who asks .
You just have to remember not to tell them anything that you do n't want to fall into the wrong hands .
The general approaches the two robots .
Artwo shyly moves around his taller companion .
GENERAL Greetings .
I 'm Luke : Agricultural Engineering .
We 're going to be travelling together .
You 're going with us to help set up a hortastation on Banth .
Threepio shakes hands with the general .
THREEPIO I'm Seethreepio : Human Cyborg relations .
Your kindness is greatly appreciated .
Threepio and the general both look down at Artwo .
Threepio gives the smaller android a little kick .
ARTWO Artwo Detwo : Fusion Repair .
GENERAL ( to Starkiller )
Load them into one of the speeders .
Captain Whitsun , walking with a slight limp , emerges from the underground fortress with the Royal Family .
A small group of guards and aides are lined up , standing at attention .
The two young princes , Biggs and Windy , hug and kiss their mother good - bye , then jump into the back of the larger four - man speeder .
The princess bows before her mother , then embraces her .
Tears roll down her cheeks .
Her mother wipes them away .
QUEEN
You must learn strength .
The princess turns and moves to the larger speeder where she is helped aboard by Captain Starkiller .
PRINCESS ( fuming ) I do n't need your help , thank you .
She gives the general an angry look .
GENERAL I 'm afraid he 's necessary .
A commotion erupts at the mouth of the underground fortress .
Count Sandage , several senators and ten to twelve troopers rush into the canyon and block the speeders .
SANDAGE
Where are you going ?
What is this ?
In one quick movement the general moves between Sandage and the queen .
Whitsun and Starkiller assume defensive positions in front of the princess and her brothers .
QUEEN Leia and the boys are being taken to safety .
It is my wish .
SANDAGE
The Empire has assured their safety .
They must stay .
QUEEN
It is not my wish ....
SANDAGE General , you 've gone too far this time .
( to the troops ) Arrest him .
Five troops start to move on the general , as Sandage draws his laserpistol .
Before anyone can complete his action , the general ignites his lasersword and cuts the senator in two .
He drops to the ground in a heap , and the approaching troops stop in their tracks .
QUEEN
Stop this !
The general , Starkiller , and Whitsun replace their swords , and bow low to the queen .
All of the troops , senators , and aides do the same .
The formalness of the occasion is broken when the queen embraces the general .
She then turns and embraces each of the captains .
They are both flustered , and somewhat embarrassed .
QUEEN
May the force of others be with you .
The general and his captains head for the speeders , while the queen and all the others return to the underground fortress .
64 . DESERT BLUFF - AQUILAE
The two speeders edge their way onto a bluff overlooking the hidden fortress canyon .
They stop for one last reflective moment .
Forced to leave their closest friends and relatives , the group is deeply moved .
The two robots , for the most part , are puzzled .
Suddenly , there is a huge atomic flash , followed by a loud rumble , and the entire canyon collapses into a large crater .
The group quietly watches the dust settle .
The hidden fortress and all its inhabitants have been destroyed .
The general watches the princess , who appears to take it well .
GENERAL
It was the only way we could be safe from treachery .
65 . DUNE SEA - AQUILAE
The two sleek landspeeders glide effortlessly through the vast hills and valleys of the dune sea .
At the base of the towering dune ridge , the four - man speeder stops .
The smaller speeder , with Starkiller and the two robots , makes its way to the top of the ridge .
Captain Starkiller stops the speeder just short of the top of the ridge .
He gets out and continues the rest of the way on foot .
The young captain peeks over the dune ridge into the canyon below .
Muted sounds and large dust clouds rise from the canyon floor .
Starkiller immediately ducks back behind the ridge with an amazed look on his face .
He quickly returns to the speeder , and picks up the intercom .
STARKILLER
Sir , you 'd better take a look at this .
But come easy .
The four - man speeder starts with a crack , and slowly moves up the side of the imposing dune .
It stops next to the smaller speeder .
The general and Whitsun get out and make their way to the top of the ridge , where they join Starkiller .
Far in the distance , crossing the endless dune sea , is the Imperial invasion army .
It is immense .
A convoy of giant tanks , troop carriers , and supply ships stretch from horizon to horizon .
Cavalry , mounted on giant dune birds , ride the line from one end of the convoy to the other .
Hundreds of troops ride one - man jet - sticks in precision formation .
Their lances form a giant pin-cushion .
It is an awesome sight .
GENERAL SKYWALKER
They 're heading toward the fortress .
WHITSUN
What will they do when they find it destroyed ?
GENERAL
They wo n't stop looking for us ... They 're coming from the spaceport at Anchorhead , which means they control everything between here and the spaceport at Gordon .
STARKILLER
Can we go around them ?
GENERAL No .
We 'll have to wait for them to pass .
Starkiller , see if you can monitor any of their communications on the com-link in the big speeder .
Starkiller returns to the speeder .
He collapses in the large speeder next to the princess , and flips on the com-link radio , moving back and forth across the dial .
PRINCESS
Must you do that ?
Starkiller smiles rather sarcastically .
STARKILLER Orders ... The invasion force has cut us off .
We 'll probably be here for some time .
You ought to stretch a bit .
PRINCESS
Is that a command , General ?
Maybe I feel like watching after my brothers .
Starkiller looks back at the two sleeping boys .
STARKILLER
They 're not going anywhere .
They 're asleep .
PRINCESS
I want to stay with them .
STARKILLER
What 's the matter ?
You afraid I might eat them ?
66 . LIBRARY - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE
The king 's old library has been converted into an office for General Vader .
He is sitting behind his desk as Prince Valorum , the black knight of Sith , enters and salutes .
The black knight is dressed in the fascist black and chrome uniform of the legendary Sith One Hundred .
The general returns his salute .
VADER Welcome , Prince Valorum .
Your exploits are legendary .
I have long waited to meet a Knight of the Sith .
If there is any way I can assist you , my entire command is at your bidding .
VALORUM
I want a tie - in to your computer network , a control center , and communication access .
VADER
Right away !
I 'll also transfer all information we have on the general .
His command post was self - destroyed , but we believe he is still alive ....
Do you really believe he 's a Jedi ?
VALORUM
If he was not a Jedi , I would n't be here .
67 . WASTELAND - AQUILAE
The speeders make their way across the grey desert .
It is dawn .
The twin suns have yet to rise over the distant hills .
The speeders are coated with dust and grime , indicating that they have travelled far .
The two captains drive through the night as everyone else sleeps .
Starkiller calls Whitsun on the intercom .
STARKILLER
How are your fuel packs ?
I 'm reading minus four .
WHITSUN I 'm too low to transfer any .
The general , who appeared to be asleep , opens his eyes , and takes the microphone from Whitsun .
GENERAL
There is a fuel station fourteen degrees by two meters .
The occupation force should have control of it by now , so hide your weapons ... but keep them within reach .
68 . FUEL STATION - AQUILAE
A series of low concrete structures rise out of the desert .
The speeders stop in front of an old weather - beaten block house .
The rusted hulk of a landspeeder lies half - buried to one side of the building .
Starkiller and Whitsun jump out of the speeder and go into the block house .
69 . INTERIOR - FUEL STATION - AQUILAE
The two young captains , dressed as farmers , enter the dingy little fuel station .
It is quiet .
A few power packs line the walls and a dismantled speeder rests in the repair bay .
There is a sharp dripping sound coming from the speeder .
It appears that no - one is there .
STARKILLER Greetings ! ...
Who 's in charge here ?
They look around the deserted station , but find no attendant .
An eerie quiet pervades the building .
WHITSUN I do n't get it ...
STARKILLER
You do n't have to .
It 's abandoned .
Whitsun opens a door leading to a storage area , and stops short .
WHITSUN
Not quite abandoned ...
Starkiller moves to the doorway and sees the attendant , his wife , and small daughter hanging upside down , tortured to death .
Whitsun cuts them down .
WHITSUN
They should n't have resisted .
Starkiller grabs two power packs from the shelf .
STARKILLER
Help me with these power packs .
We 'd better move out of here .
Whitsun covers the family with an old work tarp .
He bows to the dead , then reluctantly grabs a couple of power packs and they start for the door .
Whitsun stops for a moment .
WHITSUN
Hear that ?
Someone 's here .
( yelling )
We 're friends .
Show yourself .
Silence .
Whitsun shrugs his shoulders and they start out the door , only to run straight into a burly stormtrooper .
STORMTROOPER
Get out of here !
70 . FUEL STATION - AQUILAE
Whitsun and Starkiller are pulled out of the doorway and shoved into the center of a group of fifteen or twenty Imperial stormtroopers who have surrounded the two speeders .
Several troops have pulled General Skywalker out of the speeder .
He acts senile , like a man twice his age .
GENERAL SKYWALKER
I 'm all right .
I can still move about by myself .
A rough looking sergeant grabs Whitsun .
SERGEANT
What are you doing here ?
WHITSUN
We 're out of power , sir .
SERGEANT
Let me see your travel passes !
WHITSUN I have it here , somewhere .
We 've been relocated ... to a Bantha hortastation , by Imperial order ...
Whitsun fumbles to retrieve something from his pocket , and eventually pulls out a small , round disc .
The sergeant puts the disc in a small portable reader .
Various computer readouts are displayed on the monitor .
Starkiller starts to put a power pack into one of the speeders .
SERGEANT
What are you doing there ?
All power has been restricted .
GENERAL SKYWALKER
We 've run out .
We must have power , or be forced to stay here .... and become your responsibilities .
The sergeant thinks about this for a moment , as the old , wise general watches him .
Tension fills the air .
Starkiller shuffles around to a position where he can reach his weapon .
A trooper hands the sergeant a message .
SERGEANT ( to Whitsun )
Take only two of those power packs , and then move out quickly .
The sergeant hurries to a military craft , where he takes a call on an intercom .
General Skywalker and his two young captains load the remaining power packs into the speeder , and roar away from the station .
71 . WASTELAND - AQUILAE
The speeders race along through the rocky desert wasteland .
The general speaks into the intercom to Starkiller .
GENERAL Keep a close watch .
If that sergeant runs an analysis on those passes , we might be seeing him again ... We should be safely inside Gordon within the day .
Everyone is in good spirits .
The princess and her young brothers sing an Aquilaean melody , which is transmitted to Starkiller in the smaller speeder .
The general takes little Windy , and lets him sit on his lap in the forward compartment of the speeder .
Artwo flexes Threepio's arm back and forth , attempting to discover the cause of a loud squeak .
ARTWO Z - 2 does n't seem to help at all .
THREEPIO
It 's all this filth and dust .
This environment is murderous .
Starkiller notices a small speck on the horizon .
STARKILLER ( into intercom )
Object approaching , bearing three point two .
The general looks through an electrotelescope mounted in the speeder .
He spots a distant row of troopers riding strange dune birds .
GENERAL ( to Starkiller )
It 's a patrol .
It could mean trouble .
We 'd better split up .
You stay on a direct course .
We 'll meet you at the western edge of ravine 23 - 64 .
Stay in contact .
The larger speeder makes a sharp left turn , speeding off across a deep ravine .
Starkiller can begin to distinguish the approaching troopers .
STARKILLER
It looks like there 's ten of them .
They 're heading right for me ....
Wait a second .
They 've disappeared !
I 've lost them .
GENERAL Continue on .
73 . WASTELAND LAKEBED - AQUILAE
Whitsun deftly maneuvers the bulky speeder through a narrow , boulder strewn ravine .
They eventually come out on a dry lake bed , where they stop .
Standing not more than a hundred feet away , apparantly waiting for the speeder , are five Imperial troops on their dune birds .
GENERAL
We 've found them , five of them , anyway ... Watch yourself .
The troops slowly ride their huge birds over to the speeder , and dismount .
The officer in charge is a vicious looking warrior , with a large scar across his face .
OFFICER
Let me see your passes .
Whitsun hands him the small pass disc , and he places it in his reader .
He studies the computer readout for a few moments , and then returns the disc to Whitsun .
OFFICER
Have you seen any other transports in this area ?
GENERAL SKYWALKER
We saw two heading south .
Goin ' toward Ansel , look like to me .
OFFICER
All right .
Be on your way .
The officer mounts his dune bird , and the patrol moves away .
Whitsun winks at the princess , and smiles at the general , as the speeder starts off across the dry lake .
The general fiddles with the intercom .
GENERAL S - 2 , are you clear ?
STARKILLER
I have five troopers approaching .
Any problems on your end ?
GENERAL
We came through all right .
You should n't have any trouble , but stay alert .
STARKILLER
Best wishes ....
Here they come .
Everyone rides along in silence , a little worried about Starkiller , especially the princess .
PRINCESS .. Do you think he 'll be all right ?
GENERAL
He can take care of himself .
Biggs is looking out the back window of the speeder .
BIGGS
Hey look !
They 're coming back .
Everyone looks to see the patrol quickly gaining on them .
GENERAL Stop !
They 're faster .
Get your weapon .
The speeder screeches to a halt in a cloud of dust .
The general and his captain jump from the transport with laserpistols drawn .
The patrol bears down on them , swords drawn , at full charge .
Both the general and Whitsun fire .
Two of the troopers and their Dune birds explode in a cloud of smoke .
The remaining three troopers are upon the duo in a matter of seconds .
The general ignites his lasersword and cuts down two of the troops as they pass .
The last turns his bird around before reaching the speeder , and hightails it back toward the ravine .
The general jumps onto one of the riderless dune birds and takes off in pursuit .
Whitsun checks the dead troopers .
73 . WASTELAND RAVINE - AQUILAE
The general rides at breakneck speed after the fleeing trooper .
His lasersword is raised high over his head , ready to deal a death blow .
The lumbering birds race through the winding ravine .
74 . WASTELAND RAVINE - AQUILAE
The intercom warning buzzer begins to scream .
Whitsun rushes for it , but the princess gets there first .
PRINCESS
Are you all right ?
STARKILLER
Two riders heading your way .
I got three , but two got away .
Watch yourselves !
75 . WASTELAND RAVINE - AQUILAE
The general is riding neck and neck with the trooper .
He swiftly brings his sword down and the trooper drops from his saddle .
The momentum of his charge carries the general around a bend in the ravine , and right in the path of two more troops charging down on him .
The two troopers are taken by surprise .
They stop their birds , and so does the general .
They stand there , about fifty yards apart , sizing up each other .
Suddenly , the two troopers start for the Jedi at full speed .
The general raises his sword , and starts for them .
The troopers are no match for the general , who kills them both before they are even able to swing their swords .
76 . WASTELAND LAKEBED - AQUILAE
Starkiller stops near the larger landspeeder and gets out .
He is wounded .
Blood streams from his left arm .
Whitsun rushes to help him .
The princess shows a great deal of concern .
WHITSUN
It looks worse than it is .
You 'll be all right .
Whitsun motions to the princess , who looks a little relieved .
WHITSUN
Bring me the med aid pack .
PRINCESS
It he was clumsy enough to get hurt , maybe we ought to let him bleed to death .
She hands
Whitsun the kit , as the general rides up and dismounts .
He moves to Starkiller .
GENERAL
You missed two .
STARKILLER
I know , I could n't ...
GENERAL
Do n't let it happen again .
We 'd better move out .
They might have reported in .
77 . CONTROL ROOM - PALACE OF LITE - AQUILAE
The dark and sinister Valorum moves several markers on a large map readout to form a line from the destroyed underground fortress to the spaceport at Gordon .
An aide enters with General Vader .
AIDE
The patrol was lost , Sir .
All ten of them .
VALORUM
It 's to be expected .
VADER
Have you found them ?
VALORUM
They 're heading for the spaceport at Gordon .
I 'm going there .
Have all security doubled .
Make it an alert .
78 . THE OUTSKIRTS OF GORDON - AQUILAE
The speeders stop on a bluff overlooking a small cantina on the outskirts of Gordon .
The spaceport can be seen in the distance .
The general and Captain Whitsun walk over to the smaller speeder .
Starkiller helps the two androids out of their cramped quarters .
THREEPIO
Your kindness is greatly appreciated .
STARKILLER ( to general ) I 'm fit enough to ...
The general gives him a hard look and he shuts up .
Whitsun and the general climb into the speeder .
GENERAL
We 'll make contact at zero four hundred .
If we 're not back by fifty - five forty , get worried .
The speeder starts off toward the cantina .
79 . SPACEPORT CANTINA - AQUILAE
The speeder pulls up in front of the low , blockhouse style cantina .
Various strange forms of transport are parked outside the bar .
GENERAL
Take care here .
If there is any trouble , get back to the others .
The general and Whitsun enter the shabby cantina .
The murky little den is filled with a startling array of weird and exotic alien creatures , laughing at the bar .
At first , the sight is horrifying .
One - eyed , thousand - eyed , slimy , furry , scaling arms , tentacles , and claws huddle over drinks .
The general looks over the patrons , but does not see the contact , Han Solo .
A large multiple eyed creature shoves the general .
CREATURE Assha dughi wouldugga ?
The general tries to ignore the creature , and turns back to his drink .
A short , grubby looking human , and an even smaller rodent - like creature join the first creature .
HUMAN
He does n't like you .
GENERAL I understood him .
HUMAN I do n't like you either .
GENERAL I 'm sorry .
The big creature is getting agitated , and yells at the general .
HUMAN
Do n't insult us .
You just watch yourself .
We 're wanted men .
I have the death sentence on twelve Systems .
GENERAL I 'll be careful then .
HUMAN
You 'll be dead .
The short rodent yells something , and everything at the bar moves away .
The general assumes a defensive position .
His three adversaries ready their weapons .
GENERAL
You insist on a fight then .
HUMAN
Just try and kill us .
GENERAL
It will hurt a little .
HUMAN
We are n't cowards .
GENERAL
Then it can't be helped .
The general 's lasersword sparks to life .
An arm lies on the floor .
The rodent is cut in two , and the large , multiple - eyed creature lies doubled , cut from chin to groin .
The general , with quiet dignity , replaces his sword in its sheath .
The entire fight has lasted only a matter of seconds .
A figure stands in the doorway watching the general .
As soon as the general notices him , he leaves .
The cantina goes back to normal , as if nothing had happened , although the general is given a respectable amount of room at the bar .
The Jedi finishes his drink , and then leaves .
Captain Whitsun follows .
80 . SPACEPORT ALLEYWAY - GORDON - AQUILAE General Skywalker embraces Han Solo , the underground contact .
Han is a huge , green skinned monster with no nose and large gills .
HAN
You old stardog .
Took a war to get you out here ...
Whitsun arrives with Starkiller , the princess and her brothers , and the two puzzled androids .
GENERAL
It 's been too long .
We 've been through much together .
It will be good to have you out of retirement and back at my side .
How is Starkiller ?
( putting his arm around the young Captain Starkiller )
This is his son .
HAN
You 're all the old boy will talk about .
He 's still holding up .
Come , let 's get off the street .
The group enters a small doorway at the far end of the alleyway .
On the main street , within view of the doorway , giant Imperial air tanks and other military hardware rumble through the city .
Starving refugees sit in the gutters watching the immense display of force with a mixture of awe and terror .
The princess stops for a moment , and stares at her people , watching the might of the Empire .
The general escorts her through the doorway with the others .
81 . SLUM DWELLING - LIVING AREA - AQUILAE
The seedy dwelling is dark and dingy .
The group is greeted by three underground leaders , and the old Jedi , Kane Starkiller .
Captain Starkiller embraces his father as the underground leaders bow before the princess .
82 . SLUM DWELLING - DINING AREA - AQUILAE
The princess walks through the dining area followed by Whitsun and Starkiller , who carry the two sleeping princes .
The general sits at a large table finishing dinner with Han , Kane and the three underground leaders .
Whitsun returns from the bedroom .
GENERAL ( to Whitsun ) Captain , why do n't you take the androids into the other room for a game of chess ?
... I 'm sure they 'd enjoy it .
THREEPIO A wonderful idea .
Your kindness is greatly appreciated .
Whitsun escorts the two robots into the next room .
Datos , a thin , wizened old man , seems greatly relieved .
DATOS
You 're taking a great risk travelling with them .
This whole operation sounds bad to me .
I do n't trust the chrome companies .
Time is growing short .
The Empire 's attempts at control have already caused a great deal of suffering to our people .
Occo , a brash young rebel , about the same age as Captain Starkiller , slams his fist on the table .
OCCO
It must happen now !
We are ready !
Each day the Imperial S.B.T. finds and destroys a few more in the organization .
We cannot wait any longer .
GENERAL
Any uprising without a coordinated attack on the death star is out of the question .
HAN
He 's right .
As long as it's operational , any action down here would be meaningless .
We must proceed as planned .
Are the arrangements secure ?
Quist , the third member of the underground , sparks to life , and places several discs and badges on the table .
QUIST
All passenger transport has been suspended , so we 've arranged for you to travel as the crew of a Baltarian freighter .
The boys will have to be placed in suspended animation and hidden in shielded micro-packs .
It 's the only way we will be able to get them past the scanners .
DATOS
Were you able to acquire the necessary power packs ?
QUIST
It 's become a serious problem .
All power supplies have been restricted .
S - 4 units are impossible to come by .
HAN I know an agent who might be able to acquire them for us .
I 'll check with him .
It will be risky , but we 've no other choice .
83 . SPACEPORT OBSERVATION DECK -
LONDON , Dec. 12 — Nasdaq has started the takeover clock ticking for the London Stock Exchange today when it officially opened a $ 5.3 billion hostile offer .
Holders of shares in the exchange now have until Jan. 11 to tender their shares to Nasdaq , which is offering £ 12.43 ( $ 24.44 ) apiece for them .
Nasdaq , based in New York , already holds 28.75 percent of the London exchange , and needs to buy at least 22.25 percent more to get majority control .
Nasdaq can extend the deadline once , to Feb. 10 .
Robert Greifeld , chief executive of Nasdaq , said the offer represents “ full and fair value ” for the London exchange , balancing the current success of the business with new competitive threats .
London now attracts more international listings than New York does , but it could lose some of that business to a pan-European electronic exchange that a group of giant investment banks are planning to set up .
Management at the London Stock Exchange quickly rejected the bid , as it did Nasdaq ’s two previous overtures .
“ The board unanimously rejects Nasdaq ’s offer , as it substantially undervalues the exchange and fails to reflect its unique strategic position and the powerful earnings and operational momentum of the business , ” the London exchange said in a statement .
With DSL prices like these , it 's no wonder Borat left Kazakhstan behind .
1
A new report from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe ( PDF ) paints a grim picture of Internet access in Kazakhstan and shows how difficult life can be for those in poor and authoritarian countries who want to join the worldwide community of Internet users .
Consider the prices for Internet access , for one .
Most users ( and only four percent of the country even has access ) hook up through state - owned Kazakhtelecom , a company not concerned with competitive pricing for its services .
An unlimited dial - up plan costs about € 82 ( $ 111 ) in a country where the average monthly wage is € 292 ( $ 399 ) .
As for DSL , an unlimited 1.5 M bps connection costs € 2,458 ( $ 3,355 ) a month , and does n't even included the required ADSL modem .
Want a 6 M bps cable connection ?
It 'll cost you , to the tune of € 16,144 ( $ 22,032 ) a month .
As the OSCE report drily notes , this is more than a thousand times the price of such a connection in Western Europe .
This does n't just make Internet access expensive ; prices like this actually change the way that people use the Internet , as we 've seen in other countries .
Getting a connection is only the first step , though .
Internet policy decisions — such as canceling domain name registrations — can seem a bit , well , arbitrary .
Borat.kz , a domain registered by UK comedian Sacha Baron Cohen , was summarily shut down by the Association of IT Companies in December 2005 .
The reason : " We 've done this so he can't badmouth Kazakhstan under the .kz domain name , " the head of the association told Reuters .
" He can go and do whatever he wants at other domains . "
The government is also not real excited about web sites that publish " dirt , " " lies , " and threaten national security , and the country 's Minister of Information last year announced that a comprehensive policy on dealing with these issues would soon be announced .
Although it has yet to appear , Kazakhstan 's " Information Security Concept " was approved by President Nursultan Nazarbayev .
That " Concept " makes clear that Kazakhstan is faced with serious threats from " destructive illegal political , religious , and economic organizations , " " certain foreign political , economic , military , and information structures , " and " unlawful activities of political and economic organizations in creating , disseminating , and using information . "
Bloggers who have published items critical of the government have been charged under statutes that prohibit any violations of the president 's " honor and dignity . "
In 2003 , a journalist complained that one of his favorite web sites was being blocked .
According to the report , " the prosecutor opened a criminal case against him for compromising the security system of Kazakhtelecom .
He was beaten , sentenced and sent behind bars . "
As that last example indicates , content filtering is alive and well in the country .
For several years , the preferred method of blocking was apparently by IP address , but that came to an end in 2005 .
The method of choice is now " increasing the connection latency " so that undesirable sites take so long to load that users give up .
Kazakhstan has recently been attempting to raise its worldwide profile , and it has been a member of the OSCE since 1992 .
For both of those reasons , it may pay some attention to the report , which concludes by suggesting that the country get rid of the state telecom monopoly , that the OSCE should monitor networks in the country to see if Kazakhstan is still filtering content , and that the government there should work to " support affordable and safe hosting web sites with the national ISPs . "
1 Yes , I know .
Of course , Cheney has zero respect for the Constitution , so there 's no danger of that happening .
So , McGovern says , it time to impeach :
" There is no question in my mind that Cheney has committed impeachable offenses .
So has George Bush , " argues McGovern .
" Bush is much more impeachable than Richard Nixon was .
That 's been clear for some time .
There does not seem to be much sentiment for impeachment in Congress now , but around the country people are fed up with this administration . "
It 's even worse than that .
McGovern says that Nixon was not nearly as bad as Bush .
" I think this is the most lawless administration we 've ever had , " he says of the Bush - Cheney team .
That 's a strong statement coming from a man who tangled in 1972 with Nixon , and then saw Nixon 's presidency destroyed by the Watergate scandals .
But McGovern says there is no comparison .
" I 'd far rather have Nixon in the White House than these two fellows that we 've got now , " said the former three - term senator from South Dakota .
" Nixon did some horrible things , which led to the effort to impeach him .
But he simply was not as bad as Bush .
On just about every level I can think of , Bush 's actions are more impeachable than were those of Nixon . "
This is the same George McGovern who , in 1970 , co-sponsored an amendment with Republican Sen. Mark Hatfield of Oregon that would have ended the Vietnam War .
On Sept. 1 , 1970 , just before the amendment was voted down , McGovern delivered an emotional speech on the Senate floor that would be just as true today :
" Every senator in this chamber is partly responsible for sending 50,000 young Americans to an early grave .
This chamber reeks of blood .
Every Senator here is partly responsible for that human wreckage at Walter Reed and Bethesda Naval and all across our land - young men without legs , or arms , or genitals , or faces or hopes . "
" There are not very many of these blasted and broken boys who think this war is a glorious adventure .
Do not talk to them about bugging out , or national honor or courage .
It does not take any courage at all for a congressman , or a senator , or a president to wrap himself in the flag and say we are staying in Vietnam , because it is not our blood that is being shed .
But we are responsible for those young men and their lives and their hopes . "
" And if we do not end this damnable war those young men will some day curse us for our pitiful willingness to let the Executive carry the burden that the Constitution places on us . "
" So before we vote , let us ponder the admonition of Edmund Burke , the great parliamentarian of an earlier day : " A contentious man would be cautious how he dealt in blood . "
You can just imagine how that speech was received by the Senate in 1970 .
According to historian Robert Mann , McGovern 's brief , passionate speech shocked his Senate colleagues .
As McGovern took his seat , most senators sat in stunned silence .
" You could have heard a pin drop , " recalled John Holum , McGovern 's principal staff advisor on Vietnam .
As the Senate prepared to begin voting on the amendment , one senator approached McGovern and indignantly told him that he had been personally offended by the speech .
McGovern replied , " That 's what I meant to do . "
It 's a real shame George McGovern is n't in the Senate today .
We need senators who are not afraid to offend .
Outspoken American conservative Newt Gingrich has apologized for saying this week that some of the Sept. 11 hijackers entered the United States from Canada .
Gingrich , a former Republican speaker in the U.S. House of Representatives , retracted the comments on Wednesday after Canadian Ambassador Frank McKenna sent him a letter .
" Please accept my apology to the Canadian people for perpetuating the error ; one I am sure that has been very painful to them , " said Gingrich in a reply to McKenna .
He told the ambassador he " deeply regrets " what has become a " widespread inaccuracy . "
Speaking Tuesday on the Fox News political show Hannity & Colmes , Gingrich said : " Far more of the 9/11 terrorists came across from Canada than from Mexico . "
None of the 19 hijackers entered the U.S. from either Canada or Mexico , information confirmed by former U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft and the 9/11 Commission investigating the attacks , wrote McKenna in his letter to Gingrich .
The comments " perpetuate an urban legend that can take on a life of its own , especially when repeated by people whose opinions are deeply respected in the United States , " he wrote .
" Canadians and Americans are great friends .
And great friends can tell it like it is , " he said .
" In the interest of that friendship and to set the record straight , I ask that you retract your statement . "
Despite all the self - denial and fabricated accounts of endless machismo and sexual prowess that this article will no doubt provoke from the less insecure members of the male gender , it has to be said that being a guy is , at times , pretty tough .
The difficulty does n’t necessarily come from trying to fulfill the accepted social definition of what it is to be a “ man ” ( though there is that ) , or the difficulties of having an external sex organ ( there ’s that , too ) , but simply , and most importantly , in how our biological makeup affects us in all aspects of our pursuit of the opposite sex .
From our attempts to woo them to the actual intercourse we so desperately want to have with them , there are several things about men in relation to sex and romance that make the whole ordeal much harder for men than for women .
These are some of them .
Men are driven by sex at all times
Always .
It ’s not something we ’re necessarily proud of , and it ’s not even an impulse we necessarily want ( the old adage of a man ’s body not having enough blood to run a brain and a penis at the same time comes to mind ) , but it is there nonetheless .
The male body tends to treat semen like some sort of poison – no matter what , it must be expelled .
Whether by disposing of it in a Dixie cup at a sperm bank , dumping it into a condom during intercourse , or by using it to impregnate a member of the opposite sex , men are driven by a truly crippling need for sex , almost all the time .
Women and / or guilty , politically - correct males might attempt to say that women and men have nearly - identical sexual urges ( thereby chalking up womankind ’s lower levels of horniness to some sort of gender - wide mental strength of character ) , but it is simply not true .
The first American
Pie movie included an 18 - year - old female character who had never had an orgasm of any sort .
The character ( played , ironically , by Tara Reid ) was viewed as slightly unusual in her sexual inexperience , but the fact remains : the character was plausible .
A female could hypothetically live to the age of 18 or thereabouts without ever having felt the intense , painful sexual urges of their male counterparts , and thereby never having had an orgasm ( lord knows I dated a woman like that ) .
For any male not under the watchful eye of a guilt - cultivating religion , such inexperience is unthinkable , almost impossible .
While we are not singled - minded mongoloids who think only about sex at all times ( no , we do n’t think about it every seven seconds ) , the desire is nonetheless always present in the back of our minds , for better or worse – usually worse .
When a woman has an uncontrollable desire to have sex all the time at the expense of her hygiene , safety , and personal health , we call it “ nymphomania . ”
When a man experiences the same thing , we call it “ Tuesday . ”
Men can only have one orgasm
It ’s odd , then , that despite the fact that men seem to have immeasurably larger sexual appetites , the actual act of fornication is much less enjoyable for us than it is for women .
Men are only allowed one orgasm – thrust , squirt , done – and the whole thing is finished in 3 - 8 seconds .
Women , on the other hand , can have multiple orgasms with no pause in between .
According to some stuff I found ,
“ Women are capable of sustained orgasm , called status orgasmus .
These start with a 2 to 4 second " spastic contraction " and last twenty to sixty seconds .
Masters and Johnson ( 1966 ) published a chart of one woman who experienced a 43 - second orgasm , consisting of at least 25 successive contractions . ”
Not to mention ,
“ Wardell B. Pomeroy recounts the case of one extraordinary woman who had near - godlike powers in the sack .
His words : ‘ I remember one woman who was capable of from fifteen to twenty orgasms in twenty minutes .
Even the most casual contact could arouse a sexual response in her .
Observing her both in masturbation and in sexual intercourse , we found that in intercourse her first orgasm occurred with two to five seconds after entry . ’ ”
Now , there are obviously many men who can have orgasms within two seconds of commencing sexual intercourse ( more on that later ) , and obviously this woman ’s case is not typical , but still ; women can potentially have one orgasm per minute ( if not more ) , and their orgasms last , as a minimum , twice as long as the male orgasm .
This may not come as much as a surprise , but men are physically incapable of enjoying sex on the same level women do .
We do n't even get close .
In addition to serving as another unfortunate side effect of being a man , this should prove that the male gender ’s insatiable lust for sex is not a mental characteristic , but a biological imperative – we do n’t have as good a time as women do whilst in the sack , so why would we consciously want to have sex so much more frequently than they do ?
Quite simply , we do n’t – our genes do .
And yet , we are blamed for it anyway .
Men can “ fail ” at having sex
At the risk of quoting a monologue from Clerks , female participation in sex can ( but definitely should n’t be ) reduced to simply “ being there . ”
So long as the woman is present , has a vagina , and allows the male access to said vagina , she is having sex .
The sex may be bad , or awkward , or she might not actually climax , but when a woman has a penis inserted into her vagina , she is , at least technically , having sex .
Men , on the other hand , have a myriad of problems that can result in a failed attempt at having sex .
Men can experience a sudden bout of erectile dysfunction , thus making intercourse impossible in the first place .
Alternatively , men can prematurely ejaculate and end the game before it begins : in addition to the massive stress and expectation to bring a woman to orgasm , men are simultaneously forced to deal with their own physical problems and – dare I say – shortcomings when it comes to a roll in the hay .
I would never pretend that bringing a woman to climax is not a difficult , lengthy , and often tedious experience for the woman , and this is what makes sex so difficult for men – men have to juggle the pleasure of the woman ( assuming the man in case is a real man and does n’t engage in sex solely for his , and nobody else ’s , enjoyment ) along with the real possibility that they might actually fail at having sex .
Women , hypothetically , only need to ( A ) be present , and ( B ) pray that their partner has at least a hint of sexual prowess .
Women hate us
Norah Vincent is a lesbian journalist .
I say this not because “ lesbian ” is one of the only things one might need to know about her , but to bring to mind the cliché that most lesbians , to some extent , hate or dislike men .
Vincent ’s book , A Self - Made Man , chronicles the year and a half she spent disguised as a man named “ Ned , ” in order to find out how the lives of men are different from the lives of women .
While most of her findings could have been easily figured out without all the effort involved in cross - dressing ( incidentally , men are less vocal about emotions than women ) , one particular finding is especially interesting :
As “ Ned ” went to clubs to hang out with “ his ” male friends , Norah Vincent would occasionally talk to women while still in the guise of being a man – not necessarily to hit on them , but as a means of gauging reactions to certain conversational topics when the conversation is initiated by a man .
After a few months of this , Vincent evidently began to despise women ; no matter what she wanted to talk about , and no matter what her intentions were , nearly all of the women she talked to either blew her off , or were insanely rude and / or condescending to her .
Without even stopping to hear what “ Ned ” had to say , the women in the nightclubs “ Ned ” visited immediately assumed he was a lecherous jerk looking only for sex , and treated him like shit as a result .
To summarize : regular women were such assholes to a lesbian when she was dressed like a man that she began to sympathize with men and actually hate women .
If that is n’t proof - positive that heterosexual women tend to despise and generally act like jerks to men more than men despise and generally act like jerks to women , I do n’t know what is .
Sexists and assholes are obviously abound in both genders , but we 're talking about immediate reactions from one member of a sex to one member of another .
Men may act like jerks to women , but they usually do n't tend to do it just because a woman wanted to talk to them .
Women tend to despise men because of all the aforementioned reasons , many of which are beyond our control .
Despite the fact that we have shitty orgasms and that sex for us can be a stressful experience , our genes still perpetually , forcefully , unfairly push us along in pursuit of sex .
As a result of these things , men tend to be more desperate than women when it comes to finding a girlfriend and / or mate – finding a woman without a boyfriend is usually a sign of pickiness or personal choice , as there is always at least one man a woman , no matter how ugly she is , who will be able to attract a man of some sort .
Finding a guy without a girlfriend is usually a sign of a lack of options .
Thanks to the human male ’s biologically - imposed desperation and urges , women have far more choice in choosing men , and far less pressure in doing so ( outside of the natural stomp - stomp - stomp of their biological clock , anyway ) .
There ’s a great scene in the first season of the TV show Extras where the two main characters ( Andy and Maggie ) have a conversation about Maggie ’s desire to date a man whose wife died in a war .
The conversation goes something like this :
“ Forget it .
Never date a man whose wife has been murdered .
You ’ll never live up .
Pick someone else . ”
“ Well who , then ? ”
“ It ’s just that easy for you , is n’t it ? ”
Yeah .
It is .
White gold .
That ’s what some call one of the most - eaten seafoods because it 's so lucrative .
A.k.a. shrimp , the new gold rush has reached landlocked desert farms in Arizona .
“ What heat - stroked dummkopf came up with that insane notion ? ” I find myself exclaiming at the thought of all that water .
“ Have n’t they heard the word drought ?
Or sustainability ? ”
Well , actually , it ’s not quite as certifiable as it sounds .
The farmers at Wood ’s Brothers – one of four shrimp farms in Arizona – pump water from deep underground .
It ’s a little too salty to use as potable water because it is a vestige of a sea that covered the region eons ago .
The water flows into shrimp ponds enclosed in greenhouses to reduce evaporation .
And the part that really makes it work : the waste water irrigates crops which would need water anyway – the precious molecules simply do double duty , once for shrimp to swim and poop in , and the other to water and fertilize plants .
They claim their shrimp are “ the world ’s best - tasting shrimp . ”
Their crustaceans do n’t eat a jot of hormones , antibiotics , pesticides , or a whole bunch of other junk that almost all aquacultured shrimp eat in order to stay healthy and grow quickly .
I ca n’t corroborate the gourmet taste as I have not tried them , but I do find the notion of organic shrimp rather inviting since the FDA discovered illegal antibiotics had contaminated imports from China .
90 % of all US shrimp is imported , with just over 10 % coming from China , which is all farmed .
China is n’t the only culprit .
In 2001 , Thailand shipped shrimp to Sweden that were tainted with illegal antibiotics in their flesh .
An article in the New York Times today reports over $ 20 billion - worth of food imports were halted by the FDA in 2006 alone for everything from salmonella to plain old " filth " .
On the list is candy , shrimp , spices , crackers , noodles .
The list goes on .
But lets stick to shrimp before we get too overwhelmed by the dubious nature of our food supply .
As far as seafood goes , these little decapods have one of the lowest mercury levels , making them recommended - eating for pregnant women and kids .
They ’re told to stay away from many fish for fear of heavy metal poisoning .
Unfortunately , aside form being ( usually ) safe to eat , they generally devastate the regions where they ’re prevalent .
The environmental devastation shrimp farms cause is bad , really bad .
I wo n’t cover the depressing list here as many others have written about it .
Suffice it to say that the problems are primarily involved in whacking down mangrove forests to make way for the ponds , and churning out millions of gallons of effluent that not only spread disease and pollution into the sea , but also neighboring shrimp farms .
There is no silver bullet that will suddenly make shrimp farming completely environmentally friendly .
However , there are a number of groups who are certainly trying to make it so .
Researchers at the University of Arizona and Texas A&M have worked long and hard on the system that the afore - mentioned Woods Brothers Shrimp Farm uses .
Closed loop farms cut down water usage and effluent discharge by cleaning the water so it is used over and over again in an almost continuous cycle .
The system is expensive to install , so do n’t expect it to sprout up all over the developing world where most of the damage is done .
A concept quite likely to catch on in developing countries is in operation on a small scale on the coast of the Sonoran Desert in Mexico .
Here , seawater flows in from the Sea of Cortez into shrimp ponds .
When the water exits it is now laden with feces and debris and floods across fields of crops that grow on saltwater .
They grow lush from the nutrients in the water , turning the nearly barren coastal desert emerald green .
The crop cleans the water somewhat , which then flows through mangroves that are planted like a plantation to be used for lumber and animal feed ( goats , sheep and camels love the leaves ) .
The water filters through the ground and eventually makes its way back to sea , totally clean .
The University of Arizona initiated the idea a couple of decades ago .
The Arizona - based Seawater Foundation is now commercializing it .
They say that concerns about flooding the desert with seawater are unfounded .
Many coastal deserts are already too salty for freshwater farming .
Also , there ’s underground seawater in these areas , which freshwater floats on .
Thus , adding seawater wo n’t contaminate freshwater reserves .
Camels proved the point when the group tried a project along the Red Sea coast in Africa a few years ago .
Soon after seawater flood irrigated fields , the animals came in droves to drink from a small pool of water that appeared in an area previously dry as the proverbial bone .
Seawater farming can be emulated along most coastal deserts , where freshwater is generally too scarce for much traditional agriculture and food aid is often a must .
Gotta love it !
CHICAGO , July 11 - Joe Neglia was a retired government intelligence worker with Parkinson 's disease when he suddenly developed a troublesome gambling habit .
After losing thousands of dollars playing slot machines near his California home several times a day for nearly two years , Mr. Neglia says he stumbled across an Internet report linking a popular Parkinson 's drug he used with compulsive gambling .
" I thought , ' Oh my God , this must be it , " ' he said .
Three days after stopping the drug , Mirapex , " all desire to gamble just went away completely . "
" I felt like I had my brain back , " he continued .
A Mayo Clinic study published yesterday in July 's Archives of Neurology describes 11 other Parkinson 's patients who developed the problem while taking drugs for the disease from 2002 to 2004 .
Doctors have since identified 14 additional Mayo patients with the problem , said Dr. Maryellen Leann Dodd , a Mayo psychiatrist who was the lead author of the study .

Running C programs on a Lisp OS
This paper describes a way to run the enormous installed base of programs written in C , assembly , and other similar languages on such an OS .
The implementation is by no means without penalty -- every memory access would incur bounds - checking and data - conversion overhead .
My wild - ass guess is that this will slow down most programs by a factor of between 10 and 1,000 .
See the end for why I guess this .
C Pointer Semantics
In C , every parameter to a function , every local variable , every statically - allocated variable , and every object allocated on the free store has an address .
These addresses are interchangeable ; it must be possible to write a function that takes the address of any of the above types of variables and writes a value to the pointed - to variable .
Furthermore , most C programs assume that different types of data live in the same memory space , and do things such as copying an array of integers using memcpy ( ) .
However , there are two exceptions to this everything - must - go - in - one - memory - space rule : function addresses and return values .
While most C implementations put the addresses of functions in the same namespace as the addresses of data , few C programs -- except those that access hardware functions directly -- assume this to be the case .
This is fortunate , since I 'm not sure how I could implement this in Java otherwise .
Return values are strictly rvalues , and cannot have their addresses taken .
RAM implementation
It might be better , under some circumstances , to implement RAM as a sparse array , the way most modern OSes do -- enabling the stack to start at the top of the address space , for instance , and enabling unmapped space to cause errors when accessed .
This would be much slower in software than in hardware , however .
However , this approach -- especially if pursued enthusiastically -- would find most pointer bugs sooner or later .
Function call and return
As an optimization , parameters and locals that never have their addresses taken can be passed directly , rather than being pushed onto the slower stack in the memory array .
In general , parameters can be passed directly ; if the called function needs the addresses of the parameters , it can push them itself .
In general , the memory array should be passed to all C functions ; it should not be bound to an atom .
This makes it possible to run more than one C program simultaneously , in separate memory spaces .
Calling native Lisp or Java code is likely to require some sort of argument unmarshalling ; it may or may not be necessary to pass the RAM to the native code , and it may be necessary to pass other native objects to it .
Also , it 's likely to require some sort of return - value marshalling , since C does n't allow rich return values .
Function pointers
However , you can store indices into an array , and ( in Lisp ) you can store pointers to functions in an array .
When linking a C program , you need only insert a reference to each function whose address is taken into this array -- this will work equally well for C and native functions .
In Java , you can't store function pointers , but you can do function indirection through interfaces .
Each C function can be declared as a class with a single call ( ) method and no instance variables ; an instance of each of these classes can be stored in a function - pointer array .
Native - Java methods may require an object to work on ; a stub class with a call ( ) function can be generated which takes an object reference as its first argument .
Native objects
This poses a memory - management problem .
The environments I 've been discussing generally do garbage - collecting memory management ; when an object is no longer referenced by any pointers , it is asked to release any resources it controls , and then it gets returned to the pool of free memory .
Once a native object has been inserted into the native - object array , it may not be possible to determine when it is no longer referenced in the C program .
I expect the life story of a native - object pointer will go something like this :
C function written to interface with native Lisp / Java facilities calls a native function to get a pointer to a native object .
C function stores it in a data structure in C RAM somewhere .
Another C function , also written to interface with native Lisp / Java facilities , calls some native functions , passing the native object to them .
( How this is done is the business of the argument marshalling code . )
Repeat as necessary .
Another C function , also written to interface with native Lisp / Java facilities , calls an invalidate - native - object - pointer function , which removes the reference to the object from the native - object array .
If the last step is forgotten , we have a memory leak .
C programs are very prone to memory leaks ; further discussion of memory leaks and how to fix them could greatly extend this paper .
See http://www.geodesic.com/greatcircle/index.html for more information .
Performance
Interpreted languages vary in efficiency .
Pre -8.0 versions of Tcl typically had performance penalty factor of about 1,000 ; byte - compiled Java typically has a performance penalty factor of about 20 ; threaded Forth code typically has a performance penalty factor of about 5 .
All of these are off the top of my head , and I have n't checked any of them .
I 'm assuming there 's no performance penalty for writing the bounds - checking code in Lisp instead of C or assembly .
This is somewhat optimistic .
It might be possible to reduce this performance penalty in a few ways .
A l Gore is a funny guy .
And , for his $ 175,000 speaking fee , he tells this story : after leaving the White House and heading back to Tennessee sans motorcade – “ in a rented Ford Taurus , ” he sniffs –he and Tipper stop to get a bite to eat at a Shoney ’s , “ which , as you may know , is a low - cost family restaurant . ”
The people in the restaurant “ made a huge fuss …over Tipper . ”
Then , a man spies Gore and stage - whispers , “ Did n’t he used to be the Vice President ?
He ’s fallen so low . ”
Peals of delight from the audience .
Gore smiles back .
It ’s a nice moment .

But wait , there ’s more .
Later , he goes on , he attempts the same story in Nigeria .
Punch line , laughter , applause–no problem .
The next day , an official at the airport yells out to him , “ Call Washington ! ” Hmmm .
“ What could be wrong in Washington ? ” he muses , scratching his chin .
“ That ’s when I remembered it could be a lot of things . ”
The crowd goes wild .
Come to find out , Gore explains , a reporter in Nigeria had lost a bit of the story in translation .
“ Vice President Al Gore announced yesterday that he and his wife , Tipper , have opened a low - cost family restaurant called Shoney ’s and will be running it themselves , ” Gore intones .
By the time he landed in the United States , the story had hit the wires , and he was–again –the butt of jokes on Leno and Letterman .
Three days later , he received a handwritten note from Bill Clinton , congratulating him on the Shoney ’s deal .
“ We like to celebrate each other ’s successes in life , ” Gore deadpans to uproarious laughter .
Funny guy , indeed .
In one well - delivered anecdote , Gore manages to make fun of himself , the election , his relationship with his former boss , the Bush administration , and the media–and still come out on top .
Gone is the robo - candidate who provided fodder for conservative bile and late - night merrymaking .
( For a good time , google “ SNL ” and “ lockbox . ” )
After the 2000 election , Gore might have slunk away to a loser ’s life : a memoir here , a visiting professorship there , the occasional keynote speech or celebrity golf tournament .
Instead , in what may be the greatest brand makeover in history , Gore is being hailed as a visionary who was right about everything from global warming to Iraq .
At 59 , he ’s an Academy Award winner , a bestselling author , a front - runner for the Nobel Prize , and a concert promoter who turned out to be a bigger rock star at this year ’s Grammys than the rock stars themselves .
What no one is talking about is that he has also become a stunningly successful businessman–and that has fueled his comeback .
Since his nonelection , Gore has become a millionaire many times over , bringing him , in financial terms , shoulder to shoulder with the C - suite denizens he used to hit up for campaign cash .
In addition to the steady flow of six - figure speaking gigs , he has become an insider at two of the hottest companies on the planet : at Google , where he signed on as an adviser in 2001 , pre-IPO ( and received stock options now reportedly worth north of $ 30 million ) , and at Apple , where he joined the board in 2003 ( and got stock options now valued at about $ 6 million ) .
He enjoyed a big payday as vice chairman of an investment firm in L.A. , and , more recently , started a cable - television company and an asset - management firm , both of which are becoming quiet forces in their fields .
Financial disclosure documents released before the 2000 election put the Gore family ’s net worth at $ 1 million to $ 2 million .
After years of public service–and four kids needing high - priced educations–Al and Tipper used to fret occasionally about money .
Not anymore .
They have a new multimillion - dollar home in a tony section of Nashville and a family home in Virginia , and have recently bought a multimillion - dollar condo at the St. Regis condo / hotel in San Francisco .
Available data indicate a net worth well in excess of $ 100 million .
It ’s good to be the president , even metaphorically , of Al Gore Inc .
And that helps explain why he ’s wary of reentering the political fray .
Here , then , is the untold tale of Gore ’s unlikely rebirth .
advertisement
Gore greets me at the door of his suite at the Regency Hotel in New York in late May : “ I have n’t seen you since Orlando ! ”
He is in the city to promote his new book , The Assault on Reason .
I ’d first been introduced to him several weeks earlier at the Tribeca Film Festival , and we chatted again briefly in Orlando , Florida , at a tech - geek conference of Adobe software enthusiasts ( who were treated to his global - warming speech , including the Shoney ’s bit ) .
But this is our first official interview , and he begins with his game face on .
Ever polite , he has been fielding questions about politics nonstop–including at a taping of the PBS show Charlie Rose the night before .
He visibly relaxes , though , when we start talking about global business .
“ I have really enjoyed the business world much more than I expected , ” Gore says , settling back in his chair .
He speaks animatedly about incentive structures and how information flow creates opportunities .
One problem he had in politics , he says , was identifying an issue too early – “ ‘ predawn ’ is the term I use ” –to be able to act on it .
But “ in the business world , particularly at a time when things are moving so swiftly , if you can see it early , you can make a business opportunity out of it . ”
He pauses .
“ For whatever reason , the business world rewards a long - term perspective more than the political world does . ”
By his own account , his makeover has been less the result of a conscious strategy than of a few smart initiatives that happened to ripen in sync–from Google ’s towering growth to the recent profitability of his media startup , Current TV .
“ I ’ve remarked to Tipper how amazing it is that both Current and Generation [ Investment Management ] have reached the next stage of their development at almost exactly the same time . ”
What defines the ventures he has taken part in , he says , is “ a revolutionary and transformational concept ” in industries that badly need change .
But did he expect such enormous financial success ?
He pauses .
“ It ’s all been a pleasant surprise .
And a lot of fun . ”
That ’s not how things looked in the first years after that trip back to Nashville .
In the spring of 2001 , Gore returned from a vacation in the Mediterranean with an unfortunate beard , and the late - night jokesters had a field day .
His first business move–signing on as an adviser to Google–proved prescient , but Google was n’t yet a powerhouse .
Almost no one took note .
( On his first day at Google , Gore recalls with a laugh , “ Larry [ Page ] and Sergey [ Brin ] and the entire executive team had false beards on . ” )
His most public effort was dusting off a slide show on global warming he had put together in 1989 .
It was full of depressing data about melting ice caps and killer hurricanes– not a likely vehicle to spark a resurrection .
As recently as May 2004 , he took some serious ribbing for presenting a version of it at an event timed to coincide with the goofy global - warming film The Day After Tomorrow .
A few months later , when television producer turned environmental activist Laurie David invited her A - list pals to see the slide show , she had a hard time getting them to attend .
“ People were still mad about the election , ” she recalls .
“ And nobody cared about global warming . ”
What has changed since then is , in part , political : John Kerry fared worse than Gore at the polls , and President George W. Bush has seen his approval ratings tumble .
Hurricane Katrina played a role , too , stirring fears of climate change .
But Gore ’s business efforts have also come together in a crescendo that cannot be ignored .
In fact , to understand the personal drive and vision behind Gore ’s revival–and the philosophy that continues to take his business , if not his political , brand forward –the place to begin is with his two entrepreneurial efforts , Current TV and Generation .

Joel Hyatt is comfortably ensconced in his loft - style San Francisco office at Current TV , Al Gore ’s now - profitable cable network .
Hyatt , the CEO , is a longtime friend of Gore ’s who made his millions by founding Hyatt Legal Plans , a provider of low - cost legal services that was acquired by MetLife in 1997 .
He has taught entrepreneurship at Stanford ’s business school and chaired the Democratic finance committee during the 2000 election .
He does n’t talk easily about his front - row view of Gore ’s disputed loss , and when he does , his voice shakes with emotion .
“ It ’s hard to move on from something like that , ” he says .
But he did .
After the election , Hyatt began talking with Gore about the sorry state of television and the role that the broadcast media play in the public sphere .
“ The line between news and entertainment is blurred , ” as Gore now puts it .
“ Much of TV is mind deadening .
It ’s a one - way conduit of knowledge . ”
The two men discussed what Hyatt calls “ an utter lack of innovation in the media industry ” –a barely disguised oligopoly , as they saw it , controlling both content and competition .
“ We decided that we wanted to build a new kind of media company to democratize–small d–television first and the media industry generally , ” Hyatt says .
They would give viewers from 18 to 34 the means to create and control what went on the air–a user - generated model now familiar thanks to the likes of YouTube and MySpace , but a shot in the dark for TV back in 2002 .
Undaunted , Gore and Hyatt went looking to buy a cable - TV network .
The effort quickly became a disaster .
Meetings were taken , favors were called in , but nobody wanted them .
“ We were told repeatedly , ‘ You ’re not going to start a cable - television company , ' ” Hyatt recalls .
“ ‘ There ’s no room in the industry for you .
Period . '”
The only possibility they could find was a yawner of a Canadian news network , called Newsworld International , or NWI , owned by the French company Vivendi .
Yet even here , Gore and Hyatt were initially rebuffed .
Gore had to tap then French president Jacques Chirac to arrange a meeting with Vivendi executives .
Negotiations dragged on for months .
“ There were probably at least seven or eight times when [ the deal ] was dead and all but buried , ” Gore recalls .
Finally , after nearly a year of nail biting and a cameo appearance by Barry Diller , who owned a part of the entities –Gore lobbied him in person–Gore and Hyatt snagged NWI in May 2004 for $ 70 million .
( Their investment partners included former Goldman Sachs senior director Philip Murphy , who is now the Democratic finance committee chair ; Richard Blum , husband of California Senator Dianne Feinstein ; Sun Microsystems cofounder Bill Joy ; and Bob Pittman , former chief operating officer of AOL Time Warner . )
They had the network , renamed Current TV , but they still did n’t know precisely what it would air .
At a meeting around Hyatt ’s kitchen table in the summer of 2004 , the nascent management team kicked around ideas–and kicked them to the curb .
One option was to give 200 talented unknowns all around the world video equipment , train them , and set them loose to tell stories .
Hyatt and Gore ’s response : Not good enough .
Gore was looking for something “ transformational , ” recalls Current exec Joanna Drake Earl , a veteran of Paul Allen ’s Moxi media startup .
“ Transformational ? ”
Earl remembers with a laugh .
“ I mean … that ’s hard to manage to . ”
As Current ’s August 1 , 2005 , launch date approached –the old Canadian news programming would end July 31 –tensions ran high .
“ At one point , ” says president of programming David Neuman , who had produced sitcoms on NBC and Fox , “ I got down on my hands and knees and begged for more time . ”
Finally , the team agreed on a formula .
They would hire a crew of “ vanguard journalists , ” but work toward the goal of creating a network largely shaped by its viewers , via a Web site that functioned like a production community .
Current TV , Gore ’s cable channel , turned a profit in only two years .
Today , less than two years in , at least 30 % of the network ’s content is viewer generated , called VC2 .
Amateur filmmakers , some in their teens , upload three - to eight - minute documentary - style nonfiction segments , called “ pods , ” to the Current Web site .
Online modules help aspiring filmmakers navigate everything from framing a shot to negotiating music rights .
The online community comments on the videos and votes to “ green - light ” pods that they want to see on air .
Makers of the pods that are aired get $ 500 ; Current gets a library of content to use in perpetuity –with no production costs .
advertisement
The result is surprisingly engaging and unlike anything else on TV .
The pods shuffle through everything from cutting - edge bands and dogsled races , to African villagers struggling with HIV / AIDs and dispatches from soldiers serving in Iraq .
Current has also worked with advertisers to create viewer - generated commercials , or VCAMs .
To date , some 32 VCAMs have hit the air .
“ Once we heard the concept , we got on board early on , ” says Brett Dennis , director of media marketing for T - Mobile , which also runs traditional spots on the network .
“ It provided us with a groundbreaking way to reach customers , and to encourage them to engage with our brand . ”
Plus , it ’s delightfully cheap : $ 1,000 for every commercial that gets on the air .
( If the ad is distributed on other networks , the fee can go up to $ 50,000 . )
T - Mobile has already selected three VCAMs , and hopes to do more ; other VCAM advertisers include Pop Secret , Sony , and L’Oréal .
Says Dennis : “ It ’s the best example we ’ve seen of the convergence of a traditional network model and the user - generated Internet model . ”
Gore is clearly happy with Current TV ’s progress and optimistic about its future .
“ The more people who are watching , and the more people who are contributing , the higher and higher the quality goes of the pods from which we select . ”
He adds , “ One of the happy problems we ’ve had is explaining Current TV to investors and distributors .
Nobody would believe how low our production costs were , or how good the business model was . ”
Current TV is now in 38 million U.S. homes via DirecTV , Comcast , Dish Network , AT&T U - Verse , and Time Warner Cable .
Its expansion this year to the UK and Ireland on BSkyB and Virgin Media will put it in another 8.2 million homes .
“ We have a belief that explicit recognition of environmental , social , governance , economic , and ethical factors affect business , ” says Blood .
Current TV is making money , about a 10 % margin on cash flow , after less than two years , according to analyst estimates ; new cable networks typically take four to six years to go into the black .
“ Partly it ’s because they inherited some distribution on DirecTV when they acquired NWI , ” says Derek Baine , a senior analyst with Kagan Research .
He estimates that Current ’s license fee is about 12 cents per month per subscriber , roughly what an established player like Lifetime gets , and projects that advertising , now 24 % of revenue , will pass the industry average of 43 % by 2010 .
“ I think their model has made other networks sit up and pay attention . ”
While Gore was struggling to launch his cable network in late 2003 , he was also moving on another front : starting an investment firm based on a new definition of sustainability .
Metropolitan West Financial , an L.A. - based asset - management outfit where he ’d been vice chairman for two years , had just been sold to Wachovia .
( Gore ’s former Senate chief of staff , Peter Knight , was a Met West managing director and had recruited him . )
Gore had his hefty payout from the deal , plus a desire “ to incorporate sustainability values into the financial - services work that I was doing . ”
Goldman ’s Murphy introduced him to David Blood , then CEO of Goldman Sachs Asset Management .
“ They were both talking to me about similar things , ” Murphy recalls , “ deep conversations about emerging markets , sustainability issues , and new ways of making investments .
They were both asking , ‘ Can this make money ?
Can this be a business ? ' ”
“ I was interested in creating a business around investing , which I love , and philanthropy , ” Blood says .
He and Gore met many times , both in London , where Blood is based , and in the United States , to talk about values and skills .
“ It ’s not exactly like choosing a spouse , ” Blood says of selecting a business partner .
But it ’s close .
“ You have to know that you can work together , have the difficult conversations .
You need 100 % trust and confidence . ”
They worked together on a statement of values for their company , which they named Generation Investment Management .
When they launched in August 2004 , they made no move to attract outside investors –which , despite the catcalls from Gore detractors , was entirely by design , says Blood .
“ We spent a year playing with our own money , ” he says–a pool of about $ 100 million from himself , Gore , Knight ( whom Gore brought in from Met West ) , and three other founding partners .
“ We did n’t want to raise money first and then come up with an idea , ” Blood says .
“ What we really needed to do was invent a new language . ”
advertisement
Rather than rely on short - term earnings projections , they thought long - term investment potential–and good management –could be better gauged by looking at factors such as whether a company was preparing for a carbon - neutral future .
Environmental stewardship , though , is just part of how Generation defines sustainability .
“ We think about how businesses attract and retain employees , governance , branding ; how they operate in the community ; and how all of that drives their business strategy , ” Blood explains .
“ We have a belief that explicit recognition of environmental , social , governance , economic , and ethical factors affect business . ”
Generation ’s research team , led by Colin le Duc , has both environmental economists and traditional buy - side equity analysts , who have learned to ask a wider range of questions of the companies they cover .
The firm plans to build a long - term portfolio of only 30 to 50 companies .
Blood claims that returns so far have exceeded expectations , although he wo n’t divulge specifics .
( See “ An Inconvenient Portfolio ” for some of the firm ’s holdings . )
The firm now has nearly $ 1 billion under management , from 15 institutions , plus a few individuals .
And it has turned down some investors .
Says Blood : “ Anybody who is expecting a monthly report on how their stocks are doing is n’t for us . ”
A few million people saw An Inconvenient Truth , ” says Kevin Wall .
“ I plan to deliver 2 billion eyeballs . ”
Wall is the producer of this summer ’s Live Earth concerts–nine simultaneous events across seven continents on July 7 , on the model of Live 8 , to raise awareness for global warming and money for the Alliance for Climate Protection , a nonpartisan advocacy group of which Gore is chairman .
“ The artists are not being paid , I ’m not being paid , ” Wall notes .
His biggest unpaid superstar is Gore himself .
On the night of the Grammys this year , Gore went from dressing room to dressing room backstage , recruiting performers .
He was in the midst of lobbying the Red Hot Chili Peppers when he was called to the stage to present the award for best rock album –to the Red Hot Chili Peppers .
When the group came out to accept the award , they told Gore they ’d do the concert .
Live Earth was inspired , Wall says , by An Inconvenient Truth .
After he saw the film at its premiere , he talked to NBC Universal chief Jeff Zucker about broadcasting the concerts across the NBC properties and lined up the BBC and MSN as partners , then reached out to Gore .
“ I told Al , ‘ I do n’t need anything from you , I just want to hand you the mike . ' ”
That Gore now finds himself the celebrity draw is ironic , given that his star “ performance ” revolves around a slideshow .
When Laurie David and the documentary team she ’d assembled –director Davis Guggenheim , producer Lawrence Bender ( of the Kill Bill movies ) , producer Scott Burns ( famous for the “ Got Milk ? ” ads ) , and coproducer Lesley Chilcott–went to San Francisco to lobby Gore about making a movie , he was reluctant .
His global - warming spiel was just a lecture , he said .
How would it work as a film ?
advertisement
He relented , though–in part because he was so passionate about the slide show .
Working first with flip charts and a slide carousel , and now with Apple ’s Keynote software , Gore found he could talk to people in his own voice , without the handlers , image consultants , and intermediaries that turned him into a sound - bitten , earth - toned version of himself in 2000 .
Gore was happy to continue traveling the country with his slides , but David had a more aggressive agenda : “ Let ’s get it out there ! ”
The production schedule for An Inconvenient Truth was so compressed that Gore joked it was like making “ Kill Al , Vol .
Three , ” a friendly jibe at Bender .
Filming began in July 2005 ; the premiere was at Sundance the following January .
In between , Katrina hit .
“ I was scheduled to give the slide show in New Orleans that day , ” Gore says .
“ The audience was the state insurance commissioners who wanted to learn more about hurricanes and global warming . ”
The movie was released theatrically in New York and Los Angeles in May 2006 , in wide release in June .
And by March 2007 , Gore was thanking the Academy .
Part of the proceeds from the film go to the Alliance for Climate Protection .
The film has made more than $ 50 million worldwide ; 50,000 DVDs have been given away to schools and nonprofits , and 850,000 copies of the book have been sold .
Back in New York , I ask Gore to explain what he meant when he said he wanted Current TV to be transformational .
He answers with a 10 - minute history lesson on the computer .
“ It ’s a geeky analogy , but you ’re from Fast Company , so you ’ll like it , ” he says good - naturedly .
Sketching a diagram on a file folder , he reveals just how geeky he is himself .
He certainly needs more than 30 seconds to get his point across .
That helps explain why , despite the interest from so many Democrats in his political aspirations , he seems genuinely distanced from the idea of running for President–at least for now .
“ What politics has become , ” Gore explains at one point during our discussion , “ is something that requires a kind of tolerance for artifice and manipulative communications strategies that I just find I have in very short supply .
I just do n’t have the patience for things that seem to be greatly rewarded in today ’s political system . ”
Politically , his outsider status makes him a potential kingmaker .
If this is sour grapes over 2000 , it does n’t sound like it–at least not from the vantage point of 2007 .
“ A politics of ideas , driven by passion , seems to encounter a headwind , ” he tells me .
“ I do think that the Internet is bringing revolutionary transformation .
I have not ruled out the possibility of getting into politics sometime in the future , ” he says , “ but I do n’t expect to .
Because I do n’t expect things to change .
If they did change , then I would feel differently . ”
advertisement
As a political figure , Gore may be more palatable as a possible dark horse than an actual candidate–precisely because he seems incapable of turning his passions into sound bites .
And in any campaign , he might find himself on the defensive for his business activities .
In his slideshow tour , he has been paid by many companies , which could be used to challenge his integrity .
( He routinely cuts or eliminates his fee for schools and other nonprofits . )
He also headed the Apple board committee that cleared Steve Jobs of wrongdoing in the stock - options backdating scandal .
Sitting where he is , his outsider status makes him a potential kingmaker among the Democratic candidates .
He has said he expects to endorse someone eventually .
Whoever gets the nod can expect Gore ’s Alliance for Climate Protection to run its own campaign on the issues .
Gore sees no reason to apologize for not wanting to jump into the electoral fray .
As a businessman , he can speak with a candor few successful politicians can maintain .
He has made an enormous amount of money and achieved positions of influence from technology to financial services to media .
He and Tipper are even setting themselves up as angel investors for a few early - stage tech companies they believe in .
In doing one end run after another around the status quo , he has created a new life : a perfect amalgam of environmental activism and a new type of capitalism in which there is more than one bottom line to consider , more than one master to serve .

Nearly ten percent of companies have fired an employee for violating corporate blogging or message board policies , and 19 percent have disciplined an employee for the same infractions , according to a new survey from Proofpoint , a messaging security company .
Almost a third of companies " employ staff to read or otherwise analyze outbound email , " while more than fifteen percent have hired people whose primary function is to spy on outgoing corporate email .
A quarter have fired an employee for violating corporate email policies .
Twenty percent of the companies and almost thirty percent of companies with more than 20,000 employees had been ordered by a court or a regulator to turn over employee emails .
Enterprises continue to express a high level of concern about creating , managing and enforcing outbound messaging policies ( for email and other communication protocols ) that ensure that messages leaving the organization comply with both internal rules , best practices for data protection and external regulations . [… ]
The growing popularity of new electronic communication channels ( such as webmail , blogs , media sharing sites and instant messaging ) pose new sources of risk for IT security professionals and the organizations they serve .
I have doubts that this many companies have actually fired employees for message board or blog postings , but that ’s just a gut , Chertoff - style , danger - dog hunch .
If anything , I ’d guess the two categories are lumped together , because despite the hype around blogs , I think people are more likely to say something stupid on a message board .
Proofpoint , a vendor that sells message monitoring equipment , also has a vested interest in having companies perceive that they need to be monitoring their employees .
That does n’t make the survey flawed , but it ’s certainly in the interests of security vendors to keep the perceived threat level high .

Howard has played down the comments , saying it was " stretching it a bit " to conclude that Australia 's Iraq involvement was motivated by oil .
The remarks are causing heated debate as the US - led Iraq coalition has avoided linking the war and oil .
Oil concerns
Australia was involved in the invasion of Iraq in 2003 , and has about 1,500 military personnel still deployed in the region .
There are no immediate plans to bring them home .
In comments to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation , Mr Nelson admitted that the supply of oil had influenced Australia 's strategic planning in the region .
" Obviously the Middle East itself , not only Iraq but the entire region , is an important supplier of energy , oil in particular , to the rest of the world , " he said .
" Australians and all of us need to think what would happen if there were a premature withdrawal from Iraq .
" It 's in our interests , our security interests , to make sure that we leave the Middle East , and leave Iraq in particular , in a position of sustainable security . "
Australians and all of us need to think what would happen if there were a premature withdrawal from Iraq

Howard 's stand on Iraq
But Prime Minister John Howard was quick to play down the significance of his defence minister 's comments .
" We did n't go there because of oil and we do n't remain there because of oil , " he told a local radio station .
" A lot of oil comes from the Middle East - we all know that - but the reason we remain there is that we want to give the people of Iraq a possibility of embracing democracy , " he added .
Opposition criticism
Opposition politicians , though , have chastised Mr Howard 's government over the comments .
" This government simply makes it up as it goes along on Iraq , " Labor leader Kevin Rudd told reporters .
Anti-war protesters say the government 's admission proves that the US - led invasion was more of a grab for oil rather than a genuine attempt to uncover weapons of mass destruction .
But ministers in Canberra have brushed aside the criticism , saying they remain committed to helping the US stabilise Iraq and combat terrorism .
They have also stressed that there will be no " premature withdrawal " of Australian forces from the region .

Every president has a political philosophy that guides him and , sometimes , the nation .
George W. Bush believes he has divine inspiration to do what he wants to do , when he wants to do it , and to make his subjects adhere to whatever beliefs he holds for the moment .
His political philosophy is a chunk of swiss cheese that is being forced down the throats of a lactose - intolerant nation .
During his first campaign for presidential office , he preached a doctrine against nation building and pre-emptive military strikes .
Within a year of his inaugural he was already planning to export his version of democracy to the world .
Within two years , he had begun spinning half - truth and lies in his plans to launch a pre-emptive strike against Iraq and to create a “ regime change . ”
That “ nation building ” plan , however , has proven as strong as a bridge built by non-union labor working for a corrupt contractor .
As the commander - in - chief , a title of which he is not hesitant to use on almost every occasion , he found out he could move billion dollar warships as easily as the toy boats and rubber duckies in his bathtub .
George W. Bush , in attacking Bill Clinton for putting troops into Bosnia , demanded deadlines for withdrawal .
But , for the war he created in Iraq , and which looks like the quagmire that became the Vietnam War , he has decided that deadlines were blueprints for failure , that “ it makes no sense to tell the enemy when you plan to start withdrawing . ”
As president , George W. Bush pushed the No Child Left Behind Act , which requires extensive testing of students to see that they meet Republican - approved goals .
Within months of creating the program , teachers were forced to “ teach to the test , ” rather than to improve a student 's education .
Yet , President Bush becomes infuriated when critics suggest he has failed every test of success in Iraq , and defiantly tells a nation worn down by the cost of a failed foreign policy that it ’s impossible to measure success in war .
When the majority of Americans declared , in poll after poll , they opposed the use of torture , even against al - Qaeda operatives , the commander - in - chief decided the majority did n’t matter .
He has disregarded the wishes of the people who believe in better health care for all Americans .
Shortly after he took office , President Bush withdrew the United States from the Kyoto Agreement , signed by 37 industrialized nations .
His response was to gut the environment and , against the findings of an overwhelming majority of scientists , not only claimed that global warming is n’t a problem , but has suppressed the views of government scientists .
In almost every campaign speech , even those after he was elected , he pontificates about fiscal responsibility , personal freedom , and less government in the lives of people .
His fiscal irresponsibility has led to deficit spending and a national debt that our grandchildren will still be paying ; he launched an extensive spy system against Americans , and believes there needs to be even more legislation — Constitutional amendments , specifically — to ban flag burning ( an issue the Supreme Court has already dealt with ) and same sex marriage .
When the Republicans controlled Congress , the smirky President demanded that the senate adhere to an up - or - down vote on all of his appointees — a majority vote was all that should be needed to approve his candidates .
His belief , echoed by the nation ’s elected Republicans and googles of conservative radio talk show hosts , opposed the entire history of the Senate that allows debate until 60 or more senators vote to end that debate .
President Bush invoked that “ up - or - down ” vote on the appointment of John Bolton , who had a long history of opposition to the United Nations , to be the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. President Bush demanded “ up - or - down votes ” in the Senate to approve his nominees to the federal courts , ambassadorships , and the cabinet .
It ’s democracy , he bleated .
Majority vote .
Majority rules .
Of course , he conveniently forgot that had he truly believed in majority vote , Al Gore would have been president .
Nevertheless , after the Democrats took control of Congress , President Bush saw the light and decided that up - or - down votes did n’t matter .
The President ’s lieutenants blocked an up - or - down vote on the “ surge ” in Iraq .
When the House voted 247–176 and the Senate voted 63 – 37 to allow federal funding for stem cell research , the oh - so - moral President decided the majority and up - or - down votes did n’t matter , and vetoed the proposed legislation .
When Congress voted to require phased withdrawals from Iraq , President Bush vetoed that legislation .
When the Senate , by a 53 –38 vote , declared they had “ No Confidence ” in Attorney Gene-ral Ambrose Gonzales , the President ignored the wishes of the majority ; the “ Decider - in - Chief ” decided that he would continue to mismanage the country without judicial or Congressional advice or overview .
To an audience at Tsinghua University , President Bush said that “ life in America shows that liberty paired with law is not to be feared .
In a free society , diversity is not disorder , debate is not strife , and dissent is not revolution . ”
How his Administration created and enforced the USA PATRIOT Act ; how he and his Administration have routinely and maliciously suppressed the rights of dissent , linking dissent to treason ; and how he and his Administration have consistently shown the disregard for the Bill of Rights puts the lie to what he told Chinese students was his philosophy of government .
In forming the Constitution , this nation ’s Founding Fathers rejected the concept of the divine right of kings .
It 's doubtful the President has read the Constitution .
Perhaps if he had , his philosophy , like swiss cheese , would not be so full of holes , and he might not be so cavalier in thinking he has divine wisdom to shred that document as easily as one shreds a pound of cheese .

Alone
From childhood 's hour I have not been
As others were , I have not seen
As others saw , I could not bring
My passions from the common spring .
From the same source I have not taken
My sorrow , I could not awaken
My heart to joy at the same tone ,
And all I loved , I loved alone .
Then in my childhood , in the dawn
Of a most stormy life was drawn
From every depth of good and ill
The mystery which binds me still :
From the torrent , and the fountain ,
From the red cliff of the mountain ,
From the sun that ' round me rolled
In its autumn tint of gold ;
From the lightning in the sky ,
As it passed me , flying by ,
From the thunder , and the storm ,
And the cloud that took the form
( When the rest of Heaven was blue )
Of a demon in my view .
-- Edgar Allan Poe , 1875
General Assembly asserts UU moral values
General Assembly asserts UU moral values
UU World Magazine , published by the Unitarian Universalist Association
The 46th annual General Assembly of the Unitarian Universalist Association of Congregations in Portland , Ore. , June 20 – 24 , attracted the second largest GA crowd ever for five days of workshops , business meetings , lectures , and worship services .
The Portland General Assembly drew 5,697 people , including 2,428 delegates representing 643 member congregations .
Several thousand people attended major presentations at GA , including a forum on the UUA ’s role in the publication of the Pentagon Papers in 1971 , an address on the Israeli - Palestinian conflict by Middle East scholar Rashid Khalidi , and Sunday afternoon ’s closing worship service featuring the Rev. Josh Pawelek and singer Ysaye M. Barnwell , best known for her work with Sweet Honey in the Rock .
The unexpectedly large turnout filled many workshop rooms to overflowing .
When more than 1,200 turned up for a lecture by popular author ( and former UU minister ) Robert Fulghum , many people were turned away .
The General Assembly Planning Committee promised to make recordings available of overcrowded events .
The General Assembly commemorated Beacon Press ’s publication of the Pentagon Papers with speeches by three of the men who brought the government ’s secret history of the Vietnam War to the public .
Daniel Ellsberg , the former military analyst who leaked the Pentagon Papers to Sen .
Mike Gravel and the New York Times , joined Gravel and former UUA President Robert N. West to discuss the significance of their decision today .
“ Thank God for a democracy that leaks like a sieve , ” said Gravel , who is a Democratic candidate for U.S. President .
“ We need more leaks . ”
In 1971 Gravel read the documents he received from Ellsberg into the Congressional Record .
The New York Times and other newspapers published selections until the Justice Department filed an injunction stopping them .
Beacon Press was the only publisher who took the risk of publishing the entire collection .
West recalled the threats the UUA endured from the government , including a call from President Richard Nixon .
“ The Justice Department investigated our entire denomination ’s financial affairs and threatened our Association staff members , ” he said , “ because one of our departments , Beacon Press , published one book that was controversial — a text that was already in the public domain . ”
He said he sees parallels in the government ’s secrecy and the “ misuse ” of the power of the Justice Department today , and quoted from his report to the 1973 General Assembly : “ We want to make known our determination to resist every government intrusion on our constitutional liberties and to encourage others also to resist . ”
Ellsberg said that he hopes someone with access to documents about the U.S. government ’s plans for war with Iran will come forward .
“ By taking that risk , ” he said , “ they ’d have a high chance of averting a catastrophe that would lead to the deaths of tens , hundreds of thousands of people and disastrously reduce our security . ”
As for the occupation of Iraq , Ellsberg drew sustained applause when he said , “ The Congress has the power to stop the war .
They ’re not doing it . ”
Video of major presentations and written reports about many GA workshops and events are available online at UUA.org .
The fall issue of UU World will feature extended coverage of General Assembly .
The published General Assembly agenda included votes on a Statement of Conscience on “ moral values in a pluralistic society , ” two relatively minor bylaw amendments , and an uncontested slate of candidates for elected boards and committees .
But delegates brought a dozen additional resolutions that livened up the plenary sessions on the final day of the Assembly .
The Statement of Conscience , which emerged from a two - year “ study / action ” process in congregations , called for Unitarian Universalists “ to assert and defend two basic principles underlying the American Constitution ” — “ the right of all human beings to follow a life of their choosing , as long as others are not harmed , ” and “ the basic principle of inherent equal dignity of all human beings . ”
( The full text of all General Assembly resolutions will be available at UUA.org ; see below for links . )
Delegates approved six social justice resolutions or “ Actions of Immediate Witness ” on torture , immigration raids , international women ’s rights , sexuality education , gay rights in the U.S. military , and the Employment Non-Discrimination Act .
The first four passed with little debate , but the last two inspired passionate exchanges .
An Action of Immediate Witness ( AIW ) entitled “ Repeal ‘ Do n’t Ask , Do n’t Tell , ’ ” which calls for an end to a policy that allows gay and lesbian people to serve in the military only if they are closeted , drew statements of opposition from delegates who raised class issues and criticized military violence .
“ This is yet another campaign being pushed forward by white , privileged queer people , ” said Jason Lydon , a delegate from the Community Church of Boston , “ without being in accountable relationships with queer people of color , or being aware of the impact the military itself has on all communities of color . ”
A handful of speakers expressed concerns that repeal could lead to an epidemic of hate crimes — “ open season on gays in the military , ” in one opponent ’s phrase .
After the debate became emotional , a delegate , trustee - at - large Tamara Payne - Alex , came to the procedural microphone to ask if there was time for a prayer , and Moderator Gini Courter agreed .
After a minute of silence , Courter offered a prayer that said , in part , “ There is always enough love to go around if we create it .
Let us be centered , forgiving , and caring . ”
Courter then called for a vote and announced that the resolution had clearly carried .
To make sure people had a chance to judge for themselves , she asked the video camera operators to pan the vast plenary hall so the evidence could be seen on the giant screens on either side of the plenary stage .
As the cameras panned , she called again for yes and no votes and for a show of abstentions .
There were clearly many fewer negative votes than affirmative .
The final Action of Immediate Witness , entitled “ Pass the Employment Non-Discrimination Act with Transgender Inclusion and Protection , ” also attracted spirited opposition from delegates who said it did not go far enough and from others who said the resolution expressed commitments the UUA has already made .
( Some of the opponents had sponsored a resolution specifically affirming transgender people that the Commission on Social Witness merged with a separate resolution on the Employment Non-Discrimination Act . )
This AIW also passed easily .
As the final plenary session was coming to a close , delegates came forward with six “ responsive resolutions , ” which were approved with little or no debate .
The UUA bylaws permit delegate - initiated resolutions in response to reports by UUA officers and committees .
One responsive resolution reaffirmed the General Assembly ’s opposition to the war in Iraq and urged delegates to take “ all necessary action to end the U.S. occupation of Iraq . ”
One asked congregations to report back to future General Assemblies about their historical “ complicity with the genocide of native people , with slavery and the slave - based economy , and with all types of racial , ethnic , and cultural oppression past and present , toward the goal of accountability through acknowledgment , apology , repair , and reconciliation . ”
The resolution asked for updates at the next two Assemblies .
Other resolutions asked congregations to report next year about their engagement with people in communities of color regarding their voting experiences ; encouraged congregations to raise funds to provide health insurance for approximately 200 uninsured church employees ; and asked the General Assembly Planning Committee to discuss devoting at least 30 minutes of the opening of General Assembly 2008 to help attendees “ engage in compassionate response and witness ” when encountering new people .
One responsive resolution grew out of a proposed Action of Immediate Witness about transgender people .
It affirmed “ the commitment to the inherent worth and dignity of every human being , including transgender individuals ” and urged that “ this spiritual value ” be expressed through “ employment practices , educational efforts , congregational life , and public witness . ”
The resolution notes that no prior General Assembly statement specifically addresses the Association ’s views on transgender identity and encourages congregations “ to explore with their communities the important differences between sexual orientation and transgender identity . ”
At last year ’s GA there was one responsive resolution ; this year the number equaled the number of Actions of Immediate Witness , which undergo a rigorous process of proposal , petition , amendment sessions , and floor debate .
There is no such process for “ responsive resolutions , ” although approval requires a two - thirds vote .
Moderator Courter said she would be discussing the responsive resolution process with the UUA ’s parliamentarian and legal counsel before next year ’s Assembly .
In other business , delegates elected a slate of candidates who ran unopposed for denominational boards and committees , approved two bylaw changes without debate , and voted on 30 mission - oriented statements that grew out of “ Open Space ” conversations about the mission of Unitarian Universalism .
The Association welcomed two new member congregations : the Unitarian Universalist Peace Fellowship in Raleigh , N.C. , and the Unitarian Universalist Church of Hot Springs , Ark .
The bylaw amendments added “ Chief Governance Officer ” to the description of the moderator ’s duties and refined language governing the Board of Review , an elected body that hears appeals of Ministerial Fellowship decisions .
Several hundred people took part in conversations about Unitarian Universalism ’s mission in the world , using a decision - making process called Open Space Technology , and generated 30 statements for prioritization by delegates .
Unfortunately , results of the vote on the Open Space statements wo n’t be available for several months due to technical difficulties .
( See the Fall issue of UU World in late August for a complete report on the Open Space conversations and other General Assembly events . )
During his annual report , UUA President William G. Sinkford announced a comprehensive fundraising campaign called “ Now is the Time . ”
The campaign ’s goal is to raise $ 20 million in cash and $ 30 million in planned giving commitments .
More than $ 14 million in cash and $ 19 million in legacy commitments has already been raised , Sinkford said .
All Unitarian Universalists will be offered an opportunity to contribute through special Association Sunday collections in their congregations this fall .
Sinkford said the collection would fund a national advertising campaign and he introduced a clip from a short film the UUA has commissioned as part of the advertising campaign .
Other Association Sunday funds will support the successful settlement of ministers of color and allow the Association to offer grants for promising new growth efforts .

Update 2 : Sorting 1 PB with MapReduce .
PB is not peanut - butter - and - jelly misspelled .
It 's 1 petabyte or 1000 terabytes or 1,000,000 gigabytes .
It took six hours and two minutes to sort 1PB ( 10 trillion 100 - byte records ) on 4,000 computers and the results were replicated thrice on 48,000 disks .
Update : Greg Linden points to a new Google article MapReduce : simplified data processing on large clusters .
Some interesting stats : 100k MapReduce jobs are executed each day ; more than 20 petabytes of data are processed per day ; more than 10 k MapReduce programs have been implemented ; machines are dual processor with gigabit ethernet and 4 - 8 GB of memory .
Google is the King of scalability .
Everyone knows
Google for their large , sophisticated , and fast searching , but they do n't just shine in search .
Their platform approach to building scalable applications allows them to roll out internet scale applications at an alarmingly high competition crushing rate .
Their goal is always to build a higher performing higher scaling infrastructure to support their products .
How do they do that ?
Information Sources
Platform
Linux
A large diversity of languages : Python , Java , C ++
What 's Inside ?
The Stats
Estimated 450,000 low - cost commodity servers in 2006
In 2005 Google indexed 8 billion web pages .
By now , who knows ?
Currently there over 200 GFS clusters at Google .
A cluster can have 1000 or even 5000 machines .
Pools of tens of thousands of machines retrieve data from GFS clusters that run as large as 5 petabytes of storage .
Aggregate read / write throughput can be as high as 40 gigabytes / second across the cluster .
Currently there are 6000 MapReduce applications at Google and hundreds of new applications are being written each month .
BigTable scales to store billions of URLs , hundreds of terabytes of satellite imagery , and preferences for hundreds of millions of users .
The Stack
Google visualizes their infrastructure as a three layer stack :
Products : search , advertising , email , maps , video , chat , blogger Distributed Systems Infrastructure : GFS , MapReduce , and BigTable .
Computing Platforms : a bunch of machines in a bunch of different data centers
Make sure easy for folks in the company to deploy at a low cost .
Look at price performance data on a per application basis .
Spend more money on hardware to not lose log data , but spend less on other types of data .
Having said that , they do n't lose data .
Reliable Storage Mechanism with GFS ( Google File System )
Reliable scalable storage is a core need of any application .
GFS is their core storage platform .
Google File System - large distributed log structured file system in which they throw in a lot of data .
Why build it instead of using something off the shelf ?
Because they control everything and it's the platform that distinguishes them from everyone else .
They required :
- high reliability across data centers
- scalability to thousands of network nodes
- huge read / write bandwidth requirements
- support for large blocks of data which are gigabytes in size .
- efficient distribution of operations across nodes to reduce bottlenecks System has master and chunk servers .
- Master servers keep metadata on the various data files .
Data are stored in the file system in 64MB chunks .
Clients talk to the master servers to perform metadata operations on files and to locate the chunk server that contains the needed they need on disk .
- Chunk servers store the actual data on disk .
Each chunk is replicated across three different chunk servers to create redundancy in case of server crashes .
Once directed by a master server , a client application retrieves files directly from chunk servers .
A new application coming on line can use an existing GFS cluster or they can make your own .
It would be interesting to understand the provisioning process they use across their data centers .
Key is enough infrastructure to make sure people have choices for their application .
GFS can be tuned to fit individual application needs .
Do Something With the Data Using MapReduce
Now that you have a good storage system , how do you do anything with so much data ?
Let 's say you have many TBs of data stored across a 1000 machines .
Databases do n't scale or cost effectively scale to those levels .
That 's where MapReduce comes in .
MapReduce is a programming model and an associated implementation for processing and generating large data sets .
Users specify a map function that processes a key / value pair to generate a set of intermediate key / value pairs , and a reduce function that merges all intermediate values associated with the same intermediate key .
Many real world tasks are expressible in this model .
Programs written in this functional style are automatically parallelized and executed on a large cluster of commodity machines .
The run -time system takes care of the details of partitioning the input data , scheduling the program 's execution across a set of machines , handling machine failures , and managing the required inter-machine communication .
This allows programmers without any experience with parallel and distributed systems to easily utilize the resources of a large distributed system .
Why use MapReduce ?
- Nice way to partition tasks across lots of machines .
- Handle machine failure .
- Works across different application types , like search and ads .
Almost every application has map reduce type operations .
You can precompute useful data , find word counts , sort TBs of data , etc .
- Computation can automatically move closer to the IO source .
The MapReduce system has three different types of servers .
- The Master server assigns user tasks to map and reduce servers .
It also tracks the state of the tasks .
- The Map servers accept user input and performs map operations on them .
The results are written to intermediate files
- The Reduce servers accepts intermediate files produced by map servers and performs reduce operation on them .
For example , you want to count the number of words in all web pages .
You would feed all the pages stored on GFS into MapReduce .
This would all be happening on 1000s of machines simultaneously and all the coordination , job scheduling , failure handling , and data transport would be done automatically .
- The steps look like : GFS -> Map ->
Shuffle -> Reduction ->
Store Results back into GFS .
- In MapReduce a map maps one view of data to another , producing a key value pair , which in our example is word and count .
- Shuffling aggregates key types .
- The reductions sums up all the key value pairs and produces the final answer .
The Google indexing pipeline has about 20 different map reductions .
A pipeline looks at data with a whole bunch of records and aggregating keys .
A second map - reduce comes a long , takes that result and does something else .
And so on .
Programs can be very small .
As little as 20 to 50 lines of code .
One problem is stragglers .
A straggler is a computation that is going slower than others which holds up everyone .
Stragglers may happen because of slow IO ( say a bad controller ) or from a temporary CPU spike .
The solution is to run multiple of the same computations and when one is done kill all the rest .
Data transferred between map and reduce servers is compressed .
The idea is that because servers are n't CPU bound it makes sense to spend on data compression and decompression in order to save on bandwidth and I/O .
Storing Structured Data in BigTable
BigTable is a large scale , fault tolerant , self managing system that includes terabytes of memory and petabytes of storage .
It can handle millions of reads / writes per second .
BigTable is a distributed hash mechanism built on top of GFS .
It is not a relational database .
It does n't support joins or SQL type queries .
It provides lookup mechanism to access structured data by key .
GFS stores opaque data and many applications needs has data with structure .
Commercial databases simply do n't scale to this level and they do n't work across 1000s machines .
By controlling their own low level storage system Google gets more control and leverage to improve their system .
For example , if they want features that make cross data center operations easier , they can build it in .
Machines can be added and deleted while the system is running and the whole system just works .
Each data item is stored in a cell which can be accessed using a row key , column key , or timestamp .
Each row is stored in one or more tablets .
A tablet is a sequence of 64KB blocks in a data format called SSTable .
BigTable has three different types of servers :
- The Master servers assign tablets to tablet servers .
They track where tablets are located and redistributes tasks as needed .
- The Tablet servers process read / write requests for tablets .
They split tablets when they exceed size limits ( usually 100 MB - 200 MB ) .
When a tablet server fails , then a 100 tablet servers each pickup 1 new tablet and the system recovers .
- The Lock servers form a distributed lock service .
Operations like opening a tablet for writing , Master aribtration , and access control checking require mutual exclusion .
A locality group can be used to physically store related bits of data together for better locality of reference .
Tablets are cached in RAM as much as possible .
Hardware
When you have a lot of machines how do you build them to be cost efficient and use power efficiently ?
Use ultra cheap commodity hardware and built software on top to handle their death .
A 1,000 - fold computer power increase can be had for a 33 times lower cost if you you use a failure - prone infrastructure rather than an infrastructure built on highly reliable components .
You must build reliability on top of unreliability for this strategy to work .
Linux , in - house rack design , PC class mother boards , low end storage .
Price per wattage on performance basis is n't getting better .
Have huge power and cooling issues .
Use a mix of collocation and their own data centers .
Misc
Push changes out quickly rather than wait for QA .
Libraries are the predominant way of building programs .
Some are applications are provided as services , like crawling .
An infrastructure handles versioning of applications so they can be release without a fear of breaking things .
Future Directions for Google
Support geo-distributed clusters .
Create a single global namespace for all data .
Currently data is segregated by cluster .
More and better automated migration of data and computation .
Solve consistency issues that happen when you couple wide area replication with network partitioning ( e.g. keeping services up even if a cluster goes offline for maintenance or due to some sort of outage ) .
Lessons Learned
Even as Special Counsel Scott J. Bloch moved forward with plans for a sweeping probe of the Bush administration , several advocacy groups complained that his ties to the administration and to conservative groups , as well as his record on gay rights and whistle - blowers , made him the wrong man for the job .
“ There is a serious question as to whether Bloch will just provide cover for an administration that is covering for him , ” said Melanie Sloan , executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , a Democratic - leaning group .
A spokesman for the Office of Special Counsel , communications director James Mitchell , waved away the complaints , saying agency staffers have already begun to form an internal task force , led in part by career staff , to probe three broad areas of activity involving the White House and senior advisor Karl Rove .
The agency will use its subpoena power if necessary , Mitchell said .
It will focus on whether White House political concerns improperly intruded on the decision to fire at least one U.S. attorney ; whether Rove ’s office staff or others violated the Hatch Act in briefing Cabinet agency managers on political developments and Republican campaign goals ; and whether the White House improperly used Republican National Committee e-mail accounts for official business .

Many of those e-mails are now missing , and Bloch has said his agency will probably join the effort to find them .
The advocacy groups charge , among other things , that Bloch initiated a policy that made it more difficult for gay employees to allege discrimination .
A whistle - blower group said Bloch had a poor record of protecting those reporting wrongdoing .
And , these critics pointed out , the Office of Personnel Management is investigating alleged improper employment practices including intimidation of workers at the Special Counsel agency .
“ This is a job where you do n’t have a lot of friends , ” Mitchell said .
“ You do n’t make people happy when you zap them for violations or reject their whistle - blower complaints . ”
At Bloch ’s confirmation hearing , Mitchell said , the incoming director was urged to reduce the large backlog of whistle - blower and other complaints .
Bloch disposed of a great many of them -- so many that an advocate for environmental whistle - blowers said they had received no satisfaction from the agency .
Advertisement
“ He just ignored them , ” said Jeff Ruch , executive director of Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility .
Mitchell said office procedures on whistle - blower and other cases were reviewed by a bipartisan congressional staff in 2005 that later provided a positive report .
While Bloch has alienated advocacy groups on the left , he has also lost support from White House insiders , according to one report .
The Weekly Standard , a conservative magazine , reported last year that Bloch was ostracized by the White House and might even be urged to step down .
Mitchell said such attacks are expected by investigators like Bloch .
“ He is a watchdog , ” Mitchell said .
“ That ’s what he likes to do . ”

Well , no .
According to figures released last month , one in ten now suffers from a clinically - recognised mental health problem , and earlier this year a UNICEF report on " childhood well - being " found that out of 21 nations across the developed world , British children are the unhappiest .
A damning survey by the National Consumer Council , reported in the Mail , revealed that children who watch too much television and spend hours on the internet are " greedy and unhappy " .
" These children argue more with their families , have a lower opinion of their parents , and lower self - esteem than other children , " the report said .
Even Gordon Brown has been moved to comment on his determination to halt the " erosion of childhood " .
So how is this unhappiness manifesting itself ?
Well , there 's increasing evidence of mushrooming behavioural problems in our schools , these days even among the very youngest pupils in primary schools .
But many unhappy children lie low , bottling up their misery , and the symptoms do n't become apparent until the teenage years .
There again , we see the evidence : the UK has the worst problems with drugs , binge - drinking and under - age sex in Europe .
We 're also near the top of international polls for anti-social behaviour , self - harm and eating disorders .
And , according to figures from the Institute for Public Policy Research , last year 24,000 youngsters tried to kill themselves - that 's one every 22 minutes .
So what IS happening ?
After researching the state of modern childhood for over five years , I 'm convinced that , as our country has grown richer and more " advanced " , we 've lost sight of certain fundamental truths about child - rearing .
We 've come to believe that 21st century children are different from children in the past - that they can get by with less parental time and attention , skip stages in their development and cope with pressures and emotional burdens children should n't have to cope with .
The brutal truth is that they can't .
Life may have changed enormously over the past few decades , but the human brain evolves much more slowly - in fact , it has n't changed since Cro-Magnon times .
All babies are born as little Stone Age babies , and it's up to their parents - supported by their wider community - to help them towards maturity , gradually equipping them with the inner strength , skills and knowledge they need to live in a complex technological culture .
We can't rush this business , we can't opt out of it as individuals or as a society , and we can't miss bits out .
Every adult in Britain - including the politicians and businessmen who determine so many aspects of our daily lives - has to recognise that children 's basic developmental needs have not changed over the millennia .
The most obvious ones are the physical ones : food , shelter and sleep .

The " obesity explosion " of recent years shows that society - parents , manufacturers , marketers , even the schools that fed children turkey twizzlers - lost sight of the importance of wholesome food in recent decades .
As for shelter , we 've confused that with over - protection , keeping children wrapped in cotton wool to keep them " safe " , and thus denying them essential opportunities to learn through real - life experience - actually getting out on their bikes and breathing fresh air .
And in a 24/7 culture , where sleep has been sidelined as electronic entertainment fizzes on throughout the night , children may well be getting less sleep than at any time in human history .
Another essential childhood need is the emotional stability that comes from feeling cared - for and secure .
Tiny babies , who can't feed or look after themselves , need to know someone is caring for them at all times , and are programmed to recognise and become attached to this " someone " by sight , sound , smell and so on .
The carer therefore needs to be a constant and consistent loving presence in the child 's life .
We 've comprehensively blown this one by putting so many tiny children into day nurseries , so that both their parents can go out to work and feed the economy rather than the baby .
As children grow older , emotional security is associated with regularity and routine , such as family meals and a familiar bedtime ritual .
Children need adults not only to love them , but to provide regularity and to set and maintain boundaries for their behaviour .
So parents have to balance warmth with a degree of firmness .
This sort of balanced parenting is extremely difficult when adults are exhausted from juggling work and domestic responsibilities or - in a materialistic society based on an " I want " philosophy - unsure where the boundaries ought to be drawn .
If a child gets used to eating dinner with the television on every night , how are you going to tell them they can't do that any more because you 've finally realised they never talk to you at all ?
Or if , like millions of children , they have a television in their room which they watch late in the evening , how are you to insist it 's taken away because they 're exhausted every day ?
It 's even more difficult if , because of the pressures of modern life , a parents ' marriage is collapsing or they 're trying to bring up a child alone .
Children also need to learn communication skills , another essential element in emotional and social development .

This starts from the moment they 're born , and is an important part of the bond with the carer that underpins emotional development .
As parents sing and talk to their babies , they awaken the language instinct wired deep in the human brain and provide the data through which children will learn to speak their mother tongue .
But if adults do n't spend time with their children , communication skills wo n't develop as they should - and , in a busy modern world , many parents are n't available to play their part in this process .
Many children now spend the majority of their day in institutional care .
At home , babies often sit in front of an electronic babysitter and , as they grow older , there is that problem of older children having TVs in their rooms , which means that even when the family is in the same building , its members are splintered off from each other .
Ironically , in a world where there are more ways to communicate than ever before , parents communicate less and less with their own children .
There 's one other absolutely vital ingredient if children are to grow strong in body and mind - one that , to the great concern of developmental psychologists , is being practically eradicated from many children 's lives .
They need to play .
What 's more , they need to play in a relaxed , unstructured way , preferably outdoors with other children and - as they grow older - away from the eagle eyes of the adults .
The need for play is built into the DNA of all higher animals - lion cubs , for instance , are programmed to play - hunt , play - stalk and playfight to sort out their place in the family pecking order .
If they did n't learn these lion life - skills through play , the species would die out .
Human children develop physical control and co-ordination through running , jumping , climbing , skipping or kicking a football around .
They gain first - hand experience of the world they 're going to live in by making mud-pies or paddling in puddles or messing about in a sandpit , riding a home - made go - kart or climbing a tree .
These experiences underpin the understanding of the world on which human science and learning are based - without play , education is built on very shifting sands .
Without play also , children 's imagination and creativity is likely to be stunted .
So , too , their social skills .
It 's through playing with other children - without adult interference - that youngsters learn how to make friends , resolve quarrels , work collaboratively and , indeed , avoid small enemies .
They also learn how to take " safe risks " and make their own judgments , thus developing independence and self - reliance .
As far as play is concerned , our society has n't just taken its eye off the ball , we 've completely lost track of it .
Our paranoid obsession with " health and safety " means many parents now keep their children cooped up indoors living a sedentary , screen - based existence .
" Play " happens on a PlayStation , games on a GameBoy , and children often spend their day mindlessly gazing at TV .
That appalling scenario was the focus of this week 's National Consumer Council report , which found that in millions of households " the screen appears to be ever - present , particularly during meal times " .
As the Prime Minister pointed out , this " exposes children to the pressures of very aggressive advertising " .
That , in turn , creates a generation of mini-consumers who want everything they see on screen and equate happiness with materialism .
" Safe " in their bedrooms , our youngsters are learning about life from the people they see on screens - pop stars , celebrities and other attention - seekers - and from the anonymous army of marketers lurking behind those screens .
And the message those celebrities and marketers sell is that happiness comes from being rich and famous , from ownership of the latest musthave products , and a " cool " lifestyle .
All these changes in children 's lifestyles are the unintended consequences of rapid social and cultural change , driven by new technology and an increasingly competitive consumer society .
Nobody planned them - indeed , we 've all been so rushed off our feet that we did n't even notice them happening - but together they amount to a toxic cocktail of side - effects of " progress " .
The statistics emerging now - which I alluded to earlier - about children 's mental health must act as a wake - up call to parents , politicians and the nation as a whole .
Given that they 're growing up in a land of peace and plenty , unhappiness is not a natural state for our children .
There are , of course , a few unlucky souls genetically predisposed to depression , but most human beings develop a natural resilience .
I fear natural toughness is becoming absent in today 's children because the developmental needs described above have not been met .
Unfortunately , the challenges children face today are pretty toxic as well .
Two other side effects of cultural change have been the massive increase in marketing pressure on children and a simultaneous increase in the pressures they face at school .
We now live in a winners and losers culture .
Meanwhile , the obsession with competition has also infected primary schools , which abound with tests , targets and even league tables for young children 's achievements .
Children now face up to 70 academic tests before the age of 16 .
We enter our offspring into this highstakes educational rat race at a younger age than any other country , with many embarking on formal learning at the tender age of four .
At this age many children ( especially boys ) are n't even physically competent to hold a pencil , let alone write with one .
However , now that we 've become aware of the problem of childhood unhappiness , there 's no reason why we can't find a solution .
Since we know what 's necessary for bringing up happy , healthy , successful children ( the prescription is now ratified by decades of neuroscientific research ) , a society as advanced as ours should be able to provide it .
A good start would be to rein in marketing , which is now increasingly predatory towards children , and change the tests - and - targets culture of primary education .
Our consumer culture , along with the breakdown of extended families and far greater mobility , has broken down the trust that in the past held communities together .
Parents , teachers and other members of the community must find ways of reforging an " adult alliance " in their community to support families in raising their young .
The main responsibility for rearing children , however , lies - as it always has - with parents .
They have to wise up , stop being paralysed by a combination of rapid change , uncertainty and guilt , and find new ways to provide a secure , healthy family life for their offspring .
None of this is rocket science , but in terms of our nation 's future , it 's more important than rocket science .
Unless , very soon , we start attending to the well - being of our children ( all our children ) and tackle the growing problems with their mental health , the next generation may not be bright or balanced enough to keep our economy healthy and our nation together .

Opinion
What they said , and when they said it
IN 2005 , former U.S. Sen .
John Edwards said about his vote for war in Iraq : " I was wrong [ and ] I take responsibility . "
This statement , so simple , has been all too rare from politicians and leading media voices .
Instead , as the war rages on -- a war itself originally based on lies -- our political arena still teems with icons more interested in hiding the truth .
That 's no small matter .
As the saying goes , the first step to recovery is admitting the problem .
Sadly , though , the flip side is also true -- refusing to admit a problem will perpetuate that problem indefinitely .
President Bush said just two months ago that " we 've never been for stay the course . "
This , when for the last three years he has batted down any questions about his Iraq policy by saying " stay the course . "
Similarly , consider U.S. Sen. Joseph Lieberman ( Independent - Conn . ) .
Facing a difficult Democratic primary challenge , Lieberman said of Iraq in July that " the sooner we are out the better , " and that , by the end of 2006 , he would support efforts to " begin to draw down significant numbers of American troops . "
He later said that " no one wants to end the war in Iraq more than I do and bring our troops home . "
But weeks after being re-elected , Lieberman is now leading the charge for military escalation , sending a letter to President Bush last week saying , " [ I ] strongly encourage you to send additional American troops to Iraq . "
Pundits and news analysts are employed to expose this sort of nonsense so that our democratic discourse -- and the policy choices that come out of it -- are grounded in fact .
But that has not happened .
Instead , we have seen a furious stampede by the most prominent media figures to cover their own hides with either more lies , or more out - of - the mainstream bluster .
Time Magazine 's Joe Klein , for instance , last week claimed he has " been opposed to the Iraq war ever since 2002 . "
Readers were expected to forget about his nationally televised declaration in late February 2003 -- the critical days just before the invasion was ordered .
" War may well be the right decision at this point , " Klein told NBC 's Tim Russert .
" In fact , I think it probably is . "
This followed venerated New York Times columnist David Brooks who , rather than admitting the failure of his Iraq war cheerleading , lashed out at anti-war challenges to pro-war incumbents , writing that " primary voters should n't be allowed to define the choices in American politics " ( apparently , democracy and elections are no longer an acceptable way to run our country ) .
Weeks later , the Washington Post 's Richard Cohen justified his support for the war by flippantly writing that he thinks " the prudent use of violence could be therapeutic . "
All of this might be fine if those spewing this rhetoric faced some form of public rebuke that made clear such behavior is objectionable .
But there has been nothing of the kind .
The president was barely bothered by reporters about why he denied he ever said " stay the course . "
Lieberman continues to be invited on Sunday talk shows as a credible guest discussing Iraq , and no one asks him about his hypocrisy .
Meanwhile , Klein , Brooks and Cohen are still prominent news analysts for the largest publications in America , playing key roles shaping a political debate they now distort .
In other words , all of this is accepted without question , as if such behavior should be treated like just another staple of American politics .
Of course , dishonesty and anti-democratic salvos and caustic statements about violence are not new in politics -- but the ho - hum reaction to it is .
And that should trouble anyone interested in making sure America never again embarks on another misguided military adventure that leaves thousands dead and our national security in tatters .
How can we expect to change course in Iraq , if a president is given a pass to claim he has never stayed the course in the first place ?
How can we expect to hold lawmakers accountable if they are never questioned about their efforts to deliberately mislead us ?
How can we expect the media to be a watchdog if its leading analysts and news framers face no public sanctions when they disrespect the truth or give credence to fringe ideologies ?
A country whose national political conversation is dominated by voices that deny their own complicity in national security tragedies ; downplay human casualties , and generally make dishonesty mundane , is a nation prevented from reflecting on its bad decisions -- and thus is doomed to repeat such bad decisions in the future .
No , the former Mayor of New York did n’t go to medical school , but he thinks that he did :
Presidential hopeful Rudy Giuliani said Tuesday that people who want to legalize marijuana for medical purposes really just want to make the drug available to everyone .
“ I believe the effort to try and make marijuana available for medical uses is really a way to legalize it .
There ’s no reason for it , ” the former New York mayor said during a town hall - style meeting at New Hampshire Technical Institute .
He also said there are better alternatives .
“ You can accomplish everything you want to accomplish with things other than marijuana , probably better .
There are pain medications much superior to marijuana , ” he said .
“ We ’d be much better off telling people the truth .
Marijuana adds nothing to the array of legal medications and prescription medications that are available for pain relief . ”
Rudy , I ’m not sure which law school you went to , but mine did n’t teach me anything about how to treat terminal cancer , or glaucoma .
So do n’t pretend you know anything about either one of these topics .
Ann Althouse , a relatively conservative law professor has this say about Rudy ’s nonsense :
I think he ’s right .
But perhaps marijuana should be legalized , not just for people who can portray themselves as sick enough , but for any adult .
Of course , he can hardly say that .
What basis Professor Althouse has for saying that Mayor Giuliani ’s assessment of the medical benefits of marijuana are “ right ” I ca n’t entirely say .
But , the second part of her paragraph is 100 % right .
I did n't watch any of the Memorial Day events on television .
Memorial Day , it seems to me , should be only for the families of the dead .
It 's really impossible to remember someone we never knew .
Of course , these days Memorial Day gets larded with politics and pseudo - patriotism .
It 's nauseating to watch a bunch of actors , entertainers and politicians who never heard a gun fired in anger put on a maudlin performance as if they really gave a rat 's toenail for the dead .
The fact is , war is started by old men who never go near the war , and wars are always fought by the young .
The king of Belgium once noted that it takes 20 years of peace to produce a man and 20 seconds of war to destroy him .
Think about that .
All that a young human being is – intelligence , health , youth , education , knowledge , potential accomplishments – reduced to a bloody pile of broken bones and guts in an instant .
They are strangers killing and being killed by strangers .
War is mass murder , and no doubt part of the degradation of the human species is the fact that starting with the War Between the States , the human toll of war has increased exponentially .
It 's ironic that wars take the healthiest and bravest , while the unhealthy and the cowardly manage to evade them .
Look at all the draft dodgers of the Vietnam Era who suddenly became war hawks as soon as they were too old to go .
I 've said it before :
If I had children of war age , I would do everything in my power to dissuade them from joining the military .
The present war is a bad war .
It is not being fought to protect freedom , let alone the American people .
Poor Cindy Sheehan , who bravely protested the war , finally gave up .
She felt betrayed by the Democrats , by the antiwar movement , but the saddest thing of all , she said , was that she finally faced the fact her son died for nothing .
And sad as it is to say , it 's true .
The politicians and some of the media chicken hawks like to fork the fertilizer talking about sacrifices for freedom ( sacrifices most of them studiously avoid ever making ) , but it 's just fertilizer .
Why did we go to war in Iraq ?
Because the president hated Saddam Hussein ; because the Israeli lobby wanted us to ; because the crazy neoconservatives had the insane idea that the Middle East could be democratized at the point of a gun ; because oil companies and other corporations lusted for profit .
Missing is any threat to the safety and freedom of the United States , a threat no Iraqi ever made or ever had the capability of carrying out .
So , if you do n't want to say the kids are dying for nothing , you can say they are dying for Halliburton , for ExxonMobil , for the president 's ego , for a cockamamie theory of a bunch of academics , for Israel , for money or for oil .
What you cannot truthfully say is that they are dying for freedom .
The " global war on terror " is just a bad metaphor that does n't have any connection to reality .
How long are the American people going to allow liars to lull them into sacrificing the most precious treasure the country has – its youth – in a futile , lie - ridden , corruption - pocked war ?
In my dreams , I see the American people rising like a roaring lion and ripping the guilty politicians out of their offices , but that is only a dream .
The kind of people with the courage to do that lie moldering in millions of graves around the world .
A NASA - funded expedition , including researchers from Carnegie Mellon University ’s Robotics Institute , will begin searching for the submerged bottom of Mexico ’s El Zacatón sinkhole with a robotic submarine the week of May 14 .
Zacatón , in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas , is a geothermal sinkhole , or cenote , that is more than 282 meters deep .
Nobody has ever reached bottom and at least one diver has died attempting to do so .
Scientists want to learn more about its physical dimensions , the geothermal vents that feed it and whatever life might exist at its various depths .
The Deep Phreatic Thermal Explorer ( DEPTHX ) mission will use a 2.5 - meter - diameter submarine to map the cenote ’s shape , obtain water samples and return core samples from the cenote walls .
In the process , DEPTHX will test technologies and methods that might be useful in other underwater missions , including the long - term possibility of exploring the oceans hidden under the icy crust of Europa , one of Jupiter ’s moons .
Bill Stone of Stone Aerospace in Austin , Texas , will lead a team that includes scientists from the University of Texas at Austin , the Colorado School of Mines and the Southwest Research Institute .
The team also includes Associate Research Professor David Wettergreen and colleagues from Carnegie Mellon ’s Robotics Institute , who helped develop the innovative DEPTHX sub .
" We ’ll spend the first two days checking out DEPTHX ’s sensors , updating its software and performing a test dive to 250 meters to check its pressure housings , " Wettergreen said .
" We ’ll then have six days to complete the science program .
It ’s an ambitious program , but the vehicle performed well in two earlier field tests at the La Pilita cenote in Mexico . "
DEPTHX is unique among autonomous underwater vehicles in its ability to navigate untethered in complicated , sometimes closely confined underwater spaces .
Much of the cenote is pitch black so DEPTHX , using Carnegie Mellon software to control its flight , relies on depth , velocity and inertial guidance sensors to estimate its position in well - mapped areas , and an array of 56 sonar sensors to find its way in unmapped areas .
Software developed by Robotics Institute graduate student Nathaniel Fairfield uses the sonar to build maps of the cenote .
Project scientist George Kantor and senior research programmer Dominic Jonak complete the Carnegie Mellon team .
In addition to Zacatón , DEPTHX will be used to explore two nearby cenotes , Caracol and Verde , during the team ’s two - week expedition .
The mission ’s progress can be monitored at the Robotics Institute ’s DEPTHX Web site , www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/depthx , which will feature daily updates , images and graphics beginning May 15 .
A science writer from the University of Texas at Austin ’s Jackson School of Geosciences will maintain a daily blog of the mission at geology.com / .

A New Perception of Water
Water is necessary for life .
It has been said that a human can go weeks without food , days without water and minutes without oxygen before there is death .
I have written here before about water and the need to look more closely at how we use it .
The two prior blog posts about water were [… ]
Two months ago , the MPAA announced that any films submitted for rating would now be scrutinized for instances of cigarette smoking , particularly when it is glamorized .
This new regulation was aimed at keeping these images away from the eyes of young , malleable children , and could affect said film ’s rating , though the deciding criteria remains unknown .
Now family - friendly juggernaut Disney has become the first major Hollywood studio to back the MPAA ’s anti-smoking decision to help keep cigarettes away from the youth of America .
The decision was made as a result of recent studies exploring the affect current films have on children given the ubiquitous nature of these images — the results do n’t look good .
It seems that 90 percent of all films depict smoking , and that children with the highest exposure to these films are three times more likely to try smoking .
In addition to banning smoking in all upcoming releases , Disney has said it will place anti-smoking public service announcements on any future DVDs that feature smoking , and they are encouraging theater owners to do the same on the big screen .
The company ’s two other labels , Touchstone and Miramax , will also be strongly discouraged from producing or distributing movies with images of smoking , though how strong the discouragement remains unclear .
Disney may be taking an important step in the fight against this national health crisis , but film is only a small piece of the pie .
It is up to our government to implement proper anti-smoking education for children — a quick PSA before a movie will do nothing .
And it helps to remember that smoking , unlike violence or sexual imagery , is around children all the time , wherever they go .
The only way to make real change is with parents who feel a need to protect their children .
Light a fire under them , and the problem will smoke itself .
I ’ve been sitting on this for a while , so I ’m very excited to announce that Don Stewart , John Goerzen and I are collaborating on an upcoming book for O’Reilly , the working title of which is “ Real - World Haskell ” .
Better yet , O’Reilly has agreed to publish the title under a Creative Commons license !

New Dutch accessibility law
On 1 September last year the new Dutch law on the quality of government websites went into effect .
At the time I read a short note on a Dutch blog that the new law made accessibility mandatory , nodded sagely , decided it was about time , and went on with my work without actually looking at the new law .
It was only last Friday that I studied it in detail , and to say that I was pleasantly surprised would be an understatement .
The law 's stated purpose is to make sure that every Dutch government website is accessible by following the guidelines as formulated by W3C .
In order to do so , a corpus of 125 guidelines has been created to define best practices for creating accessible sites .
These guidelines go way beyond WCAG ; they also embrace modern , standards - compliant web development as a whole .
A few examples will show you where Dutch government accessibility is heading .
As of 1 September last year , every website built for a government agency is required by law to use :
valid HTML 4.01 or XHTML 1.0
CSS and semantic HTML and separation of structure and presentation
progressive enhancement
the W3C DOM ( instead of the old Microsoft document . all )
) meaningful values of class and id
and meaningful alt attributes on all images
Furthermore :
scripts that work on links should extend the basic link functionality ( think accessible popups )
if a link makes no sense without a script , it should n't be in the HTML ( but be generated by JavaScript )
use of forms or scripts as the only means of getting certain information is prohibited
means of getting certain information is prohibited removing the focus rectangle on links is prohibited
information offered in a closed format ( think Word ) should also be offered in an open format
the semantics of many HTML elements are explicitly defined
New government websites must comply with these guidelines .
Existing government websites must be converted to the new guidelines before 2011 .
Sounds good , does n't it ?
The Dutch accessibility law has been created by people who know quite a bit about accessibility .
In fact , last Tuesday I had a meeting with two members of this committee to discuss slight changes in the Site Survey script that 's treated in chapter 6 of the book .
The committee members impressed me with their factual and detailed knowledge of modern , standards - compliant web development .
It was perfectly possible to discuss accessibility , usability , JavaScript use and popups on a level that would n't be out of place on an international Web conference .
The guidelines ' one slight accessibility problem in an international context is the lack of translations .
Currently they are only available in Dutch .
A pleasant secondary effect of this law will be the gradual removal of New Amateurs from the circle of web companies that work for the government .
Fourteen months ago I discussed ways and means of converting the new amateurs , and proposed :
Could we arrange for economic pressure , for instance by lobbying for all government sites to require the use of CSS ?
It seems the Dutch government has done exactly this .
Thank you !

“ Executive privilege ” claim in US attorneys ’ case
White House asserts sweeping power to defy the law
By Bill Van Auken
21 July 2007
The Bush administration has claimed virtually unlimited power to defy Congress and federal law in its rejection of congressional attempts to secure information related to the politically motivated firing of nine US attorneys .
The Washington Post reported Friday that officials in the administration have insisted that “ the Justice Department will never be allowed to pursue contempt charges initiated by Congress against White House officials once the president has invoked executive privilege . ”
The report came one day after a House judiciary panel indicated that it is moving closer to bringing contempt charges against White House chief of staff Joshua Bolten over his refusal to turn over subpoenaed documents sought in the probe of the federal prosecutors ’ purge .
The House subcommittee voted 7 - to - 3 to reject the White House contention that Bolten ’s stonewalling is legitimized by Bush ’s assertion of executive privilege .
The Bush administration has made the sweeping claim that virtually all communications involving decision - making within the administration are protected as confidential discussions involving the US president .
Similar claims have been made by the administration in rebuffing subpoenas issued by the Senate Judiciary Committee demanding documents from the Vice President Dick Cheney ’s office , the Justice Department and the National Security Council regarding the National Security Agency ’s secret and illegal domestic spying operation .
In addition , the White House has instructed Bush ’s former White House Counsel Harriet Miers to refuse to respond to a congressional subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee on the attorney firings .
It was Miers who initiated the process that led to the firings of the nine prosecutors , when she proposed that all 93 US attorneys be dismissed after Bush ’s reelection in 2004 .
The administration and the Republican right have advanced a thesis known as the “ unitary executive , ” under which all executive branch officials , including the US attorneys , are to be considered extensions of the president ’s personal power .
This means that Congress cannot mandate an executive agency or department to carry out actions opposed by the president — such as initiating the prosecution of a top official for contempt of Congress .
“ Those claims are not legally valid , ” the House panel ’s chairwoman , Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat , said after Thursday ’s vote .
“ We are hopeful that the White House will come to the conclusion that is better for them to cooperate than continue this confrontation . ”
Sanchez ’s claims were substantiated in a confidential report drawn up by the Congressional Research Service , Congress ’s non-partisan research arm , dated July 5 and entitled “ Presidential Claims of Executive Privilege : History , Law , Practice and Recent Developments . ”
The document , while not issued publicly , was posted earlier this week on the web site of the Federation of American Scientists Project on Government Secrecy .
The report states in part that “ recent appellate court rulings cast considerable doubt on the broad claims of privilege posited by the OLC ( the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel ) in the past and now by the Clement Memo . ”
The document to which the report refers is a memorandum issued June 27 by Paul D. Clement , the Solicitor General and Acting Attorney General in matters dealing with the fired prosecutors , claiming virtual blanket immunity under executive privilege and baldly asserting that “ congressional interest in investigating the replacement of US attorneys clearly falls outside its core constitutional responsibilities . ”
The document , drafted by the CRS ’s specialist in American public law , Morton Rosenberg , went on to cite two court rulings against the Clinton administration , the Espy and Judicial Watch cases , asserting that they “ arguably have effected important qualifications and restraints on the nature , scope and reach of the presidential communications privilege . ”
In particular , Rosenberg insisted that these cases found that “ the unavailability of the information elsewhere by an appropriate investigating authority ” trumps an assertion of executive privilege .
The response of the Bush administration to such findings is to assert even greater extra-constitutional powers , essentially declaring that once executive privilege is claimed , the White House is answerable to neither the Congress nor the courts .
It has made it clear that it is prepared to openly defy the law in order to impose this interpretation .
Under federal law , once the House or Senate issues a contempt citation against an administration official , it is submitted to the US attorney for the District of Columbia , “ whose duty it shall be to bring the matter before the grand jury for its action . ”
According to the Post , administration officials have made it clear that they intend to block this legally defined process .
“ A US attorney would not be permitted to bring contempt charges or convene a grand jury in an executive privilege case , ” a “ senior official ” told the Post , affirming that his position was that of the administration .
“ And a US attorney would n’t be permitted to argue against the reasoned legal opinion that the Justice Department provided .
No one should expect that to happen . ”
The official added that the “ constitutional prerogatives of the president would make it a futile and purely political act for Congress to refer contempt citations to US attorneys . ”
An “ astonishing ” assertion of presidential power
The Post article quoted George Mason University professor of public policy Mark J. Rozell , an expert on executive privilege , describing the administration ’s position as “ astonishing ” and a “ breathtakingly broad view of the president ’s role in this system of separation of powers . ”
“ What this statement is saying is the president ’s claim of executive privilege trumps all , ” Rozell added .
California Democratic Congressman Henry Waxman , chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , the principal investigative committee of the House , told the newspaper that the administration ’s position “ makes a mockery of the ideal that no one is above the law . ”
Waxman added , “ I suppose the next step would be just disbanding the Justice Department . ”
In fact , the White House position is of a piece with the federal prosecutors ’ firings to begin with .
The purpose of the purge was to secure the transformation of the Justice Department into little more than a political agency of the White House and the Republican National Committee , using its police powers to influence the outcome of the 2006 and 2008 elections .
Ample evidence has already emerged from the investigation into the purge of US attorneys that those fired were targeted either for prosecuting corrupt Republican elected officials or for resisting Republican demands that they mount politically motivated investigations of Democratic candidates and pro-Democratic organizations on trumped - up vote fraud charges .
The only precedent that White House officials cited in their sweeping claims for executive privilege is a 1984 opinion issued by the right - wing lawyer Theodore Olson , who headed the Justice Department ’s Office of Legal Counsel under the Reagan administration and then served Bush as solicitor general between 2001 and 2004 .
The case involved the refusal of then Environmental Protection Agency chief Anne Gorsuch Burford to turn over documents relating to a scandal over the Reagan administration ’s failure to enforce toxic waste cleanup statutes .
The document asserted : “ The President , through a United States Attorney , need not , indeed may not , prosecute criminally a subordinate for asserting on his behalf a claim of executive privilege .
Nor could the Legislative Branch or the courts require or implement the prosecution of such an individual . ”
This extra-constitutional assertion was never tested in court , as the Reagan administration ended up turning over the documents and Burford , who was found in contempt of Congress , resigned .
Given the administration ’s blanket refusal to comply with federal law , recourse is left to Congress in the form of “ inherent contempt . ”
This statutory procedure , enacted by Congress in 1857 , allows either the House or Senate to issue a contempt citation and then have the individual cited arrested by the body ’s sergeant - at - arms to be brought to the floor of the chamber for trial .
This authority was used only once , in 1934 , when the Senate tried and convicted a former Postmaster , sentencing him to 10 days in jail .
The action was subsequently upheld as constitutional by the US Supreme Court .
If there was ever an occasion for utilizing such a statute , it is manifestly presented by the Bush administration ’s brazen contempt for the law .
There is little chance , however , that either the Senate or the House will invoke this power .
Just as the Democratic leadership in both chambers refuses to employ the congressional “ power of the purse ” to stop funding the war in Iraq , so too it has no stomach for aggressively pursuing a constitutional confrontation with the White House .
The extraordinary assertion by the White House of quasi- dictatorial powers takes place in the context of public support for Bush and his administration having fallen to near record lows , with less than a third of the population expressing support for their policies , and with particularly bitter opposition to the war in Iraq .
Bush ’s claims might appear delusional in the light of his dwindling political support .
But given the passivity and continuous capitulation of the ostensible political opposition in the Democratic Party , and cover-up of the constitutional implications by the media , the assertion by the White House of supra-legal powers assumes far more ominous significance .
The cantilever force sensor at the heart of IBM ’s “ nano - MRI ” microscope measures just twelve hundredths of a millimeter in length and a tiny one ten - thousandth of a millimeter thick .
IBM scientists have used this nano - MRI to visualize structures at resolution 60,000 times better than current magnetic resonance imaging technology allows .
This technique brings MRI capability to the nanoscale level for the first time and represents a major milestone in the quest to build a microscope that could " see " individual atoms in three dimensions .
With further development , applications could include understanding how individual proteins interact with drugs for discovery and development , and analyzing computer circuits only a few atoms wide .

IBM today announced that researchers at its Almaden Research Center have demonstrated magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) techniques to visualize nanoscale objects .
This technique brings MRI capability to the nanoscale level for the first time and represents a major milestone in the quest to build a microscope that could " see " individual atoms in three dimensions .
Using Magnetic Resonance Force Microscopy ( MRFM ) , IBM researchers have demonstrated two - dimensional imaging of objects as small as 90 nanometers , a key advancement on the path of 3D imaging at the atomic scale .
Such imaging could ultimately provide a better understanding of how proteins function , which in turn may lead to more efficient drug discovery and development .
“ Our ultimate goal is to perform three - dimensional imaging of complex structures such as molecules with atomic resolution , ” said Dan Rugar , manager , Nanoscale Studies , IBM Research .
“ This would allow scientists to study the atomic structures of molecules — such as proteins — which would represent a huge breakthrough in structural molecular biology . "
MRFM offers imaging sensitivity that is 60,000 times better than current magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) technology .
MRFM uses what is known as force detection to overcome the sensitivity limitations of conventional MRI to view structures that would otherwise be too small to be detected .
To achieve this , the research team developed specialized magnetic tips for their microscope , optimizing their ability to manipulate and detect the very weak magnetism of atomic nuclei .
Conventional medical MRI typically operates on a scale at least 1,000 times coarser ; even the most specialized MRI microscopy is limited to about 3 micrometers , or 3,000 nanometers .
This achievement could eventually have major impact on the study of materials — ranging from proteins and pharmaceuticals to integrated circuits — for which a detailed understanding of the atomic structure is essential .
Knowing the exact location of specific atoms within tiny nanoelectronic structures , for example , would enhance designers ' insight into manufacture and performance .
The ability to directly image the detailed atomic structure of proteins would aid the development of new drugs .
For more than a decade , IBM researchers have been making pioneering advancements in MRFM .
With this latest achievement , the team is now able to make images with as few as 103 atoms as opposed to the 108 atoms required to make an image with today ’s MRI technology .
This improved sensitivity extends MRI into the nanometer realm .
IBM Research has a distinguished history in developing microscopes for nanoscale imaging and science .
Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer of IBM 's Zurich Research Laboratory received the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics for their invention of the scanning tunneling microscope , which can image individual atoms on electrically conducting surfaces .
The report on this work , “ Nuclear magnetic resonance imaging with 90 - nm resolution , ” by H. J. Mamin1 , M. Poggio , C. L. Degen and D. Rugar at IBM Research Division , Almaden Research Center , San Jose , California and the Center for Probing the Nanoscale , Stanford University appears in the April 22 issue of Nature Nanotechnology .

Escalation in the Middle East
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul

While the president ’s announcement that an additional 20,000 troops would be sent to Iraq dominated the headlines last week , the real story was the president ’s sharp rhetoric towards Iran and Syria .
And recent moves by the administration only serve to confirm the likelihood of a wider conflict in the Middle East .
The president stated last week that ,  Succeeding in Iraq also requires defending its territorial integrity — and stabilizing the region in the face of the extremist challenge .
This begins with addressing Iran and Syria . 
He also announced the deployment of an additional aircraft carrier battle group to the Persian Gulf , and the deployment of Patriot air missile defense systems to countries in the Middle East .
Meanwhile , US troops stormed the Iranian consulate in Iraq and detained several Iranian diplomats .
Taken together , the message was clear : the administration intends to move the US closer to a dangerous and ill - advised conflict with Iran .
As I said last week on the House floor , speculation in Washington focuses on when , not if , either Israel or the U.S. will bomb Iran — possibly with nuclear weapons .
The accusation sounds very familiar : namely , that Iran possesses weapons of mass destruction .
Iran has never been found in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty , and our own Central Intelligence Agency says Iran is more than ten years away from producing any kind of nuclear weapon .
Yet we are told we must act immediately while we still can !
This all sounds very familiar , but many of my colleagues do n’t seem to have learned much from the invasion of Iraq .
House Democrats strongly criticized the Iraq troop surge after the president ’s announcement , but then praised the president ’s confrontational words condemning Iran .
Many of those opposing a troop surge are not calling for a withdrawal of our troops from the Middle East , but rather for redeployment .
Redeployment to where ?
Iran ?
We need to return to reality when it comes to our Middle East policy .
We need to reject the increasingly shrill rhetoric coming from the same voices who urged the president to invade Iraq .
The truth is that Iran , like Iraq , is a third - world nation without a significant military .
Nothing in history hints that she is likely to invade a neighboring country , let alone America or Israel .
I am concerned , however , that a contrived Gulf of Tonkin - type incident may occur to gain popular support for an attack on Iran .
The best approach to Iran , and Syria for that matter , is to heed the advice of the Iraq Study Group Report , which states :
" the United States should engage directly with Iran and Syria in order to try to obtain their commitment to constructive policies toward Iraq and other regional issues .
In engaging with Syria and Iran , the United States should consider incentives , as well as disincentives , in seeking constructive results . "
In coming weeks I plan to introduce legislation that urges the administration to heed the advice of the Iraq Study Group .
Dialogue and discussion should replace inflammatory rhetoric and confrontation in our Middle East policy , if we truly seek to defeat violent extremism and terrorism .
Dr. Ron Paul is a Republican member of Congress from Texas .
The Best of Ron Paul
There was no surprise today when Dana Perino , speaking on behalf the White House at today 's press gaggle , declared the following with respect to the recently passed FISA bill :
We are going to have some fights on our hands ; we know that .
We are going to be asking for the FISA law that was just modernized last week , and which the President signed before he left for Maine , to be made permanent .
Right now there is a sunset on it , and we think that 's inappropriate .
While the White House will be actively pursing making the deplorable FISA bill permanent , the leadership in both the House and Senate have vowed to take quick action to temper the impact of the recently passed law .
Just hours after the vote , Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi sent a letter to John Conyers and Silvestre Reyes ( Chairmen of the House Judiciary and Intelligence committees ) , seeking to fix the FISA bill " as soon as possible " :
Tonight , the House passed S. 1927 , a bill approved by the Senate yesterday , which is an interim response to the Administration 's request for changes in FISA , and which was sought to fill an intelligence gap which is asserted to exist .
Many provisions of this legislation are unacceptable , and , although the bill has a six month sunset clause , I do not believe the American people will want to wait that long before corrective action is taken .
Accordingly , I request that your committees send to the House , as soon as possible after Congress reconvenes , legislation which responds comprehensively to the Administration 's proposal while addressing the many deficiencies in S. 1927 .
Today , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid issued a similar statement to Senators Rockerfeller and Leahy ( Chairmen of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary Committees ) :
I know both of you share my disappointment at the process that led to passage of the recent law , and at the flawed outcome itself , which you and I and many others strongly opposed .
The temporary authorities in the new law will sunset in six months .
While these temporary authorities are in effect , I support all efforts by your two committees to conduct vigorous and comprehensive oversight of their implementation .
I also know that your committees have been working exhaustively on sound options for a longer - term change to FISA , even though your work has been hindered by lack of cooperation from the Administration in providing relevant information .
When the Senate reconvenes in September , I fully support your committees working expeditiously together and in a bipartisan manner to develop a longer - term statutory change that better serves American national security interests and comports with the Constitution and proper judicial and congressional oversight .
I would like to see the full Senate consider as soon as possible a bill reported by your committees that addresses the deficiencies in the recently - enacted law and any other matter you believe must be addressed .
Although the recently passed law has a six - month sunset provision , and although the White House hopes that after those six months this rights - stripping , unitary - executive - coddling law becomes permanent , Congress clearly has other plans .
You can expect to see more FISA legislation -- better FISA legislation --- up for votes this year .
And Congress can expect to have us on its heels beforehand , reminding our good Senators and Representatives that the " support and defend the Constitution " part of their oath is n't really optional .

When Deborah Jackson opened her electric bill in February , she had no idea it would be a life - changing event .
She and her husband , Patrick , who live in a three - bedroom brick house in East St. Louis , Ill. , owed Ameren ( AEE ) $ 600.82 , up from $ 172 in January .
In March , the tab floated into the stratosphere : $ 1,024.31 .
Since the couple 's budget billing plan lets them pay the same amount each month , the charges were eventually set at $ 538 .
To keep the lights on , Deborah has returned her engagement ring to the jeweler until the Jacksons can afford the ring 's $ 125 monthly payment .
Patrick , a warehouse employee , works an extra day each week .
The Jacksons and their two kids no longer eat out or go to the movies .
" It 's frustrating because you can't do the things you 're used to doing , " Deborah says .
" You 're like , ' I 'm just working to pay a light bill . ' "
The Jacksons are among millions of U.S. residents reeling from the aftershocks of electricity deregulation in 17 states and Washington , D.C. After rate freezes in Illinois expired in January , bills soared up to 55 % for Ameren customers and 26 % for those of Commonwealth Edison .
The Jacksons were hit with a much bigger increase because their house is among 170,000 Ameren dwellings that got big discounts for using electric heat .
Those discounts also ended in January .
Deregulation was supposed to do for the power industry what it did in the airline and telecommunications industries : bring consumers lower prices and more competition .
Instead , utility bills are rising sharply for residents in many states that unshackled their power markets as rate caps , the final remnants of regulation , expire .
Now , several deregulated states , fearing a public backlash , are turning back the clock and reinstating some form of electricity regulation .
The Illinois legislature last month approved a $ 1 billion rate - relief package that would on average halve the increase that socked Illinois customers like the Jacksons .
The pact also scraps a controversial wholesale - power auction system and sets up a new agency to buy electricity and build generators .
Virginia reregulated its power industry in July .
Other states have partly reregulated or are weighing doing so before rate freezes are lifted .
In Ohio , rate caps are scheduled to end in December 2008 , when utilities would buy their power in the wholesale market .
" Some feel you should let the market take over , but based on what I 've seen happen in other states , it 's just not something I 'm willing to tolerate , " Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland said .
While average prices rose 21 % in regulated states from 2002 to 2006 , they leapt 36 % in deregulated states where rate caps expired , according to a study by Ken Rose , senior fellow at the Institute of Public Utilities at Michigan State University .
Electric rates for Baltimore - area customers surged 50 % in June after a 15 % jump last year as rate caps came off .
There have been similar surges in Connecticut , Delaware and Rhode Island .
Meanwhile , little , if any , retail competition has materialized for consumers .
Deregulation , which affects regions with more than half the U.S. population , " has n't panned out the way we had hoped , " Rose says .
Rose and other industry experts largely blame wholesale power markets dominated by a handful of large suppliers .
In some cases , these giants have been accused of manipulating prices in ways that echo complaints during the 2000 California energy crisis .
Some economists say electricity is n't suited to competition because it 's needed 24 hours a day and can't be stored , giving sellers too much leverage .
In the 1990s , deregulation was pushed by commercial customers rankled by utilities that built too many power plants and saddled customers with the tab .
Deregulation was supposed to let customers buy electricity from more - efficient , competing suppliers .
To prevent utilities from favoring their own plants , many had to sell the generators to unregulated affiliates or to independent power wholesalers .
The power - generation price on the bill was no longer regulated , but states continued to oversee utilities and the separate price they charged to maintain the wires to homes and businesses .
Customers could buy from the new competitors or stay with their utility , which itself would have to purchase power from the wholesalers .
To ensure instant benefits for consumers , states froze residential rates for five to 10 years .
But while 60 % or more of commercial customers in many deregulated states switched to rivals and realized at least some savings , fewer than 10 % of consumers have defected , says a study by Michigan State and Ohio State universities .
Richard Rathvon , head of the Retail Energy Supply Association , blames the rate caps , which kept prices artificially low and left rivals no room to undercut the utility .
" Competition has n't failed , " he says .
" It has n't been allowed to work . "
Proof , he says , lies in Texas , where utilities have been able to raise their rates in response to fuel price increases and this year were freed of all price restraints .
About 60 % of Texas consumers have chosen an alternative power supplier .
D'Lana Motta , 52 , of DeSoto , Texas , switched from utility TXU ( TXU ) to Reliant Energy ( RRI ) earlier this year to light her home and clothing boutique .
She 's saving about 10 % on her electric bill .
" In running a business , you want to save money , " she says .
" And maybe it 's a little more personal service . "
' Deregulation has been disappointing '
Yet critics say Texas points up competition 's failure : Average electricity prices still have surged 58 % since 2002 .
" Deregulation has been disappointing , " says Clarence Johnson of the Texas Public Utility Counsel .
The culprit , Rathvon says , is fossil - fuel costs , especially natural gas , which has tripled in price since the late 1990s .
Even coal prices have risen 70 % .
That has driven up electric rates in regulated states as well .
Rose says fuel costs do n't explain the bigger price increases in deregulated states .
Echoing a sentiment voiced by consumer advocates , Rose instead points to wholesale electricity markets he says are far from competitive .
Wholesale power suppliers have built few plants as they 've been unable to obtain financing .
And most big utilities and their generation affiliates have not built transmission lines to import out - of - state power or local plants because keeping supplies tight means higher prices , Rose says .
In a power sale last year , Baltimore Gas & Electric said it purchased 70 % of its electricity from its unregulated parent company , Constellation Energy ( CEG ) .
BG&E sold its plants to Constellation during deregulation .
A Maryland Public Service Commission ( PSC ) report says BG&E conceded in hearings it " has no direct financial incentive to keep generation rates low for its customers . "
Constellation profit rose 50 % last year to a record $ 936 million .
" There appears to be a conflict between Constellation 's objective in selling electricity at the highest price and BG&E 's obligation to get the lowest price , " says PSC Chairman Steven Larsen .
Paul Allen , Constellation 's vice president of corporate affairs , says Constellation is supplying much of BG&E 's power because it's " the low - cost provider . "
Allen blames the rate increases on natural gas price increases after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005 .
Natural gas represents a small portion of electricity generation but has a disproportionate effect on wholesale prices .
That 's because idle natural gas plants that rev up to meet excess demand on hot days charge high prices that all generators , even low - cost coal plants , receive .
Such " spot market " prices also affect rates for long - term contracts .
By contrast , regulated utilities must charge customers the average cost of all their generation .
Illinois officials cite a more sinister explanation for rate increases triggered by last year 's wholesale auction .
In a complaint to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission , state Attorney General Lisa Madigan accused 15 wholesale suppliers of manipulating prices .
One way that could have happened , the complaint says , is by prospective bidders withdrawing from the auction to drive up prices in exchange for winning bidders agreeing to buy their power in separate contracts .
" The short answer is , ' Bunk , ' " says John Rowe , CEO of Exelon ( EXC ) , one of the bidders named in the complaint and parent company of Commonwealth Edison .
The attorney general has agreed to drop the complaint if the rate - cut package is signed by the governor .
In Texas , state regulators have proposed a $ 210 million fine against TXU after a consultant 's report found the company withheld power from the spot market in 2005 to push up wholesale prices .
Questions also have been raised about the regional power grid operators that manage the flow of electricity between states and oversee auctions , and whose members include utilities and suppliers .
Joseph Bowring , who monitors power purchases for Mid-Atlantic grid operator PJM Interconnection , told FERC in May that PJM kept him from reporting that utilities paid $ 20 million more than necessary for power because of one generator 's market dominance , among other problems .
To discourage manipulation of wholesale purchases , FERC has proposed new rules , including making suppliers disclose their bids to other bidders after a brief lag .
Bids are now kept secret for six months .
" We 're trying to increase the transparency , " says FERC Chairman Joseph Kelliher .
He says FERC is closely monitoring power markets and , with a 2005 law , can now impose hefty fines for manipulation .
Meanwhile , states worried about rate increases have scaled back deregulation .
A new Virginia law gives utilities fresh incentives to build power plants and ends retail choice for most customers to ensure a sufficient customer base to finance the generators .
Consumer groups say Dominion Virginia Power ( D ) , the state 's No. 1 utility , spearheaded the legislation and is unfairly benefiting from it .
It can keep 40 % of excess profits and earn an especially high rate of return for building nuclear plants , renewable power or " clean coal " generators .
And Dominion can still sell power into the region 's competitive wholesale markets .
" ( Dominion ) called the shots , " says Irene Leech , head of the Virginia Citizens Consumer Council , noting the utility has long been the top corporate contributor to state lawmakers .
" They want the benefits of competition , but they do n't want to take any risks . "
Dominion CEO
Tom Farrell vigorously denies ramming the bill through the Legislature and says the new incentives are needed to prod the company to be more efficient and build plants that do n't contribute to global warming .
During the rate freeze , he notes , Dominion had to write off $ 1.5 billion in fuel costs .
Other states can't revert to regulation because utilities have sold their power plants .
So they 're taking baby steps back .
Connecticut and Montana recently agreed to let utilities again build plants , which can take at least four years to complete .
The extra supply is designed to temper price increases in the wholesale market .
Officials in Maryland , Ohio and Michigan are considering similar proposals .
Pros and cons of a return to regulation
Yet officials say scrapping deregulation brings its own perils .
Bill Massey , a former FERC commissioner and a lawyer for Compete , a group of wholesalers , utilities and customers , says free markets have led to more efficient and innovative plants .
Now , rivals are best able to offer conservation and energy efficiency services to cut global warming emissions , he says .
Allen of Constellation warns that " ratepayers will be on the hook for cost overruns " if utilities such as BG&E are permitted to once again build and own plants .
And David Crane , CEO of NRG Energy ( NRG ) , worries that independent suppliers like NRG could be squeezed out if utilities that buy electricity can also produce it .
Unmoved by such arguments are consumers struggling under huge electric rate increases .
Jackson , the Illinois customer , welcomes the price cuts included in the proposed plan to beef up state oversight .
" That would help me , " she says .
" Anything 's better than $ 538 . "

AFTER 28 years at an electronics plant in her hometown , Mount Pleasant , Iowa , Toni Cory found herself out of a job when the plant closed .
Instead of looking for another manufacturing job , she vowed to start a dog day - care and kennel business .
Although she had dogs of her own , she had no clue where to start .
To help , she called on VocationVacations , a company based in Portland , Ore. , that enables the curious to spend time trying out potential new jobs .
The company hooked up Ms. Cory with Dawn Walton , an owner of the Dog Zone , a dog day care business in nearby Cedar Rapids .
There , Ms. Cory had an experience she says she will never forget .
Over two and a half days , she walked dogs ; she washed them ; she groomed them and fed them .
When she was n’t dealing with dogs directly , she cleaned kennels , calmed cranky customers and balanced budget sheets .
Ms. Cory returned home , she said , exhausted but fulfilled .
Three months later , she opened Almost Home , a dog day care and boarding service in Mount Pleasant .
A law has been proposed in the US Congress that would overturn a recent ruling on internet radio royalty payments .
The bill could save internet radio , according to activists .
Earlier this month the Copyright Royalty Board ( CRB ) , which reports to the Library of Congress , increased the charges which internet radio stations will have to pay in order to broadcast music .
Stations claim that the charges in many cases represent more than their total revenues , and that they make it impossible to build a business out of online radio .
The CRB is answerable to Congress , and two members of the House of Representatives have proposed a law which would withdraw the CRB 's recent ruling and propose a compromise system of payments .
Internet radio activists say that the system is unfair because it penalises online radio stations unduly .
Broadcast radio pays no royalty fees , they say , while satellite radio pays far less than internet radio's new charges .
The new law will charge the same fee to radio stations whether they are provided via satellite , cable , or the internet .
It will offer stations the chance to choose to pay 7.5 per cent of their revenues or 33 cents per hour per listener .
The bill was introduced by Democrat Jay Inslee and Republican Don Manzullo .
" Since the CRB 's decision to dramatically and unfairly increase webcaster royalty rates , millions of internet radio listeners , webcasters and artists have called on Congress to take action , " said Jake Ward of lobby group SaveNetRadio .
" Today Congress took notice , and we thank Mr Inslee for leading the charge to save music diversity on the internet . "
Speaking this month to OUT - LAW Radio's Joe Kennedy , chief executive of Pandora , one of the internet 's largest radio - style services , said the threat to online radio was severe .
" The judges adopted the proposal to triple the rates for large webcasters , and for small webcasters it 's actually closer to a 12 times increase in the rates that they pay , " said Kennedy .
" It 's an extraordinary increase in the rates that will effectively kill internet radio as we know it today .
" Over 90 per cent of internet radio will simply be gone .
The net result will be a huge loss of diversity , a huge loss for music artists and a loss of virtually all of the internet radio that exists . "
" You ca n't put an economic chokehold on this emerging force of democracy , " Inslee said , according to CNet News .
" There has to be a business model that allows creative webcasters to thrive and the existing rule removes all the oxygen from this space . "

Oxfam say basic services cannot meet the needs of the Iraqi people
Life in Iraq
The report said the government was failing to provide basics such as food and shelter for eight million people .
It warned of a humanitarian crisis that had escalated since the 2003 invasion .
Meanwhile , the US agency overseeing reconstruction in Iraq said economic mismanagement and corruption were equivalent to " a second insurgency " .
Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction Stuart Bowen was appointed by the US Congress to audit how billions of dollars of US money is being and has been spent .
In a BBC interview , he described corruption as " an enemy of democracy " and said that it could not be allowed to continue at current levels .

" We have performed 95 audits that have found instances of programmatic weakness and waste , and we 've got 57 ongoing cases right now , criminal cases , looking at fraud . "
Last year , Prime Minister Nouri Maliki 's government only spent 22 % of its budget on vital rebuilding projects , while spending 99 % of the allocation for salaries , he said .
The inspector general also described a process of transferring control of projects to the Iraqi government as troubling , and found cancellations , delays and costs that outstripped budgets .
He said " a pathway towards potential prosperity " could be found only if oil production was brought up to optimal levels , and security and corruption effectively managed .
' Ruined by war '
The Iraqi parliament is about to take the whole of August off as a holiday despite the problems and the Oxfam report highlighting the plight of many Iraqis .
The BBC's Nicholas Witchell in Baghdad says the report by the UK - based charity and the NGO Co-ordination Committee in Iraq ( NCCI ) makes alarming reading .
Millions of Iraqis have been forced to flee the violence , either to another part of Iraq or abroad - many of those are living in dire poverty
Jeremy Hobbs
Director of Oxfam International
Alarming humanitarian crisis
The survey recognises that armed conflict is the greatest problem facing Iraqis , but finds a population " increasingly threatened by disease and malnutrition " .
It suggests that 70 % of Iraq 's 26.5 m population are without adequate water supplies , compared to 50 % prior to the invasion .
Only 20 % have access to effective sanitation .
Nearly 30 % of children are malnourished , a sharp increase on the situation four years ago .
Some 15 % of Iraqis regularly cannot afford to eat .
The report also said 92 % of Iraq 's children suffered from learning problems .
It found that more than two million people have been displaced inside the country , while a further two million have fled to neighbouring countries .
Many are living in dire poverty .
" Basic services , ruined by years of war and sanctions , cannot meet the needs of the Iraqi people , " the director of Oxfam International , Jeremy Hobbs , said .
Mr Hobbs said that despite the violence , the Iraqi government and the international community could do more to meet people 's needs .
On Thursday , an international conference in Jordan pledged to help the refugees with their difficulties .
Oxfam has not operated in Iraq since 2003 for security reasons .
FBI agents trying to track the source of e-mailed bomb threats against a Washington high school last month sent the suspect a secret surveillance program designed to surreptitiously monitor him and report back to a government server , according to an FBI affidavit obtained by Wired News .
The court filing offers the first public glimpse into the bureau 's long - suspected spyware capability , in which the FBI adopts techniques more common to online criminals .
The software was sent to the owner of an anonymous MySpace profile linked to bomb threats against Timberline High School near Seattle .
The code led the FBI to 15 - year - old Josh G. , a student at the school , who on Monday pleaded guilty to making bomb threats , identity theft and felony harassment .
In an affidavit seeking a search warrant to use the software , filed last month in U.S. District Court in the Western District of Washington , FBI agent Norman Sanders describes the software as a " computer and internet protocol address verifier , " or CIPAV .
FBI Spyware in a Nutshell
The full capabilities of the FBI 's " computer and internet protocol address verifier " are closely guarded secrets , but here 's some of the data the malware collects from a computer immediately after infiltrating it , according to a bureau affidavit acquired by Wired News .
• IP address
• MAC address of ethernet cards
• A list of open TCP and UDP ports
• A list of running programs
• The operating system type , version and serial number
• The default internet browser and version
• The registered user of the operating system , and registered company name , if any
• The current logged - in user name
• The last visited URL
Once that data is gathered , the CIPAV begins secretly monitoring the computer 's internet use , logging every IP address to which the machine connects .
All that information is sent over the internet to an FBI computer in Virginia , likely located at the FBI 's technical laboratory in Quantico .
Sanders wrote that the spyware program gathers a wide range of information , including the computer 's IP address ; MAC address ; open ports ; a list of running programs ; the operating system type , version and serial number ; preferred internet browser and version ; the computer 's registered owner and registered company name ; the current logged - in user name and the last - visited URL .
The CIPAV then settles into a silent " pen register " mode , in which it lurks on the target computer and monitors its internet use , logging the IP address of every computer to which the machine connects for up to 60 days .
Under a ruling this month by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals , such surveillance – which does not capture the content of the communications – can be conducted without a wiretap warrant , because internet users have no " reasonable expectation of privacy " in the data when using the internet .
According to the affidavit , the CIPAV sends all the data it collects to a central FBI server located somewhere in eastern Virginia .
The server 's precise location was n't specified , but previous FBI internet surveillance technology – notably its Carnivore packet - sniffing hardware – was developed and run out of the bureau 's technology laboratory at the FBI Academy in Quantico , Virginia .
The FBI 's national office referred an inquiry about the CIPAV to a spokeswoman for the FBI Laboratory in Quantico , who declined to comment on the technology .
The FBI has been known to use PC - spying technology since at least 1999 , when a court ruled the bureau could break into reputed mobster Nicodemo Scarfo 's office to plant a covert keystroke logger on his computer .
But it was n't until 2001 that the FBI 's plans to use hacker - style computer - intrusion techniques emerged in a report by MSNBC.com .
The report described an FBI program called " Magic Lantern " that uses deceptive e-mail attachments and operating - system vulnerabilities to infiltrate a target system .
The FBI later confirmed the program , and called it a " workbench project " that had not been deployed .
No cases have been publicly linked to such a capability until now , says David Sobel , a Washington , D.C. , attorney with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" It might just be that the defense lawyers are not sufficiently sophisticated to have their ears perk up when this methodology is revealed in a prosecution , " says Sobel .
" I think it 's safe to say the use of such a technique raises novel and unresolved legal issues . "
The June affidavit does n't reveal whether the CIPAV can be configured to monitor keystrokes , or to allow the FBI real - time access to the computer 's hard drive , like typical Trojan malware used by computer criminals .
It notes that the " commands , processes , capabilities and ... configuration " of the CIPAV is " classified as a law enforcement sensitive investigative technique , the disclosure of which would likely jeopardize other ongoing investigations and / or future use of the technique . "
The document is also silent as to how the spyware infiltrates the target 's computer .
In the Washington case , the FBI delivered the program through MySpace 's messaging system , which allows HTML and embedded images .
The FBI might have simply tricked the suspect into downloading and opening an executable file , says Roger Thompson , CTO of security vendor Exploit Prevention Labs .
But the bureau could also have exploited one of the legion of web browser vulnerabilities discovered by computer - security researchers and cybercrooks – or even used one of its own .
" It 's quite possible the FBI knows about vulnerabilities that have not been disclosed to the rest of the world , " says Thompson .
" If they had discovered one , they would not have disclosed it , and that would be a great way to get stuff on people 's computer .
Then I guess they can bug whoever they want . "
The FBI 's 2008 budget request hints at the bureau 's efforts in the hacking arena , including $ 220,000 sought to " purchase highly specialized equipment and technical tools used for covert ( and ) overt search and seizure forensic operations . …
This funding will allow the technology challenges ( sic ) including bypass , defeat or compromise of computer systems . "
With the FBI in the business of hacking , security companies are in a tight place .
Thompson 's LinkScanner product , for example , scans web pages for security exploits , and warns the customer if one is found .
How would his company respond if the FBI asked him to turn a blind eye to CIPAV ?
He says he 's never fielded such a request .
" That would put us in a very difficult position , " Thompson says .
" I do n't know what I 'd say . "
The Washington case unfolded May 30 , when a handwritten bomb threat prompted the evacuation of Timberline High School in Lacey , Washington .
No bomb was found .
On June 4 , a second bomb threat was e-mailed to the school from a Gmail account that had been newly created under the name of an innocent student .
" I will be blowing up your school Monday , June 4 , 2007 , " the message read .
" There are 4 bombs planted throughout Timberline high school .
One in the math hall , library hall , main office and one portable .
The bombs will go off in 5 minute intervals at 9:15 AM . "
In addition , the message promised , " The e-mail server of your district will be offline starting at 8:45 am . "
The author made good on the latter threat , and a denial - of - service attack smacked the North Thurston Public Schools computer network , generating a relatively modest 1 million packets an hour .
Responding to the bomb threat , school administrators ordered an evacuation of the high school , but , once again , no explosives were found .
That began a bizarre cat - and - mouse game between law enforcement and school officials and the ersatz cyberterrorist , who e-mailed a new hoax bomb threat every day for several days , each triggering a new evacuation .
Each threat used the same pseudonym , but was sent from a different , newly created Gmail account to complicate tracing efforts .
On June 7 , the hoaxer started issuing threats through other online mediums .
In his most brazen move , he set up a MySpace profile called Timberlinebombinfo and sent friend requests to 33 classmates .
The whole time he was daring law enforcement officials to trace him .
" The e-mail was sent over a newly made Gmail account , from overseas in a foreign country , " he wrote in one message .
" Seeing as you 're too stupid to trace the e-mail back lets ( sic ) get serious , " he taunted in another .
" Maybe you should hire Bill Gates to tell you that it is coming from Italy .
HAHAHA .
Oh wait .
I already told you that it 's coming from Italy . "
As promised , attempts to trace the hoaxer dead - ended at a hacked server in Grumello del Monte , Italy .
The FBI 's Seattle Division contacted the FBI legal attaché in Rome , who provided an official request to the Italian national police for assistance .
But on June 12 , perhaps fed up with the mocking , the FBI applied for and obtained a search warrant authorizing the bureau to send the CIPAV to the Timberlinebombinfo MySpace profile .
Court documents reveal the search warrant was " executed " June 13 at 5:49 p.m .
Though the CIPAV provided a wealth of information , G's IP address would have been enough to guide the FBI to the teen 's front door .
John Sinclair , G's attorney , says his client never intended to blow anything up – " it was a prank from the get - go " – but admits he hacked into computers in Italy to launder his activities , and that he launched the denial - of - service attack against the school district 's network .
G. was sentenced Monday to 90 days in custody , and given credit for 32 days he 's spent behind bars since his arrest .
When he 's released he 'll be on two years ' probation with internet and computer restrictions , and he 's been expelled from high school .
The teen is being held at the Thurston County Juvenile Detention Center , where he will serve out his sentence , says Sinclair .
Sinclair says he was told that the FBI had tracked down his client in response to a request from local police – but that he did n't know exactly how the bureau did it .
" The prosecutor made it clear that they would n't indicate how this device works or how they do it , " says Sinclair .
" For obvious reasons . "
Larry Carr , a spokesman with the FBI 's Seattle field office , could n't confirm that the CIPAV is the same software previously known as Magic Lantern , but emphasized that the bureau 's technological capabilities have grown since the 2001 report .
The case shows that FBI scientists are equipped to handle internet threats , says Carr .
" It sends a message that , if you 're going to try and do stuff like this online , that we have the ability to track individuals ' movements online and bring the case to resolution . "

The predecessor of Haskell was named Orwell , and the user manual began with this quotation from the essay :
A man may take to drink because he feels himself to be a failure , and then fail all the more completely because he drinks .
It is rather the same thing that is happening to the English language .
It becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish , but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts .
Orwell explains why you cannot think clearly unless you express yourself clearly , and gives rules of thumb to help ensure the latter .

Mountain View , CA – Recent surveys in Internet usage have shown that the open source browser , Firefox , has been making significant gains on Internet Explorer in market share .
This has lead many Firefox users to begin preparing for The Foxture , or the day when Firefox finally passes Internet Explorer .
Many have speculated on what will happen on that day , and several theories have been circulating on the message boards and chat rooms .
Evan Nicholson from Santa Monica thinks he 'll be swept away to a Nirvana .
He said , “ On that day the Flying Spaghetti Monster will whisk me away to Flying Spaghetti Heaven in a Firefox - shaped spaceship .
I just hope my paladin hits level 70 before that happens . ”
Others , such as Bob Taylor from Ann Arbor , Michigan , think that will be the day that Microsoft will shut down operations .
“ How can Microsoft continue operations knowing that more people are using Firefox than Internet Explorer ?
Bill Gates will probably pass out the Kool - aid , and there 'll be a big clean up at Redmond , ” Taylor said .

Francis Hibbard , the director of the organization , said , “ It'll be bigger than New Year 's Eve at Time 's Square and the Super Bowl combined .
We 've already started accumulating fireworks . ”
Little doubt remains that the day will come , it 's just a question of when .
As Firefox users prepare to celebrate , Internet Explorer users face the crushing reality of being in the minority .
When asked how she felt about that eventuality , Jessica Wu , a long - time Internet Explorer user , said , “ Huh ? ” Then went back to playing Club Penguin .

Goodling fails to turn over documents subpoenaed by House committee Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday May 22 , 2007 Print This Email This Former top Justice Department aide Monica Goodling was chided by the House Judiciary Committee for failing to turn over documents that had been subpoenaed as part of the investigation into the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
Goodling is set to testify before the Committee on Wednesday .
" I am concerned , however , about your statement that Ms. Goodling is going to refuse to produce documents in her possession that are responsive to the subpoena , " Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , the committee 's chairman , wrote to Goodling 's attorney John Dowd .
In responding to an argument made by Dowd on why Goodling did not need to turn the documents over , he added , " We are aware of no authority that permits internal Department administrative regulation to allow a former employee of the Department of Justice , or any other person , to avoid the subpoena power of the House of Representatives , as that power is central to the House 's ability to carry out its Constitutional oversight mandate and certainly trumps internal agency regulations . "
At issue were a set of documents that Dowd , an attorney for the Washington , DC law firm Akin , Gump , Straus , Hauer , and Feld , acknowledged his client possessed .
" Ms. Goodling has copies of other electronic documents and emails that would be responsive to the Committee 's subpoena but which are copies of official Department of Justice documents , including un-redacted copies of documents produced to date only in redacted form , " wrote Dowd with additional counsel .
Bush : Insurgents in Iraq same as 9/11 attackers Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 12 , 2007 Print This Email This President Bush , defending his troop surge in Iraq , insisted Thursday that the insurgents attacking US troops in Iraq " are the same ones who attacked us on Sept. 11 . "
Bush was speaking at a White House press conference on the same day an interim progress report on his troop surge in Iraq was released .
Asked for proof of the connection between insurgents in Iraq and the 9/11 hijackers , Bush said both had pledged their allegiance to Osama bin Laden .
" The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq are the ones who attacked us on Sept. 11 , " Bush said .
The president was responding to a question from NBC correspondent David Gregory , who asked why Americans should n't believe he is " stubborn or in denial . "
Gregory was referencing a report in Thursday 's Washington Post that indicated CIA Director Michael Hayden saw as " irreversible " the lack of progress in Iraq .
Facing a new report out today on the progress of his troop surge , Bush downplayed the fact that the report shows Iraqi lawmakers are making " satisfactory " progress on less than half of the 18 benchmarks that are required related to the troop buildup .
The president reminded reporters that the buildup was just completed within the last month , and he tried to urge more patience in the war 's fifth year .
Bush said the report shows the Iraqi government has made satisfactory progress on eight benchmarks , unsatisfactory progress on eight more and mixed results on two .
Democrats used the occasion of the progress report 's release to criticize Bush 's war policy .
" Does this White House think that we do n't know how to turn on our televisions ? " asked Illinois Sen. Barack Obama , a Democratic presidential candidate , in a prepared statement .
" Do n't tell us we 're making progress in Iraq when the last three months have been some of the deadliest since this war began for our brave troops who have sacrificed so much .
And do n't tell us it 's progress when the Iraqi leadership has done nothing  nothing  to take the political steps necessary to end their civil war . "
During the press conference , Bush acknowledged that public opinion is turning against the war in Iraq , but he continued to insist that he believed the fight was winnable .
" There 's war fatigue in America , " Bush said .
" It 's affecting our psychology ... it 's an ugly war . "
Bush insisted progress was being made in Iraq , several times invoking Anbar Provence , before continuing to try to tie the Iraq war to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
" Al Qaeda in Iraq has pledged allegiance to Osama bin Laden , " Bush said .
" We need to take al Qaeda in Iraq seriously just like we need to take al Qaeda anywhere in the world seriously . "
Bush also refused to rule out committing more troops to Iraq in the future , saying he would not publicly speculate about what he will do when Gen.
David Petraeus delivers a final report on the surge 's progress in September .
" I 'm not going to answer your question , " Bush told a reporter who asked about the possibility of sending more troops to Iraq .
As Bush tried to leave the press conference , a reporter called out a question about a new intelligence report that shows al Qaeda is gaining strength and is stronger now than at any time since 2001 .
Bush said it " is simply not the case " that al Qaeda is stronger now than it was before the Sept. 11 attacks , although he asserted the terror group to defend some of his more controversial programs .
" No question al Qaeda is dangerous ... that 's why we need terrorist surveillance programs , " Bush said , in an apparent reference to his warrantless wiretapping program .
Bush 's double - take was a one - time deal , though .
As he left a second time , a reporter tried to get in one last question .
" Is bin Laden alive ? " the reporter asked , as Bush continued to leave the room without offering an answer .
The following video is from MSNBC's News Live broadcast on July 12 , and contains clips from press conference edited by David Edwards : Excerpts from briefing : # PRESIDENT BUSH : Nothing 's changed in the new room .
Anyway -- ( laughs ) -- yeah , I mean , as I told you last November right about this time , I -- I was part of that group of Americans who did n't approve of what was taking place in Iraq because it looked like all the efforts that we had taken to that point in time were about to fail .
In other words , sectarian violence was really raging .
And I had a choice to make , and that was to pull back , as some suggested , and hope that the chaos and violence that might occur in the capital would not spill out across the country ; or send more troops in to prevent the chaos and violence from happening in the first place , and that 's the decision I made .
So it was a realistic appraisal by me .
What 's realistic as well is to understand the consequences of what will happen if we fail in Iraq .
In other words , people are n't just going to be content with driving America out of Iraq , al Qaeda wants to hurt us here .
That 's their objective .
That 's what they 'd like to do .
They have got an ideology that they believe that the world ought to live under , and that one way to help spread that ideology is to harm the American people , harm American interests .
The same folks that are bombing innocent people in Iraq were the ones who attacked us in America on September the 11th , and that 's why what happens in Iraq matters to the security here at home .
So I 've been realistic about the consequences of failure .
I have been realistic about what needs to happen on the ground in order for there to be success .
And it 's been hard work .
And the American people see this hard work .
And one of the reasons it 's hard work is because on our TV screens are these violent killings perpetuated by people who have done us harm in the past .
And that ought to be a lesson for the American people ; to understand that what happens in Iraq and overseas matters to the security of the United States of America .
Yes , ma'am ?
Q
Sir , on that point , what evidence can you present to the American people that the people who attacked the United States on September 11th are in fact the same people who are responsible for the bombings taking place in Iraq ?
What evidence can you present ?
And also , are you saying , sir , that al Qaeda in Iraq is the same organization being run by Osama bin Laden himself ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Al Qaeda in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden .
And , you know , the guys who perpetuated the attacks on America , obviously the guys on the airplane are dead , and the commanders -- many of those are either dead or in captivity , like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed .
But the people in Iraq -- al Qaeda in Iraq has sworn allegiance to Osama bin Laden .
And we need to take al Qaeda in Iraq seriously , just like we need to take al Qaeda anywhere in the world seriously .
Let 's see here , working my way around here .
Sheryl . .... Q Good morning , Mr. President .
Given the events on the ground in Iraq and the politics here at home , has U.S. military deployment to Iraq reached a ceiling or can you allow any further military escalation ?
PRESIDENT BUSH :
You 're trying to do what Martha very skillfully tried to get me to do , and that was to -- Q Can I have a follow - up ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Yeah , you can because you were about to realize I 'm not going to answer your question , except -- ( interrupted by laughter ) -- except to say this .
There 's going to be great temptation to -- not temptation .
There will be -- you wo n't be tempted .
You will actually ask me to speculate about what David Petraeus will talk to us about when he comes home .
And I -- I just ask the American people to understand that the commander in chief must rely upon the wisdom and judgment of the military thinkers and planners .
It 's -- it 's -- it 's -- it 's -- it 's very important that there be that solid connection of trust between me and those who are in the field taking incredible risk .
And so Ed , I 'm going to wait to see what David has to say .
I 'm not going to prejudge what he may say .
I -- I trust David Petraeus , his judgment .
He 's an honest man .
He 's -- those of you who 've interviewed him know that he 's a straight shooter .
He is a ( n ) innovative thinker .
I was briefed by members of the codel that came back that said that it appeared to them that our troops have high respect for our commanders in -- in Baghdad , as do I .
Now , do you have a follow - up , perhaps another subject , another area , another -- Q Same subject PRESIDENT BUSH : Same questions ?
Q Different approach , different approach here .
PRESIDENT BUSH : Okay .
Q
How hard is it for you to conduct the war without popular support ?
And are you , personally -- do you ever have trouble balancing the -- between doing what you think is the right thing and following the will of the majority of the public , which is really the essence of democracy ?
PRESIDENT BUSH : Yeah , it is .
And I -- first of all , I can fully understand why people are tired of the war .
The question they have is , can we win it ?
And of course , I 'm concerned about whether or not the American people are in this fight .
I believe however that when they really think about the consequences of if we were to precipitously withdraw , they begin to say to themselves , maybe we ought to win this ; maybe we ought to have a stable Iraq .
Their question , it seems like to me , is , can we succeed ?
And that 's a very important , legitimate question for anybody to ask .
I think many people understand we must succeed and I think a lot of people understand we 've got to wait for the generals to make these military decisions .
I suspect -- I know this , Ed , that if our troops thought that I was taking a poll to decide how to conduct this war , they would be very concerned about the mission .
In other words , if our troops said , well , well , here we are in combat and we 've got a commander - in - chief who is , you know , running a focus group .
In other words , politics would be -- is more important to him than our safety and / or our strategy .
That would dispirit our troops .
And there 's a lot of constituencies in this fight .
Clearly the American people , who are paying for this , is the major constituency .
And I repeat to you , Ed , I understand that they 're -- this violence has affected them .
And a lot of people do n't think we can win .
There 's a lot of people in Congress who do n't think we can win as well .
And therefore their attitude is , get out .
My concern with their strategy , something that Mike Hayden also discussed , is that just getting out may sound simple and it may affect polls but it would have long - term , serious security consequences for the United States .
And so , Ed , sometimes you , you know , you just have to make the decisions based upon what you think is right .
My most important job is to help secure this country .
And therefore the decisions in Iraq are all aimed in helping do that job .
And that 's what I firmly believe .
The second constituency is the military .
And I repeat to you : I 'm pretty confident our military do not want their commander in chief making political decisions about their future .
A third constituency that matters to me a lot is military families .
These are good folks who are making huge sacrifices , and they support their loved ones .
And I do n't think they want their commander in chief making decisions based upon popularity .
Another constituency group that -- that is important for me to talk to is -- is the Iraqis .
Obviously I want the Iraqi government to understand that we expect there to be reconciliation top down , that we'd want to see laws passed .
I think they 've got that message .
They know full well that the American government and the American people expect to see tangible evidence of working together .
That 's what the benchmarks are aimed to do .
They also need to know that -- that I 'm making decisions based upon our security interests , of course , but also helping them succeed and that -- that a poll is not going to determine the course of action by the United States .
What will determine the course of action is , will the decisions that we have made help secure our country for the long run ?
And finally , another constituency is the enemy , who are wondering whether or not America has got the resolve and the determination to stay after them .
And so that 's -- that 's what I think about , Ed .
And you know , I -- I 'm -- I guess I 'm like any other , you know , political figure .
Everybody wants to be loved .
Just sometimes the decisions you make and the consequences do n't enable you to be loved .
And so when it 's all said and done , Ed , when you ever come down and visit the old -- old , tired me down there in Crawford , I will be able to I say I looked in the mirror and made decisions based upon principle , not based upon politics .
And that 's important to me .
Thank you all for your time .
I love being here at this new building .
Thank you .

Thank you for coming back .
PRESIDENT BUSH : I 'm happy to do it .
This is not the new me .
I mean , this is just like an aberration .
In other words -- Q
It 's over next time .
PRESIDENT BUSH : I 'm not going to leave and then come back if somebody yells something at me .
Q Like China .
PRESIDENT BUSH : Yeah , exactly !
( Laughs . )
Thank you .
Thank you , David .
I appreciate that .
Exactly .

There is a perception in the coverage that al Qaeda may be as strong today as they were prior to September the 11th .
That 's just simply not the case .
I think the report will say , you know , since 2001 , not prior to September the 11th , 2001 .
Secondly , that because of the actions we 've taken , al Qaeda is weaker today than they would have been .
They are still a threat .
They are still dangerous .
And that is why it is important that we succeed in Afghanistan and Iraq , and anywhere else we find them .
And that 's -- that 's -- our strategy is to stay on the offense against al Qaeda .
Elaine asked the question : Is it al Qaeda in Iraq ?
Yeah , it is al Qaeda , just like it 's al Qaeda in parts of Pakistan .
And I 'm working with President Musharraf to be able to -- he does n't want them in his country .
He does n't want foreign fighters in his -- the outposts of his country .
And so we 're working to make sure that we continue to keep the pressure on al Qaeda .
But no question , al Qaeda is -- is dangerous for the American people , and that 's why -- as well as other people that love freedom -- and that 's why we 're working hard with allies and friends to enhance our intelligence , that 's why we need terrorist surveillance programs , that 's why it 's important for us to keep -- you know , I would hope Congress would modernize that bill -- that 's why we 're keeping on the offense .
Ultimately , the way to defeat these radicals and extremists is to offer alternative ways of life so that they 're unable to recruit .
That they can use -- they like to use frustration and hopelessness .
They -- they -- the societies that do n't provide hope will become the societies where al Qaeda has got the capacity to convince a youngster to go blow himself up .
What we need to do is to help governments provide brighter futures for their people so they wo n't sign up .
And the fundamental question facing the world in this issue is whether or not it makes sense to try to promote an alternative ideology .
I happen to think it does .
They say , " He 's idealistic . "
Yeah , I 'm idealistic , but I 'm also realistic in understanding if there 's not an alternative ideology presented , these thugs will be able to continue to recruit .
They 'll use hopelessness to be able to recruit .
And so it 's -- thank you for asking that question .
Q Bin Laden -- PRESIDENT BUSH : Thank you all .
Q
Is bin Laden alive ?

Kirrily 's goal is to " take a snapshot of the Perl world as it currently stands . "
As an active member of the Perl community , she 's often asked questions about Perl 's users and is only left to " hypothesise , generalise , and hand - wave . "
Further , software communities can often be an echo chamber where people only hear from like - minded people .
The Perl Survey is an attempt to break out of that echo chamber and hear from all Perl users around the world , regardless of skill level , not just the core users most active in vocal communities .
An interesting part of the survey is asking the respondent 's salary , if they choose to release it .
" I hear a lot of talk about the going rate for Perl programmers , " Kirrily says , " and whether organizations that claim they can't hire Perl programmers simply are n't paying enough . "
Correlating results with the other data points could shed light on the topic .
The survey 's reach could also help users around the world .
" Salary information can be very hard to find out for anywhere other than the US , " says Kirrily , an Australian .
The survey will be open until September 30 , 2007 .
Then , in October , Kirrily will be announcing the results and releasing the raw data , minus email addresses , under a Creative Commons " CC - BY " license .
Her hope is that other interested people will provide their own analyses of the results .

Chop off a salamander ’s leg and a brand new one will sprout in no time .
But most animals have lost the ability to replace missing limbs .
Now , a research team at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies has been able to regenerate a wing in a chick embryo — a species not known to be able to regrow limbs — suggesting that the potential for such regeneration exists innately in all vertebrates , including humans .
Their study , published in the advance online edition of Genes and Development on Nov. 17 , demonstrates that vertebrate regeneration is under the control of the powerful
Wnt signaling system :
Activating it overcomes the mysterious barrier to regeneration in animals like chicks that can’t normally replace missing limbs while inactivating it in animals known to be able to regenerate their limbs ( frogs , zebrafish , and salamanders ) shuts down their ability to replace missing legs and tails .
“ In this simple experiment , we removed part of the chick embryo’s wing , activated Wnt signaling , and got the whole limb back – a beautiful and perfect wing , ” said the lead author , Juan Carlos Izpis ? a
Belmonte , Ph.D. , a professor in the Gene Expression Laboratory .
“ By changing the expression of a few genes , you can change the ability of a vertebrate to regenerate their limbs , rebuilding blood vessels , bone , muscles , and skin – everything that is needed . ”
This new discovery “ opens up an entirely new area of research , ” Belmonte says .
“ Even though certain animals have lost their ability to regenerate limbs during evolution , conserved genetic machinery may still be present , and can be put to work again , ” he said .
Previously , scientists believed that once stem cells turned into muscles , bone or any other type of cells , that was their fate for life ?
and if those cells were injured , they did n’t regenerate , but grew scar tissue .
Manipulating
Wnt signaling in humans is , of course , not possible at this point , Belmonte says , but hopes that these findings may eventually offer insights into current research examining the ability of stem cells to build new human body tissues and parts .
For example , he said
Wnt signaling may push mature cells go back in time and “ dedifferentiate ” into stem - like cells , in order to be able to then differentiate once more , producing all of the different tissues needed to build a limb .
“ This is the reverse of how we currently are thinking of using stem cells therapeutically , so understanding this process could be very illuminating , ” he says .
“ It could be that we could use the Wnt signaling pathway to dedifferentiate cells inside a body at the site of a limb injury , and have them carry out the job of building a new structure . ”
Members of the Wnt gene family ( for “ wingless , ” originally discovered in fruit flies ) are known to play a role in cell proliferative processes , like fetal growth and cancer development , and Belmonte ’s lab has characterized the crucial role of Wnt signaling in limb growth .
In 1995 , the Salk researchers were first to demonstrate that they could induce the growth of extra limbs in embryonic chicks , and in 2001 , they found that the Wnt signaling system played a critical role in triggering both normal and abnormal limb growth .
The current study was designed to see if Wnt signaling also was involved in the regeneration of limbs and included three groups of vertebrates : zebrafish and salamanders , which can regenerate limbs throughout their lives ; frogs , which can only regenerate new limbs during a limited period during their fetal development ; and chicks , which cannot regenerate limbs .
To manipulate animals ’ regeneration ability , the Salk researchers used inhibitory and excitatory factors for Wnt signaling , which they delivered directly to the remaining bulge after they cut a limb from the experimental embryos .
In adult zebrafish and salamanders , they found that blocking
Wnt signaling with the inhibitory factors , prevented normal regeneration .
And , conversely , when they treated mutant adult zebrafish that cannot regenerate with the excitatory agent , the ability to regenerate their fins was rescued , Belmonte says .
Using an inhibitory agent on frogs before the regeneration - enabled developmental window closed resulted in loss of that ability , but treating them with the excitatory agent after they had lost their regenerative capacity induced new limb growth .
They then performed the key experiment , successfully testing the ability of an excitatory factor to produce limb regeneration in chick embryos .
“ The signal restarted the process , and genes that were involved in the initial development of the limb were turned back on , ” Belmonte says .
“ It is simply amazing . ”
The procedure was tricky , however .
Belmonte noted that if
Wnt signaling is activated for too long of a period in these animals , cancer results .
“ This has to be done in a controlled way , with just a few cells for a specific amount of time , ” he says .
“ The fact is that this pathway is involved in cell proliferation , whether it is to generate or regenerate limbs , control stem cells , or produce cancer . ”

A real tear - jerker
A mother passing by her daughter 's bedroom was astonished to see the bed was nicely made and everything was picked up .
Then she saw an envelope propped up prominently on the center of the bed .
It was addressed , " Mom . "
With the worst premonition , she opened the envelope and read the letter with trembling hands :
Dear Mom :
WASHINGTON —
It ’s odd , this urge I have to mark the passing of Leona Helmsley .
The diva of a hotel empire whose abrasive arrogance was given a full public airing during her tabloid - terrific trial on tax - evasion charges in the late 1980s died earlier this week at 87 .
Her epitaph : the Queen of Mean .
Nostalgia for New York City is a common affliction among those of us who once made our homes there .
It drives an entire industry built upon the memory of the Brooklyn Dodgers , and infuses people with the determined outlook that somehow life on the Lower East Side was better when it was an immigrant ghetto than it is today as a gentrified enclave for suburban college students in search of a cool nightclub .
There is an awful lot to legitimately miss about New York without resorting to a gauzy glance back at the 1980s , a time when the very rich — always a source of curiosity and perverse civic pride — held cultural sway .
Wall Street rose up as a way of life instead of as a mere industry .
Real estate barons such as Helmsley and her husband , Harry , were titans .
Donald Trump was building his career as a developer , investor and political player — viewed as a savior of struggling municipal projects or as an instigator of self - enriching sweetheart deals , take your pick .
This was before Trump became a caricature of himself for TV .
Average New Yorkers gained little from all this money sloshing up and down the avenues .
The trickle - down economics of the Reagan era did n’t turn the aging subways around , fill the potholes or shore up the bridges .
Public investment of all kinds was starved in part because of deep federal budget cuts .
So when a former housekeeper testified at the queen ’s trial that Leona Helmsley once told her that “ only the little people pay taxes , ” something snapped .
It was as though the decade had been unmasked for what it was : an era of individual rapaciousness , backed in good part by government itself .
How could we know that two decades later that sound bite of selfishness — “ only the little people pay taxes ” — would become public policy ?
Recalling Helmsley has jogged another memory .
It is of Vice President Dick Cheney , speaking to then - Treasury Secretary Paul O’Neill after the 2002 midterm elections .
According to Ron Suskind ’s 2004 book , “ The Price of Loyalty , ” O’Neill wanted the White House to abandon its plan for a second round of big tax cuts .
The federal deficit already was rising , the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , necessitated enormous new expenditures for security , and the war in Afghanistan created another big demand for funds .
But , Cheney told O’Neill dismissively : “ We won the midterms .
This is our due . ”
So the second installment went forward , part of a tax - cut tab from the still - unfinished Bush era that amounts to a 10 - year , $ 2 - trillion drain on the public treasury .
By any measure , the cuts flow disproportionately not to the “ little people ” but to those who already are living large .
The Tax Policy Center , a nonpartisan think tank sponsored by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute , says the combined effect of the Bush tax cuts was to raise the after - tax incomes of those taxpayers with more than $ 1 million in annual income by 6 percent — more than twice the benefit for those with incomes between $ 20,000 and $ 75,000 .
Looked at another way , those with incomes of more than $ 1 million got an average tax cut of $ 118,477 .
That compares with $ 1,205 for a taxpayer whose income falls between $ 50,000 and $ 75,000 .
As the Bush presidency limps to a close , the country is frantic about Iraq and weighed down by concerns over terrorism .
The central theme among Democrats running for president is undoing President Bush ’s catastrophic foreign policy mistakes .
Republican candidates , by and large , solemnly swear to stay the course in Iraq .
There ’s been little discussion of how to repair the damage from a fiscal policy based on the premise that only the little people pay taxes .
Some Democrats have pledged to repeal the tax cuts for those with the highest incomes — say , people earning $ 200,000 or more a year .
No attention has been paid to the inevitable future program cuts to bring the federal budget into line .
These will almost certainly fall upon the public at large — whether they are drivers or hospital patients or students or retirees .
Such is the legacy of this particular decade of greed .
At least back in the 1980s , we were appalled by it .

Some ancient - DNA evidence has offered new clues to a very cold case : the disappearance of the last woolly mammoths , one of the most iconic of all Ice Age giants , according to a June 7th report published online in Current Biology , a publication of Cell Press .
DNA lifted from the bones , teeth , and tusks of the extinct mammoths revealed a " genetic signature " of a range expansion after the last interglacial period .
After the mammoths ' migration , the population apparently leveled off , and one of two lineages died out .
" In combination with the results on other species , a picture is emerging of extinction not as a sudden event at the end of the last ice age , but as a piecemeal process over tens of thousands of years involving progressive loss of genetic diversity , " said Dr. Ian Barnes , of Royal Holloway , University of London .
" For the mammoth , this seems much more likely to have been driven by environmental rather than human causes , even if humans might have been responsible for killing off the small , terminal populations that were left . "
Barnes , along with Dr. Adrian Lister of the University College London and the Natural History Museum in London and others , had earlier found evidence that bison , bears , and lions underwent major population shifts twenty - five to fifty thousand years ago .
Those results came as a surprise , the researchers said , because scientists tended to think that the major environmental changes happened about fifteen to twenty - five thousand years ago , when the glaciers reached their fullest extent .
The findings also offered early human hunters a potential alibi ; they did n't come on the scene in large numbers until even later .
In search of a general pattern in the new study , Barnes and Lister 's team looked to the extinct woolly mammoth .
What they found , however , was an " interesting pattern , not like those of the other species . "
Their genetic data indicate that Siberian mammoths expanded from a small base some time before sixty thousand years ago .
Moreover , they found two distinct genetic groups , implying that mammoths had diverged in isolation for some time before merging back into a single population .
The DNA further suggests that no later than forty thousand years ago , one of the groups died out , leaving only the second alive at the time of the mammoth 's last gasp .
" At a time when we should be very concerned about the potential extinction of many existing large mammals , studying those that occurred in the geologically recent past can provide many insights , " Lister said .
" Our work , together with that of others , shows that the conditions for extinction can be set up long before the actual extinction event . "

j Query for JavaScript programmers
When jQuery came out back in January 2006 , my first impression was that it was a cute hack .
Basing everything around CSS selectors was a neat idea ( see getElements BySelector ) but the chaining stuff looked like a bit of a gimmick and the library as a whole did n’t look like it would cover all of the bases .
I wrote jQuery off as a passing fad .
Over the past few months it ’s become clear to me exactly how wrong I was .
jQuery is an exceptionally clever piece of engineering .
It neatly encapsulates an extraordinary range of common functionality , and provides a clever plugin API for any functionality not included by default .
It takes a core abstraction — that of a selection of DOM elements — and extracts as much mileage out of it as possible .
Most importantly , it does so in a way that obeys best practices and plays well with other JavaScript code .
Most introductions to jQuery focus on designers and inexperienced developers .
I ’m going to try to explain why jQuery should be of interest to experienced programmers as well .
Namespacing
The key to writing good , reusable JavaScript is to zealously manage your namespace .
JavaScript provides a single global namespace ( the window object ) , and many programmers ( and some libraries ) add symbols to this with abandon .
Global variables are evil !
Smart developers minimise their number of global objects , using techniques like the module pattern .
j Query introduces just one symbol to the global namespace : the jQuery function / object .
Everything else is either a directy property of jQuery or a method of the object returned by calls to the jQuery function .
What about language enhancements ?
Most libraries provide some variation of map , filter and strip , functions that are sadly missing from the JavaScript engines that ship with most browsers .
Some libraries directly extend JavaScript ’s built - in String and Array classes , but this can be a risky strategy .
String . prototype and Array .
prototype are themselves global namespaces , and adding properties to them brings the same risk of collisions as being careless with regular globals .
j Query provides a number of language enhancement functions , but each one is made available as a property of the jQuery object : jQuery.each , jQuery.extend , jQuery.grep , jQuery.map , jQuery.merge and jQuery.trim .
There ’s no chance of these colliding with someone else ’s code .
The infamous $ function
I was n’t being entirely truthful when I said that jQuery was the only global symbol introduced : the $ symbol is also set up as a shortcut for jQuery .
Thankfully , this is done in a non-destructive way : if you need your old $ function back ( if you are already using code based on Prototype , for example ) you can call jQuery.noConflict ( ) to revert to the old $ function .
$
$
( function ( $ ) { //
Within this block , $ is a reference to jQuery // Neat , huh ? } ) ( jQuery ) ;
If you want the convenience of thefunction for jQuery without colliding with some other use of the globalfunction , the jQuery documentation suggests the following idiom :
Attaching everything to the $ symbol was one of the things that made me initially dismiss jQuery as a gimmick .
For some reason thinking of it in terms of the jQuery symbol makes everything seem a lot more sensible , even though I ’m happy to use the $ shortcut in my own code .
Selecting some elements
Every jQuery operation starts with selecting one or more nodes from the DOM .
jQuery ’s selection syntax ( really a domain specific language ) is an interesting hybrid of CSS 1 , 2 , bits of CSS 3 , some XPath and a few custom extensions as well .
I wo n’t describe it in detail here , but here are some useful examples :
j Query ( ' div.panel ')
All divs with class= “ panel ” j Query ( ' p #intro ' )
The paragraph with id =“ intro ” j Query ( ' div#content a: visible ' )
All visible links inside the div with id =“ content ” j Query ( ' input[@name=email ] ' )
All input fields with name = “ email ” j Query ( ' table.orders tr:odd ' ) “ odd ” numbered rows in a table with class “ orders ” j Query ( ' a [ @href^ = " http :// " ] ')
All external links ( links that start with http ://) j Query ( ' p [ a ] ' )
All paragraphs that contain one or more links
Of particular interest from the above are : visible and : odd , which are jQuery specific extensions .
Also note that the attribute selectors use an @ sign , in common with XPath rather than CSS 2 .
The selection language is extremely rich , and is similar to regular expressions in that time taken to learn it will pay off many times over .
Doing stuff with them
The object returned by a jQuery selector call is an interesting beast .
It represents a collection of DOM elements , and behaves a bit like an array — it has a length property , items can be accessed by index and ( most importantly )
Firebug treats it as an array when displaying it in the interactive console .
This is a clever illusion ; the collection is actually a jQuery object , incorporating a large number of methods which can be used to query , modify and extend the collection of selected elements .
There are three principle categories of jQuery methods : those that manipulate all of the matched elements , those that return a value from the first matched object , and those that modify the selection itself .
I wo n’t list all of the methods ( see visualjquery.com for that ) , but I ’ll illustrate with some examples .
If you have Firebug you can try these out interactively : use this Insert jQuery bookmarklet first to load the jQuery library in to any page , then paste the code examples in to the Firebug console .
j Query ( ' div#primary ' ) . width( 300 ) ;
Set the width of div id =“ primary ” to 300 px. j Query ('p ' ) .css ( ' line - height ' , ' 1.8em ' ) ;
Apply a line - height of 1.8 em to all paragraphs .
j Query ( ' li:odd ').css ( {color : ' white ' , backgroundColor : ' black'} ) ;
Apply two CSS rules to every other list item ; note that the css ( ) function can take an object instead of two strings .
j Query ( ' a [ @href^ = " http :// " ]') . addClass ( ' external ' ) . attr ( ' target ' , ' _blank ' ) ;
Add a class of “ external ” to all external links ( those beginning with http : // ) , then add target = “ _blank ” for good measure .
This makes use of chaining , described below .
j Query ( ' blockquote ').each ( function ( el ) { alert ( jQuery ( this ) .
text ( ) ) } ) ;
Iterate over every blockquote on the page , and alert its textual content ( excluding HTML tags ) .
j Query ( 'a ' ) .html ( ' Click here !' ) ;
Replace all link text on the page with the insidious “ Click here ! ” .
Here are some examples of methods that read values from the first matched element :
var width = j Query ( ' div ' ) .
width ( ) ;
How wide is the first div on the page ?
var src = j Query ( 'img ' ) . attr ( ' src ' ) ;
What ’s the src attribute of the first image on the page ?
var color = j Query ( 'h1 ' ).css ( ' color ' ) ;
What colour is the first h1 ?
There ’s a pleasing symmetry at work here : the methods used to set attributes ( when passed two arguments , or an object representing multiple settings ) can instead be used to read values if called with only one argument .
This symmetry is used throughout jQuery , making the API much easier to commit to memory .
Finally , there are methods that modify the set of selected elements itself .
Many of these also provide simpler ways of traversing the DOM :
j Query ( ' div ' ) .not ( '[ @id ] ' )
Returns divs that do not have an id attribute .
j Query ( ' h2 ' ) .
parent ()
Returns all elements that are direct parents of an h2. j Query ( ' blockquote ' ) .children ( )
Returns all elements that are children of a blockquote .
j Query ( 'p ' ) .eq ( 4) .next ( )
Find the fifth paragraph on the page , then find the next element ( its direct sibling to the right ) .
j Query ( ' input: text : first ' ) .parents ( ' form ' )
Find the form parent of the first input type =“ text ” field on the page .
The optional argument to parents ( ) is another selector .
Chaining
The jQuery team frequently boast about jQuery ’s support of chaining , even to the point of declaring that “ jQuery is designed to change the way that you write JavaScript ” right on the front page .
Personally I found this a big turn - off , so I ’m happy to say that you can make good use of jQuery while avoiding lengthy chains of methods entirely .
That said , chaining can be used for some neat tricks .
In addition to chaining a bunch of DOM manipulation methods together , you can use jQuery ’s end ( ) method to push and pop a stack of the selected element contexts .
This is a little hard to explain ; essentially , every time you use a method that changes the selected set of elements ( such as children ( ) or filter ( ) ) you can later use end ( ) to revert back to the previous selection .
Jesse Skinner gives a neat example of this in action in his tutorial Simplify Ajax development with jQuery :
$ ( ' form#login ' ) // hide all the labels inside the form with the ' optional ' class .find ('label.optional ') .hide ( ) .end ( ) // add a red border to any password fields in the form . find ( ' input : password ' ) .css ( ' border ' , ' 1px solid red ' ) .end ( ) // add a submit handler to the form . submit( function ( ) { return confirm ( ' Are you sure you want to submit ? ' ) ; } ) ;
That whole thing is essentially a one - liner .
It selects a form , finds some elements within that form , applies changes to them , reverts the selection back to the original form and assigns a submit ( ) handler to it .
It ’s a cute concept , but you do n’t have to use it if you do n’t want to .
I ’m quite happy splitting my code up with a few self - documenting variable names .
DOM manipulation
j Query offers a few smart ways of making large scale manipulations to the DOM .
The first is quite surprising : the jQuery function can take a snippet of HTML which it will turn in to a DOM element ( it actually looks out for a string that starts with a less than sign ) :
var div = j Query ( '< div > Some text </div > ' ) ;
You can use chaining to add attributes to the div once it has been created :
var div = j Query ( '< div > Some text</div >') .addClass (' inserted ' ) . attr ( 'id ' , ' foo ' ) ;
Now append it to the body tag :
div.appendTo(document.body )
Or prepend it to a known location using a selector :
div.prependTo(' div#primary ')
Handling events
All JavaScript libraries need an event handling utility and jQuery ’s is no exception .
As with attr ( ) and css ( ) , the event methods serve dual purpose : call them with a function to assign an event handler ; call them without to simulate that event being triggered :
j Query ( 'p').click ( function ( ) { j Query ( this ).css (' background - color ' , ' red ' ) ; } ) ;
Set up paragraphs so that when you click them they turn red .
j Query ( 'p : first ') .click ( )
Send a fake “ click ” to the first paragraph on the page .
Similar functions exist for the other browser events — mouseover , keyup and so on .
Note that within an event handler the ’ this ’ keyword is set to the element that triggered the event ; using jQuery ( this ) is a common idiom to enable jQuery methods on that element .
A couple of event related functions deserve a special mention :
j Query ( 'a' ) .hover ( function ( ) { j Query ( this ).css (' background - color ' , ' orange ' ) ; } , function ( ) { j Query ( this ).css (' background - color ' , ' white ' ) ; } ) ;
hover ( ) is a shortcut for setting up two functions that run onmouseover and onmouseout .
j Query ( 'p ' ) .one ( ' click ' , function ( ) { alert ( jQuery ( this ) .html ( ) ) ; } ) ;
one ( ) sets up an event handler that will be removed after the first time it has been fired .
The above example causes all paragraphs to alert their contents once the first time they are clicked .
j Query also supports custom events , through the bind ( ) and trigger ( ) methods ( for which click ( ) and friends are just shortcuts ) .
Custom events can take arguments , handled using an array passed to trigger ( ) :
j Query ( document ) .bind ( ' stuffHappened ' , function ( event , msg ) { alert ( ' stuff happened : ' + msg ) ; } ) ; jQuery ( document ) .
trigger ('stuffHappened ' , [ ' Hello ! ' ] ) ;
Unobtrusive scripting
This is a topic that is very dear to me .
I still believe that the best Web applications are the ones that are still usable with scripting turned off , and that the best way to achieve that is through unobtrusive scripting , with events being assigned to elements after the regular page has been loaded ( see Unobtrusive Scripting and Hijax for more ) .
j Query has excellent support for this .
Firstly , the node selection metaphor is core to both jQuery and unobtrusive scripting as a whole .
Secondly , jQuery ships with a solution to the window.onload problem based on Dean Edwards ’ work getting a “ DOM loaded ” event to work cross - browser .
You can set a function up to run when the DOM is ready for it like so :
j Query ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { alert ( ' The DOM is ready ! ' ) ; } ) ;
Even better , you can shortcut the above by passing your function directly to jQuery ( ) :
j Query ( function ( ) { alert ( ' The DOM is ready ! ' ) ; } ) ;
jQuery and Ajax
j Query has the best API for Ajax I ’ve seen in any of the major libraries .
The most simple form of an Ajax call looks like this :
j Query ( ' div#intro').load ('/some/fragment.html ' ) ;
This performs a GET request against / some / fragment.html and populates div#intro with the returned HTML fragment .
The first time I saw this , I was unimpressed .
It ’s a neat shortcut , but what if you want to do something more advanced like display an Ajax loading indicator ?
j Query exposes custom events ( ajaxStart , ajaxComplete , ajaxError and more ) for you to hook in this kind of code .
It also offers a comprehensive low - level API for more complex Ajax interactions :
jQuery.get ('/some/script.php ' , {' name ' : ' Simon'} , function ( data ) { alert ( ' The server said : ' + data ) ; } ) ; // GET against / some / script.php?name=Simon jQuery.post('/some/script.php ' , {' name ' : ' Simon'} , function ( data ) { alert ( ' The server said : ' + data ) ; } ) ; // POST to / some / script.php jQuery.getJSON ('/ some.json ' , function ( json ) { alert ( 'JSON rocks : ' + json.foo + ' ' + json.bar ) ; } ) ; // Retrieves and parses / some.json as JSON jQuery.getScript('/ script.js ' ) ; // GET and eval ( ) / script.js
Plugins
Considering the amount of functionality you get out of the box , jQuery is actually pretty small — it comes in at 20 KB when minified , even smaller when gzipped .
Additional functionality outside the framework is handled using plugins , which can ( and do ) add brand new methods to the existing jQuery instance object .
If you want to be able to run :
jQuery ('p').bounceAroundTheScreenAndTurnGreen ( ) ;
j Query ’s plugin mechanism provides documented hooks for adding that method to the jQuery system .
The ease with which these can be created has attracted an impressive community of plugin authors ; the Plugin directory lists well over 100 .
One really nice touch is that you can add custom selectors in a similar way to custom methods .
The moreSelectors plugin adds things like “ div:color ( red ) ” to match divs with red text , for example .
Leaky abstractions
In my new - found respect for jQuery , I ’ve been struggling with one philosophical blocker .
For the past few years , I ’ve been advising people to only pick a JavaScript library if they were willing to read the source code and figure out exactly how it works .
My reasoning was based on Joel Spolsky ’s classic essay The Law of Leaky Abstractions , which points out that the more complexity your APIs are hiding , the more trouble you ’ll be in when some of that complexity leaks through .
Browsers are the leakiest abstraction of them all , so being able to dig yourself out of a hole when the library fails to cover for you is of paramount importance .
j Query uses some really arcane tricks to achieve its functionality — parts of it ( like the selector code ) are positively terrifying .
If understanding exactly how the library works is necessary , jQuery must be a poor choice for the majority of developers .
However , the enormous popularity of jQuery combined with a distinct lack of horror stories demonstrates that this is not the case .
I think I ’m going to have to reconsider my advice .
The way the library works is n’t the issue : it ’s understanding the underlying issues , and knowing what kind of browser differences there are and what kind of techniques your library is using to fix them .
No library can protect you 100 % against weird browser behaviour , but as long as you have a grounding in the underlying theory you should be able to figure out if a problem stems from your own code , your library or the underlying implementation .
To conclude
I hope I ’ve made the case that jQuery is n’t just another library — there are enough interesting ideas in there to teach even the most hardened of JavaScript programmers some new tricks .
Even if you do n’t intend on using it , it ’s still worth spending some time exploring the jQuery ecosystem .
Ah , the memories .
Bill Gates , known for so many years to be ( by far ) the wealthiest person in the world , now has to settle for second place , because a Mexican tycoon came in first ( and not by a small margin ; Carlos Slim Helú beats him by over $ 8 billion ) .
Is this a sign that IT is yesterday 's news ?
Actually , no : Carlos himself is a telecommunications magnate , and while the top 10 list is n't dominated by tech people , the top 100 still has its fair share of geeks .
With the web growing at a miraculous pace , we 're hoping to see the Google founders eventually joined by more web - based entrepreneurs , although the desktop paradigm will likely remain strong for years to come .
Let 's take a look at the current list of top 10 wealthiest people in IT .
Carlos Slim Helú
Net worth : $ 67.8 billion Company : Telmex , América Móvil , Grupo Carso
What ?
Telecommunications are IT .
The fact that Carlos Slim may not be as known worldwide as some other people on this list does n't mean he does n't pack 67.8 billion dollars .
Add Rupert Murdoch 's wealth to that of Bill Gates and they still barely overtake Carlos , and that says a lot .
If you wonder how he got here so fast , it 's due to his company América Móvil 's stock jumping a whopping 27 % in the second quarter of 2007 .
2. William H. Gates III
Net Worth : $ 59.2 billion Company : Microsoft
Now you 're sorry you gave all that money to charity , eh Bill ?
Being number two kinda sucks , but do n't worry , Microsoft 's long term online strategy will ... oh , wait .
In any case , Bill Gates has been numero uno for so long we were kinda used to him in this spot .
Frankly , we expected him to be overtaken by those two kids from Google , but the telecoms magnate instead reigned supreme .
Bill is actually focused on giving away his fortune to good causes from now on , and has said previously that he does n't care much for being the richest man in the world .
3. Lawrence Ellison
Net Worth : $ 21.5 billion Company : Oracle
Oracle ?
Bo-ring .
Ellison has been able to lurk near the top 10 overall for quite some time now , and although he 's slowly slipping the ranks ( at one point in time in 2000 , he was the richest man in the world ) , he 's still doing really , really well .
Well , what can you do : databases are always in fashion .
4. Paul Allen
Net Worth : $ 18.0 billion Company : Microsoft
There was a time when Paul and Bill were both in the overall top 10 list of billionaires , but this was a long , long time ago .
Now , Paul is at the 19th place overall and only fourth in IT , with the Google guys breathing down his neck .
His ties with Microsoft are n't so strong , and he sold some 68 million shares of the company , which left him with a meager sum of 138 million shares .
He likes to invest in anything and anyone : real estate , sports , even space programs .
He 's also known for owning the Octopus , the world 's fifth biggest yacht , as well as a couple of smaller ones .
5 & 6 . Sergey Brin & Larry Page
Net Worth : $ 16.6 billion ( each ) Company : Google
We 've put these two rascals together because their huge wallets are the exact same size .
Combine their wealth , and they jump to number 3 ; I hope you guys realize why it 's bad to have a co-founder ?
If you must have one , at least stab them in the back and get rid of 'em before you get wealthy , so you do n't have to share .
But , we digress .
The fact that these sheer billions originate from an algorithm and an almost blank white web page with a colorful logo and a single form is still astonishing .
7. Michael Dell
Net Worth : $ 15.8 billion Company : Dell
When you count all the problems that Dell ( the company ) had , it 's a wonder that it still manages to be the number one hardware company in the world ( or , if you ask HP , the number two company ) .
Michael is currently struggling to retain this position as he took control of the company once again , replacing Kevin Rollins at the beginning of this year , and the situation is not too cheery at the moment , so you can expect Michael to drop a position on this list real soon .
8. Steven Ballmer
Net Worth : $ 15.0 billion Company : Microsoft
Developers developers developers !
Laugh all you like ( heck , take a look at that dancing video on YouTube again if you must ) , but he 's got 15 billion dollars , and you have to choose between the iPhone and food for a month .
Oh yeah , although he has money to burn , Steve has an office smaller than my bathroom .
Go figure .
9. Naguib Sawiris
Net Worth : $ 10.0 billion Company : Orascom Telecom Holding
Naguib Sawiris is the chairman and CEO of Egypt 's Orascom Telecom , a multinational GSM mobile phone operating in the emerging markets of Middle East , Africa , and South Asia .
As a good indicator of just how fast these markets grow , just look at Naguib 's last year position on Forbes ' list : 278 .
10 . Sunil Mittal
Net Worth : $ 9.5 billion Company : Bharti Telecom
More proof that if you want to be a multi-billionaire , the telecoms industry is where it 's at .
Sunil Mittal is the chairman and managing director of Bharti group , which runs India 's largest GSM mobile phone service .
Although Sunil has nearly $ 9.5 billion dollars , he 's only the 6th richest Indian in the world .
Talk about fierce competition .
Snooze to destiny : Daily Show salutes Bush presidential vacation record David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday August 17 , 2007
Print This Email This The Daily Show turned its attention Wednesday to presidential vacations , commenting briefly on French President Nicolas Sarkosy 's visit to President Bush in Kennebunkport before asking " Senior Western White House Correspondent " Samantha Bee about Bush 's return to Crawford , TX .
" This place is abuzz with expectation , " said Bee excitedly .
" It 's no longer a question of if the president will break the record , but when . "
" Most vacation days taken by a sitting president , " Bee explained when Jon Stewart asked what record she meant .
" People said that Reagan 's 436 would stand forever , but right now , as you can see , this president stands on 423 , meaning his record should fall less than two weeks from today .
And they said it should n't be done . "
Bee continued playing up the great obstacles faced by Bush in his pursuit of the record and his dedication in overcoming them .
" Reagan has a ranch in beautiful Santa Barbara , " she said .
" Bush has spent his time chasing the record in Crawford , Texas , which by all objective accounts is a genuine scorched shithole .
...
And do n't forget , Bush is a war president .
The 80's ?
If Bush had been president then , he might not have come in at all . "
The following video is from Comedy Central 's The Daily Show , broadcast on August 15 .
Leo Frank
Leo Max Frank ( April 17 , 1884 – August 17 , 1915 ) was a Jewish - American factory superintendent whose murder conviction and extrajudicial hanging in 1915 by a lynch mob planned and led by prominent citizens in Marietta , Georgia , drew attention to antisemitism in the United States .
[ 2 ]
He was posthumously pardoned in 1986 .
An engineer and superintendent of the National Pencil Company in Atlanta , Frank was convicted on August 25 , 1913 , for the murder of one of his factory workers , 13 - year - old Mary Phagan .
She had been strangled on April 26 and was found dead in the factory cellar the next day .
Frank was the last person known to have seen her alive , and there were allegations that he had flirted with her before .
His trial became the focus of powerful class , regional , and political interests .
Raised in New York , he was cast as a representative of Yankee capitalism , a rich northern Jew lording it over vulnerable working women , as the historian Albert Lindemann put it .
Former U.S. Representative Thomas E. Watson used the sensational coverage of the case in his own publications to push for a revival of the Ku Klux Klan , calling Frank a member of the Jewish aristocracy who had pursued " Our Little Girl " to a hideous death .
Frank and his lawyers resorted to stereotypes too , accusing another suspect — Jim Conley , a black factory worker who testified against Frank — of being especially disposed to lying and murdering because of his race . [ 3 ]
There was jubilation in the streets when Frank was convicted and sentenced to death .
By June 1915 his appeals had failed , but Governor John M. Slaton believed there had been a miscarriage of justice , so he commuted the sentence to life imprisonment — to great local outrage .
A crowd of 1,200 marched on Slaton 's home in protest , and two months later Frank was kidnapped from prison by a lynch mob of 25 armed men who called themselves " Knights of Mary Phagan " .
Frank was driven 150 miles to Frey 's Gin , near Phagan 's home in Marietta , and murdered .
A crowd gathered after the hanging ; one man repeatedly stomped on Frank 's face , while others took photographs , pieces of his nightshirt , and bits of the rope to sell as souvenirs . [ 4 ]
On March 11 , 1986 , the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles granted Frank a pardon , citing the state 's failure to protect him or prosecute his killers , though they stopped short of exonerating him .
The names of Frank 's murderers were well - known locally but were not made public until January 7 , 2000 , when Stephen Goldfarb , an Atlanta librarian and former history professor , published the Phagan - Kean list [ 5 ] on his website .
The Washington Post noted that the list includes several prominent citizens — a former governor , the son of a senator , a Methodist minister , a state legislator , and a former state Superior Court judge — their names matching those on Marietta 's street signs , office buildings , shopping centers , and law offices today . [ 6 ]
Background
Leo Frank
Frank was born in Cuero , Texas , to Rudolph ( November 5 , 1844 – January 22 , 1922 ) and Rachel Jacobs Frank ( April 16 , 1859 – January 1 , 1925 ) , but the family moved to Brooklyn , New York , in July 1884 , when he was three months old .
Two years later a sister , Marian J. , was born in Brooklyn on October 18 , 1886 .
Frank was educated in the New York City public school system and went to high school at the Pratt Institute from 1898 to 1902 , after which Frank matriculated at Cornell University and studied mechanical engineering .
Frank was an active student who joined the Henry Morse debating team his freshman year and participated for 4 years , [ 7 ] took up landscape photography [ 8 ] and chess as a hobby , and played tennis [ 9 ] and basketball for his college team .
After graduating in June 1906 , he gained employment with the B.T. Sturtevant Company in Hyde Park , Massachusetts , as a draftsman for 6 months .
Returning to New York , Frank accepted a position as a testing engineer for the National Meter Company until the middle of October 1907 .
At the invitation of his uncle Moses Frank , Leo travelled to Atlanta for 2 weeks .
Moses Frank , a Southerner , suggested that Frank come to work for the National Pencil Company , a manufacturing plant he had just invested in .
Leo Frank agreed , and after returning to New York , he travelled to Germany to study pencil manufacturing at Eberhard Faber in Bavaria .
After a 9 - month apprenticeship , Frank returned to the United States on August 1 , 1908 , for a short stay with his family in Brooklyn .
On August 4 , 1908 , Frank departed for Atlanta , arriving on August 6 , [ 10 ] and began working at the National Pencil Company on 37 to 41 South Forsythe Street on August 10 , 1908 . [ 11 ]
Frank was introduced to Lucille Selig ( February 29 , 1888 – April 23 , 1957 ) shortly after he arrived in Atlanta .
She came from a prominent and upper middle class Jewish family of industrialists who two generations earlier had founded the first synagogue in Atlanta . [ 12 ]
Though she was very different from Frank , and laughed at the idea of speaking Yiddish , they were married on November 30 , 1910 , at the Selig residence on 68 East Georgia Ave in Atlanta . [ 13 ]
Frank was elected president of the Atlanta chapter of the B'nai B'rith , a Jewish fraternal organisation , in 1912 . [ 14 ]
The Jewish community in Atlanta was the largest in the South , and the Franks moved in a cultured and philanthropic milieu whose leisure pursuits included opera and bridge . [ 15 ]
But although Frank was happy , he was not popular .
He was a Yankee and an industrialist .
Alphin writes that although the Old South was not known for its antisemitism , his being a Jew was enough to add to the sense that he was different . [ 16 ]
Mary Phagan
Mary Phagan
Mary Phagan ( June 1 , 1899 – April 26 , 1913 ) was born in Florence , Alabama , four months after her father William Joshua Phagan died of measles .
She was born into a family of tenant farmers that had farmed in Alabama and Georgia for generations .
After her father died , Phagan 's mother moved her family to East Point , where she opened a boarding house .
The children took jobs in the local mills .
Phagan left school at the age of ten to work part - time in a textile mill .
In 1911 , a paper manufacturing plant owned by Sigmund Montag , treasurer of the National Pencil Company , hired her .
In 1912 her mother Frances Phagan married John William Coleman , and she and the children moved into the city .
Phagan took a job with the National Pencil Company in the spring of 1912 , where she ran a knurling machine that inserted rubber erasers into pencils ' metal bands . [ 17 ]
Alphin writes that wages were low for everyone — ten to fifteen cents an hour , one - third of the average wage in the North , and most of the production - line workers were teenagers , an issue that fueled resentment against the factory owners .
Mary Phagan earned $ 4.05 per week or 7 and 4/11 cents an hour , for 55 hours . [ 18 ]
Leo Frank earned $ 180.00 per month , plus a portion of the profits . [ 19 ]
At the time , industrialists were regularly attacked in print by The Atlanta Georgian . [ 20 ]
Murder
Discovery of the body
One of the two murder notes found near the body
Phagan worked in the metal room on the second floor of the factory in a section called the tipping department , down the hall from Frank 's office .
Phagan had been laid off on Monday , April 21 , due to a shortage of brass sheet metal .
About noon on Saturday , April 26 , she went to the factory to claim her pay of $ 1.20 .
At about 3:17 a.m. on Sunday , April 27 , the factory 's night watchman , Newt Lee , went to the factory basement to use the Negro toilet . [ 21 ]
Lee said he discovered the body of a dead girl , and called the police , meeting them at the front door and leading them to the body .
Mary Phagan 's body was found dumped in the rear of the basement near an incinerator .
Her dress was hiked up around her waist and a strip from her petticoat was torn off and wrapped around her neck .
Her face was blackened and scratched .
Her head was bruised and battered .
A 7 feet ( 2.1 m ) strip of .75 inches ( 19 mm ) wrapping cord tied into a loop was around her neck buried .125 inches ( 3.2 mm ) deep .
Initially there was an appearance of rape .
Based on the ashes and dirt from the floor that were stuck to her skin , it appeared that she and her assailant had struggled in the basement . [ 22 ]
A service ramp at the rear of the basement led to a sliding door that opened into the alley ; the police found that it had been tampered with so that it could be opened without unlocking it .
Later examination found bloody fingerprints on the door as well as a metal pipe that had been used as a crowbar . [ 23 ]
Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators .
The boards from the door with the bloody prints were removed and subsequently lost before any analysis could be done .
Bloody fingerprints were found on the victim 's jacket , but there is no indication that they were ever analyzed . [ 24 ]
A trail in the dirt along which police believed Phagan had been dragged was trampled and no footprints were ever identified . [ 25 ]
Two notes were found in a pile of rubbish by Phagan 's head , and became known as the " murder notes " .
One said : " he said he wood love me land down play like the night witch did it but that long tall black negro did boy his slef . "
The other said , " mam that negro hire down here did this i went to make water and he push me down that hole a long tall negro black that hoo it wase long sleam tall negro i write while play with me . "
The effect of the discovery was to cast suspicion on Newt Lee .
During the trial " night witch " was interpreted to mean " night watch [ man ] " ; when he read the note , night watchman Newt Lee said , " Boss , that 's me . " [ 26 ]
An undisturbed fresh mound of human excrement was found at the bottom of the elevator shaft , though the significance was not recognized until after the trial [ 25 ] during the Leo M. Frank clemency hearings of 1915 .
Police investigation
An Atlanta Georgian headline on April 29 , 1913 , showing that the police suspected Frank and Newt Lee .
On Sunday , April 27 , Frank said that Lee 's time card was complete .
It was supposed to be punched every half hour during the watchman 's rounds .
On Monday , April 28 , Frank said Lee had not punched the card at three or four intervals .
The police investigated a variety of suspects , and arrested both Lee and a young friend of Phagan 's for the crime .
Gradually they became convinced that they were not the culprits .
A detective sneaked into Lee 's apartment and found a blood - smeared shirt at the bottom of a burn barrel .
The blood was smeared high up on the armpits and the shirt smelled unused .
The prosecution later claimed that the shirt had been planted by Frank in order to incriminate Lee .
The Atlanta Constitution broke the story of the murder and was soon in a frenzied competition with the Georgian for readers .
The latter was a formerly sedate local paper bought by the William Randolph Hearst syndicate in 1912 [ 27 ] and revamped using his standard formula of yellow journalism .
As many as 40 extra editions came out the day Phagan 's murder was reported .
The Georgian published a doctored morgue photo of Phagan , in which her head was shown spliced onto the body of another girl .
Some evidence went missing when it was ' borrowed ' from the police by reporters .
The two papers offered a total of $ 1,800 in reward money for information leading to the apprehension of the murderer . [ 28 ]
Suspicion falls on Frank
Newt Lee claimed he tried to call Leo Frank for 8 minutes after the discovery of Phagan .
The police later noted that Frank had not answered the phone when they called his house at 4 A.M. , and that he seemed nervous when they took him to the undertaker at P.J. Bloomfield 's Mortuary and to the factory before dawn .
They considered his detailed answers on minor points as suspect and noted his trembling .
Frank pointed out at the trial that the police had refused to tell him the nature of their investigation .
Phagan 's friend , 13 - year - old pencil factory worker George Epps , came forward to say that Frank had flirted with Phagan and had frightened her . [ 29 ]
The police appeared to intimidate and influence witnesses , such as the Seligs ' cook Minola McKnight , and Nina Formby , the madam of a bordello .
They both recanted statements made to the police , Formby indicating the police had " plied her with whisky . " [ 30 ]
Frank hired two Pinkerton detectives to help him prove his innocence .
Though Frank produced alibis for the entire time during which the crime could have been committed , suspicion was aroused by his waiting a week to bring forward one crucial witness , Lemmie Quinn .
Gradually , however , the Georgian began to take Frank 's side , responding to pressure from Atlanta 's Jewish community .
Meanwhile , the Constitution continued to criticize the police for their lack of progress . [ 31 ]
Jim Conley
Jim Conley , the factory 's janitor , is believed by many historians to be the real murderer . [ 32 ]
On May 1 , the police arrested Conley after he was caught by the plant 's day watchman , E.F .
Holloway , washing a dirty blue work shirt .
Conley tried to hide the shirt , then said the stains were rust from the overhead pipe on which he had hung it .
Detectives examined it for blood , found none and returned it .
Conley was still in police custody two weeks later when he gave his first formal statement .
He said that , on the day of the murder , he had been visiting saloons , shooting dice , and drinking at home .
He offered some details , such as 40 cents spent on a bottle of rye , 90 cents won at dice , and 15 cents for beer , twice . [ 33 ]
His story was called into question when a witness told detectives that " a black negro . . . dressed in dark blue clothing and hat " had been seen in the lobby of the factory on the day of the murder .
Further investigation also determined that Conley could read and write , something he had initially denied . [ 34 ]
After initially sticking to his claim that he could not write , he was threatened with perjury charges , and eventually told police , " White folks , I 'm a liar . "
He was asked to write portions of the murder notes , and although the police found similarities in the spelling , he continued to deny having written them .
The interview ended and Conley was placed in a basement isolation cell .
A week later , on May 24 , he called for a detective and admitted he had written the notes .
In a sworn statement he said Frank had called him to his office the day before the murder ; he claimed Frank said he had some wealthy people in Brooklyn , and asked : " Why should I hang ? " [ 35 ]
[ 36 ] [ H ]e asked me could I write and I told him yes I could write a little bit , and he gave me a scratch pad and ... told me to put on there " dear mother , a long , tall , black negro did this by himself , " and he told me to write it two or three times on there .
I wrote it on a white scratch pad , single ruled .
He went to his desk and pulled out another scratch pad , a brownish looking scratch pad , and looked at my writing and wrote on that himself .
After testing Conley again on his spelling — he spelled " night watchman " as " night witch " — the police were convinced he had written the notes .
They were skeptical about the rest of his story , not only because it implied premeditation by Frank , but because it suggested that Frank had confessed to Conley and involved him .
For the next three days , two detectives played good cop / bad cop with Conley , one accusing him of the murder , the other offering him food and consolation . [ 37 ]
On May 28 the Georgian said that E.F.
Holloway , the plant day watchman , believed Conley had strangled Phagan when he was drunk . [ 37 ]
In a new affidavit ( his second affidavit and third statement ) , Conley admitted that he had lied about his Friday meeting with Frank .
He said that he had met Frank on the street on Saturday , and was told to follow him to the factory .
Frank told him to hide in a wardrobe to avoid being seen by two women who were visiting Frank in his office .
He said Frank dictated the murder notes for him to write , gave him cigarettes , and told him to leave the factory .
Afterward , Conley said he went out drinking and saw a movie .
He said he did not learn of the murder until he went to work on Monday .
[ 38 ] William Smith represented Conley , but in October 1914 said he believed his client to be guilty .
The police were satisfied with the new story , and both The Atlanta Journal and the Georgian gave the story front - page coverage .
Three officials of the pencil company were not convinced and said so to the Journal .
They contended that Conley had followed another employee into the building intending to rob her , but instead found that Phagan was a more ready target . [ 39 ]
The police placed little credence in the employees ' theory , but had no explanation for the failure to locate the purse , and were concerned that Conley had made no mention that he was aware that a crime had been committed when he wrote the notes .
To resolve their doubts , the police attempted on May 28 to arrange a confrontation between Frank and Conley .
Frank exercised his right not to meet without his attorney , who was out of town .
The police announced that this refusal was an indication of Frank 's guilt , and the meeting never took place [ 40 ]
On May 29 Conley was interviewed for four hours . [ 41 ]
His new affidavit said that Frank told him that " he had picked up a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something . "
Conley said that he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator , then returned to Frank 's office where the murder notes were dictated .
Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two had returned to the office .
He said Frank gave him two hundred dollars , but took it back , saying , “ Let me have that and I will make it all right with you Monday if I live and nothing happens . "
Conley 's affidavit concluded , " The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter . " [ 42 ]
At trial , Conley changed his story concerning the $ 200 .
He said the money was withheld until Conley had burned Phagan 's body in the basement furnace . [ 43 ]
The Georgian hired William Manning Smith to represent Conley .
Smith was known for specializing in representing black clients , and had successfully defended a black man against an accusation of rape by a white woman .
He had also taken an elderly black woman 's civil case as far as the Georgia Supreme Court .
Although Smith believed Conley had told the truth in his final affidavit , he became concerned that Conley was giving long jailhouse interviews with crowds of reporters .
Smith was also concerned about reporters from the Hearst papers , who had taken Frank 's side .
He arranged for Conley to be moved to a different jail , and severed his own relationship with the Georgian . [ 44 ]
Hearings , sentencing , and clemency
Trial
The first day of the trial .
Spectators were racially segregated .
The stenographer can be seen next to Newt Lee , who is being questioned by prosecutor Hugh Dorsey .
On May 24 , 1913 , a murder indictment was returned against Frank by a grand jury .
The grand jury included five Jews and historian Albert Lindemann suggests , " they were persuaded by the concrete evidence that [ prosecutor ] Dorsey presented . " [ 19 ]
Lindemann notes that none of Conley 's testimony was presented to the grand jury and that at criminal trial , Dorsey " explicitly denounced racial anti-Semitism " and " indulged in ... philo - Semitic rhetoric . " [ 19 ]
The trial began on July 28 .
The windows were left open because of the heat .
In addition to the hundreds of spectators inside , a large crowd gathered outside to watch the trial through the windows .
Afterward the defense cited the crowds as factors in intimidation of the witnesses and jury in their legal appeals . [ 45 ]
Leo Frank trial
The State 's prosecution team was made up of the Solicitor General Hugh M. Dorsey , Assistant Solicitor General Frank Arthur Hooper and E. A. Stevens .
Frank was represented by eight lawyers ( some of them jury selection specialists ) , led by Luther Z. Rosser .
The defense used peremptory challenges to eliminate the only two black jurors .
The prosecution 's theory was that Conley 's last affidavit was true , Frank was the murderer , and the murder notes had been dictated by Frank in an effort to pin the crime on Lee .
The defense 's theory was that Conley was the murderer , and that Lee helped Conley write the notes .[ citation needed ]
The defense brought numerous witnesses who attested to Frank 's alibi , which did not leave him enough time to have committed the crime . [ 46 ]
Prosecutor Hugh Dorsey , later governor of Georgia
Lead defense lawyer Luther Rosser .
Conley reiterated his testimony from his final affidavit .
He added to it by describing Frank as regularly having sex with women in his upstairs office on Saturdays while Conley kept a lookout on the first floor lobby .
Another witness C. Brutus Dalton who , like Conley , had a criminal record , corroborated Conley .
Although Conley admitted that he had changed his story and lied repeatedly , this did not damage the prosecution 's case as much as might have been expected , as he admitted to being an accessory .
Many white observers did not believe that a black man could have been intelligent enough to make up such a complicated story .
The Georgian wrote , " Many people are arguing to themselves that the negro , no matter how hard he tried or how generously he was coached , still never could have framed up a story like the one he told unless there was some foundation in fact . " [ citation needed ]
Defense witnesses testified that there were too many people in the factory on Saturdays for Frank to have had trysts there .
They pointed out that the windows of Frank 's second floor office lacked curtains .
Though numerous girls testified to Frank having a bad character for lasciviousness , a larger number of female factory workers testified for the defense of Frank 's good character when it came to women .[ citation needed ]
Frank spoke on his own behalf August 18 , 1913 , making an unsworn statement as allowed by Georgia Code , Section 1036 ; it did not permit any cross-examination without his consent , and none occurred . [ 47 ]
Most of his four - hour speech consisted of a detailed analysis of the accounting work he had done the day of the murder .[ citation needed ]
He ended with a description of how he viewed the crime , along with an explanation of his nervousness : " Gentlemen , I was nervous .
I was completely unstrung .
Imagine yourself called from sound slumber in the early hours of the morning ...
To see that little girl on the dawn of womanhood so cruelly murdered — it was a scene that would have melted stone . " [ 48 ]
In its closing statements , the defense attempted to divert suspicion from Frank to Conley .
Lead defense attorney Luther Rosser , said to the jury : " Who is Conley ?
He is a dirty , filthy , black , drunken , lying , nigger . "
Frank had issued a widely publicized statement questioning how the " perjured vaporizings of a black brute " could be accepted in testimony against him . [ 49 ]
The prosecutor compared Frank to Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .
He said that Frank had killed Phagan to keep her from talking .
With the sensational coverage , public sentiment in Atlanta turned strongly against Frank .
The defense requested a mistrial because it felt the jurors had been intimidated , but the motion was denied .[ citation needed ]
In case of an acquittal , the judge feared for the safety of Frank and his lawyers , so he brokered a deal in which they would not be present when the verdict was read .
On August 25 , Frank was convicted of murder , as crowds outside the courtroom chanted " Kill the Jew ! "
The Constitution described the scene as Dorsey emerged from the steps of city hall : " The solicitor reached no farther than the sidewalk .
While mounted men rode like Cossacks through the human swarm , three muscular men slung Mr. Dorsey on their shoulders and passed him over the heads of the crowd across the street . " [ 50 ]
Appeals
Jeffersonian : " If Frank 's rich connections keep on lying about this case , SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN . " [ 51 ] Local politician Tom Watson continued his campaign against Frank , warning in the : " If Frank 's rich connections keep on lying about this case , SOMETHING BAD WILL HAPPEN . "
Frank 's appeals to the Georgia Supreme Court failed in November .
The U.S. Supreme Court denied a writ of habeas corpus sought by Frank 's lawyers .
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote , " I very seriously doubt if the petitioner ... has had due process of law ... because of the trial taking place in the presence of a hostile demonstration and seemingly dangerous crowd , thought by the presiding Judge to be ready for violence unless a verdict of guilty was rendered . "
In October 1914 , William Smith , Jim Conley 's own lawyer , announced that he believed Conley had murdered Phagan , but neither the state nor the police pursued this . [ 52 ]
A writ of error was issued allowing Frank to appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court , which heard the appeal in April 1915 .
On April 19 , in the case of Frank v. Mangum , the appeal was denied on a 7 - 2 vote .
Holmes and Justice Charles Evans Hughes dissented , with Holmes writing , " It is our duty ... to declare lynch law as little valid when practiced by a regularly drawn jury as when administered by one elected by a mob intent on death . " [ 53 ]
Commutation of sentence
On May 31 , 1915 , Frank pleaded to the Georgia State Prison Commission that his sentence be commuted to life imprisonment .
On June 9 the Commission submitted a divided report , 2 against and 1 in support , to the departing Governor of Georgia , John M. Slaton .
The incoming governor , Nathaniel Harris , was a close ally of Tom Watson who was against Frank , whereas Slaton had a law partnership with Luther Rosser who was Frank 's defense attorney during the trial . [ 54 ]
Slaton reviewed more than 10,000 pages of documents , visited the pencil factory , and examined new evidence , including studies comparing Conley 's speech patterns to the language of the murder notes . [ 55 ]
He told reporters : " some of the most powerful evidence in Frank 's behalf was not presented to the jury which found him guilty . " [ 56 ]
During the hearing former Governor Brown warned Slaton , " In all frankness , if Your Excellency wishes to invoke lynch law in Georgia and destroy trial by jury , the way to do it is by retrying this case and reversing all the courts . " [ 57 ]
Indignation in the press about the commutation of Frank 's sentence .
On June 21 — five days before Slaton 's term as governor ended and one day before Frank was scheduled to hang , [ 58 ] Slaton commuted Frank 's sentence to life in prison .
" I can endure misconstruction , abuse and condemnation , " Slaton said , " but I can not stand the constant companionship of an accusing conscience which would remind me that I , as governor of Georgia , failed to do what I thought to be right ....
Feeling as I do about this case I would be a murderer if I allowed this man to hang .
It may mean that I must live in obscurity the rest of my days , but I would rather be plowing in a field for the rest of my life than to feel that I had that blood on my hands . " [ 59 ]
The Atlanta area public was outraged .
A mob threatened to attack the governor at his home .
A detachment of the Georgia National Guard , along with county policemen and a group of Slaton 's friends who were sworn in as deputies , dispersed the mob . [ 60 ]
Slaton had been a popular governor , but he and his wife left Georgia immediately thereafter . [ 56 ]
Frank was taken to the Milledgeville State Penitentiary , a minimum security work farm , which officials thought would be more secure .
About a month after he was transferred there , on July 17 a fellow inmate William Creen tried to kill him , slashing his throat with a 7 - inch ( 18 cm ) butcher knife and severing his jugular vein , according to The New York Times .
The attacker told the authorities he wanted to keep the other inmates safe from mob violence , that Frank 's presence was a disgrace to the prison , and that he was sure he would be pardoned if he killed Frank . [ 61 ]
Lynching
Knights of Mary Phagan
Joseph Mackey Brown ( 1851 –1932 ) , one of the ringleaders .
He had served two terms as the Governor of Georgia , 1909 – 1911 and 1912 –1913 .
The June 21 , 1915 , commutation drove Tom Watson to new heights of ferocity . [ 62 ]
He wrote in the pages of The Jeffersonian and Watson 's Magazine : " This country has nothing to fear from its rural communities .
Lynch law is a good sign ; it shows that a sense of justice lives among the people . " [ 63 ]
A group of prominent men organized themselves into the " Knights of Mary Phagan , " openly planning to kidnap Frank from prison .
They recruited men with the necessary skills for a total of 28 , including themselves ; an electrician was to cut the prison wires , car mechanics were to keep the cars running , and there was a locksmith , a telephone man , a medic , a hangman , and a lay preacher . [ 64 ]
The ringleaders were well - known locally , but were not named publicly until June 2000 , when a local librarian posted a list on the Web , based on information compiled by Mary Phagan 's great - niece Mary Phagan Kean ( b. 1953 ) . [ 65 ]
The list included :
Joseph Mackey Brown , former governor of Georgia
Emmet Burton , police officer
Eugene Herbert Clay , former mayor of Marietta , son of Senator Alexander S. Clay
E. P. Dobbs , mayor of Marietta at the time
William J. Frey , former Cobb County sheriff
George Hicks , Cobb County deputy sheriff
William McKinney , Cobb County deputy sheriff
Newton Augustus Morris , twice a superior court judge of the Blue Ridge Circuit [ 66 ]
Newton Mayes Morris , in charge of the Cobb County chain gang
Fred Morris , general assemblyman who later organized Marietta 's first Boy Scout troop
George Swanson , Cobb County sheriff
John Augustus Benson , merchant
D.R. Benton , Mary Phagan 's uncle
" Yellow Jacket " Brown , electrician
Bolan Glover Brumby , manufacturer , owner of the Marietta Chair Company
Jim Brumby , garage owner who serviced the cars
Luther Burton , coal yard operator
George Exie Daniell , merchant
Cicero Holton Dobbs , taxi driver
John Tucker Dorsey , who later served as the Circuit 's district attorney
C. D. Elder , physician
Gordon Baxter Gann , lawyer , later mayor of Marietta and a state legislator Robert A . Hill , banker who helped fund the group
Horace Hamby , farmer
Lawrence Haney , farmer
Ralph Molden Manning , contractor
L. B. Robeson , railroad freight agent who provided a car
Moultrie McKinney Sessions , lawyer and banker , part of the Marietta delegation at Governor Slaton 's clemency hearing [ 6 ]
Hanging

The man on the far left can be seen holding a camera .
On the afternoon of August 16 , the eight cars of the lynch mob left Marietta separately for Milledgeville .
They arrived at the prison at around 10:00 PM and the electrician cut the telephone wires , members of the group emptied the gas from the prison 's automobiles , handcuffed the warden , seized Frank and drove away .
The 175 miles ( 282 km ) trip took about seven hours at a top speed of 18 miles per hour ( 29 km / h ) through small towns on back roads .
Lookouts in the towns telephoned ahead to the next town as soon as they saw the line of open cars pass by .
A site at Frey 's Gin , two miles ( 3 km ) east of Marietta , had been prepared , complete with a rope and table supplied by former Sheriff William Frey . [ 69 ]
The New York Times reported that Frank was wearing a nightshirt and undershirt , and the lynchers had tied a piece of brown canvas around his waist like a skirt .
He was handcuffed , and his legs were tied at the ankles .
They placed a new .75 inches ( 19 mm ) manila rope over his head , tied in a hangman 's knot so it would force his head backwards and break his neck , and threw it over a branch of a tree .
He was turned to face the direction of the house Phagan had lived in , and was hanged at around 7 am . [ 70 ]
The Atlanta Journal wrote that the wound on his throat , caused when it was slashed in jail by another inmate , had reopened .
A crowd of men , women , and children arrived on foot , in cars , and on horses , and souvenir hunters cut away parts of his shirt sleeves to take away . [ 71 ]
According to The New York Times , one of the onlookers , Robert E. Lee Howell — related to Clark Howell , editor of The Atlanta Constitution — wanted to have the body cut into pieces and burned , and began to run around , screaming , whipping up the mob .
Judge Newt Morris tried to restore order , and asked for a vote on whether the body should be returned to the parents intact ; only Howell disagreed .
When the body was cut down , Howell started stamping on Frank 's face and chest ; Morris quickly placed the body in a basket , and he and his driver John Stephens Wood drove it out of Marietta . [ 70 ]
In Atlanta thousands besieged the undertaker 's parlor , demanding to see the body ; after they began throwing bricks , they were allowed to file past the corpse . [ 70 ]
Frank was buried in the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Glendale , Queens , New York on August 20 , 1915 .
The New York Times wrote that the vast majority of Cobb County believed he had received his just desserts , and that the lynch party had simply stepped in to uphold the law after Governor Slaton arbitrarily set it aside . [ 70 ]
A Cobb County grand jury was convened to indict the lynchers , but although they were well - known locally , none were identified . [ 72 ]
Several photographs were taken of the lynching , which were published and sold as postcards in local stores for 25 cents each , a common practice after lynchings , along with pieces of the rope , Frank 's nightshirt , and branches from the tree .
According to Elaine Marie Alphin , they were selling so fast the police announced that sellers required a city license . [ 73 ]
Members of the lynch party or crowd can be seen in the postcards posing in front of the body , one of them holding a portable camera .
Historian Amy Louise
Wood writes that the local newspapers did not publish the photographs : it would have been too controversial , given that the lynch party can be seen clearly and that the lynching was being condemned around the country .
The Columbia State , which opposed lynching , wrote : " The heroic Marietta lynchers are too modest to give their photographs to the newspapers . "
Wood also writes that a news film of the lynching was released , which included the photographs , though it focused on the crowds without showing Frank 's body ; its broadcast was prevented by censorship boards around the U.S. , though according to Wood there is no evidence that it was stopped in Atlanta . [ 74 ]
Aftermath
Immediate aftermath
After Frank 's lynching , approximately half of Georgia 's 3,000 Jews left the state . [ 75 ]
According to Frank scholar Steve Oney , “ What it did to Southern Jews ca n’t be discounted ....
It drove them into a state of denial about their Judaism .
They became even more assimilated , anti-Israel , Episcopalian .
The Temple did away with chupahs at weddings — anything that would draw attention . ” [ 76 ]
Many American Jews saw Frank as an American Alfred Dreyfus.[ citation needed ]
In part because Frank was the president of the B'nai B'rith chapter in Atlanta , Georgia .
Adolph Kraus , president of B'nai B'rith , invited 15 prominent members in Chicago to form the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith in September 1913 , one month after Frank 's conviction . [ 77 ]
Two weeks after the lynching , in the September 2 , 1915 , issue of The Jeffersonian , Watson wrote that " the voice of the people is the voice of God . " [ 78 ]
He had capitalized on his sensational coverage of a controversial trial ; in 1914 , when Watson began reporting his anti-Frank message , The Jeffersonian 's circulation had been 25,000 ; by September 2 , 1915 , its circulation was 87,000 . [ 79 ]
On November 25 , 1915 , months after Frank was taken from the Milledgeville prison , members of the Knights of Mary Phagan burned a gigantic cross on top of Stone Mountain , reportedly inaugurating a revival of the Ku Klux Klan .
The group was led by William J. Simmons and attended by 15 charter members and a few aging survivors of the original Klan .
Frank 's widow , Lucille , did not remarry .
She worked at the glove counter of the J.P. Allen store , and died April 23 , 1957 , of heart disease .
In her 1954 will she had requested to be cremated .
Before her death Lucille requested to family members that her ashes be spread in a local Atlanta park , but a local ordinance forbade it . [ 10 ]
Atlanta magazine reported in 2003 that her ashes were stored for seven years in a local funeral home , until her family buried them secretly in a shoebox between the headstones of her parents in Atlanta 's Oakland Cemetery , apparently worried that a funeral would stir up antisemitic action from the local Ku Klux Klan . [ 80 ]
( 1982 –1986 ) Alonzo Mann 's affidavit , pardon
In 1982 , nearly 70 years after the murder , Alonzo Mann , who had been Frank 's office boy , told authorities that he had seen Jim Conley alone at the factory carrying Phagan 's body . [ 81 ]
This contradicted Conley 's testimony that Frank had paid him to move the girl 's body .
Mann swore in an affidavit that Conley had threatened to kill him if he reported what he had seen .
When the boy told his family , his parents made him swear not to tell anyone else .
Mann finally decided to make a statement in what he called an effort to die in peace .
He passed a lie detector test , and died three years later at the age of 85 . [ 82 ]
Mann 's deposition was the basis of an attempt to obtain a posthumous pardon for Frank from the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles .
The effort was led by Charles Wittenstein , southern counsel for the Anti-Defamation League , and Dale Schwartz , an Atlanta lawyer , though Mann 's testimony was not sufficient to settle the issue .
The board also reviewed the files from Slaton 's commutation decision . [ 83 ]
It denied the pardon in 1983 , hindered in its investigation by the lack of available records .
Conley had died in 1962 .
The state 's files on the case were lost [ 84 ] and with them the opportunity to apply modern forensic techniques . [ 85 ]
It concluded that , " After exhaustive review and many hours of deliberation , it is impossible to decide conclusively the guilt or innocence of Leo M. Frank .
For the board to grant a pardon , the innocence of the subject must be shown conclusively . " [ 86 ]
At the time , the lead editorial in the Atlanta Constitution began , ' Leo Frank has been lynched a second time ' . [ 87 ]
Frank supporters submitted a second application for pardon in 1986 , asking the state only to recognize its culpability over his death .
The board granted the pardon on March 11 , 1986 . [ 88 ]
It said :
Without attempting to address the question of guilt or innocence , and in recognition of the State 's failure to protect the person of Leo M. Frank and thereby preserve his opportunity for continued legal appeal of his conviction , and in recognition of the State 's failure to bring his killers to justice , and as an effort to heal old wounds , the State Board of Pardons and Paroles , in compliance with its Constitutional and statutory authority , hereby grants to Leo M. Frank a Pardon . [ 89 ]
Memorials and historical markers
In 1995 on the 80th anniversary of the lynching , Rabbi Steven Lebow of Temple Kol Emeth placed a plaque on a building near the site of the hanging ; it read " Wrongly accused .
Falsely convicted .
Wantonly murdered . " [ 6 ]
On March 7 , 2008 , a State historical marker was erected by the Georgia Historical Society , the Jewish American Society for Historic Preservation , and Temple Kol Emeth , near the building at 1200 Roswell Road , Marietta .
The memorial reads :
Near this location on August 17 , 1915 , Leo M. Frank , the Jewish superintendent of the National Pencil Company in Atlanta , was lynched for the murder of thirteen - year - old Mary Phagan , a factory employee .
A highly controversial trial fueled by societal tensions and anti-Semitism resulted in a guilty verdict in 1913 .
After Governor John M. Slaton commuted his sentence from death to life in prison , Frank was kidnapped from the state prison in Milledgeville and taken to Phagan 's hometown of Marietta where he was hanged before a local crowd .
Without addressing guilt or innocence , and in recognition of the state 's failure to either protect Frank or bring his killers to justice , he was granted a posthumous pardon in 1986 . [ 90 ]
On October 20 , 2003 , the 90th anniversary of Anti-Defamation League 's founding , a monument dedicated by ADL was placed near the inside entrance of the Mount Carmel Cemetery in Queens , NY .
LEO FRANK : THE TRIAL OF LEO FRANK IN 1913 WAS MOTIVATED BY THE RAMPANT ANTI - SEMITISM OF THE TIME .
THE FOUNDING OF THE ANTI - DEFAMATION LEAGUE THAT SAME YEAR WAS MOTIVATED BY A PASSION TO ERADICATE SUCH INJUSTICE AND BIGOTRY .
DESPITE HIS INNOCENCE , FRANK WAS ABDUCTED FROM JAIL IN 1915 AND LYNCHED .
ADL REMEMBERS THE VICTIM LEO FRANK AND REDEDICATES ITSELF TO ENSURING THERE WILL BE NO MORE VICTIMS OF INJUSTICE AND INTOLERANCE .

Update : Webcast of the presentation here , though it 's badly edited .
( E.g. , one has to wait 15 minutes to hear Mr Raymond begin speaking ) .
Executive summary here ( very slow download right now ) and the 422 page full report ( BIG .pdf warning ) here .
The National Petroleum Council is due to report today on a study requested by US Energy Secretary Bodman .
Here are some of my concerns about it .
Firstly , let 's look at what Secretary Bodman asked the NPC to do .
I obtained a copy of his letter here , and it looks like this :
The National Petroleum Council ( NPC ) , a federally chartered and privately funded advisory committee , was established by the Secretary of the Interior in 1946 at the request of President Harry S. Truman .
In 1977 , the U.S. Department of Energy was established and the NPC ’s functions were transferred to the new Department .
The purpose of the NPC is solely to represent the views of the oil and natural gas industries in advising , informing , and making recommendations to the Secretary of Energy with respect to any matter relating to oil and natural gas , or to the oil and gas industries submitted to it or approved by the Secretary .
A pretty sensible straightforward sort of letter , and I 'm glad my elected officials are asking these kinds of question .
However , the folks they asked it of have this mission
Ok , so we 're asking the oil and gas industry , who make their living by selling us oil and gas , whether there might any problem with the supply of oil and gas .
I do n't know what Secretary Bodman was expecting , but in his place I would have expected to get a sales pitch for buying more oil and gas .
Given that very low expectation , the report is better than one might have feared .
However , it 's still pretty biassed , and fails to address the Secretary 's questions .
An aside to Secretary Bodman : next time try the National Academies .
Anyway , continuing , the NPC put together a crack team of industry executives and consultants to answer the question of whether they could continue to deliver us enough oil and gas or not .
( I should note here that my comments are based on a June 29th draft of the Executive Summary .
I was one of the hundreds of persons consulted by the NPC , though not one of the ones who they paid much attention too , it seems .
I 'm assuming the final version will be on their website by the time you read this ) .
Here 's the folks who ran the study :
There will be a large , unprecedented buildup of oil supply in the next few years .
Between 2004 and 2010 , capacity to produce oil ( not actual production ) could grow by 16 million barrels a day -- from 85 million barrels per day to 101 million barrels a day -- a 20 percent increase .
Such growth over the next few years would relieve the current pressure on supply and demand ...
While questions can be raised about specific countries , this forecast is not speculative .
It is based on what is already unfolding .
The oil industry is governed by a " law of long lead times . "
Much of the new capacity that will become available between now and 2010 is under development .
Many of the projects that embody this new capacity were approved in the 2001 - 03 period , based on price expectations much lower than current prices ....
But at least for the next several years , the growing production capacity will take the air out of the fear of imminent shortage .
And that in turn will provide us the breathing space to address the investment needs and the full panoply of technologies and approaches -- from development to conservation -- that will be required to fuel a growing world economy , ensure energy security and meet the needs of what is becoming the global middle class .
It is not very long since Mr Raymond was heading up an ExxonMobil that was taking out large editorial page ads in the New York Times arguing that peak oil would not occur for decades to come .
And nor is it long since Mr Yergin was telling us that Well , the " not speculative " forecast , made in July 2005 , is not looking too good so far :
Average daily oil production , by month , from EIA and IEA , together with 13 month centered moving averages of each line , recursed once .
Click to enlarge .
Believed to be all liquids .
Graph is not zero - scaled .
Source : IEA Oil Market Reports , and EIA International Petroleum Monthly Table 1.4 .
The IEA line is taken from Table 3 of the tables section at the back of the OMR in the last issue for which the number for that month is given ; last two points in purple are at earlier stages of revision than the rest of the graph .
Of the 16 mbd of new capacity over five years , after two years we have seen somewhere between zero ( EIA ) , or 1 mbd ( IEA ) of new production .
Not a good start , and it certainly has n't been enough to " take the air out of the fear of imminent shortage " as Mr Yergin promised us .
So you get the idea : the NPC put together a team who have a track record of being relentlessly overoptimistic , and the absolute trailing edge of concern about oil supply issues .
What did they have to say ?
During the last quarter - century , world energy demand has increased about 60 percent , supported by a global infrastructure that has expanded to a massive scale .
Now , most forecasts for the next quarter - century project a similar percentage increase in energy demand from a much larger base .
Oil and natural gas have played a significant role in supporting economic activity in the past , and will likely continue to do so in combination with other energy types .
Over the coming decades , the world will need better energy efficiency and all economic , environmentally responsible energy sources available to support and sustain future growth .
Fortunately , the world is not running out of energy resources .
But many complex challenges could keep these diverse energy resources from becoming the sufficient , reliable , and economic energy supplies upon which people depend .
These challenges are compounded by emerging uncertainties : geopolitical influences on energy development , trade , and security ; and increasing constraints on carbon dioxide emissions that could impose changes in future energy use .
While risks have always typified the energy business , they are now accumulating and converging in new ways .
The National Petroleum Council ( NPC ) examined a broad range of global energy supply , demand , and technology projections through 2030 .
The Council identified risks and challenges to a reliable and secure energy future , and developed strategies and recommendations aimed at balancing future economic , security , and environmental goals .
The United States and the world face hard truths about the global energy future over the next 25 years : Coal , oil , and natural gas will remain indispensable to meeting total projected energy demand growth .
The world is not running out of energy resources , but there are accumulating risks to continuing expansion of oil and natural gas production from the conventional sources relied upon historically .
These risks create significant challenges to meeting projected energy demand .
To mitigate these risks , expansion of all economic energy sources will be required , including coal , nuclear , renewables , and unconventional oil and natural gas .
Each of these sources faces significant challenges – including safety , environmental , political , or economic hurdles – and imposes infrastructure requirements for development and delivery .
" Energy Independence " should not be confused with strengthening energy security .
The concept of energy independence is not realistic in the foreseeable future , whereas U.S. energy security can be enhanced by moderating demand , expanding and diversifying domestic energy supplies , and strengthening global energy trade and investment .
There can be no U.S. energy security without global energy security .
A majority of the U.S. energy sector workforce , including skilled scientists and engineers , is eligible to retire within the next decade .
The workforce must be replenished and trained .
Policies aimed at curbing carbon dioxide emissions will alter the energy mix , increase energy - related costs , and require reductions in demand growth .
So , we could summarize this as " Peak oil is nowhere in sight ; we think we can continue to grow oil supply in coming decades as we have in recent decades , but it 's getting trickier and you a ) better be prepared to grant all our various requests for assistance in pulling it off , and b ) should start trying to use less of our products in case we can't quite manage it " .
So this is undoubtedly some kind of progress .
The fact that the trailing edge of the debate is now officially calling for efficiency and conservation measures is a big deal and good progress .
But I still think these guys are a long way from making contact with reality .
CEO's are supposed to set impossible goals and then exhort the troops to meet them , and that 's what we have here , I think , from this group of oil company CEO's .
My bias is to look at the graphs and tables rather than the words .
There are n't too many in this report , but the ones they do have are very revealing .
Middle East Reserves
A major concern with the NPC report is its failure to take seriously the potential concerns with Middle Eastern oil reserves .
As figure ES - 6 of the Executive Summary makes clear , almost all the growth in oil export capacity that the report assumes by 2030 is anticipated to come from the Middle East :
National Petroleum Council scenario for net regional oil imports and exports in 2005 and 2030 .
Source : Figure ES - 6 of NPC executive summary .
Note that Asia , North America , and Europe all grow their imports significantly , while Latin America , Africa , and Russia increase exports only slightly .
The Middle East is required to increase exports massively to balance the books .
This is no doubt predicated on the claims that two - thirds of the world ’s oil reserves are in that region ( eg see the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2007 ) .
However , it needs to be realized that there are serious long - standing concerns about whether these reserves exist in the amounts claimed .
For example , in the 2005 World Energy Outlook , the International Energy Agency writes on pages 125 - 128 :
There are doubts about the reliability of official MENA reserves estimates , which have not been audited by independent auditors …
MENA proven oil reserves increased sharply in the 1980s and , after a period during which they hardly increased , rose further around the turn of the century .
From around 400 billion barrels at the start of the 1980s , reserves ballooned to almost 700 billion barrels by 1989 and reached nearly 800 billion barrels at the end of 2004 ...
Most of these increases occurred in the Middle East .
In the second half of the 1980s , Saudi Arabia and Kuwait revised their reserves upwards by about one - half .
The United Arab Emirates and Iraq also recorded large upward revisions at that time .
Total Middle East reserves jumped from 398 billion barrels in 1985 to 663 billion barrels in 1990 .
As a result , world oil reserves increased by more than 40 % .
This dramatic and sudden revision in MENA reserves has been much debated .
It reflected partly the shift in ownership of reserves away from international oil companies , some of which were obliged to report reserves under strict US Securities and Exchange Commission rules .
The revision was also prompted by discussions among OPEC countries over setting production quotas based , at least partly , on reserves .
What is clear is that the revisions in official data had little to do with the actual discovery of new reserves .
Total reserves in many MENA countries hardly changed in the 1990s .
Official reserves in Kuwait , for example , were unchanged at 96.5 billion barrels ( including its share of the Neutral Zone ) from 1991 to 2002 , even though the country produced more than 8 billion barrels and did not make any important new discoveries during that period .
The case of Saudi Arabia is even more striking , with proven reserves estimated at between 258 and 262 billion barrels in the past 15 years , a variation of less than 2 % .
The reserves data for the five main Middle Eastern oil producing countries are shown in this next graph :
History of proved reserves claims for key Middle Eastern nations .
Source : BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2007 .
This clearly shows the very strange pattern of reserve updates , which is quite unlike reserve histories in western countries that wander up and down year - by - year as oil is consumed and new discoveries are made and additional recovery projects are implemented .
Recently , data is starting to come to light that suggests that not all these reserves additions were appropriate .
For example , in 2006 , Petroleum Intelligence Weekly obtained a 2001 document from the Kuwait Oil Company which suggested that remaining proven plus probable oil reserves there were only about half of the official number for proven reserves .
This has now been somewhat confirmed by the Kuwaiti Oil Minister , with the Kuwait Times reporting earlier this year : “ Sheikh Ali also confirmed to Al - Wasat newspaper that the state 's proven oil reserves have fallen to 48 billion barrels , as reported last year by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly , down from an announced 100 billion barrels . ”
In the case of Saudi Arabia , concern that future production would be limited has existed since at least 1979 , when a Senate Subcommittee Staff report on the subject stated , after extensive interviews with the American oil company executives managing the country ’s fields at that time :
Saudi Arabia ’s decision to cut back its producing target to 12 mmbd was significantly influenced by the conclusion that higher production rates would require costly investments and might not be maintained for a period of time acceptable to Saudi Arabia .
The oil production level that can be maintained until it begins to decline to lower levels is known as the “ production plateau . ”
The plateau that the Arabian American Oil Company ( Aramco ) now uses as a basis for its planning indicates that a rate of 12 mmbd may last 15 - 20 years before irreversibly declining , a period Saudi Arabia now finds uncomfortably short .
Higher rates , such as 16 mmbd , could only be maintained for a shorter period of time before declining .
Moreover , the prospect of future discoveries in Saudi Arabia is highly uncertain .
In addition , technical problems have complicated the management of the oil fields since the early 1970’s .
Taking into account all these factors , it would be imprudent for the United States to plan on a change in Saudi Arabian oil development plans to increase long - term production above 12 mmbd .
The current plan of a target capacity of 12 mmbd achieved no earlier than 1987 is a considerable change from an earlier one which envisioned a capacity of 16 mmbd in 1983 .
In fact , due to a combination of lower production ( via the demand collapse of the 1980s ) , and technology that allows oil operators to both increase recovery and maintain plateau until a field is more deeply depleted , Saudi Arabia has still been able to produce over 9 mbpd in recent years , more than 25 years after the words above were written .
However , is it at all prudent to assume that now , at this late stage , production can be increased significantly more than was thought feasible in 1979 , and continue for decades more ?
That is what the NPC report would have you believe .
More recently , Matt Simmons , in his book Twilight in the Desert has documented in great detail that extensive exploration efforts have only found modest amounts of new oil discoveries , just as Aramco executives predicted in the late 1970s .
Thus Saudi production still comes from the same handful of giant fields it was coming from in 1979 , most of which are now quite mature .
In particular , recent research here at The Oil Drum has shown that the northern half of Ghawar , which historically accounted for 4mbd of Saudi production , is significantly more depleted than Saudi Aramco has revealed , and production from this part of the field cannot be maintained much longer at recent levels .
This raises the question of whether the development of other fields that Saudi Arabia is now undertaking will be sufficient to increase overall capacity , or only offset declines in north Ghawar .
This may be in part why Saudi Arabia has not been able to increase production since 2004 , which has had a great deal to do with the fact that global oil production has not increased appreciably in the last two years .
It seems to me that this issue is of central importance to global oil reserves and production capacity .
Given the fact that most of the relevant data are closely held state secrets of the countries in question , I can see that reasonable people might hold a different view than me about the amount of oil remaining in the Middle East , and the potential for production increases .
However , the fact that the issue is not even flagged to the reader of the executive summary of the NPC report suggests the degree of bias that pervades that document .
Reliance on Undiscovered Oil
Not only is much of the growth in oil anticipated to come from the Middle East , where it is unclear whether the oil exists , and whether the region will be stable enough to produce it , but it is also mainly not yet discovered :
Illustrative Total Liquids Supply .
Source : Figure ES - 5 of NPC report Executive Summary .
As you can see , the growth in total liquids supply comes by and large from about 40 mbd of " Exploration Potential " .
Now , to put this in context OPEC liquids production at the moment , according to Table 16 of the OPEC Monthly Oil Market Report ( PDF ) ) is just around 30 mbd .
So the NPC wants us to believe that there is a whole other OPEC plus a third waiting to be discovered .
If that does n't sound too likely to you , you 're not alone .
The ASPO curve for the trend in oil discoveries shows a peak back in the 1960s , with gradual downtrend ever since :
History of global oil discoveries , with extrapolation .
Source : ASPO .
So in summary , the NPC report is saying that production will increase by around 25 % over the next twenty five years , but this increase is entirely reliant on finding large amounts of new oil , mainly in the Middle East .
Unfortunately , it is rather unlikely that the existing claims of oil reserves in the Middle East are true , and even less likely that massive amounts more oil can be found there .
Even if it could , the Middle East is the least politically stable region of the world , and relying ever more heavily on it for critical inputs to our economy is likely to be fairly painful at regular intervals .
However , their number one recommendation on the demand side is :
Based on a detailed review of technological potential , a doubling of fuel economy of new cars and light - trucks by 2030 is possible through the use of existing and anticipated technologies , assuming vehicle performance and other attributes remain the same as today .
The 4 percent annual gain in CAFE standards starting in 2010 that President George W. Bush suggested in his 2007 State of the Union speech is not inconsistent with a potential doubling of fuel economy for new light duty vehicles by 2030 .
Depending upon how quickly new vehicle improvements become incorporated in the full fleet average , it should be possible to lower U.S. oil demand by about 3 - 5 million barrels per day by 2030 .
Additional fuel economy improvements would be possible by reducing vehicle weight , horsepower , and amenities , or by developing more expensive , step - out technologies .
That 's something I can heartily agree with , and it 's great to hear the oil industry calling for a doubling of fuel economy .

In the spring of 1978 , an energetic marketing man named Gary Thuerk wanted to let people in the technology world know that his company , the Digital Equipment Corporation , was about to introduce a powerful new computer system .
DEC operated out of an old wool mill in Maynard , Massachusetts , and was well known on the East Coast , but Thuerk hoped to reach the technological community in California as well .
He decided that the best way to do it was through the network of government and university computers then known as the Arpanet .
Only a few thousand people used it regularly , but their names were conveniently printed in a single directory .
After selecting six hundred West Coast addresses ,
Thuerk realized that he would never have time to call each one of them , or even to send out hundreds of individual messages .
Then another idea occurred to him : what if he simply used the network to dispatch a single e-mail to all of them ?
“ We invite you to come see the 2020 and hear about the DECSystem - 20 family , ’’ the message read .
As historic lines go , it did n’t have quite the ring of “ One small step for a man , ” yet Gary Thuerk ’s impact can not be disputed .
When he pushed the send button , he became the father of spam .
The reaction was immediate and almost completely hostile .
“ This was a flagrant violation of the Arpanet , ’’ one recipient wrote .
Another noted that “ advertising of particular products ” should be strongly discouraged on the network .
The system administrator promised to respond at once , and Thuerk was harshly reprimanded .
Nevertheless , his company sold more than twenty of the computer systems , for a million dollars apiece .
Thuerk saw no harm in his actions ; he and others viewed the network as an emerging symbol of intellectual freedom .
Even if unsolicited e-mail became a nuisance , a greater danger would be posed by placing limits on how this powerful new tool could be deployed .
“ The amount of harm done by any of the cited ‘ unfair ’ things the net has been used for is clearly very small , ’’ the Internet pioneer Richard Stallman wrote a few days after the DEC e-mail .
Stallman opposed any action that would interfere with the aggressive openness that came to define the Web .
And he still does .
In his message about the DEC spam , Stallman pointed out — three decades before the appearance of Craigs - list and Monster.com — that the network provided a unique opportunity to advertise jobs and an entirely new way to sell products .
He went even further : “ Would a dating service on the net be ‘ frowned upon ’ . . . ?
I hope not .
But even if it is , do n’t let that stop you from notifying me via net mail if you start one . ”
I have no idea whether anyone on the Arpanet tried to help Stallman find a date , but thousands of people have tried to help me .
In the past few weeks , I have received several e-mails from the Dating Adult Friend line , and several dozen from a site called Adult Friend Finder .
In addition , there were fourteen messages from someone calling himself Damian Dominques , who offered , repeatedly , to help me meet “ delicious babes . ”
I also received fairly unambiguous invitations for personal interaction from people named Antonia , Heather , Helen , Joyce , Olivia , Kelly , Sally , Sophie , and Sue , among dozens of others .
Wading through dating - service spam is a minor inconvenience compared to dealing with advertisements for products designed to help those dates succeed .
I received three hundred and seventeen pieces of mail offering , through surgical , mechanical , and , above all , pharmaceutical means , to help “ fatten ” my “ love muscle , ” as one of them put it .
There were also several hundred solicitations for low - and no-interest car loans , automatic mortgage approvals , sleeping pills , dubious heart medicines , diet aids , gastric bypass surgery , contact lenses , air - conditioning systems , watches , online casinos , laptops , high - definition television sets , bootleg software , and jobs that promised to let me work at home , do practically nothing , and earn millions of dollars .
In all , last month my three principal e-mail addresses pulled in 4,321 messages that went straight into various spam folders .
Another hundred or so made it to my in - box .
__
As the Web evolves into an increasingly essential part of American life , the sheer volume of spam grows exponentially every year , and so , it would appear , do the sophisticated methods used to send it .
Nearly two million e-mails are dispatched every second , a hundred and seventy - one billion messages a day .
Most of those messages have something to sell .
Even the most foolish and unsavory advertisements can earn money — in part because the economic bar for success is so low .
If somebody wants to send you junk mail the old - fashioned way , through the United States Postal Service , he has to pay for it ; the more he sends , the greater the expense .
With electronic junk mail , the opposite is true : it costs a pittance to send a million messages — or even a billion — and recipients almost always spend more than the sender .
( Assume that someone can unleash a hundred million spams from a twenty - dollar broadband account each month ; at those rates , a penny would pay for fifty thousand pieces of mail . )
Spam ’s growth has been metastatic , both in raw numbers and as a percentage of all mail .
In 2001 , spam accounted for about five per cent of the traffic on the Internet ; by 2004 , that figure had risen to more than seventy per cent .
This year , in some regions , it has edged above ninety per cent — more than a hundred billion unsolicited messages clogging the arterial passages of the world ’s computer networks every day .
The flow of spam is often seasonal .
It slows in the spring , and then , in the month that technology specialists call “ black September ” — when hundreds of thousands of students return to college , many armed with new computers and access to fast Internet connections — the levels rise sharply .
Attempts to police the Internet have met with only partial success .
On May 23rd , the federal government indicted Robert Alan Soloway on thirty - five counts , including mail fraud , wire fraud , money laundering , and aggravated identity theft .
( He has pleaded not guilty . )
In its indictment , the government contended that Soloway had sent out tens of millions of illegal e-mails in the past four years , seeking to drum up business for his Internet marketing firm .
Federal agents described Soloway , a twenty - seven - year - old Seattle “ entrepreneur , ’’ as the nation ’s spam king , and said that the arrest would have a major effect on the flow of unwanted e-mail .
“ Taking Soloway off the streets is terrific , ’’ I was told not long ago by Matt Sergeant , the chief anti-spam technologist at MessageLabs , one of the leaders in the growing industry dedicated to ridding the Internet of junk mail .
“ But turn on your computer tomorrow and see if you notice a difference .
These guys are sophisticated and they are everywhere .
Each time we think we have them , they respond with something new . ”
Spam seemed to vanish after the DEC incident of 1978 .
Throughout the nineteen - eighties , the Internet remained largely the province of academics , few of whom had any desire to see their network turned into a platform for virtual garage sales and dating services .
But , driven by the rise of eBay , in the nineties , and other commercial applications , the Internet soon became more powerful than the people who had created it .
The World Wide Web was conceived in an environment where trust was assumed and identity never doubted , and that openness has been among its greatest assets and its biggest flaws .
The Internet permits individuals to act without supervision , permission , or control .
If you have the e-mail address , you can write directly to whomever you want ; protocols and rules that have governed written communication for hundreds of years no longer apply .
That absolute freedom makes cyberspace an ideal place to agitate for democracy in China , sell seventeenth - century carpets , or blog about early music .
Blending these new freedoms with any sense of order or discipline has proved nearly impossible , however , and so has virtually every attempt to contain the explosion of spam .
The loop - qubus quantum computer involves a semiconductor chip with a loop of cavities containing quantum dots .
By focusing optical pulses at individual quantum dots , the electron spins within the dots rotate , changing the state of the bit .
Credit : Clark , et al .
Scientists have designed a scheme to create one of the fastest quantum computers to date using light pulses to rotate electron spins , which serve as quantum bits .
This technique improves the overall clock rate of the quantum computer , which could lead to the fastest potentially scalable quantum computing scheme of which the scientists are aware .
Susan Clark and Kai-Mei Fu , both of Stanford University , and Thaddeus Ladd and Yoshihisa Yamamoto , both with Stanford University as well as the National Institute of Informatics in Tokyo , have published their results on the new scheme in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters .
“ We still do n't know what a final quantum computer will look like , ” Ladd explained to PhysOrg.com .
“ Large scale quantum computation is a technology that is still very far away from being implemented , and will probably incorporate many new ideas that have not been imagined yet .
The important development in this paper is finding a physical implementation of an existing theoretical idea [ using phase gates to couple non-local spins ] and estimating the speed . ”
On a single semiconductor chip , the researchers combine fast single - bit rotations and fast two - qubit gates , both of which are optically controlled .
In quantum computing , the orientation and phase of the electron spin serve as the bit state , and the gates are responsible for performing reversible operations on input data to produce output data .
The semiconductor chip is a square millimeter in size , and consists of a loop of cavities — together , this apparatus is called a “ loop - qubus . ”
Each cavity holds a quantum dot , which is a small piece of semiconductor that contains , in this scheme , a single electron .
By focusing optical pulses at individual quantum dots , the electron spins rotate , changing the state of the bit .
The architecture is built on the idea of using phase gates to couple non-local spins .
The optical pulses can provide a means to couple distant electron spins , or qubits , so that the phase of one qubit can depend on the phase of another qubit .
When coupled , the qubits ’ spin states form a “ qu-bus , ” which is the basis of a two - qubit gate .
The operating speed of a quantum computer is measured by its clock signal , which could take many different forms .
In the optical control scheme , the pulses , which could be supplied by a laser , provide a clock rate for the system .
Ladd explained that there are several limitations on speed for quantum computers .
“ In quantum computing , not only is the state of the bit ( 0 or 1 ) important , but also the phase of the bit , ” he said .
“ How quickly we can control the phase of the qubit , in our scheme , depends on the magnetic field .
Increasing the magnetic field increases how fast the phase for any single qubit changes in time and ultimately sets the limit of how fast we can control our qubits .
In the article , we give the limit of about 100 GHz , which is assuming a very high magnetic field , which would require superconducting magnets to achieve .
“ The second limitation on speed is the time it takes for the phase of one qubit to change the phase of another , ” he continued .
“ This must be done with pulses that are slower than the rate light moves in and out of each optical cavity , so this brings the speed down to more like 10 GHz .
Finally , as the computer gets bigger , the amount of time it takes for light to propagate around the system will also limit speed , perhaps bringing the speed of physical qubits down to GHz compared to classical computers . ”
However , Ladd added that the proposed architecture , with its speedy physical operations , non-local couplings , potential for monolithic semiconductor implementation , and non-reliance on single photon sources or detectors , is still much faster than other schemes for quantum computing , such as ion traps .
“ As opposed to classical computers , quantum computers critically depend on error correcting schemes , ” Clark said , explaining the complexity of calculating a quantum computer ’s speed .
“ Techniques for correcting errors can get complicated ; however , in general , they require many physical qubits and qubit operations to represent one fault - tolerant logical operation ( and therefore more time ) .
The speed of the physical qubit manipulation makes the computer appear faster than it is .
Proper error correction may reduce the speed of the quantum computer to 1 - 10 MHz . ”
Besides speed , the proposed scheme also has benefits in terms of scalability and manufacturing potential .
Because the system can create two - qubit gates between distant qubits , the scheme favors scalability compared with systems that rely on adjacent qubit interactions .
Also , the system does n’t require the two qubits to have the same frequency , which matches other proposals in its potential for large - scale fabrication .
“ In terms of building this computer , we are working on that one step at a time , ” Clark said .
“ We are starting by putting the quantum dot qubits in cavities , performing rotations on those qubits , and then coupling them via qubus .
But a complete , scalable device remains many years away . ”

The molecule is based on one from the egg cells of a frog
Amphinase is a version of a molecule isolated from the egg cells of the northern leopard frog .
UK and US scientists found it recognises the sugary coating found on a tumour cell , and latches on to it before invading and killing it .
The Journal of Molecular Biology paper suggests the molecule could potentially treat many cancers .
It is rather like Mother Nature 's very own magic bullet
Professor Ravi Acharya
University of Bath
Researcher Professor Ravi Acharya said : " This is a very exciting molecule .
" It is rather like Mother Nature 's very own magic bullet for recognising and destroying cancer cells .
" It is highly specific at hunting and destroying tumour cells , is easily synthesised in the laboratory and offers great hope as a therapeutic treatment of the future . "
Evades defences
Amphinase is a version of a ribonuclease enzyme , which is found in all organisms and plays a role in mopping up genetic material called RNA .
In mammals the enzyme is kept in close check , so that it does not cause damage .
But because Amphinase comes from an amphibian , and not a mammal , it is able to evade the usual defences of cancer cells , and attack them .
It will have no effect on other cells because it is only capable of recognising and binding to the sugar coating of tumour cells .
However , it is still in the early stages of development , and a treatment is not likely for several years .
Amphinase is the second anti-tumour ribonuclease to be isolated by Alfacell Corporation from northern leopard frog ( Rana pipiens ) egg cells .
The other , ranpirnase , is in late - stage clinical trials as a treatment for unresectable malignant mesothelioma , a rare and fatal form of lung cancer .
It is also being assessed as a treatment for non -small cell lung cancer and other solid tumours .
Dr Emma Knight , science information manager at Cancer Research UK , said : " Cancer is such a complicated disease that researchers need to explore all potential avenues .
" A similar drug to Amphinase is currently being tested against cancer in human clinical trials .
" But it 's far too early to comment on whether Amphinase could ever be helpful for people with cancer . "
An image of a sunspot the size of the Earth , taken with the Swedish Solar Telescope .
The energy output from the Sun has increased significantly during the 20th century , according to a new study .
Many studies have attempted to determine whether there is an upward trend in the average magnitude of sunspots and solar flares over time , but few firm conclusions have been reached .
Now , an international team of researchers led by Ilya Usoskin of the Sodankylä Geophysical Observatory at the University of Oulu , Finland , may have the answer .
They examined meteorites that had fallen to Earth over the past 240 years .
By analyzing the amount of titanium 44 , a radioactive isotope , the team found a significant increase in the Sun 's radioactive output during the 20th century .
Over the past few decades , however , they found the solar activity has stabilized at this higher - than - historic level .
Prior research relied on measurements of certain radioactive elements within tree rings and in the ice sheets covering Greenland and Antarctica , which can be altered by terrestrial processes , not just by solar activity .
The isotope measured in the new study is not affected by conditions on Earth .
The results , detailed in this week 's issue of the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics Letters , " confirm that there was indeed an increase in solar activity over the last 100 years or so , " Usoskin told SPACE.com .
The average global temperature at Earth 's surface has risen by about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1880 .
Some scientists debate whether the increase is part of a natural climate cycle or the result of greenhouse gases produced by cars and industrial processes .
The Sun 's impact on climate has only recently been investigated .
Recent studies show that an increase in solar output can cause short - term changes in Earth 's climate , but there is no firm evidence linking solar activity with long - term climate effects .
The rise in solar activity at the beginning of the last century through the 1950s or so matches with the increase in global temperatures , Usoskin said .
But the link does n't hold up from about the 1970s to present .
" During the last few decades , the solar activity is not increasing .
It has stabilized at a high level , but the Earth 's climate still shows a tendency toward increasing temperatures , " Usoskin explained .
He suspects even if there were a link between the Sun 's activity and global climate , other factors must have dominated during the last few decades , including the increase of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere .
LARRY SMITH knows he is treading a fine marital line .
Mr. Smith , 37 , is the editor of Smith , an online magazine he founded , and he loves to work in bed at all hours — midafternoon , 2 a .m. if insomnia strikes , then again in the morning .
“ Sitting there in bed half awake with a cup of coffee is extremely pleasant , ” he said .
Yet Mr. Smith is all too aware of his wife ’s mounting disapproval of his routine and suspects that a laptop - in - bed ban could be imminent .
As electronic devices get smaller , people tote their technology around the house more than ever .
And as the number of home wireless networks also grows , laptops — along with Treos , BlackBerries and other messaging devices — are migrating into the bedroom and onto the bed .
The marital bed has survived his - and - her book lights and the sushi - laden bed tray .
Can it also survive computers that tether their owners to the office or make the bed the workplace itself ?
Piper Kerman , Mr. Smith ’s wife , tries to be understanding about her husband ’s need to work constantly , but her tolerance has limits , especially when she thinks about the significance of their bed , their first joint purchase when they started out as a couple 10 years ago .
Serpa power plant ( pdf ) Portugal 52,000 solar panels , 150 acres , 11 MW
Spread across a hillside pasture amid olive trees , 52,000 shimmering photovoltaic modules in one of the worldâ€™s largest solar power plants have begun generating enough electricity for 8,000 homes , GE , PowerLight Corp. and Catavento SA announced today .
After eight months of construction and testing , GE Energy Financial Services , a unit of General Electric , PowerLight , a subsidiary of SunPower Corporation and Catavento dedicated the 11 - megawatt Serpa solar power plant today , on schedule no less .
The facility — a model of clean power generation integrated with agriculture — is in one of Europeâ€™s sunniest areas , in Portugalâ€™s Alentejo agricultural region in the town of Serpa , 200 kilometers ( 124 miles ) southeast of Lisbon .
GE Energy Financial Services financed and purchased the project in an approximately US $ 75 million transaction last year .
PowerLight , designed , deployed , operates and maintains the plant .
The plant uses PowerLightâ€™s PowerTracker system that follows the sunâ€™s daily path across the sky to generate more electricity than conventional fixed - mounted systems .
Catavento , developed and manages the project , which began feeding Portugalâ€™s electricity grid in late January .
Kevin Walsh , Managing Director and leader of renewable energy at GE Energy Financial Services , said today at a dedication ceremony in Serpa : â€ œThis project is successful because Portugalâ€™s sunshine is plentiful , the solar power technology is proven , government policies are supportive , and we are investing and delivering under GEâ€™s ecomagination initiative to help our customers meet their environmental challenges .
â€
Added Andrew Marsden , Managing Director of GE Energy Financial Servicesâ€™ European Operations : â€ œThe Serpa project is a springboard for other solar power investments weâ€™re pursuing in Europe through project acquisitions , project finance , development capital and access to solar modules through GE Energy.â€ 
Generating electricity from the sun with no fuel costs or emissions , the Serpa plant is on a 60 - hectare ( 150 - acre ) hillside , equivalent to the area of more than 80 football fields .
The project supports a European Union initiative by saving more than 30,000 tons a year in greenhouse gas emissions compared to equivalent fossil fuel generation .
The EU this month agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20 percent by 2020 , from 1990 levels .
Portugal relies heavily on imported fossil fuels , and its carbon dioxide emissions have increased 34 percent since 1990 , among the fastest rates in the world .
To address this , the country is implementing some of the worldâ€™s most advanced incentives for installing renewable energy .
The Serpa project relies on a preferential tariff mandated by the Portuguese government .
Solar power enjoys widespread support in Portugal , with the backing of 77 percent of the population , according to a European Commission study published in January .
At todayâ€™s ceremony , a 3.7 million euro ( US $ 4.8 million ) contract was signed for a grant to the project under the Portuguese governmentâ€™s Economic Modernization Program .
Piero Dal Maso , co-CEO of Catavento , said the project â€œserves as a beacon to the world to show how to overcome challenges of scale and complexity .
â€
Added co-CEO Rui Pimenta : â€ œWe hope the government will clear remaining roadblocks so solar power can truly radiate across Portugal.â€ 
Construction of the Serpa project began in June 2006 and was completed as planned in January 2007 .
The facility consists of a ground - mounted photovoltaic system that uses silicon solar cell technology to convert sunlight directly into energy .
The Serpa solar power plant incorporates photovoltaic modules from SunPower , Sanyo , Sharp and Suntech .
Since the release of Michael Moore 's " sicko " movie , the U.S. health care system and its alleged failure have been widely debated .
But while the U.S. health care system is far from perfect , it is much better than Michael Moore would have you believe .
Furthermore , the real shortcomings that it does have are not the effect of its free market elements , but to various regulations and factors unrelated to the health care system .
This will not be a direct review of " sicko " , a movie which I have n't seen .
But it will of course be a indirect attack on the movie 's thesis .
For a listing of the lies present in the movie , see this review .
Myth : " The U.S. has a purely free market health care system "
Fact : The U.S. health care system is indeed more market driven than in most other countries , but nearly half of all health care costs is paid for by the government .
Already in 2004 roughly 45 % of health care costs were government funded a proportion which has likely increased since then due to Bush 's Medicare expansion .
Furthermore , the system is burdened with heavy regulations , which contributes to raising its costs , as The Economist recently reported in an interesting article .
Myth : " The U.S. health care system leaves 45 million ( or whatever number is claimed ) without health insurance "
Even setting aside that a significant proportion of these uninsured are illegal immigrants , which in Sweden is completely excluded from the health care system , this is only true in the sense that nearly 9 million in Sweden is without health insurance .
Everyone in America over the age of 65 is covered by the Medicare program and low income earners below the age of 65 can get their health care paid by the Medicaid program .
And besides , one can always simply go to an emergency room and demand care there since federal law prohibits hospitals from denying people care there , a possibility which has created some problems in the border regions to Mexico since illegal immigrants have been very good at taking advantage of this ( more about this in the link in the beginning of this paragraph ) .
And if you are unable to pay , government will have to compensate the hospitals .
Myth : " Market mechanisms are responsible for the high costs of the American health care system "
Fact :
That the U.S. health care system has a very high cost level is one of the few criticisms of it which is basically true .
Regardless of how you calculate , U.S. health care costs are higher than anywhere else in the world .
It should however be pointed out that many - including reportedly Michael Moore - exaggerate just how much more expensive it is by comparing the cost in PPP - adjusted dollars per capita .
Since the U.S. is still the third richest country ( After Luxembourg and Norway ) in the world according to that method of comparison and because a higher average income will for various reasons drive up the cost in PPP - adjusted dollars this kind of comparison will exaggerate the relative extra cost , while greatly underestimating it in dirt poor Cuba .
Health care costs in the U.S. are roughly 15 % of GDP compared to roughly 10 % in countries like France , Canada and Cuba .
What is then the cause of these higher costs ?
Well , in part it is actually ( see below ) the case that U.S. health care quality is higher , and quality costs .
And as is also described below , an unhealthier lifestyle among many Americans also contributes to pushing up costs .
Moreover , as discussed above various regulations have contributed to pushing up costs ( see aforementioned The Economist article ) and furthermore American doctors and nurses has much higher pay relative to the rest of the population than in most other countries .
And it is also the case that the American health care system in practice function as an Atlas which carries the world 's medical research costs on its shoulders .
In Sweden , Canada and most other countries , the government health system purchases medicine for very low prices which does n't cover the research costs needed to produce it .
Drug companies still reluctantly agrees to this since the prices they receive still give them a small profit given the completion of the research needed to produce it and because they can in the United States charge prices which covers not only cost of production but also the cost of research and more .
This factors means that real health care costs are overestimated in the United States while being underestimated in the favorite countries of Michael Moore and other socialists .
If the United States were to act as other countries and pay the same low prices for medicin - something which many leading Democrats have advocated - as other countries this would of course contribute to a significant short term reduction in U.S. health care costs .
The problem is that this would mean that new research would be unprofitable and so few or no new medicines would appear which in the long run would raise health care costs everywhere .
Myth : " Despite its higher costs , the World Health Organizations ranking show that the American health care system ranks only number 37 in quality " .
Fact :
No , it does n't show that at all .
The ranking is actually only to a small extent a ranking of health care quality .
If you check its details it measures mostly other things .
What is being measured is mostly things like a population 's health level ( why this is not a good indicator of health care quality see below ) and to what extent financing and treatment is in accordance with the WHO:s socialist ideals .
That socialist systems are better in accordance with socialist ideals is hardly surprising and is definitely not a valid indicator of health care quality .
The only one of their indicators which measures quality is " level of responsiveness " which is based on patient satisfaction and how quickly and efficient the system works .
And in this category the American health care system is .... number one !
Myth : " The somewhat shorter life expectancy and somewhat greater health problems of the United States shows that its health care system does n't work as well "
Fact :
No , it does n't show that at all .
These indicators vary mainly due to other factors , primarily different life style factors .
Sweden 's and Denmark 's health care systems - and the economic system in general - are basically the same , yet life expectancy is a few years higher in Sweden .
The difference is caused by the fact that Danes have a less healthy life style than Swedes .
Hong Kong has a very high life expectancy and low level of health problems " despite " having a health care system largely privately financed like in the U.S.
And as Michael Moore himself is a perfect illustration of , the United States have a higher proportion of people who are fat and / or for other ways live a unhealthy lifestyle .
This will both contribute to raising the cost of the system and worsening these health indicators .
LONG before Walt Disney built his theme park in Anaheim , this savvy little city 30 miles south of Los Angeles was deploying cutting - edge technology to improve its citizens ' lot and upstage neighbouring communities .
It was one of the first cities in America to build its own electricity grid — to illuminate its streets and lure late - night shoppers from nearby towns .
The innovation continued .
Before most had even heard of the internet , Anaheim had networked the city with fat communications piping , so residents could have a variety of cable TV providers and telephone companies to choose from , while local utilities could automate their meter reading and businesses could provide all manner of online services .
Now the city is in the process of blanketing itself with a wireless broadband network .
Anaheim is not the only city turning itself into a giant Wi -Fi hotspot .
No fewer than 175 municipalities and metropolitan regions in America are building community - wide networks .
A similar number are in the planning stage .
But having blazed the trail in network services , Anaheim is the municipality that other cities are watching the closest — all the more so because the company rolling out its wireless network is Earthlink .
Once the loudest booster of municipal Wi-Fi and still the biggest in the business , Earthlink is having second thoughts .
Having turned in a $ 30 m loss for its most recent quarter , Earthlink now says it is “ re-evaluating its position in the muni - Wi - Fi market ” .
The announcement has sent shivers through city halls across America .
The Anaheim model may no longer be realistic .
Like Anaheim , most municipalities installing wireless networks are not paying for the privilege , but relying on providers like Earthlink to foot the bill .
Having won the right to supply Wi-Fi services to a municipality , most companies expected to recoup the investment though subscriptions and advertising .
Neither revenue stream has lived up to expectation .
Originally , Earthlink thought it would be in clover if 20 - 25 % of households signed up for its wireless internet service .
It now realises it will be lucky to get 15 % .
And without the eyeballs , advertisers have been slow to come aboard .
The trouble is that too many cities ' schemes were half - baked to start with .
In some cities , such as Philadelphia , the mission was to offer cheap ( or even free ) internet connections to the poor .
In others , such as Anaheim , a more pragmatic , market - driven approach was adopted .
Elsewhere , populist mayors and city councils pandered to voters with promises of universal internet access .
In almost all cases , however , the reigning philosophy was “ build it and they will come ” .
What no one seems to have bargained for was that , while Wi-Fi technology works perfectly well over short distances within a home , coffee shop or airport , it does n't work all that well outside .
Wi - Fi's popularity stems from its use of the unlicensed , 2.4 gigahertz part of the radio spectrum .
But being unfettered by licences and regulations means that there are many PCs jostling for access .
Adding to the mayhem are the domestic appliances , like cordless phones and microwave ovens , that radiate in the same frequency band .

Simple only in theory
This creates enough trouble inside a building .
Outside , there are the added problems of foliage , tall buildings and hills .
These can reflect , absorb or otherwise interfere with a municipal Wi -Fi 's signal , beamed from aerials on lamp - posts and traffic lights .
Because of these glitches , network operators have found that the old rule of 15 - 20 Wi-Fi aerial nodes per square mile is nowhere near good enough .
Nowadays people expect to connect to the internet using low - powered devices such as laptops and Wi-Fi-enabled mobile phones .
To meet this demand , operators must install twice as many nodes per square mile .
The cost escalation does not stop there .
In opting for external Wi-Fi , municipal operators seem to have forgotten that the vast majority of dwellings in America use chicken wire in their walls .
As every high - school physics student learns , a mesh of chicken wire can screen out electromagnetic fields , especially those caused by radio waves .
For an external Wi -Fi beam to be detected indoors , homes have had to be kitted out with signal - boosting wireless modems .
These complications have made a mockery of service suppliers ' business plans .
When Earthlink says it is re-evaluating its position in the municipal Wi-Fi market , what it really means is that it can't make money out of communities with fewer than 2,500 households per square mile .
Even then , it needs assurances that the city will commit to buying a big chunk of the network 's capacity for such “ anchor tenancies ” as emergency services , traffic and parking control , video surveillance and internet telephony , as well as automated meter reading and other utility services .
This is precisely how it should be .
Internet access for residential users was never going to be the mainstay for municipal Wi-Fi .
Most communities are pretty well served these days by cable , DSL and satellite internet services .
As a result , competition has beaten broadband - access charges down to around $ 15 a month .
And where such services are not competitive , they quickly become so the moment municipal Wi-Fi presses its nose to the window .
No , the future of municipal wireless broadband rests on making cities safer , saner and simpler to manage .
Trivial pursuits like downloading songs or posting video clips can be safely left to phone and cable companies .

The moon is in kind of a bad neighborhood .
Daytime highs can hit 250 degrees Fahrenheit , while nighttime lows can plummet to - 450 degrees .
Getting there is ruinously expensive .
And the air quality is n't just poor — it 's practically nonexistent .
So NASA contractor ILC Dover has some niggles to address before year 's end , when the space agency expects its next design for a lunar habitat .
The company recently delivered a demonstration model for preliminary testing .
The airlock - sealed living capsule , 13 feet in diameter and more than 19 feet tall , inflates to maximize volume by weight .
That 's key , because each pound of lunar cargo eats at least 35 pounds of rocket fuel in transit .
Presently , the pods consist of little more than blow - up walls .
Engineers are still working on interior accommodations and the architecture of the overall moon outpost — likely a hub - and - spoke system that scales easily .
ILC Dover 's next version will be sent to Antarctica for trials in extreme conditions .
In the meantime , ILC Dover is developing materials to toughen those inflatable walls , such as structural fabric that hardens in UV light and embeddable microcapsules that if punctured release a foam sealant to keep the rig airtight .
" The basic technology is ready to fly , " says Dave Cadogan , director of research and technology at ILC Dover .
" When that happens is a political question . "
NASA is shooting for a move - in date of 2020 .

Why have a monetary system based on gold ?
Because , as conditions are today and for the time that can be foreseen today , the gold standard alone makes the determination of money 's purchasing power independent of the ambitions and machinations of governments , of dictators , of political parties , and of pressure groups .
The gold standard alone is what the nineteenth - century freedom - loving leaders ( who championed representative government , civil liberties , and prosperity for all ) called " sound money . "
The eminence and usefulness of the gold standard consists in the fact that it makes the supply of money depend on the profitability of mining gold , and thus checks large - scale inflationary ventures on the part of governments .
The gold standard did not fail .
Governments deliberately sabotaged it , and still go on sabotaging it .
But no government is powerful enough to destroy the gold standard so long as the market economy is not entirely suppressed by the establishment of socialism in every part of the world .
Governments believe that it is the gold standard 's fault alone that their inflationary schemes not only fail to produce the expected benefits , but unavoidably bring about conditions that ( also in the eyes of the rulers themselves and most of the people ) are considered as much worse than the alleged or real evils they were designed to eliminate .
Except for the gold standard , governments are told by pseudo - economists that they could make everybody perfectly prosperous .
Let us test the three doctrines advanced for the support of this fable of government omnipotence .
1. The Fiction of Government Omnipotence
" The state is God , " said Ferdinand Lassalle , the founder of the German socialist movement .
As such , the state has the power to " create " unlimited quantities of money and thus to make everybody happy .
Intrepid and clear - headed people branded such a policy of " creating " money as inflation .
The official terminology calls it nowadays " deficit spending . "
But whatever the name used in dealing with this phenomenon may be , its meaning is obvious .
The government increases the quantity of money in circulation .
Then a greater quantity of money " chases " ( as a rather silly but popular way of talking about these problems says ) a quantity of goods and services that has not been increased .
The government 's action did not add anything to the available amount of useful things and services .
It merely made the prices paid for them soar .
If the government wishes to raise the income of some people , for example , government employees , it has to confiscate by taxation a part of some other people 's incomes , and then distribute the amount collected to its employees or favored groups .
Then the taxpayers are forced to restrict their spending , while the recipients of the higher salaries or benefits are increasing their spending to the same amount .
There does not result a conspicuous change in the purchasing power of the monetary unit .
But if the government provides the money it wants for the payment of higher salaries by printing it or the granting of additional credits , the new money in the hands of these beneficiaries constitutes on the market an additional demand for the not - increased quantity of goods and services offered for sale .
The unavoidable result is a general tendency of prices to rise .
Any attempts the governments and their propaganda offices make to conceal this concatenation of events are in vain .
Deficit spending means increasing the quantity of money in circulation .
That the official terminology avoids calling it inflation is of no avail whatever .
The government and its chiefs do not have the powers of the mythical Santa Claus .
They cannot spend except by taking out of the pockets of some people for the benefit of others .
2 . The " Cheap - Money " Fallacy
Interest is the difference in the valuation of present goods and future goods ; it is the discount in the valuation of future goods as against that of present goods .
Interest cannot be " abolished " as long as people prefer an apple available today to an apple available only in a year , in ten years , or in a hundred years .
The height of the originary rate of interest , which is the main component of the market rate of interest as determined on the loan market , reflects the difference in the people 's valuation of present and future satisfaction of needs .
The disappearance of interest , that is , an interest rate of zero , would mean that people do not care a whit about satisfying any of their present wants and are exclusively intent upon satisfying their future wants , their wants of the later years , decades , and centuries to come .
People would only save and invest and would not be consuming .
On the other hand , if people were to stop saving , that is , making any provision for the future , be it even the future of the tomorrow , and would not save at all and consume all capital goods accumulated by previous generations , the rate of interest would rise beyond any limits .
It is thus obvious that the height of the market rate of interest ultimately does not depend on the whims , fancies , and the pecuniary interests of the personnel operating the government apparatus of coercion and compulsion , the much - referred - to " public sector " of the economy .
But the government has the power to push the Federal Reserve System , and the banks subject to it , into a policy of cheap money .
Then the banks are expanding credit .
Underbidding the rate of interest as established on the not - manipulated loan market , they offer additional credit created out of nothing .
Thus they are inescapably falsifying the businessmen 's estimation of market conditions .
Although the supply of capital goods ( that can only be increased by additional saving ) remained unchanged , the illusion of a richer supply of capital is conjured up .
Business is induced to embark upon projects which a sober calculation , not misled by the cheap - money ventures , would have disclosed as mal - investments ( over - investment in capital ) .
The additional quantities of credit inundating the market make prices and wages soar .
An artificial boom , a boom built entirely upon the illusions of ample and easy money , develops .
But such a boom cannot last .
Sooner or later it must become clear that , under the illusions created by the credit expansion , business has embarked upon projects for the execution of which the real savings are not rich enough .
When this mal - investment becomes visible , the boom collapses .
The depression that follows is the process of liquidating the errors committed in the excesses of the artificial boom ; it is the return to calm reasoning and a reasonable conduct of affairs within the limits of the available supply of capital goods .
It is a painful process , but it is a process of restoration of business health .
Credit expansion is not a nostrum to make people happy .
The boom it engenders must inevitably lead to a debacle and unhappiness .
If it were really possible to substitute credit expansion ( cheap money ) for the accumulation of capital goods by saving , there would not be any poverty in the world .
The economically backward nations would not have to complain about the insufficiency of their capital equipment .
All they would have to do for the improvement of their conditions would be to expand money and credit more and more .
No " foreign aid " schemes would have emerged .
But in granting foreign aid to the backward nations , the American government implicitly acknowledges that credit expansion is no real substitute for genuine capital accumulation through saving .
3 . The Failure of Minimum Wage Legislation and of Union Coercion
The height of wage rates is determined by the consumers ' appraisal of the value the worker 's labor adds to the value of the article available for sale .
As the immense majority of the consumers are themselves earners of wages and salaries , this means that the determination of the compensation for work and services rendered is made by the same kind of people who are receiving these wages and salaries .
The fat earnings of the movie star and the boxing champion are provided by the welders , street sweepers , and charwomen who attend the performances and matches .
An entrepreneur who would try to pay a hired man less than the amount this man 's work adds to the value of the product would be priced out of the labor market by the competition of other entrepreneurs eager to earn money .
On the other hand , no entrepreneur can pay more to his helpers than the amount the consumers are prepared to refund to him in buying the product .
If he were to pay higher wages , he would suffer losses and would be ejected from the ranks of the businessmen .
Governments decreeing minimum wage laws above the level of the market rates restrict the number of hands that can find jobs .
Such governments are producing unemployment of a part of the labor force .
The same is true for what is euphemistically called " collective bargaining . "
The only difference between the two methods concerns the apparatus enforcing the minimum wage .
The government enforces its orders in resorting to policemen and prison guards .
The unions " picket . "
They and their members and officials have acquired the power and the right to commit wrongs to person and property , to deprive individuals of the means of earning a livelihood , and to commit many other acts which no one can do with impunity .
Nobody is today in a position to disobey an order issued by a union .
To the employers no other choice is left than either to surrender to the dictates of the unions or to go out of business .
But governments and unions are impotent against economic law .
Violence can prevent the employers from hiring help at potential market rates , but it cannot force them to employ all those who are anxious to get jobs .
The result of the governments ' and the unions ' meddling with the height of wage rates cannot be anything else than an incessant increase in the number of unemployed .
It is precisely to prevent this outcome that the government - manipulated banking systems of all Western nations are resorting to inflation .
Increasing the quantity of money in circulation and thereby lowering the purchasing power of the monetary unit , they are cutting down the oversized payrolls to a height consonant with the state of the market .
This is today called Keynesian full - employment policy .
It is in fact a method to perpetuate by continued inflation the futile attempts of governments and labor unions to meddle with the conditions of the labor market .
As soon as the progress of inflation has adjusted wage rates so far as to avoid a spread of unemployment , government and unions resume with renewed zeal their ventures to raise wage rates above the level at which every job - seeker can find a job .
The experience of this age of the New Deal , the Fair Deal , the New Frontier , and the Great Society confirms the fundamental thesis of the true British lovers of political liberty in the nineteenth century , namely , that there is but one means to improve the material conditions of all of the wage earners , viz. , to increase the per -head quota of real capital invested .
This result can only be brought about by additional saving and capital accumulation , never by government decrees , labor - union violence and intimidation , and inflation .
The foes of the gold standard are wrong also in this regard .
4 . The Inescapable Consequence , namely , the United States Government Gold holdings will shrink
In many parts of the earth an increasing number of people realize that the United States and most of the other nations are firmly committed to a policy of progressing inflation .
They have learned enough from the experience of the recent decades to conclude that on account of these inflationary policies an ounce of gold will one day become more expensive in terms both of the currency of the United States and of their own country .
They are alarmed and would like to avoid being victimized by this outcome .
Americans were once forbidden to own gold coins and gold ingots ( from 1933 to 1976 ) .
Their attempts to protect their financial assets consisted in the methods that the Germans in the most spectacular inflation that history knows called " Flucht in die Sachwerte " ( flight into real values ) .
They are investing in common stocks and real estate , and prefer to have debts payable in legal tender money rather than holding claims payable in it .
Even in the countries in which people are free to buy gold there are not yet ( 1965 ) conspicuous purchases of gold on the part of financially potent individuals and institutions .
Up to the moment at which French agencies began to buy gold , the buyers of gold were mostly people with modest incomes anxious to keep a few gold coins as a reserve for rainy days .
It was the purchases via the London gold market on the part of such people that reduced the gold holdings of the United States .
There is only one method available to prevent a further reduction of the American gold reserve , namely , radical abandonment of deficit spending as well as of any kind of " easy - money " policy .
Small ISVs : You need Developers , not Programmers
Context is critical .
Management advice can be worthless or worse if it is not appropriate for your situation .
The right decisions for a big company can be fatal in a small one .
Make sure you consider your context before you listen to anybody 's management drivel , including mine . :-)
I run a small ISV ( Independent Software Vendor ) with no substantial outside funding .
SourceGear is 6 years old and has 25 employees .
I 've learned plenty of interesting lessons along the way .
One of the things I 've learned is that a small ISV should not have any programmers .
For the purpose of this article , a " programmer " is someone who does nothing but code new features and [ if you 're lucky ] fix bugs .
They do n't write specs .
They do n't write automated test cases .
They do n't help keep the automated build system up to date .
They do n't help customers work out tough problems .
They do n't help write documentation .
They do n't help with testing .
They do n't even read code .
All they do is write new code .
In a small ISV , you do n't want any of these people in your company .
Instead of " programmers " ( people that specialize in writing code ) , what you need are " developers " ( people who will contribute in multiple ways to make the product successful ) .
My apologies if I 'm trying to be too cute with my word definitions , but it really does n't matter what terminology you use .
In a small ISV you can't afford to have people who think their only responsibility is writing code .
There are far too many other things to be done , all of which are critical to having a successful product .
If you were a BigCo , you would just hire more specialists until every job function is covered .
But as a small ISV , what you need are fewer people who are more versatile .
Boundaries vs. Flexibility
This is a really important difference between small companies and big ones :
In a small firm , most people wear multiple hats .
It simply is n't feasible to have a person who focuses on just one small area .
Small companies need versatile people who are content and capable to step in and do whatever it takes to help the company succeed .
One accountant or bookkeeper handles basically everything .
There is often a utility infielder who is always busy but nobody knows what they do .
The key concept here is flexibility .
Big companies have more specialists .
Payroll is different from " accounts receivable " which is separate from " accounts payable " .
Architects do design .
Programmers write code .
Technical Leads manage programmers .
Program Managers keep the spec and schedule .
Product Managers do positioning and message .
Evangelists do , er , well , nobody really knows what evangelists do . :-)
Anyway , each person has a specific , well - defined job .
The key concept here is respect for boundaries .
By the way , these are two very different cultures and ugly things can happen when they intersect .
Flexibility and boundaries do n't mix very well .
A person who has been successul in one of these cultures often stumbles badly when they transition to the other one .
Developers
In a small ISV , every developer is first and foremost a programmer .
The bulk of their time should be spent writing code and fixing bugs .
But every developer also needs to be involved in other areas such as the following :
Spec documents
Configuration management
Code reviews
Testing
Automated tests
Documentation
Solving tough customer problems
Using my terminology , these things are the difference between a programmer and a developer .
The developer has a much larger perspective and an ability to see the bigger picture .
The programmer writes code , throws it over the wall to the testers and waits for them to log bugs .
The developer knows it is better to find an fix bugs now , since he just might be the one talking to the customer about it later .
When your team evolves from programmers to developers , your pecking order may change .
Your best developer may not be the person who usually gets thrown the really tough problems .
A programmer of amazing talent can be a lousy developer .
Coding is a necessary but insufficient part of being a developer .
Similarly , the less gifted members of your team can still distinguish themselves as excellent developers through their contributions to the non-coding parts of the product .
Frequently Asked Questions
Ca n't we just let our programmers be coders and hire a separate group to do everything else ?
Maybe .
SourceGear has tried it this way in the past , and sometimes it has worked well .
But in the long run you will regret the decision to insulate your programmers from everything but code .
Programmers in a small ISV have too much influence to let them have a narrow perspective .
Make them see the perspective of the user .
Put your programmers on the phone to help a customer with a tough problem .
Your product quality will improve as you expose programmers to the consequences of the bugs they create .
Our programmers do n't know how to do all this other stuff .
Really ?
Surely the university CS programs are teaching SCM tools and tech support skills , right ? :-)
Yeah , my school did n't teach this stuff either .
It 's a foregone conclusion that your programmers do n't know how to do the non-coding aspects of product development .
Teach them .
Formal training might play a part here , but the best learning comes from experience .
Your developers need to borrow the advice of Nike and " Just Do It " .
Make sure they are allowed to fail .
Let them learn from their mistakes .
Our programmers do n't want to do all this other stuff .
Some people do n't want to be developers -- they want to be programmers .
That 's okay .
A programmer can have a fine career .
But you and the programmer may want to talk frankly about whether your small ISV environment is the right fit .
Ultimately you can decide to manage this in whatever way makes sense for your context .
I 'm suggesting that every programmer in a small ISV needs to be getting involved in something beyond the code , but most rules have exceptions .
Is n't it rare to find developers who have such a diverse skill set ?
Yep .
True developers are precious
You probably can't hire them from the outside .
You have to help your programmers morph to become developers .
Once they do , you may have to work very hard to keep them .
When a developer leaves , he or she will either become a manager at a BigCo or a founder of their own company .
How do developers get any code written if they 're constantly being interrupted with other stuff ?
Yep , that 's a problem .
I 'll take this opportunity to cite Eric 's Axiom of Software Management :
You can't eliminate problems ,
but you can make trades
to get problems that you prefer
over the ones you have now .
Your developers still need flow time or they will never get any code written .
This problem is far preferable to the set of problems you get when you surround yourself with people that have a narrow " code - only " perspective .
Try to structure your time .
For example , do n't try to write code and do tech support on the same day .
So are you saying our developers have to do all that other stuff ?
Images of the stretchable silicon membrane ( a , b , c ) The membrane in the relaxed state before stretching in the horizontal , diagonal , and vertical directions , respectively ( d,e , f ) The membrane during stretching in these directions ( g, h , i ) The membrane at full stretch .
Credit : John Rogers
Scientists have created a form of nanoscale silicon that is stretchable .
The new material may help pave the way for a class of stretchable electronic devices , such as “ smart ” surgical gloves and personal health monitors , that are not possible to create using current technology and materials .
“ Electronics that are bendable have many potential applications , but reversible stretchability is a different and much more technically challenging characteristic , ” said corresponding researcher John Rogers , a materials scientist at the University of Illinois at Urbana - Champaign ( UIUC ) , to PhysOrg.com .
Rogers and colleagues from UIUC and the University of Arizona created an ultra - thin silicon membrane from a silicon wafer and merged the membrane with a slab of a silicon - based polymer .
The overall process involved several steps but , in short , the group first “ pre-strained ” the polymer slab , pulling it taut , before they topped it with the prepared silicon .
When they released the strain the silicon buckled , resulting in a series of raised wavy ridges forming a herringbone - like pattern .
The finished composite membrane is about 100 nanometers thick and can stretch biaxially – that is , in both the vertical and horizontal directions .
The group performed several stretching tests on the membrane by pulling it from various directions .
Stretching it horizontally caused the herringbone pattern to straighten out .
Stretching along the diagonal produced similar changes until , at full stretch , straight diagonal ridges formed .
And stretching along the vertical direction – perpendicular to the waves – produced straight vertical ridges .
In each case , the membrane recovered its original pattern when the strain was released .
These temporary stretching - induced structural changes occur primarily at the membrane ’s central region .
In its pre-stretched state , the herringbone pattern is far less pronounced at the membrane ’s edges .
There , the waves give way to fairly straight ridges , and thus the edge of the membrane does not have the elasticity of the central region .
However , Rogers and his colleagues say that this could be an asset in certain applications .
For example , a medical imaging system that is stretchable – able to conform to the contours of the human body to achieve more detailed images – might perform better if regions directly above the device ’s photodetectors ( which collect light reflecting from the object being imaged ) are kept flat .
In their paper describing the work , in the May 8 online edition of Nano Letters , Rogers and his colleagues also discuss theoretical predictions of the membrane 's behavior .
They note that these predictions match their experimental observations , specifically in terms of the shape and dimensions of the waves .
This theoretical component of the research , performed by UIUC scientist Young Huang , a co-author of the paper , is a significant result of their work .
Rogers and his group have previously produced structures with similar qualities : stretchy , ridged nanoribbons made of silicon and gallium arsenide .
Other research groups have made circuit components consisting of stretchable metal wires connecting rigid islands .
However , the nanoribbons are only stretchable lengthwise and the wire - island structures provide circuit - level stretchability rather than stretchable devices .

Times : ' Democrats scrambling to expand eavesdropping ' Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday August 1 , 2007
Print This Email This President Bush is pressuring Democrats in Congress to expand his administration 's authority to eavesdrop on international communications without a warrant and Democratic leaders seem more willing to give him at least part of what he wants , the New York Times reports .
Democratic leaders emerged from a breakfast meeting at the White House Wednesday and appeared willing to pass a limited expansion of spying powers before Congress leaves for a month - long recess at the end of this week , Reuters reported .
" What we committed to was to work closely with the administration to come to agreement , " House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said .
Pelosi expected the House to pass legislation updating the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act this week , but Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid was less optimistic his chamber would adopt legislation in the next few days .
" We would like to do that .
We hope we can do that and I 'll try to do that but there 's no guarantees , " Reid said .
The proposal to amend FISA would be the first change in the eavesdropping power since Bush 's warrantless wiretapping program was revealed in December 2005 .
Sen .
Patrick Leahy , chairman of the Judiciary Committee , said Wednesday evening that the bill being considered by the Senate would protect civil liberties by maintaining FISA court oversight of eavesdropping on communication within the United States .
The Congress is willing and able to responsibly reform FISA when changes are needed , and now is such a time .
...
The reform we have proposed to the Administration will improve the governments ability to collect intelligence , while protecting the civil liberties of Americans , " Leahy said in a prepared statement .
The Bush administration wants Congress to remove hurdles in the law and make it easier for the National Security Agency to eavesdrop on some purely foreign telephone calls and e-mail .
Some civil liberties groups , however , warned Congress not to move to quickly in changing the law because there could be unforeseen consequences .
" Congress needs to take its time before it implements another piece of antiterrorism legislation it will regret , like the Patriot Act , " American Civil Liberties Union executive director Anthony Romero told the Times .
" The Bush administration clearly has abused the FISA powers it already has and clearly wants to go back to the good old days of warrantless wiretapping and domestic spying .
Congress must stop this bill in its tracks . "
In recent days , the Times reports , Bush and Mike McConnell , director of national intelligence , have publicly called on Congress to expand FISA powers , and McConnell met with Congressional leaders of both parties Tuesday to try to reach a compromise .
Members of the Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees met Tuesday , along with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , to discuss proposed legislation , and similar talks are underway in the House , the Times reported .
 We hope our Republican counterparts will work together with us to fix the problem , rather than try again to gain partisan political advantage at the expense of our national security ,  Senator Harry Reid of Nevada , the majority leader , said in a statement Monday night .
A key point of disagreement between Congress and the administration involves how to audit the wiretapping of calls between two people outside the United States that are routed through US telecommunications switches .
Democrats have proposed secret FISA courts review the records to ensure Americans are n't being spied upon , but the White House wants to give sole oversight authority to the attorney general .
That option is not sitting well with Congress 's majority party because of the scandals Alberto Gonzales is involved in regarding what some say is his misleading testimony about firing of US Attorneys and the wiretapping program .
" It is essential to preserve the crucial role of the FISA Court in protecting civil liberties of Americans while providing our intelligence agencies the flexibility they need , " Leahy said .
" It is not wise to expand the authority of this Attorney General  or any Attorney General  in this regard . "
Tuesday 's discussions among Congressional leaders came the same day McConnell sent a letter to Sen. Arlen Specter ( R - PA ) that acknowledged for the first time that the president 's authorization of the wiretapping program encompassed " a number of " intelligence activities that have not yet been made public .
Six more U.S. soldiers dead in Iraq .
Bush has his blank check now , still no plan to get out of Iraq , still no accountability — just a soaring death toll .
The great war commander , George Bush , said the war could get “ bloody ” in August .
In August ?
As if it has n’t been bloody enough already .
As if it is n’t bloody enough now .
Heckuva job , Congress :
The U.S. military announced on Friday the deaths of six more soldiers in Iraq , hours after U.S. President George W. Bush predicted a bloody summer lay ahead .
Five of the soldiers died on Thursday while another was killed on Tuesday by a roadside bomb in Tikrit , 175 km ( 110 miles ) north of Baghdad , the military said .
April was the worst month this year for the U.S. military since the invasion to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003 , with 104 soldiers killed .
About 90 have been killed in May so far .
The total death toll for U.S. troops since the invasion now stands at 3,440 .
How many deaths would it take for Bush to think the war is bloody now ?
The goal of Yet Another Haskell Tutorial is to provide a complete introduction to the Haskell programming language .
It assumes no knowledge of the Haskell language or familiarity with functional programming in general .
However , general familiarity with programming concepts ( such as algorithms ) will be helpful .
This is not intended to be an introduction to programming in general ; rather , to programming in Haskell .
Sufficient familiarity with your operating system and a text editor is also necessary ( this report only discusses installation and configuration on Windows and * Nix system ; other operating systems may be supported -- consult the documentation of your chosen compiler for more information on installing on other platforms ) .
What is Haskell ? [ edit ]
Haskell is called a lazy , pure functional programming language .
It is called lazy because expressions which are not needed to determine the answer to a problem are not evaluated .
The opposite of lazy is strict , which is the evaluation strategy of most common programming languages ( C , C++ , Java , even ML ) .
A strict language is one in which every expression is evaluated , whether the result of its computation is important or not .
( This is probably not entirely true as optimizing compilers for strict languages often do what 's called " dead code elimination " -- this removes unused expressions from the program . )
Haskell is called pure because it does not allow side effects ( A side effect is something that affects the " state " of the world .
For instance , a function that prints something to the screen is said to be side - effecting , as is a function which affects the value of a global variable . ) -- of course , a programming language without side effects would be horribly useless ;
Haskell uses a system of monads to isolate all impure computations from the rest of the program and perform them in the safe way ( see the chapter Monads for a discussion of monads proper or the chapter Io for how to do input / output in a pure language ) .
Haskell is called a functional language because the evaluation of a program is equivalent to evaluating a function in the pure mathematical sense .
This also differs from standard languages ( like C and Java ) which evaluate a sequence of statements , one after the other ( this is termed an imperative language ) .
The History of Haskell [ edit ]
The history of Haskell is best described using the words of the authors .
The following text is quoted from the published version of the Haskell 98 Report :
In September 1987 a meeting was held at the conference on Functional Programming Languages and Computer Architecture ( FPCA ' 87 ) in Portland , Oregon , to discuss an unfortunate situation in the functional programming community : there had come into being more than a dozen non-strict , purely functional programming languages , all similar in expressive power and semantic underpinnings .
There was a strong consensus at this meeting that more widespread use of this class of functional languages was being hampered by the lack of a common language .
It was decided that a committee should be formed to design such a language , providing faster communication of new ideas , a stable foundation for real applications development , and a vehicle through which others would be encouraged to use functional languages .
This document describes the result of that committee 's efforts : a purely functional programming language called Haskell , named after the logician Haskell B. Curry whose work provides the logical basis for much of ours .
The committee 's primary goal was to design a language that satisfied these constraints :
It should be suitable for teaching , research , and applications , including building large systems .
It should be completely described via the publication of a formal syntax and semantics .
It should be freely available .
Anyone should be permitted to implement the language and distribute it to whomever they please .
It should be based on ideas that enjoy a wide consensus .
It should reduce unnecessary diversity in functional programming languages .
The committee intended that Haskell would serve as a basis for future research in language design , and hoped that extensions or variants of the language would appear , incorporating experimental features .
Haskell has indeed evolved continuously since its original publication .
By the middle of 1997 , there had been four iterations of the language design ( the latest at that point being Haskell 1.4 ) .
At the 1997 Haskell Workshop in Amsterdam , it was decided that a stable variant of Haskell was needed ; this stable language is the subject of this Report , and is called " Haskell 98 " .
Haskell 98 was conceived as a relatively minor tidy - up of Haskell 1.4 , making some simplifications , and removing some pitfalls for the unwary .
It is intended to be a " stable " language in the sense that the implementors are committed to supporting Haskell 98 exactly as specified , for the foreseeable future .
The original Haskell Report covered only the language , together with a standard library called the Prelude .
By the time Haskell 98 was stabilized , it had become clear that many programs need access to a larger set of library functions ( notably concerning input / output and simple interaction with the operating system ) .
If these programs were to be portable , a set of libraries would have to be standardized too .
A separate effort was therefore begun by a distinct ( but overlapping ) committee to fix the Haskell 98 Libraries .
Why Use Haskell ? [ edit ]
Clearly you 're interested in Haskell since you 're reading this tutorial .
There are many motivations for using Haskell .
My personal reason for using Haskell is that I have found that I write more bug - free code in less time using Haskell than any other language .
I also find it very readable and extensible .
Perhaps most importantly , however , I have consistently found the Haskell community to be incredibly helpful .
The language is constantly evolving ( that 's not to say it 's unstable ; rather that there are numerous extensions that have been added to some compilers which I find very useful ) and user suggestions are often heeded when new extensions are to be implemented .
Why Not Use Haskell ? [ edit ]
My two biggest complaints , and the complaints of most Haskellers I know , are : ( 1 ) the generated code tends to be slower than equivalent programs written in a language like C ; and ( 2 ) it tends to be difficult to debug .
The second problem tends not to be a very big issue : most of the code I 've written is not buggy , as most of the common sources of bugs in other languages simply do n't exist in Haskell .
The first issue certainly has come up a few times in my experience ; however , CPU time is almost always cheaper than programmer time and if I have to wait a little longer for my results after having saved a few days programming and debugging , that is okay .
Of course , this is n't the case of all applications .
Some people may find that the speed hit taken for using Haskell is unbearable .
However , Haskell has a standardized foreign - function interface which allow you to link in code written in other languages , for when you need to get the most speed out of your code .
If you do n't find this sufficient , I would suggest taking a look at the language OCaml , which often out - performs even C++ , yet also has many of the benefits of Haskell .

Haskell for Miranda Programmers assumes knowledge of the language Miranda .
Though all of these tutorials are excellent , they are on their own incomplete :
The " Gentle Introduction " is far too advanced for beginning Haskellers and the others tend to end too early , or not cover everything .
Haskell is full of pitfalls for new programmers and experienced non-functional programmers alike , as can be witnessed by reading through the archives of the Haskell mailing list .
It became clear that there is a strong need for a tutorial which is introductory in the sense that it does not assume knowledge of functional programming , but which is advanced in the sense that it does assume some background in programming .
Moreover , none of the known tutorials introduce input / output and interactivity soon enough ( Paul Hudak 's book is an exception in that it does introduce IO by page 35 , though the focus and aim of that book and this tutorial are very different ) .
This tutorial is not for beginning programmers ; some experience and knowledge of programming and computers is assumed ( though the appendix does contain some background information ) .
The Haskell language underwent a standardization process and the result is called Haskell 98 .
The majority of this book will cover the Haskell 98 standard .
Any deviations from the standard will be noted ( for instance , many compilers offer certain extensions to the standard which are useful ; some of these may be discussed ) .
The goals of this tutorial are :
to be practical above all else
above all else to provide a comprehensive , free introduction to the Haskell language
to point out common pitfalls and their solutions
to provide a good sense of how Haskell can be used in the real world

EMI is close to removing rights management software from its digital music for good , in a move which would pile pressure on the rest of the recording industry to follow suit .
According to the Wall Street Journal , the London - based label took a strategy to digital music retailers in December , which included a demand for a multi-million dollar " risk insurance " fee .
Predictably , many retailers told EMI to go forth and multiply .
The paper reports that EMI returned with new ideas late in January which , rather than asking to be paid for nothing , invited retailers to make advance payments on the music they wanted to sell .
The shops ' submissions were due back to the label yesterday , and EMI will decide whether to go ahead based on the total up front cash haul that dumping DRM would bring .
Understandably coy about the imminent decision , EMI refused to confirm the process , describing reports as " speculation " .
That EMI will likely be the first major label to ditch DRM entirely is no great shock - it already announced it would no longer encumber its physical releases in January .
It even trialled selling DRM - free MP3s of some of its top - selling artists back in summer 2006 through Yahoo ! music .
Those trials failed to bring the global music industry to its knees , so it would be more surprising if talks with other retailers were n't ongoing .
Happily for Steve Jobs though , his timing is impeccable ; history will probably grant him much credit thanks to his media - baiting denouncement of DRM in an open letter earlier this week .
Warner , another of the four major record labels which together control around 80 per cent of the worldwide recorded music market , meanwhile told Jobs where he could stick his open letter .
CEO Edgar Bronfman said the Apple supremo's ideas were " without logic and merit " . ®
As I sat in the archive looking at the pictures , I suddenly saw in them the symbolic representation of our present situation .
Inexorably , weapons are being produced for the obvious purpose of destroying the next generation .
Yet those who are profiting from the production of these weapons , while enhancing their prestige and power , somehow manage not to think of this ultimate result .
Like Abraham , they do not see what their hands are doing , and they devote their entire attention to fulfilling expectations from " above , " at the same time ignoring their feelings .
They learned to deny their feelings as children ; how should they be able to regain the ability to feel now that they are fathers ?
It 's too late for that .
Their souls have become rigid , they have learned to adapt .
They have also forgotten how to ask questions and how to listen to them .
All their efforts are now directed toward creating a situation - - war - - in which their sons too will be unable to see and hear .
In the fact of mobilization for war -- even a conventional one , a nonnuclear war -- the questions of the younger generation are silenced .
To doubt the wisdom of the state is regarded as treason .
Any discussion or consideration of alternative possibilities is eliminated at a single stroke .
Only practical questions remain :
How do we win the war ?
How do we survive it ?
Once the point of asking these questions has been reached , the young forget that prosperous and prominent old men have been preparing for war for a long time .
The younger generation will march , sing songs , kill and be killed , and they will be under the impression that they are carrying out an extremely important mission .
The state will indeed regard highly what they are doing and will reward them with medals of honor , but their souls -- the childlike , living , feeling part of their personality -- will be condemned to the utmost passivity .
They will resemble Isaac as he is always depicted in the sacrificial scene : hands tied , eyes bound , as if it were the most natural thing in the world to wait unquestioningly in this position to be slaughtered by one 's father .
( In my German translation of the Bible the verb used in this passage is schlacten , which refers to the butchering of animals . )
For many years Alice Miller was a lone voice in the dark .
Her message , devastatingly simple but with the kind of implications people refused to face , was considered far too controversial : violence towards children engenders a violent society .
Gradually , though , she has won wide acceptance around the world for her central theory that abuse runs in the family .
The slapped child of one generation becomes the abuser of the next .
Violence towards " a bad child " may create a bad adult and eventually foster the creation of a bad society .
Her latest book , Paths Of Life , takes this argument still further , declaring that tyranny and totalitarianism are born in the nursery .
Having studied some of the worst dictators known to the modern world - Hitler , Stalin , Mao and Ceaucescu - she says all four were systematically beaten throughout their childhood , and all denied the pain .
Dr Miller says : " These men learned very early to glorify cruelty and to be able to justify it to themselves without remorse . "
Crucially , they were also born into societies in which violence towards children was commonplace .
In Hitler 's case , for instance , harsh rearing of children was fashionable in Germany in the 1900s .
So there is a causal connection between that practice and the terror unleashed 40 years later by so many willing executioners .
The central question , to which she has devoted the last 20 years of her work , seems deceptively simple : why is it so hard not to smack a child ?
Why do people who would n't dream of striking their friends slap their children ?
" Beating children teaches short term obedience , but in the long term , only violence and anxiety .
" As beaten children , we have to learn to forget our physical and psychic pain .
This blocking out enables us to continue punishing our own children while we insist to ourselves : smacks teach lessons .
Sadly , all we are accomplishing is sowing the seeds of cruelty for another generation .
" Almost everyone agrees that we should not maltreat children , yet they also claim that corporal punishment is not a maltreatment , labeling it as ' educational discipline ' .
This is a dangerous error which can only be solved by a law preventing the punishment of children within the home as well as school .
The goal of this law should not be the punishment of parents .
It should educate them into understanding that every beating is a maltreatment , both socially and emotionally . "
The public by a 2 - 1 margin approves of spanking children in principle , and half of parents say they sometimes do it to their own kids , an ABCNEWS poll found .
But an overwhelming majority disapproves of corporal punishment in schools .
Sixty - five percent of Americans approve of spanking children , a rate that has been steady since 1990 .
But just 26 percent say grade - school teachers should be allowed to spank kids at school ; 72 percent say it should n't be permitted , including eight in 10 parents of grade - schoolers .
The person administering the punishment is not the person who the student directly got into trouble with , to assure that there are no emotions involved in the administration of the spanking .
On a roundabout way to have lunch I witnessed the public shooting of twenty - eight Poles on the edge of a playing field .
Thousands line the streets and the river .
A ghastly pile of corpses , all in all horrifying and ugly and yet a sight that leaves me altogether cold .
The men who were shot had ambushed two soldiers and a German civilian and killed them .
An exemplary modern folk - drama .

This perfect adaptation to society 's norms -- in other words , to what is called " healthy normality " -- carries with it the danger that such a person can be used for practically any purpose .
It is not a loss of autonomy that occurs here , because this autonomy never existed , but a switching of values , which in themselve are of no importance anyway for the person in question as long as his whole value system is dominated by the principle of obedience .
He has never gone beyond the stage of idealizing his parents with their demands for unquestioning obedience ; this idealization can easily be transferred to a Fuhrer or to an ideology .
Since authoritarian parents are always right , there is no need for their children to rack their brains in each case to determine whether what is demanded of them is right or not .
And how is this to be judged ?
Where are the standards supposed to come from if someone has always been told what was right and what was wrong and if he never had an opportunity to become familiar with his own feelings and if , beyond that , attempts at criticism were unacceptable to the parents and thus were too threatening for the child ?
If an adult has not developed a mind of his own , then he will find himself at the mercy of the authorities for better or worse , just as an infant finds itself at the mercy of its parents .
Saying no to those more powerful will always seem too threatening to him .
Witnesses of sudden political upheavals report again and again with what astonishing facility many people are able to adapt to a new situation .
Overnight they can advocate views totally different from those they held the day before -- withou noticing the contradiction .
With the change in power structure , yesterday has completely disappeared for them .
And yet , even if this observation should apply to many -- perhaps even to most -- people , it is not true for everyone .
There have always been individuals who refused to be reprogrammed quickly , if ever .
...
Morality and performance of duty are artificial measures that become necessary when something essential is lacking .
The more successfully a person was denied access to his or her feelings in childhood , the larger the arsenal of intellectual weapons and the supply of moral prostheses has to be , because morality and a sense of duty are not sources of strength or fruitful soil for genuine affection .
Blood does not flow in artificial limbs ; they are for sale and can serve many masters .
What was considered good yesterday can -- depending on the decree of government of party -- be considered evil and corrupt today , and vice versa .
But those who have spontaneous feelings can only be themselves .
They have no other choice if they want to remain true to themselves .
Rejection , ostracism , loss of love , and name calling will not fail to affect them ; they will suffer as a result and will dread them , but once they have found their authentic self they will not want to lose it .
And when they sense that something is being demanded of them to which their whole being says no , they can not do it .
They simply cannot .
This is the case with people who had the good fortune of being sure of their parents ' love even if they had to disappoint certain parental expectations .
Or with people who , although they did not have this good fortune to begin with , learned later ... to risk the loss of love in order to regain their lost self .
They will not be willing to relinquish it again for any price in the world .
Parable of the Old Men and the Young
So Abram rose , and clave the wood , and went ,
And took the fire with him , and a knife .
And as they sojourned both of them together ,
Isaac the first - born spake and said , My Father ,
Behold the preparations , fire and iron ,
But where the lamb for this burnt - offering ?
Then Abram bound the youth with belts and straps ,
And builded parapets and trenches there ,
And stretched forth the knife to slay his son .
When lo !
an angel called him out of heaven ,
Saying , Lay not thy hand upon the lad ,
Neither do anything to him .
Behold ,
A ram caught in a thicket by its horns ;
Offer the Ram of Pride instead of him .
But the old man would not so , but slew his son ,
And half the seed of Europe , one by one .
In her book , , Alice Miller discusses the story of Abraham and Isaac at length .
She had been looking for a jacket illustration for her earlier book , , and came across the Rembrandt painting which I suggested you look at .
She notes that " the father 's hand completely covers the son 's face , obstructing his sight , his speech , even his breathing .
The main concerns expressed in my book ( victimization of the child , the Fourth Commandment admonishing us to honor our parents , and the blindness imposed on children by parents ) seemed to find a central focus in Abraham 's gesture .
" She eventually found thirty illustrations of the Abraham story , and all of them presented this image in essentially the same way .
I have not been able to determine Miller 's precise political beliefs , and it is not clear to me if she is a pacifist across the board ( a position I would not agree with , and I also tend to doubt that is her position for a number of reasons ) -- but setting that issue aside , consider what she says .
Remember that this was written about fifteen years ago , and also consider its relevance to events of the last few years :
An illuminating interview with Miller begins this way :
In her books , Miller offers lengthy and detailed histories of these political figures , and also of famous writers and artists , including Nietzsche , Picasso , Kafka , and Plath .
Later in this same interview , Miller says the following -- which I recommend every parent think about for a long , long time .
In fact , every adult ought to think about it , because every single one of us is affected by these issues :
Her answer , equally straightforward , compels us to re-examine both our history as children and our roles as parents : I should add , as Miller also discusses in her work , that violence toward children need not involve physical abuse ( in which category I include even " occasional " spanking ; violence is violence , and the damage it does to a child is incalculable , even if inflicted only once or twice ) .
Parents frequently abuse their children terribly in emotional and psychological ways , and such damage can be just as severe , or even worse .
Miller often reports profoundly disturbing stories and polls about the commonplace approval given to corporal punishment in Europe , even today .
Let us consider this recent story from the United States : At the bottom of the story , there is a section entitled , " The Right Way to Spank . "
Among its admonitions -- do n't do it in front of other students , specify the number of spanks in advance , have a witness to ensure that " proper procedures " are followed ( that has an especially unpleasant historic resonance , does n't it ? ) -- there is this one :
And that one short phrase contains the entirety of this deeply tragic phenomenon -- a phenomenon which has resulted in worldwide horror and catastrophe .
Thus do adults deny the reality of what is occurring directly in front of them , including its -- and they continue the denial of what was done to them as children , what they are doing to the next generation , and the deadening of the soul that inevitably results .
In , Miller discusses this " poisonous pedagogy " and its consequences in detail .
At one point , she quotes from a journal kept by poet and writer Christoph Meckel 's father during World War II : Miller says : " Once feelings have been eliminated , the submissive person functions perfectly and reliably even if he knows no one is going to check up on him ...
" And she goes on : What Miller discusses at the conclusion of that passage is the simplest reason , and an eloquent explanation , for why -- despite my frequent discouragement , depression , anguish and deep anger at our contemporary intellectual climate and the nature of our public discourse -- I have returned to writing once again .
And why I always will , no matter how painful it sometimes is .
P.S. : Many thanks to the reader who reminded me of Wilfred Owen 's World War I retelling of the Abraham and Isaac story .
Here is Owen 's version : Historically , as Owen himself witnessed and knew all too well -- paying the ultimate price himself , when he was killed just one week before the Armistice that ended The Great War -- it is Owen 's version that has transpired , over and over and over .
How profoundly tragic that the poet 's insight and forbidding warning has still not been heeded , down to this day .
Will we ever , learn ?
One can only wonder -- and hope against hope that we do , before it is finally too late .

It links to the mobile phone operator to work out roughly where you are , and will respond with a text telling you where the nearest stockist is .
The information is also available on the Levonelle website , though not many people will want to be checking that in an open - plan office .
Incentivated uses the same technology to run the CabWise service , which will tell you the location of the nearest cab if you text " home " to 60835 - assuming you 're a Londoner and do n't want to go south of the river .

The group of disgruntled newspapers in Belgium that sued Google for copyright infringement has emerged victorious after a decision was granted in their favor today in court .
The judgment echoes a previous ruling from the Court of First Instance in Brussels that found Google in violation of copyright law when the company published extracts of articles from Belgian newspaper publishers .
Copiepresse , the Belgium copyright group representing the nearly 20 papers scandalized by Google News , now gets its wish : Google News may no longer link to the news resources in question nor cache any of their materials for use in Google News .
Google was fined € 25,000 for each day it violated the copyrights of the victorious party , which will amount to a € 3.5 million payday .
The fines were reduced from an earlier penalty of € 1 million per day .
The drama began a year ago when Copiepresse 's member companies complained bitterly about the free linkage being doled out to them via Google News .
While most news sites jump at the chance to be included in Google News , these publications were aghast .
A major reason for their unhappiness was the fact that Google News conflicted with their business model : the papers were in the habit of charging for content after it had been up for a set period of time , but Google News would show you cached copies .
That was n't the central issue , however .
The newspapers also vigorously argued that Google should not reproduce their content in any way without their explicit consent .
They actually resented the fact that Google News might direct readers to their content , because they feared that a search engine might do what it is designed to do : get people what they want the first time .
Copiepresse 's member companies would prefer that you hit their home pages and wander around aimlessly instead .
No , I 'm not joking .
Google plans to challenge the ruling .
" We believe that Google News is entirely legal , " Google said in a prepared statement .
" We only ever show the headlines and a few snippets of text and small thumbnail images .
If people want to read the entire story they have to click through to the newspaper 's Web site . "
I 'm feeling luck ^h^h^h^h like you owe me a lot of money
This entire debacle was ultimately about advertising revenue , as so many of these disputes are .
Copiepresse wanted in on the game , so to speak , and demanded a cut of Google 's advertising revenue as pay for Google 's inclusion of their materials in its master index and in Google News .
Google balked , because to do so would mean the company could theoretically end up owing everyone who has ever published something online a cut of the pie .
Today 's ruling requires Google to accept copyright infringement notifications from copyright holders via email , and Google will have 24 hours to deal with any claim of infringement before being fined € 1,000 per day .
It 's not exactly what Copiepresse wanted ( essentially a paid opt - in deal ) , but it puts the power firmly in the hands of copyright holders to determine what gets indexed .
Of course , these same copyright holders had this power all the while in the form of a little something known as a robots .
txt file , but they apparently refused to use it .
Their collective argument against taking responsibility for how search engines indexed their content was that doing so made Google a de facto copyright rulemaker .
The case is significant for Europe because it could end up affecting search engine policy across the board .
A European Commission spokesperson has said that the EC will consider revisiting copyright law as a result of the decision , according to IDG .
It is hard to know which way the EC might lean , but if the EC sides with the spirit of this ruling , it could be bad news for search engines and for Internet users in general .
The idea that any copyright holder should be paid for the inclusion of their materials which they 've published freely online in a search index runs counter to established practice .
Google will be just fine , regardless .
In most other regions of the world , publications are happy to be included in Google News .
In fact , some even pay Search Engine Optimizers big money to " optimize " their search results .
When copyright holders back out of search indexes , the only people that lose are the general public and the copyright holders themselves .
In the meantime , we expect Copiepresse to continue their quest against Yahoo and MSN .
Maybe if they 're lucky , no one will link to them ever again , and they can live in the obscurity that they apparently believe they should be paid to leave .
On a sunny summer afternoon eight years ago , Dan Wilson and Susan Knapp exchanged wedding vows on a hilltop in their upstate New York apple orchard .
In the apple barn down through the trees , we toasted them with their own cider .
We drank up , despite knowing that the Food and Drug Administration had proposed making it a crime for them to sell it .
The FDA had said that the unpasteurized juice of apples is dangerous because of the possible presence of E. Coli bacteria .
That is not quite true , as many in the wedding company could explain .
We also knew that Dan and Susan were worrying that an FDA mandate to pasteurize would turn this orchard upon which Dan was reared into a losing proposition .
A few nights before the wedding , sitting at our kitchen table , he said , “ I can imagine the day when my closest relation to growing apples will be buying them in the supermarket . ”
Susan nodded .
That would be a tragedy : they are a focus of our rural society .
Their quitting farming would leave a hole bigger than a barn .
The pall that the FDA cast on their wedding was but one scene in an apple cider saga that changed how I think about regulation .
As a Natural Resources Defense Council litigator in the 1970s , I had focused on getting the federal agencies to protect public health .
The complaints about the difficulties of compliance mattered to me chiefly as an obstacle to that goal .
I still want health protected , but , as a friend of Dan and Susan , I learned that regulation , even when well - intentioned , sometimes quite unnecessarily discourages initiative and creativity .
The FDA had gotten involved with cider two years before the wedding , when an infant in California had died because of E. Coli contamination in bottled fruit juice .
The juice had come from Odwalla , at that time a large West Coast company , but the FDA began to consider regulating all producers of fruit juices , down to small cider makers such as Dan and Susan .
E. Coli can get into cider because deer and mice , which are among its carriers , have a taste for apples .
One response is to pasteurize the juice , which also brings the commercial benefit of longer shelf life .
Odwalla , however , had taken pride in not pasteurizing ; it advertised its products as tasting better because they were only minimally processed .
After the E. Coli outbreak , it installed equipment that pasteurizes by heating and cooling the juice in such a flash that the taste is not much affected .
The Apple Processors Association , dominated by large companies , urged the FDA to require that all juice be pasteurized .
That would have been ruinous for small cider producers .
At that time , equipment that pasteurizes in a flash cost upward of $ 70,000 .
Even budget pasteurizers cost $ 25,000 , but they are prone to cook the taste out of cider and require extra employees to operate .
Cider that tasted like canned apple juice , plus higher operating costs , spelled bankruptcy to Dan and Susan .
Not so for the members of the Apple Processors Association .
They already pasteurized , and stood to pick up the sales of the small producers driven out of business .
In any event , the FDA proposed to decree that juice be put through a sanitizing process that would cut bacteria levels at least 100,000 - fold .
Culling the apples and then washing them would probably have accomplished that , but the rule required that the cut take place in one step .
The only way to do that was pasteurization .
While still pondering this proposal , the FDA promulgated another rule that the Apple Processors Association wanted .
Any unpasteurized juice must carry a label with this chilling warning : this product has not been pasteurized and , therefore , may contain harmful bacteria which can cause serious illness in children , the elderly , and persons with weakened immune systems .
This was three days before Dan and Susan ’s wedding .
Many customers at their cider barn threatened to stop buying their cider if it were pasteurized .
They liked its fresh taste and were unconcerned about E. Coli , their forebears having drunk cider from this orchard for a century without apparent incident .
( So , too , do Europeans like the taste of real Brie , Camembert , and other young cheeses made from unpasteurized milk .
They accept the small risk from E. Coli and other pathogens — a risk that has prompted the FDA to allow only ersatz versions into the United States . )
By contrast , the scary label would have spooked consumers who bought the cider at a few supermarkets in a nearby city ; these stores stopped carrying Dan and Susan ’s cider .
Going to the annual meeting of the New York State orchard owners the following winter , Dan was dejected , but he met someone there who cheered him up .
Phillip Hartman , a 52 - year - old engineer , was displaying the prototype of a machine that he claimed would sanitize cider without hurting the taste , yet could be sold for $ 12,000 and would require no extra employees to operate .
That was his hope — but only a hope .
He had neither approval from the FDA nor even a company to build the machines .
Phil , whose full - time job was in the computer industry , had been trying to help a fellow employee , with a friend in the same pickle as Dan and Susan , figure out how to use ultraviolet light to sanitize cider .
The problem was that , though ultraviolet can sanitize water , the cloudiness of cider prevents the light from penetrating deeply enough .
Phil , whose engineering specialty is creating the thin films on computer wafer board , hit upon a way to make the cider run by the light source in a film so thin , 30/1000 of an inch , that the ultraviolet would sanitize every drop .
By the fall of 1997 , Phil had an ultraviolet device ready for bench testing , but he needed a biologist to confirm that it killed the E. Coli .
Randy Worobo , who had just joined the faculty of Cornell University ’s Agricultural Experimental Station , agreed to help .
His test found that the device did cut the bacteria 100,000 - fold , as required .
Phil elaborated this device into the prototype that he brought to the orchard owners ’ annual meeting .
Although Phil still had many hurdles to overcome , the orchard owners got the sense that , as Dan put it , “ this guy would do everything he could to make things right . ”
The opinion that counted most was that of Russell French , a distributor of orchard equipment , who agreed to do the selling .
He was running a risk .
If Hartman ’s machines failed to work , or if the FDA refused to sanction them , French would alienate his customers and might even face lawsuits from people who got sick after drinking cider .
Encouraged ,
Phil quit his job and set up a company to make cider - sanitizing machines .
Dan and Susan placed one of the first orders , linking their future to Phil ’s ability to deliver machines that satisfied the FDA .
Their machine arrived in time for the 1999 cider season , but the early equipment had glitches .
Phil would get phone calls from orchard owners desperate because a balky machine stood between a barn full of perishable apples and customers with cash .
Phil would respond by getting into his van and driving through the night from his home in western New York to orchards as far away as Vermont , Virginia , or Michigan .
Driving was his only option : a paraplegic since his teens , he could not negotiate an airport with his wheelchair , tools , and spare parts .
Taking the glitches out of the machines proved easier than winning regulatory approval .
One hurdle was the FDA ’s rule requiring that cider be either pasteurized or labeled as dangerous .
Phil ’s machines , even though they did reduce E. Coli by 100,000 - fold and in one step , did not pasteurize , and the FDA had not decided whether their use permitted cider makers to omit the drink - this - at - your - own - peril label .
While the FDA dithered , cider makers across the country bought pasteurizers or went out of business , because they feared taking a chance on Phil Hartman ’s machine .
Not in New York State , however .
In the words of its chief food - safety regulator , Joseph Corby , “ We told the cider producers , ‘ We license you and we approve Hartman ’s machine .
The FDA has no reasonable basis to withhold its approval , and , if it does , there will be a battle . ’
As a result , we got a lot of nasty calls from pasteurizer manufacturers . ”
It was not until late 2001 that the FDA decided that cider made with Phil ’s machine did not have to carry the warning label .
Corby ’s solicitude for New York cider makers saved dozens of them from going under .
From 1997 to 2000 , while the FDA rules were driving producers out of business elsewhere , New York ’s cider producers multiplied .
By contrast , in Vermont , just a few miles away from Dan and Susan ’s orchard , fully 60 percent of the cider producers ceased operation during the same period .
Overall , in states like New York , which supported sanitizing by ultraviolet , the number of producers stayed steady ; in states that left their producers to the FDA , the number of producers declined 38 percent .
Phil ran into another , more ominous FDA problem .
The agency had long had a rule limiting the exposure of food to ultraviolet light , not because it had evidence that it was dangerous but because it lacked definitive evidence to the contrary .
It had put an exception into that rule for a company whose machine used higher levels of ultraviolet than did Phil ’s for sanitizing the surface of fatty foods like potato chips , but the exception did not cover the use of ultraviolet on fruit juice .
FDA officials told Phil to emulate that company ’s successful application , and he would get his exception .
He did as told , but a year later the FDA wrote that his application could not be considered without more information .
And then , alarmingly , it warned that , until he got an exception , the FDA would enforce its anti-ultraviolet rule by shutting down any cider maker using his machines .
His customers — including Dan and Susan , now his friends — would be out of business .
Phil decided that he needed a lawyer quick and found one who had worked for the FDA .
He took the $ 10,000 retainer out of his savings .
The lawyer filed a new application for an exception to the ultraviolet rule .
The FDA eventually summoned Phil to a meeting at its Washington , D.C. headquarters , where an official read him a prepared statement that his new application was faulty .
Officials told him , however , that the bottler that made Naked Juice , at that time a major West Coast brand like Odwalla , had filed its own application to use ultraviolet on fruit juice .
The officials advised Phil not to apply again , because that would delay Naked Juice getting an exception — and that exception would cover him .
The FDA later did approve the Naked Juice application , but in a way that did n’t legalize Dan and Susan ’s machine .
While Phil had elegantly solved the problem of getting ultraviolet to penetrate cloudy cider by running it past the light in an ultra - thin , smooth stream , Naked Juice had done so with brute force — by applying a much larger dose of ultraviolet to a thick stream .
Critical to the functioning of the Naked Juice machines was that the stream be turbulent , to bring all the cider close to the ultraviolet light at some point .
Both kinds of machine cleaned the cider , but the exception that the FDA granted to Naked Juice required cider - sanitizing machines to have a turbulent flow .
The effect was to outlaw the machine that Phil had sold Dan and Susan , even though it was just as good at sanitizing the cider and , because of its superior design , used far less of the ultraviolet that the FDA had viewed as risky .
Fortunately , Phil had a way of altering his machines to meet the FDA ’s turbulent - flow proviso , and he drove hither and yon to retrofit them .
He remained bothered , however , by the FDA ’s action .
The agency put him through the wringer , on the theory that ultraviolet might be dangerous , but in the end it put no limit on ultraviolet exposure .
It required a particular technique ( turbulent flow ) rather than a good outcome ( safe cider ) , thereby limiting the ways in which he might use his expertise in thin - film technology to produce a still - better machine .
The FDA ’s procedural rules did , however , offer him recourse : to file a formal objection .
That he did , with Cornell biologist Randy Worobo ’s help .
It was lucid and well documented .
The FDA never responded .
Phil is still making his machines , with the help of his niece and three other young , part - time employees on rented floor space in someone else ’s factory .
His office is in his home .
Now that he ’s sold 120 machines , the market is close to saturated .
He does not know what he will do next , but when he quit his job to start this business , he knew that his income would be lower and less secure .
Is he glad that he did it ?
“ Oh hell yes .
I have enjoyed myself immensely .
I enjoy the cider makers .
I enjoy the traveling .
I enjoy the young people . ”
He has since taken up scuba diving , with the help of his niece .
Phil could not have succeeded without Worobo , who diverted time from conventional academic work and made enemies potentially dangerous to a then - untenured professor .
As he recalls , “ On Good Friday in 1999 , two salesmen from a pasteurizing - machine company came into my office and screamed and hollered at me for four hours .
They said they did n’t like competing with Cornell . ”
Why did he do it — and for free ?
“ Phil Hartman is a brilliant engineer , and I enjoy working with him .
I also feel compassion for the cider makers .
I am from a farming background myself .
I know what it was like when my parents got screwed . ”
On account of Phil ’s success , Dan and Susan can still make cider .
Dan and Susan never had any quarrel with the FDA ’s aim of reducing exposure to E. Coli .
Before the agency stepped in , they culled the fruit to get rid of any that was nibbled or damaged and washed it before putting it into the press .
Parents do no more in feeding apples they pick to their children .
The FDA itself now finds such techniques an acceptable alternative to pasteurization for orange juice .
Apples are different from oranges , and Dan and Susan are glad to have purchased Phil ’s machine .
It gives them peace of mind .
The FDA could , however , have protected us to the same degree — a 100,000 - fold reduction in E. Coli in apple cider — but with less harm to those regulated , if it had not long insisted that this reduction had to be achieved through pasteurization , had not required that the reduction be done in one step , and had not decreed that there was only one acceptable way to employ ultraviolet to achieve that one - step reduction .
By specifying the means to achieve a sensible regulatory end , the agency unnecessarily put hundreds of cider producers out of business and subjected others to years of anxiety .
Regulators should avoid dictating the means to achieve an objective when it would be enough to dictate the objective itself .
As Adam Smith and Friedrich Hayek taught , the world is too complicated for officials to know what will work best .
Local innovators like Phil Hartman , experimenting and tinkering , drawing on their store of experience and ingenuity , are much better suited to come up with unexpected solutions that will increase the general welfare and prosperity .
The FDA ’s world is especially complicated .
It regulates the giants of the drug , food , and cosmetic industries , so it ’s no wonder that , from the perspective of its Washington headquarters , small - scale cider producers are invisible .
The world is somewhat less complicated at the state level .
From Joe Corby ’s vantage point in the Department of Agriculture and Markets in Albany , New York , Empire State cider makers were not only visible but also important .
According to Cornell ’s Worobo , “ Usually , the FDA acts first , and the state agencies follow , but some state regulators stuck their necks out this time , because lots of local businesses were in trouble .
These little businesses were beneath the notice of the FDA . ”
Dan and Susan also come under Environmental Protection Agency regulation .
Its world is even more complicated than that of the FDA .
Congress requires it to regulate in exacting detail thousands of pollutants coming from millions of sources .
According to former Environmental Defense Fund chairman Richard Stewart , now a New York University law professor , the EPA ’s regulation “ has grown to the point where it amounts to nothing less than a massive effort at Soviet - style planning of the economy to achieve environmental goals . ”
But for the vast majority of pollution sources , the impact is mainly local , and how to regulate it turns on local circumstances .
So the EPA is supposed to make a huge number of decisions that should be locale - dependent , cramming a flood of controversial choices through the constricted funnel of a single national regulatory system .
That is why , under Democratic and Republican presidents alike , it is woefully behind statutory schedule in promulgating new regulations and revising old ones .
And in its rush to get the job done , it issues regulations designed to fit hypothetical , standardized firms and farms rather than the multiplicity of real ones .
Even when I was still an environmental litigator , I understood that the EPA could make the world much less complicated by giving polluters more latitude on how to achieve environmental objectives and by devolving the regulation of most of them to the states , excepting only the small number that contribute substantially to interstate pollution .
What I did not understand then , but came to understand by witnessing Dan and Susan ’s regulatory travails , is that making a federal case of intrastate pollution casts yet another pall on individual initiative and creativity .
So immense is the EPA mandate that not only can the agency not understand those it regulates , but it cannot effectively communicate its regulatory requirements , even to large businesses .
As an environmental law treatise acknowledges , “ [ I ]t is virtually impossible for a major company ( or government facility ) to be in complete compliance with all regulatory requirements .
[ And yet ] virtually every instance of noncompliance can be readily translated into a [ criminal ] violation . ”
When asked in a survey to explain why there is so much noncompliance with environmental laws , environmental attorneys identified the most important factors to be not the cost of compliance , but the “ sheer number of regulations , ” “ complexity of regulations , ” “ too many different and conflicting requirements , ” and “ keeping track of changes in regulations . ”
To decode this complexity , giant corporations put environmental law experts on their payrolls and retain law firms staffed with top environmental specialists .
A smaller company can’t afford such legal overhead , but even a firm operating a single plant must grapple with almost as much regulatory complexity as a corporate behemoth running 50 plants .
Not only do small firms have a tougher time than large ones decoding regulatory requirements ; they also face much higher compliance costs : with the EPA , that amounts to $ 3,328 per employee for firms with fewer than 20 employees , versus $ 717 for firms with more than 500 employees .
But , of course , the smallest enterprises can’t afford to hire any expert help at all .
Dan and Susan now worry about the EPA , even though they are committed environmentalists : she had worked for the California Coastal Commission ; he chairs the local natural history museum and wildlife sanctuary .
They can manage their orchard without causing water pollution but not without pesticides .
The EPA , in regulating farmers ’ use of pesticides , must not only ensure food safety but must also write its regulations so that they leave farmers with some way to protect their crops .
In this part of its task , the EPA is much more apt to take account of the largest blocs of farms , such as big corn or soybean spreads in the Midwest , than to pay attention to niche operations like Dan and Susan’s .
They have a micro-farm in a microclimate , where they face pests unlike those faced by apple growers elsewhere in the country .
They understandably fear that the EPA might , in some national administrative hiccup , inadvertently leave them with no way to stop some pest that is killing their trees .
To decipher their regulatory fate , Dan has spent hours on the EPA ’s website but comes away frustrated .
His calls to the EPA ’s help line leave him with “ the impression that their computer screens showed the same materials as mine , and they knew less than I did . ”
It is difficult enough to begin or expand a tiny business without the risk of unwittingly stepping on regulatory land mines .
As Phil Hartman ’s experience with the FDA suggests , a regulatory problem that would have been a minor irritation to a big firm can topple a start - up .
Moreover , large corporations can send their teams of lawyers and lobbyists to Washington to impress their concerns on federal regulators .
Little firms and farms can’t .
Discouraged by his regulatory prospects with the EPA , Dan e-mailed me : “ If I could characterize my outlook to the whole process , it would be variations on the theme of resignation .
I am frustrated sometimes by what seems to be EPA ’s monumental lack of understanding about the complexities that are inherent in running a little farm like ours .
But I ca n’t muster much energy for this fight .
I ca n’t do everything else I need to do in a day with the weight of concern about EPA on my shoulders . ”
Such a regulatory regime prompts people who want to run their own enterprise to work for others , and for smaller businesses to be acquired by larger ones .
Odwalla is now a unit of Coca - Cola , and Naked Juice is a unit of Chiquita Brands .
Dan and Susan could earn more working for a large corporation , but they love being their own bosses and having scope for creativity and initiative .
They hope to enlarge that scope by making some of their sweet cider into hard ciders and ice wines .
The value added would , if all works well , let them still make a living , even if the EPA drives them out of growing the apples themselves .
Of course , making alcoholic beverages requires a permit from a federal agency — no surprise there .
They estimate the paperwork for the permit application took about 150 hours of late nights , after days and evenings caring for trees and children .
But , according to Susan , “ We knew what to expect , and we got the permit .
It was a piece of cake compared with the FDA and the EPA . ”
Agencies like the FDA and the EPA , with the power to regulate means as well as ends , and with jurisdiction over even the most local problems , engage in backdoor central planning .
They stifle individual initiative and creativity and herd increasing numbers of would - be entrepreneurs into working for large bureaucratic corporations , which are more capable than smaller , more dynamic firms of dealing with Washington bureaucrats .
The upshot is that our work is less enjoyable , because it is directed from on high .
It is also less fruitful .

As the 19th century drew to a close , logicians formalized an ideal notion of proof .
They were driven by nothing other than an abiding interest in truth , and their proofs were as ethereal as the mind of God .
Yet within decades , these mathematical abstractions were realized by the hand of man , in the digital stored - program computer .
How it came to be recognized that proofs and programs are the same thing is a story that spans a century .
The story ends with a new principle that is guiding the design of a new generation of programming languages , including mobile code for the Internet .
Modern logic began with Gottlob Frege in the late 1870s .
Two aspects of Frege 's work reached a culmination a half century later , in Gerhard Gentzen 's natural deduction , which captured a notion of proof , and Alonzo Church 's lambda calculus , which captured a notion of program , both first published in the early 1930s .
As it turns out , there is a precise correspondence between Gentzen 's proofs and Church 's programs , but that was not uncovered until the late 1960s .
As the 21st century begins , that correspondence sits as a cornerstone of modern programming language design .
For my money , Gentzen 's natural deduction and Church 's lambda calculus are on a par with Einstein 's relativity and Dirac 's quantum physics for elegance and insight .
This article gives a taste of these ideas ; for more detailed information on these topics , go to http://www.ddj.com/ articles/2000/0013/0013toc.htm .
Gentzen 's Natural Deduction
Aristotle formulated his syllogisms in antiquity , and William of Ockham studied logic in the middle ages .
But the discipline of modern logic began with Gottlob Frege 's Begriffschrift , written in 1879 when Frege was 31 .
Frege 's logic was already capable of expressing quite complex concepts , as illustrated by the excerpt from Frege 's work , shown in Figure 1 .
Once Frege got the ball rolling , logic grew by leaps and bounds , with contributions from Giuseppe Peano , Bertrand Russel , and Kurt Goedel , among many others .
Among Frege 's central contributions were the notion of deduction and the notion of function .
We can see examples of each in Figure 1 ; the sideways " T " towards the middle of the frame marks a deduced fact , and the symbol , repeated throughout , stands for a function .
Frege 's deductions eventually gave rise to Gentzen 's natural deduction , and Frege 's functions eventually led to Church 's lambda calculus .
Gerhard Gentzen introduced natural deduction in 1934 , when he was 25 .
A small proof written in Gentzen 's notation is shown in Figure 2 .
Many of the ideas are direct descendants of Frege 's work .
The sideways " T " symbol serves exactly the same purpose as the sideways " T " shape in Frege 's work , and the horizontal lines that structure Gentzen 's proof were used by Frege in just the same way .
Alonzo Church introduced lambda calculus in 1932 , when he was 29 ( see Alonzo Church , " The Calculi of Lambda Conversion , " Princeton University Press , 1941 ) .
Lambda calculus was intended as a new way to formulate logic .
That formulation turned out to be flawed , but from the start Church suspected that lambda calculus might have independent interest .
In that first paper he wrote , " There may , indeed , be other applications of the system than its use as a logic . "
Prophetic words !
By 1936 , Church had realized that lambda terms could be used to express every function that could ever be computed by a machine .
Independently , at about the same time , Turing wrote the famous paper on the machine that bears his name ( http://www.alanturing.net/).
It was quickly recognized that the two formulations were equivalent , and Turing came to Princeton to study with Church between 1936 and 1938 .
Shortly thereafter , Turing returned to Britain .
During the war , At Bletchley Park , he worked on machines -- - early proto- computers -- - designed to break enemy codes .
And within a decade , John von Neumann , who was at Princeton and familiar with the work of Church and Turing , wrote " First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC " ( June 1945 , Contract No. W-670 - ORD - 492 , Moore School of Electrical Engineering , University of Pennsylvania , reprinted in part in Origins of Digital Computers : Selected Papers , by Brian Randell , Springer - Verlag , 1982 ) , his famous note on the architecture of the stored - program computer .
Church reduced all calculation to the notion of substitution .
Typically , a mathematician might define a function by an equation .
If a function f is defined by the equation f( x ) =t , where t is some term involving x , then the application f( u ) yields the value t[ u / x ] , where t[u / x ] is the term that results by substituting u for each occurrence of x in t .
For example , if f( x ) =x X x , then f( 3) =3 X 3=9 .
Church provided an especially compact way of writing such functions .
Instead of saying " the function f where f( x ) =t , " he simply wrote lx.t .
In his notation , the example function is written lx.x X x .
A term of the form lx.t is called a " lambda expression . "
Church introduced a typed version of lambda calculus in 1940 .
His goal was to avoid paradoxes that beset other logics ( including Frege 's original logic , which fell prey to Russel 's paradox ) .
Just as lambda calculus had applications beyond what Church first intended , so too did types .
A small program written in Church 's typed lambda calculus is shown in Figure 3 .
If you ignore the red part of Figure 3 , what remains is identical to Figure 2 .
This is true not just for the proof and program shown :
It turns out that any proof in Gentzen 's natural deduction corresponds to a program in Church 's typed lambda calculus , and vice versa .
What is truly remarkable is that this correspondence was not uncovered until much later , thanks to work by the logicians Haskell Curry and W.A. Howard .
Curry outlined some of the key points in 1956 ( see http://haskell .org/bio.html ) , but Howard 's paper , setting out the correspondence in full , was not written until 1969 , and though widely influential , it was not actually published until 1980 .
( See Haskell Curry and Robert Feys , Combinatory Logic , Volume I , North - Holland , Amsterdam , 1958 , and W.A. Howard , " The Formulae - as - Types Notion of Construction , " in J.P. Seldin and J.R. Hindley , editors , To H.B. Curry : Essays on Combinatory Logic , Lambda Calculus and Formalism , Academic Press , London , 1980 , pages 479-490 . )
The living proof of the Curry - Howard correspondence is the appearance of other double - barrelled names in the literature .
Time and again , a logician motivated by logical concerns and a computer scientist motivated by practical concerns have discovered exactly the same type system , usually with the logician getting there first .
Most modern functional languages use the Hindley - Milner type system , discovered by the logician Roger Hindley in 1969 and rediscovered by the computer scientist Robin Milner in 1978 .
And much recent work on type - directed compilers is based on the Girard - Reynolds system , discovered by the logician Jean - Yves Girard in 1972 and rediscovered by the computer scientist John Reynolds in 1974 .
Church and Curry lived to see their abstract theories have an impact on practical programming languages .
They were guests of honor at the 1980 conference on Lisp and Functional Programming , both highly bemused by what had been done with their work .
Gentzen was not so fortunate .
Working in Prague during the disorder at the end of World War II , he was sent to prison on May 5th , 1945 .
Gentzen faced this calmly ; he confided to a friend that " he was really quite contented since now he had at last time to think about a consistency proof for analysis . "
He died in his cell , of malnutrition , on August 4 , 1945 .
The Impact of Logic
Church 's lambda calculus , both typed and untyped , had a profound impact on the development of programming languages .
The notion that functions may take functions as arguments and may return functions as results was particularly important .
In the 1960s , Christopher Strachey proposed this as a guiding principle for the design of programming languages , under the motto " functions as first - class citizens . "
Lisp used the keyword lambda to define functions , but its definition of a function differs subtly from that of lambda calculus .
Languages that took more direct inspiration from lambda calculus include :
Iswim ( Peter Landin , 1966 ; http://lucy .csc.uvic.ca/534/luswim.html ) .
Scheme , a dialect of Lisp which got lambda right ( Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman , 1975 ; http://www.schemers .org / ) .
right ( Guy Steele and Gerald Sussman , 1975 ; http://www.schemers .org / ) .
ML , short for " metalanguage " ( Gordon , Milner , and Wadsworth , 1979 ; see http:// www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/lcp/MLbook/general.html), later succeed by Standard ML .
Miranda ( David Turner , 1985 ; http:// www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~gmh//faq.html# miranda ) .
Haskell , named for Haskell Curry ( Hudak , Peyton Jones , Wadler , and others , 1987 ; see http://haskell.org/).
O'Caml , a French spinoff of ML ( Xavier Leroy and others , 1996 ; see http://pauillac.inria.fr:80/caml/).
Iswim and Scheme are untyped , but the others have type systems based on the Hindley - Milner and Girard - Reynolds systems .
Standard ML is noted for its exploration of module types , Haskell for its type classes , and O'Caml for its object - oriented types .
Standard ML , Haskell , and O'Caml are all continuing development , and innovation in their type systems is one of the principal directions of research .
Applications built on top of functional languages , and which themselves use type systems in innovative ways , include : Kleisli , a database language for biomedical data ( implemented in Standard ML ) ;
Ensemble , a library for building distributed applications and protocol stacks ( implemented in O'Caml ) ; Lolita , a natural language understanding system ( implemented in Haskell ) ; and Xduce , a language for processing XML ( implemented in O'Caml ) .
Functional programming and types have also had a significant impact on Java .
Guy Steele , one of the three principal designers of Java , got his start with Scheme .
John Rose , another Scheme programmer , introduced lambda terms into Java in the form of inner classes , where they are used to implement callbacks in the GUI and the event framework .
The security model of Java depends heavily on type safety , spurring much new work in this area , including type systems to enhance security .
And the next generation of Java may include generic types , based partly on the Girard - Reynolds type system ( see my article " GJ : A Generic Java , " Dr. Dobb's Journal , February 2000 ) .
Java and Jini provide some support for distributed computing , but it is clear that they are not the last word .
A whole new generation of distributed languages is currently under development , including Milner 's pi calculus ; Cardelli and Gordon 's Ambit ; Fournier , Gonthier , and others ' Join calculus ; and Lee and Necula 's proof - carrying code .
All of these languages draw heavily on the traditions of typed lambda calculus .
Theorem Provers
Hewlett - Packard 's Runway multiprocessor bus underlies the architecture of the HP 9000 line of servers and multiprocessors .
Hewlett - Packard applied the Higher Order Logic ( HOL ) theorem prover as part of an effort to verify that caching protocols in Runway did not deadlock .
This approach uncovered errors that had not been revealed by several months of simulation ( see http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/ wadler/realworld/hol.html ) .
The Defense Science and Technology Organization , a branch of the Australian Department of Defense , is applying the Isabelle theorem prover ( http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/hvg/isabelle/) to verify arming conditions for missile decoys .
The system was used to prove , for example , that the missile cannot be armed when the launch safety switch is not enabled .
As a side effect of constructing the proof , some potential errors in the code were spotted .
Both HOL and Isabelle are implemented in Standard ML .
Standard ML is a descendant of ML , the metalanguage of the groundbreaking LCF theorem prover , which is in turn an ancestor of both HOL and Isabelle .
This circle reflects the intertwined history of theorem provers and functional languages .
HOL was developed by Gordon , Melham , and others , with versions released in 1988 , 1990 , and 1998 .
Isabelle was developed by Paulson , Nipkow , and others , with versions released in 1993 , 1994 , 1998 , and 1999 .
ML/LCF exploited two central features of functional languages -- higher order functions and types .
A proof tactic is a function taking a goal formula to be proved and returning a list of subgoals paired with a justification .
A justification , in turn , is a function from proofs of the subgoals to a proof of the goal .
A tactical is a function that combines small tactics into larger tactics .
The type system was a great boon in managing the resulting nesting of functions that return functions that accept functions .
Furthermore , the type discipline ensured soundness , since the only way to create a value of type Theorem was by applying a given set of functions , each corresponding to an inference rule .
As noted , the type system Robin Milner devised for ML remains a cornerstone of work in functional languages .
ML / LCF was developed by Milner , Gordon , and Wadsworth , with the complete description published in 1979 .
HOL and Isabelle are just two of the many theorem provers that draw on the ideas developed in LCF , just as Standard ML is only one of the many languages that draw on the ideas developed in ML .
Among others , Coq is implemented in Caml , Veritas in Miranda , Yarrow in Haskell ( http://www.cs.kun.nl/~janz/ yarrow / ) , and ALF ( http://www.cs.belllabs.com/who/wadler/realworld/alf.html), Elf , and Lego in Standard ML again .
The March 1999 issue of the Journal of Functional Programming ( http://uk.cambridge.org/journals/JFP/) examined the interplay between functional languages and theorem provers .
Trust and Security
Trust is essential in computing .
Almost all of the code you run is not code that you yourself have written .
How can you know it will do what you intend to do , rather than , say , wipe your hard disk , or e-mail your credit - card numbers to a third party ?
The Internet has brought this problem into sharper focus , as it increases opportunities for downloading programs while it decreases opportunities to build trust via social interaction .
Computer viruses in programs hidden in e-mail documents have brought this problem to public attention , but the problem exists for any program you might run on your machine .
Further , not only do you have to trust the programmer not to be malicious , you also have to trust him or her not to violate the security policy by mistake .
Such mistakes are in fact quite common , as many who have suffered a machine crash can attest .
There are technical means available to complement the social means of building trust .
For instance , an operating system may allocate permission to read or write files to various accounts .
( UNIX and NT support this , Windows 98 does not . )
You can then arrange for an untrusted program to be given permission to read or write only a small selection of programs .
( Alas , even on systems that can easily support this , it is not always standard practice to do so . )
The policy describing which resources may be accessed is called a " security policy . "
The bedrock of any security policy is limiting the areas of computer memory that a program can read or write .
Once a program overwrites the kernel of the operating system , all bets are off .
Even more simply , many viruses or worms operate by overwriting a return location on the stack , which in turn is achieved by writing into an array with an index outside the array boundary .
Thus , types can be intimately tied to security .
For instance , if a program is passed the address of an array , the type system can ensure that the program always writes to addresses within the array boundary .
Strongly typed languages ( such as Java or Modula - 3 , http://www.research.digital.com/src/modula-3/html/home.html) guarantee such properties ; weakly typed languages such as C or C++ do not .
Java 's popularity as an Internet programming language is based in large part on the fact that its design addresses these security issues .
The foundation of this is that Java bytecodes are verified before they are run ; that is , the bytecodes form a typed programming language , and the verifier checks the types .
The simplest way to achieve security is to check each operation each time it is performed , but this can be expensive .
To reduce the cost , before running the program , you may wish to check once and for all that certain operations are guaranteed to be safe every time they are performed ; that is , you want to prove that certain operations always conform to your security policy , and that is exactly what a type system does .
Often , you use a combination of both approaches .
For example , when Java indexes an array , the top two slots on the stack contain an index and a pointer to the array .
The verifier guarantees that the slot that is supposed to point to an array really does point to an array ( a block of storage containing a length followed by the array contents ) , so there is no need to check this at run time .
However , the code does need to check at run time that the array index is bounded by the array length .
( A clever just - in - time compiler may be able to eliminate this check for some loops , such as when the array index is the same as the loop index and the loop index is bounded by the array length . )
Software Fault Isolation
Of course , Java is not the only game in town .
For some applications , you may want the added flexibility of supplying machine code rather than Java bytecodes .
One method is to simply trust that the code provided is safe , perhaps using cryptographic techniques to verify that the code is supplied by a known party .
When executing machine code , is there any way to supplement trust with tests ?
There is -- and the solutions span an alphabet of acronyms .
One is SFI , short for or Software Fault Isolation .
This inserts extra instructions into the machine code , to check that accesses will not exceed set bounds on the memory .
SFI introduces extra run -time overhead , and the security policies it implements are cruder than those imposed by a type system .
Typically , you can restrict a whole program to access data in a particular region of memory , but not restrict accesses to a particular array to be within bounds .
SFI was developed by Wahbe , Lucco , Anderson , and Graham at the University of California at Berkeley in 1993 ( see http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~gribble/osprelims/F95/ summaries/sfi.html ) .
Typed Assembly Language
Another is TAL , or Typed Assembly Language .
The type system developed for lambda calculus is flexible enough to be applied to a range of other styles of programming languages -- and , remarkably , it can even be extended to assembly language .
In Java , the bytecodes are annotated with types that are checked by the verifier before the code is run .
Similarly , in TAL the machine code is annotated with types that are checked by the type checker before the code is run .
The difference is that while Java bytecodes are especially designed for checking , in TAL the type system is overlayed on the machine code of the Intel x86 architecture .
( The TAL researchers display a variant of the familiar " Intel inside " logo modified to say " Types inside , " and their motto is " What do you want to type today ? " )
TAL was developed by Greg Morrisett and others at Cornell University in 1998 ( http://www.cs.cornell.edu/talc/).
Typed Intermediate Language
TAL is a refinement of TIL , or Typed Intermediate Language .
The TIL project exploited types as the basis for constructing an optimizing compiler for a functional language .
The typed functional language is translated to a lower level typed intermediate language , which is optimized and then compiled to machine code ( or , later , TAL ) .
Indeed , most compilers for functional languages now exploit types heavily , in a style similar to that used for TIL .
TIL was developed by Greg Morrisett and Bob Harper at Carnegie - Mellon University in 1995 ( http://www.cs.cornell.edu/home/jgm/tilt.html).
Both TAL and TIL take their inspiration from the Girard - Reynolds type system mentioned earlier , John Reynolds also being on the faculty at Carnegie - Mellon .
Proof Carrying Code
Finally , there is PCC , or Proof Carrying Code .
In TAL , as in all type systems , the types are , in effect , a proof that the program satisfies certain properties .
In PCC , instead of adding types to the machine code , one adds the proofs directly .
The disadvantage of this is that proofs are typically larger than types , and proof checking is slightly harder than type checking ; the advantage is that proofs can be more flexible than types .
PCC was developed by George Necula and Peter Lee at Carnegie - Mellon in 1996 ( Necula moved to Berkeley shortly thereafter ; see http://www-nt.cs.berkeley.edu/home/necula/public_html/pcc.html ) .
The first application of PCC was to packet filters .
A packet filter needs to be fast ( servers process a lot of packets ) and trusted ( it is part of the kernel ) .
A special - purpose solution is the Berkeley Packet Filter ( BPF ) , a small interpreted language for packet filters built into the kernel of Berkeley UNIX , which enforces the safety policy by run-time checks .
You can avoid the overhead of interpretation by using SFI ( which adds its own run-time checks ) or PCC ( where the proof is checked just once , and there is no run-time overhead ) .
The original PCC paper presented measurements showing that SFI was four to six times faster than BPF , and that PCC was another 25 percent faster than SFI .
A drawback of PCC is that it takes a while to check the proof , so SFI is faster than PCC if checking a tiny number of packets , but PCC is faster than SFI if checking more than a dozen packets ( the common case ) .
This work won the best paper award at OSDI ' 96 ( http://www.usenix .org/publications/library/proceedings / osdi96/index.html ) , the Symposium on Operating System Design and Implementation .
Back to Java
Another application of PCC is our old friend , Java .
Instead of transmitting bytecodes and using a just - in - time compiler , with the PCC Special J system you can transmit already compiled machine code together with a proof that the code satisfies all the properties that would normally be checked by the byte code verifier or at run time .
Some Java users resort to the native code interface , which gives no security guarantees but provides a way to execute machine code directly ; with Special J , you can execute machine code directly while still preserving the security guarantees .
Necula and Lee have founded a start - up , Cedilla Systems ( http:// www.cedillasystems.com/), to pursue commercial possibilities for PCC , and PCC is now patent pending .
One advantage of both TAL and PCC is that the trusted computing base is smaller .
Designing a secure system is hard -- a number of bugs have been spotted and corrected in the Java platform since it was first released .
If a platform for secure computing is simple and small , then it is less likely to contain errors .
In TAL , the only code that needs to be trusted is the type checker for assembly language , and in PCC the only code that needs to be trusted is that of the type checker .
In particular , the compiler that generates the code does not need to be trusted .
If the compiler contains an error , then it is likely to generate code that does not type check ( for TAL ) , or an incorrect proof ( for PCC ) .
Thus , TAL and PCC , as well as enhancing security , also aid in debugging the compiler .
In rare cases , it might be that the compiler generates code that does not do what was expected , but still type checks or has a correct proof .
Even in this case , the types or proof will guarantee that the code cannot violate the security policy .
For instance , the security policy might ensure that the code never indexes outside the bounds of a given array , but the code might still look at the wrong array index .
What happens if a malicious user changes the code ?
Then the type or proof will not match the code , and the program will not run .
What happens if a malicious user changes the code , and changes the types or proofs to match the new code ?
Then the types or proofs still guarantee that the new code cannot violate the security policy , even though the code may not behave as expected .
( There is not much difference here between a malicious user and an erroneous compiler . )
The flip side of this is that neither TAL nor PCC is a panacea .
You need to set the security policy in advance , and design the type or proof system to enforce that policy .
TAL and PCC have attracted a great deal of interest in the research community .
There is a biannual workshop devoted to typed compilers in the style of TIL , and there is ongoing research on PCC at Princeton , Purdue , and Yale , as well as Berkeley and Carnegie - Mellon .
Conclusion
Both TAL and PCC work in much the same way .
They were both designed by researchers in functional languages , and they depend heavily on the logics and type systems with roots that were traced in this paper .
As it happens , they were also initiated by researchers working in the same place , Carnegie - Mellon , at the same time , just a few years ago .
The similarities were recognized from the start , and research on each has reinforced the other .
As we 've seen , types and proofs are strikingly similar , and , in the right circumstances , can even be in precise correspondence .
With Gentzen and Curry it took 30 years for the underlying similarities to be spotted , with Girard and Reynolds the same idea popped up at nearly the same time for very different reasons .
So the only surprise with TAL and PCC is that the similarities were recognized from the start .
It is too early to say , but just as physics is underpinned by the work of Copernicus , Galileo , and Newton , one day computing may be underpinned by the work of Frege , Gentzen , and Church .

A light bulb appears over my head .
I finally get it .
For the democratic process to run properly it necessitates the voter to have some knowledge of what he is voting on .
For it to work properly it requires voters to cast their votes based on an educated opinion .
If you are going to vote on something like stem cell research you should at least know what it is , correct ?
Sadly , that is n’t how many American vote , as is obvious when during an election year people are talking about whether or not someone “ looks presidential ” and whether the person looks “ likeable ” .
Well the question is , how can Americans vote on such things as global warming , stem cell research , cloning and what have you when basic scientific fundamental concepts fly right over our heads .
" American adults in general do not understand what molecules are ( other than that they are really small ) .
Fewer than a third can identify DNA as a key to heredity .
Only about 10 percent know what radiation is .
One adult American in five thinks the Sun revolves around the Earth , an idea science had abandoned by the 17th century . "
Said Jon D. Miller , a political scientists who directs the Center for Biomedical Communications at the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago , he regularly surveys Americans for his clients which include the National Science Foundation on the public ’s knowledge and attitudes towards science in general .
I mean , lets be honest , if you do n’t know what a fucking cell is how can you understand what stem cell research is enough to vote on it ?
And according to this guy most Americans do n’t know what a cell is .
Then it hit me .
There is a reason why people are fighting so hard to get creationism taught in the public schools along side evolution as a scientific alternative .
Like I said , it hit me .
And it hit me hard .
Americans , on top of not having a clue what a cell is or what radiation is or even that the Earth revolves around the Sun are letting religious leaders dictate to them what to vote on issues that would take knowledge of basic scientific fundamentals , because I am assuming that they are assuming that since these religious leaders are supposedly moral and ethical “ authorities ” they should be qualified to figure out where we stand on these scientific issues , but who is to say that they even know these basic scientific concepts ?
What a dangerous misstep .
Fact :
Polls show that in general , people who adhere to fundamentalist views are not well educated .
Those things go hand in hand .
He says that every time he goes on the radio to talk about his findings he gets people from the listening area sending him cards in the mail saying that they will pray for him .
So I take it even though they do n’t understand what he is talking about when he refers to “ DNA ” they know that people that use big words like that are most likely going to hell .
A recent update on Facebook has rendered various bits of the site unusable in Konqueror , including the ‘ Add to friends ’ link .
Since this is a pretty crucial part of Facebook , I think I am justified in the overblown title to this post .
( For the interested , Konqueror reports this error : Error : http://static.ak.facebook.com/js/base.js?12:56066: ReferenceError : Ca n't find variable : eval )
Of course , I could file a bug report with them .
I ’m not going to bother , because I already did so for one bug , and the response I got back included this :
Please note that we only support the browsers listed below and strongly recommend that you update your browser to the newest version available .
The browsers listed were :
Internet Explorer 6.0 Internet Explorer 7.0 Safari Firefox 1.5 for PCs Firefox 1.5 for Macs Firefox 2.0 for PCs Firefox 2.0 for Macs
This kind of thing gets old pretty fast ( I had a similar problem with my online bank just the other day ) .
Konqueror is an absolutely great browser , and being told to get a newer browser is the last thing I want to hear .
Konqueror integrates brilliantly into the rest of my KDE system ( think KWallet for all my passwords , kioslaves for just about everything , … ) and I ’m not going to change for Facebook .
It is just such a pain in the neck that Konqueror has such a low market share ( I ca n’t wait for Konqueror to use WebKit ) .
At the end of the day , contrary to what many web developers and browser writers would like you to believe , quality and standards compliance mean nothing — Konqueror is easily as good as Firefox , but people do n’t design to standards , they design to what the major browsers can do .
De facto standards rule the roost , and the only thing that matters is market share .
The only reason I ’m bothering to post this is I figure I might actually generate more attention this way than filing a bug report .
From “ The Deep : The Extraordinary Creatures of the Abyss ” by Claire Nouvian / Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute
SUBMARINERS
Dumbo octopus from the Monterey Bay ’s floor .
Tuberculosis , food poisoning , cholera , pneumonia , strep throat and meningitis : these are just a few of the unsavory diseases caused by bacteria .
Hygiene — keeping both home and body clean — is one of the best ways to curb the spread of bacterial infections , but lately consumers are getting the message that washing with regular soap is insufficient .
Antibacterial products have never been so popular .
Body soaps , household cleaners , sponges , even mattresses and lip glosses are now packing bacteria - killing ingredients , and scientists question what place , if any , these chemicals have in the daily routines of healthy people .
Traditionally , people washed bacteria from their bodies and homes using soap and hot water , alcohol , chlorine bleach or hydrogen peroxide .
These substances act nonspecifically , meaning they wipe out almost every type of microbe in sight — fungi , bacteria and some viruses — rather than singling out a particular variety .
Soap works by loosening and lifting dirt , oil and microbes from surfaces so they can be easily rinsed away with water , whereas general cleaners such as alcohol inflict sweeping damage to cells by demolishing key structures , then evaporate .
" They do their job and are quickly dissipated into the environment , " explains microbiologist Stuart Levy of Tufts University School of Medicine .
Unlike these traditional cleaners , antibacterial products leave surface residues , creating conditions that may foster the development of resistant bacteria , Levy notes .
For example , after spraying and wiping an antibacterial cleaner over a kitchen counter , active chemicals linger behind and continue to kill bacteria , but not necessarily all of them .
When a bacterial population is placed under a stressor — such as an antibacterial chemical — a small subpopulation armed with special defense mechanisms can develop .
These lineages survive and reproduce as their weaker relatives perish .
" What does n't kill you makes you stronger " is the governing maxim here , as antibacterial chemicals select for bacteria that endure their presence .
As bacteria develop a tolerance for these compounds there is potential for also developing a tolerance for certain antibiotics .
This phenomenon , called cross-resistance , has already been demonstrated in several laboratory studies using triclosan , one of the most common chemicals found in antibacterial hand cleaners , dishwashing liquids and other wash products .
" Triclosan has a specific inhibitory target in bacteria similar to some antibiotics , " says epidemiologist Allison Aiello at the University of Michigan School of Public Health .
When bacteria are exposed to triclosan for long periods of time , genetic mutations can arise .
Some of these mutations endow the bacteria with resistance to isoniazid , an antibiotic used for treating tuberculosis , whereas other microbes can supercharge their efflux pumps — protein machines in the cell membrane that can spit out several types of antibiotics , Aiello explains .
These effects have been demonstrated only in the laboratory , not in households and other real world environments , but Aiello believes that the few household studies may not have been long enough .
" It 's very possible that the emergence of resistant species takes quite some time to occur ; the potential is there , " she says .
Apart from the potential emergence of drug - resistant bacteria in communities , scientists have other concerns about antibacterial compounds .
Both triclosan and its close chemical relative triclocarban ( also widely used as an antibacterial ) , are present in 60 percent of America 's streams and rivers , says environmental scientist Rolf Halden , co-founder of the Center for Water and Health at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health .
Both chemicals are efficiently removed from wastewater in treatment plants but end up getting sequestered in the municipal sludge , which is used as fertilizer for crops , thereby opening a potential pathway for contamination of the food we eat , Halden explains .
" We have to realize that the concentrations in agricultural soil are very high , " and this , " along with the presence of pathogens from sewage , could be a recipe for breeding antimicrobial resistance " in the environment , he says .
Triclosan has also been found in human breast milk , although not in concentrations considered dangerous to babies , as well as in human blood plasma .
There is no evidence showing that current concentrations of triclosan in the human body are harmful , but recent studies suggest that it acts as an endocrine disrupter in bullfrogs and rats .
Further , an expert panel convened by the Food and Drug Administration determined that there is insufficient evidence for a benefit from consumer products containing antibacterial additives over similar ones not containing them .
" What is this stuff doing in households when we have soaps ? " asks molecular biologist John Gustafson of New Mexico State University in Las Cruces .
These substances really belong in hospitals and clinics , not in the homes of healthy people , Gustafson says .
Of course , antibacterial products do have their place .
Millions of Americans suffer from weakened immune systems , including pregnant women and people with immunodeficiency diseases , points out Eugene Cole , an infectious disease specialist at Brigham Young University .
For these people , targeted use of antibacterial products , such as triclosan , may be appropriate in the home , he says .
In general , however , good , long - term hygiene means using regular soaps rather than new , antibacterial ones , experts say .
" The main way to keep from getting sick , " Gustafson says , " is to wash your hands three times a day and do n't touch mucous membranes . "
August 8 , 2007 , 10:46 am
Via the New York Times :
THE term " food miles "  " â how far food has traveled before you buy it " â has entered the enlightened lexicon .
Which should tell you all you need to know about the " enlightened . "
There are many good reasons for eating local " â freshness , purity ,
taste , community cohesion and preserving open space " â  but none of these
benefits compares to the much - touted claim that eating local reduces
fossil fuel consumption .
In this respect eating local joins recycling ,
biking to work and driving a hybrid as a realistic way that we can , as individuals , shrink our carbon footprint and be good stewards of the environment .
Actually , most recycling , with the exception of aluminum which takes tons of electricity to manufacture in the first place , does nothing to reduce our carbon footprint .
And I must say that I often enjoy buying from farmers markets and such .
But does " food miles " mean anything ?
And should we really care ?
Well , here is an early hint :
The ultimate reduction in food miles , the big winner on this enlightened metric , is subsistence farming .
Anyone ready to go there yet ?
These are the economics Ghandi promoted in India , and it set that country back generations .
Well , lets go back to economics 101 .
The reason we do not all grow our own food , make our own clothes , etc. is because the global division of labor allows food and clothing and everything else to be produced more efficiently by people who specialize and invest in those activities than by all of us alone in our homes .
So instead of each of us growing our own corn , in whatever quality soil we happen to have around our house , some guy in Iowa grows it for thousands of us , and because he specialized and grows a lot , he invests in equipment and knowledge to do it better every year .
The cost of fuel to move the corn or corn products to Phoenix from Iowa are trivial compared to the difference in efficiency that guy in Iowa has over me trying to grow corn in my back yard .
Back to the New York Times :
On its face , the connection between lowering food miles and decreasing greenhouse gas emissions is a no-brainer .
Sure , if you look at complex systems as single - variable linear equations .
Those of us who do n't immediately treated the food mile concept as suspect .
It turns out , for good reason :
It all depends on how you wield the carbon calculator .
Instead of
measuring a product 's carbon footprint through food miles alone , the
Lincoln University scientists expanded their equations to include other
energy - consuming aspects of production " â what economists call " factor
inputs and externalities "  " â like water use , harvesting techniques ,
fertilizer outlays , renewable energy applications , means of
transportation ( and the kind of fuel used ) , the amount of carbon
dioxide absorbed during photosynthesis , disposal of packaging , storage
procedures and dozens of other cultivation inputs .
Incorporating
these measurements into their assessments , scientists reached
surprising conclusions .
Most notably , they found that lamb raised on
New Zealand 's clover - choked pastures and shipped 11,000 miles by boat
to Britain produced 1,520 pounds of carbon dioxide emissions per ton
while British lamb produced 6,280 pounds of carbon dioxide per ton , in
part because poorer British pastures force farmers to use feed .
In
other words , it is four times more energy - efficient for Londoners to
buy lamb imported from the other side of the world than to buy it from
a producer in their backyard .
Similar figures were found for dairy
products and fruit .
All I can say is just how frightening it is that the paper of record could find this result " surprising . "
The price mechanism does a pretty good job of sorting this stuff out .
If fuel prices rise a lot , then agriculture might move more local , but probably not by much .
The economies to scale and location just dwarf the price of fuel .
By the way , one reason this food - mile thing is not going away , no matter how stupid it is , has to do with the history of the global warming movement .
Remember all those anti-globalization folks who rampaged in Seattle ?
Where did they all go ?
Well , they did not get sensible all of a sudden .
They joined the environmental movement .
One reason a core group of folks in the catastrophic man-made global warming camp react so poorly to any criticism of the science is that they need and want it to be true that man is causing catastrophic warming -- anti-corporate and anti-globalization activists jumped into the global warming environmental movement , seeing in it a vehicle to achieve their aims of rolling back economic growth , global trade , and capitalism in general .
Food miles appeals to their disdain for world trade , and global warming and carbon footprints are just a convenient excuse for trying to sell the concept to other people .
A little while back , I posted a similar finding in regards to packaging , that is worth repeating here for comparison .
Contrary to current wisdom , packaging can reduce total rubbish
produced .
The average household in the United States generates one
third
less trash each year than does the average household in Mexico ,
partly because packaging reduces breakage and food waste .
Turning a
live chicken into a meal creates food waste .
When chickens are
processed commercially , the waste goes into marketable products
( such as pet food ) , instead of into a landfill .
Commercial processing
of 1,000 chickens requires about 17 pounds of packaging , but it also
recycles at least 2,000 pounds of by - products .
More victories for the worldwide division of labor .
So has the NY Times seen the light and accepted the benefits of capitalism ?
Of course not .
With the New Zealand example in hand , the writer ... suggests we need more state action to compel similar situations .
Given these problems , would n't it make more sense to stop obsessing
over food miles and work to strengthen comparative geographical
advantages ?
And what if we did this while streamlining transportation
services according to fuel - efficient standards ?
Should n't we create
development incentives for regional nodes of food production that can
provide sustainable produce for the less sustainable parts of the
nation and the world as a whole ?
Might it be more logical to
conceptualize a hub - and - spoke system of food production and
distribution , with the hubs in a food system 's naturally fertile hot
spots and the spokes , which travel through the arid zones , connecting
them while using hybrid engines and alternative sources of energy ?
Does anyone even know what this crap means ?
You gotta love technocratic statists -- they just never give up .
Every one of them thinks they are smarter than the the sum of billions of individual minds working together of their own free will to create our current world production patterns .
Postscript :
There is one thing the government could do tomorrow to promote even more worldwide agricultural efficiency : Drop subsidies and protections on agriculture .
You would immediately get more of this kind of activity , for example with Latin America and the Caribbean supplying more / all of the US 's sugar and other parts of Asia providing more / all of Japan 's rice .
When I was still a member of what is probably best termed the British Jihadi Network , a series of semi-autonomous British Muslim terrorist groups linked by a single ideology , I remember how we used to laugh in celebration whenever people on TV proclaimed that the sole cause for Islamic acts of terror like 9/11 , the Madrid bombings and 7/7 was Western foreign policy .
By blaming the government for our actions , those who pushed the ' Blair 's bombs ' line did our propaganda work for us .
More important , they also helped to draw away any critical examination from the real engine of our violence : Islamic theology .
Friday 's attempt to cause mass destruction in London with strategically placed car bombs is so reminiscent of other recent British Islamic extremist plots that it is likely to have been carried out by my former peers .
And as with previous terror attacks , people are again articulating the line that violence carried out by Muslims is all to do with foreign policy .
For example , yesterday on Radio 4 's Today programme , the mayor of London , Ken Livingstone , said : ' What all our intelligence shows about the opinions of disaffected young Muslims is the main driving force is not Afghanistan , it is mainly Iraq . '
He then refused to acknowledge the role of Islamist ideology in terrorism and said that the Muslim Brotherhood and those who give a religious mandate to suicide bombings in Palestine were genuinely representative of Islam .
I left the BJN in February 2006 , but if I were still fighting for their cause , I 'd be laughing once again .
Mohammad Sidique Khan , the leader of the 7 July bombings , and I were both part of the BJN - I met him on two occasions - and though many British extremists are angered by the deaths of fellow Muslim across the world , what drove me and many of my peers to plot acts of extreme terror within Britain , our own homeland and abroad , was a sense that we were fighting for the creation of a revolutionary state that would eventually bring Islamic justice to the world .
How did this continuing violence come to be the means of promoting this ( flawed ) utopian goal ?
How do Islamic radicals justify such terror in the name of their religion ?
There is n't enough room to outline everything here , but the foundation of extremist reasoning rests upon a dualistic model of the world .
Many Muslims may or may not agree with secularism but at the moment , formal Islamic theology , unlike Christian theology , does not allow for the separation of state and religion .
There is no ' rendering unto Caesar ' in Islamic theology because state and religion are considered to be one and the same .
The centuries - old reasoning of Islamic jurists also extends to the world stage where the rules of interaction between Dar ul - Islam ( the Land of Islam ) and Dar ul - Kufr ( the Land of Unbelief ) have been set down to cover almost every matter of trade , peace and war .
What radicals and extremists do is to take these premises two steps further .
Their first step has been to reason that since there is no Islamic state in existence , the whole world must be Dar ul - Kufr .
Step two : since Islam must declare war on unbelief , they have declared war upon the whole world .
Many of my former peers , myself included , were taught by Pakistani and British radical preachers that this reclassification of the globe as a Land of War ( Dar ul - Harb ) allows any Muslim to destroy the sanctity of the five rights that every human is granted under Islam : life , wealth , land , mind and belief .
In Dar ul - Harb , anything goes , including the treachery and cowardice of attacking civilians .
This understanding of the global battlefield has been a source of friction for Muslims living in Britain .
For decades , radicals have been exploiting these tensions between Islamic theology and the modern secular state for their benefit , typically by starting debate with the question : ' Are you British or Muslim ? '
But the main reason why radicals have managed to increase their following is because most Islamic institutions in Britain just do n't want to talk about theology .
They refuse to broach the difficult and often complex topic of violence within Islam and instead repeat the mantra that Islam is peace , focus on Islam as personal , and hope that all of this debate will go away .
This has left the territory of ideas open for radicals to claim as their own .
I should know because , as a former extremist recruiter , every time mosque authorities banned us from their grounds , it felt like a moral and religious victory .
Outside Britain , there are those who try to reverse this two - step revisionism .
A handful of scholars from the Middle East has tried to put radicalism back in the box by saying that the rules of war devised by Islamic jurists were always conceived with the existence of an Islamic state in mind , a state which would supposedly regulate jihad in a responsible Islamic fashion .
In other words , individual Muslims do n't have the authority to go around declaring global war in the name of Islam .
But there is a more fundamental reasoning that has struck me and a number of other people who have recently left radical Islamic networks as a far more potent argument because it involves stepping out of this dogmatic paradigm and recognising the reality of the world : Muslims do n't actually live in the bipolar world of the Middle Ages any more .
The fact is that Muslims in Britain are citizens of this country .
We are no longer migrants in a Land of Unbelief .
For my generation , we were born here , raised here , schooled here , we work here and we 'll stay here .
But more than that , on a historically unprecedented scale , Muslims in Britain have been allowed to assert their religious identity through clothing , the construction of mosques , the building of cemeteries and equal rights in law .
However , it is n't enough for Muslims to say that because they feel at home in Britain they can simply ignore those passages of the Koran which instruct on killing unbelievers .
By refusing to challenge centuries - old theological arguments , the tensions between Islamic theology and the modern world grow larger every day .
It may be difficult to swallow but the reason why Abu Qatada - the Islamic scholar whom Palestinian militants recently called to be released in exchange for the kidnapped BBC journalist Alan Johnston - has a following is because he is extremely learned and his religious rulings are well argued .
His opinions , though I now thoroughly disagree with them , have validity within the broad canon of Islam .
Since leaving the BJN , many Muslims have accused me of being a traitor .
If I knew of any impending attack , then I would have no hesitation in going to the police , but I have not gone to the authorities , as some reports have suggested , and become an informer .
I believe that the issue of terrorism can be easily demystified if Muslims and non-Muslims start openly to discuss the ideas that fuel terrorism .
( The Muslim community in Britain must slap itself awake from this state of denial and realise there is no shame in admitting the extremism within our families , communities and worldwide co-religionists . )
However , demystification will not be achieved if the only bridges of engagement that are formed are between the BJN and the security services .
If our country is going to take on radicals and violent extremists , Muslim scholars must go back to the books and come forward with a refashioned set of rules and a revised understanding of the rights and responsibilities of Muslims whose homes and souls are firmly planted in what I 'd like to term the Land of Co-existence .
And when this new theological territory is opened up , Western Muslims will be able to liberate themselves from defunct models of the world , rewrite the rules of interaction and perhaps we will discover that the concept of killing in the name of Islam is no more than an anachronism .

In any case , that 's how my relationship with Planned Parenthood got started - big F.U. to the schmuck who wanted to impose his religious beliefs on my health and lifestyle .
Today , I had my annual exam , because I am one of those " happily promiscuous " women , and when I say I am D&D free , I want to be damn sure that it 's true .
For my own peace of mind , if not yours .
The legs - in - the - stirrups part went as smoothly as KY jelly on two fingers , nurse practioner making it as easy as one can expect under the circumstances .
She cheerfully declared that everything looks great and sat down to discuss the rest of my paperwork .
Have you ever seen those multi-page double - sided health history questionnaires they make you fill out ?
There are no less than three places where you have to indicate when was the last time you had sex ( er ... half hour before the appointment ?
I showered !
Really ! I did ! ) .
Then indicate what kind of sex you usually have ( check all that apply ) : oral , anal , vaginal .
Gender of your partners :
Male , female , both .
You get the idea .
I could see the nurse 's eyes get a little bigger as she read my answers .
Then she paused and asked me how many partners I had in the last 90 days .
I was caught off guard by an unexpected question , still half naked and draped with a flimsy paper towel .
I can't think well when my pants are off , which come to think of it , explains quite a bit about my life .
I stalled a bit , asking innocently if I missed that question somehow , while in the back of my mind I was panicking , desperately trying to remember every Dick I met in the last 90 days and how fucking long ago did I meet that guy from Minneapolis and god dammit I need to peruse NSA section a little less and for real how many did I fuck and do I have to count random blow jobs or having sex with an ex-boyfriend omg I can't tell her THAT number am I really such a slut she is going to call CDC and a swat team in biohazard suits will show up for pete 's sake !!!
I finally squeaked out a number .
She did a double take .
That many ?
In the last 90 days ?
I stammered and said " let 's not go there " .
Really , I know how fucked up I am , but I definitely did not check Yes on the question " do you have any concerns about sex you would like to discuss today ? " .
The nurse , without missing a beat , said " You know what , have as many partners as you want !
Just practice safe sex ! " and opened up a medicine cabinet .
" Here are a few for the road ! " she chirped , dumping rolls of condoms in a little goody bag with pamphlets she had sitting on the table next to my chart .
Shocked that someone can be so accepting , I stuttered and said " Just how many do you think I need ? ! "
She smiled and said " As many as it takes ! " I was speechless .
Thank you , nurse practioner .
You rock .
You were absolutely wonderful today .
You not only had an outstanding bedside manner that more than a few doctors should acquire but you also showed genuine kindness and understanding that is so rarely seen anywhere today , much less in medical profession .
Most of all , thank you for not judging and thank you for supporting me .
And as long as I am on the subject of support , I would like to remind everyone who bemoans that Planned Parenthood supports abortion , that they also provide reduced fee STI testing and condoms to those who otherwise would n't have either , curbing spread of diseases throughout general public .
For many , Planned Parenthood is their only access to affordable reproductive health care .
And if you think that your holier than though persona does n't have to worry about it , go through the nearest Craigslist NSA section and see how many married religious business professionals are out there looking for random play ( I should know , I slept with a few of them ) .
Then think about it again .
Then write a check to Planned Parenthood , along with a thank you note .
So long story short , tomorrow is a Friday night , I have about five dozen condoms here and a clean bill of health .
Anyone wants to go out for drinks ?
In Delaware County , Precinct Genoa I , researcher Stuart Wright viewed and recounted 3 separate bundles of ballots .
In the second bundle , there were 274 consecutive ballots for Bush .
In the third bundle there were 359 consecutive ballots for Bush .
Genoa
I was not one of the four precincts recounted as part of a required official recount , conducted on December 15 , 2004 .
In Delaware County , BOE officials told Phillips that after the votes were cast on Election Day , ballots were unloaded by a team of teenage volunteers including the Boy Scouts who carried them into the BOE building where they were then given to a " mentally retarded man " who scraped the chads off the punch card ballots .
Dr. Phillips estimates that the " mentally retarded man " would have had to scrape four or five ballots per second on election night in order to comply with the posting of the results at 12:40 am for the nearly 80,000 ballots cast there .
In Delaware County , Ross Township precinct , Philips has discovered that the BOE certified that 70 % of the ballots cast for C. Ellen Connally , an African - American woman from Cleveland running for the Ohio Supreme Court , were also counted for Bush .
The implausibility of this outcome in a white , Republican suburb is underscored by the fact that Connally trailed both Bush and Kerry very substantially throughout the rest of the state .
Some 60 % of the Township ’s ballots opposing a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage ( which passed substantially ) also were punched for Bush , an extremely implausible outcome widely branded as the “ Gays for Bush ” anomaly .
In Butler County , Phillips found that in Monroe City precinct 4CA , Bush received 52 consecutive votes near the start of voting , and then another run of 212 consecutive votes .
Also in Butler Country , in Ross Township Precinct 4JB , Philips found that Bush was awarded 547 votes to Kerry ’s 141 votes .
In separate sequences , Bush received 41 , 29 and 25 straight votes .
Neither 4CA nor 4JB were involved in the recount .
In Clermont County , which contributed significantly to Bush ’s margin of victory , researcher Dr. Ronald Baiman discovered a suspicious use of replacement ballots , that are meant to be issued only if a regular ballot is somehow spoiled by a voter .
In a random draw of one ballot from each of the 192 precincts , against huge odds , Baiman found a replacement ballot .
Baiman asked that the next ballot from the precinct be drawn and it , too , was a replacement ballot .
Continuing pulling ballots from that same precinct , Baiman witnessed 36 straight replacement ballots in a row , a virtual statistical impossibility .
Dr. Philips recorded only five spoiled ballots in this same precinct , raising the question of where the other 31 replacement ballots came from .
Also in Clermont County , Phillips found an opti-scan ballot with a white sticker over the Kerry - Edwards spot which would prevent the counter from recording a Kerry vote .
During the December 2004 recount in Clermont County , witnesses swore out official affidavits that they saw several ballots with stickers over the Kerry - Edwards spot .
The county prosecutor claimed there were “ less than one hundred ” of these , but was unable to explain why any stickers were there at all .
In Miami County on Monday , June 19 , 2006 , Director Steve Quillan handed co-author Bob Fitrakis a print - out of what he called " freely amended results . "
Director Quillen said " You guys were right " regarding the voter turnout in Concord South West Precinct , which had been listed as 98.55 % in the certified election results in 2004 .
Quillen also disavowed the alleged 94.3 % voter turnout certified election results in Concord South .
The Free Press has questioned those results , which would have meant that 679 out of 689 people successfully voted in Concord South West .
Using a computer databank of voter history , Quillen now admits that the voter turnout was just 82.1 % in Concord South West and 79.5 % in Concord , discrepancies of more than 15 % .
In Miami County , BOE Director Quillen also says Boy Scouts who volunteered to help on Election Day mistakenly took Concord South West ballots to the Concord East precinct .
Baiman found that the pollbooks and absentee ballots in Miami County “ have little to no relationship to the voters who voted in the county . ”
He also discovered that “ At least 8 % of precincts in Miami County have at least a 5 % discrepancy between the number of voters who voted and the official certified number of votes . ”
He also noted that there were two precincts that were off by more than 100 votes .
In Miami County , both the chair and the director of the BOE admitted that the recount matched the official vote count only because they did n't use the certified results , but simply counted the ballots in the precinct and ran them through the tabulator .
This is a valid tabulator test , but not a legally valid recount , since there 's no benchmark .
Also in Miami County , Diane L. Miley , the BOE ’s former Deputy Director said the Director allowed “ Republican friends ” and “ high school students to take ballots out to the polls on Election Day . ”
Miley also says ten or more Republicans were allowed into the BOE on the evening of Election Day , when votes were being counted , which she says made her “ incredibly uncomfortable . ”
But in going public with her assertions , Miley says she was " abandoned by the Dems . . . when I stood up [ to the Republicans ] at the Board of Elections . "
In Warren County , punch card ballots were also shifted from precinct to precinct , which again , due to ballot rotations , could have reversed the intent of thousands of voters .
Warren County was also key to the Bush margin of victory .
Its BOE declared an unexplained Homeland Security alert when the polls closed , and the county ’s ballots were diverted to an unauthorized warehouse , amidst a media blackout .
Bush emerged from the county with a very large margin over John Kerry .
Warren County also used a chad scraping crew .
Ohio election protection activists have won a landmark court battle to preserve the ballots from 2004 ’s disputed presidential election , and researchers studying those ballots continue to find new evidence that the election was , indeed , stolen .
Among other things , large numbers of consecutive votes in different precincts for George W. Bush make it appear ever more likely that the real winner in 2004 should have been John Kerry .
Meanwhile , indictments and prison terms are mounting among key players in that tainted contest .
In King Lincoln Bronzeville Neighborhood Association et. al. v. J. Kenneth
Blackwell , three community groups and five individuals have won a precedent - setting federal decision preserving the ballots from the 2004 election .
By federal law those ballots could have been destroyed en masse September 3 , twenty - two months after the November 2 , 2004 balloting .
Republican Secretary of State J. Kenneth
Blackwell gave every indication that he would order the records to be destroyed as soon as he could .
Admissions have already come from a few counties that illegally disposed of election - related materials well before the federal deadline .
By law , all such documents were to be preserved , under lock and key , right up to the federal deadline .
While running the 2004 election , Blackwell served as the very active co-chair of Ohio ’s Bush - Cheney campaign .
He is now the GOP nominee for governor , but is trailing substantially in all major polls behind Democratic Congressman Ted Strickland .
Blackwell was put on notice by Columbus Attorney Cliff Arnebeck and others who filed the King Lincoln suit contending illegal discrimination against black and young voters in 2004 .
The suit is based on widespread allegations involving mal - distribution of voting machines , dubious vote counts , race - based voter suppression and many other questionable occurrences before , during and after the 2004 balloting .
The suit asked Judge Algernon Marbley of the federal district court in Columbus to order Blackwell to force Ohio ’s 88 county boards of elections ( BOEs ) to preserve ballots and other election - related materials so the full extent of the allegations could be proven .
Under intense public pressure , Blackwell claimed he lacked the power to force the BOEs to do that .
Marbley responded by both ordering Blackwell to issue a blanket preservation edict , and by issuing a federal order to all Ohio ’s BOEs .
The ballots are thus to be protected at least until after the conclusion of the lawsuit , which could take years .
Ironically , the ballots from the disputed Florida 2000 presidential election have already been preserved in a state facility at Tallahassee .
In response to a petition drive spearheaded by historians and other academics , Governor Jeb Bush and Secretary of State Glenda Hood have gathered the ballots from Florida ’s counties in a temperature controlled archive , with access guaranteed to future generations of citizens and researchers .
( Hood succeeded Katherine Harris as Secretary of State .
Like Blackwell , Harris administered her state ’s election while also serving as a Bush - Cheney campaign co-chair .
She is now the GOP ’s Florida nominee for US Senate , and is also trailing badly in her race . ) A petition drive to establish a permanent repository for Ohio ’s 2004 election materials is being coordinated through the www.savetheballots.org web site .
The campaign ’s final outcome will probably hinge on who wins the governorship and secretary of state ’s office in November .
As of now , Ohio ’s election records are stored in 88 county warehouses that range widely in quality and security .
Some of the materials are vulnerable to rain and mold , and are sprawled haphazardly in cardboard boxes on dusty floors .
Federal law requires all such records be kept under double lock and key , but many clearly are not .
In at least one case , unmonitored maintenance workers have routine access to areas where ballots are stored .
County BOEs have been inconsistent in granting access .
But thus far , independent researchers such as Dr. Richard Hayes Philips and Dr. Ron Baiman have looked at about 50,000 ballots under the auspices of the Columbus Institute for Contemporary Journalism .
Some 5.6 million votes were cast in 2004 , but at least 800,000 were cast electronically , with no paper trail .
Bush ’s official margin was 118,775 .
So far , even the limited inspection of ballots has yielded astonishing results .
Three precincts in two counties have shown consecutive runs of Bush votes that qualify as “ virtual statistical impossibilities .
” Dubious outcomes and marginal behavior by Republican election officials has set off a trickle of legal prosecutions that may become a tidal wave if the preserved ballots continue to tell such tales , and if the assertions in the King Lincoln suit are proven out .
Three Cleveland - area poll workers have already been indicated for their actions in the 2004 election , all of which were perpetrated in ways that benefited the Bush vote count .
Meanwhile , the architect of the national imposition of electronic voting machines is on his way to jail .
Ohio Congressman Bob Ney , who authored the federal Help America Vote Act , pleaded guilty to federal corruption charges on September 15 .
Ney ’s HAVA legislation has been central to foisting electronic voting machines on much of the nation .
Central to Ney ’s conviction has been a flow of “ contributions ” from the manufacturers of those machines , which have yielded millions in profits for companies with deep Republican roots .
Ney will join Tom Noe , northern Ohio ’s “ Mr. Republican , ” a major GOP contributor and close cohort of Blackwell , Bush and Ohio Governor Robert Taft .
Noe served as chair of the Lucas County ( Toledo ) Board of Elections for many years .
His wife held the post in 2004 , and ultimately resigned in disgrace .
The entire Lucas County BOE was later fired by Blackwell .
Independent researchers have shown at least 7,000 Toledo citizens were stripped from the voter rolls , and have substantiated widespread allegations of vote theft and fraud .
Noe has been convicted of federal election funding violations and of mishandling millions of dollars in funds from the Ohio Bureau of Workers Compensation .
As researchers dive deeper into the vast body of ballots , huge legal battles loom over what they may and may not tell us about the true outcome of the 2004 presidential election .
But the tip of the iceberg indicates very serious problems , with a wide range of dubious vote counts and illegal recounts all favoring George W. Bush .
Diebold opti-scan machines alone are known to have cost Kerry at least 7,000 votes .
Thus far only a fraction of Ohio ’s 88 counties have received even passing scrutiny .
But the early indicators are that Ohio 2004 , which decided the presidency , may ultimately prove out to have been the dirtiest and most obviously stolen election in all U.S. history .

Member of audience scolds President Bush Angry man tells
Bush he is shamed and frightened by his leadership
CHARLOTTE , N.C. - President Bush is n't used to tongue - lashings , but he got a scolding Thursday from a North Carolina man who told the president that he should be ashamed of himself .
" While I listen to you talk about freedom , I see you assert your right to tap my telephone , to arrest me and hold me without charges , to try to preclude me from breathing clean air and drinking clean water , " real estate broker Harry Taylor told Bush at a town hall meeting .
" I have never felt more ashamed of nor more frightened by my leadership in Washington . "
The audience at Central Piedmont Community College booed , but Bush seemed to take the criticism in stride .
" I'm not your favorite guy , " the president said .
" What 's your question ? "
Taylor did n't have one , but he was n't finished .
" I feel like , despite your rhetoric , that compassion and common sense have been left far behind during your administration , " he told Bush .
" And I would hope , from time to time , that you have the humility and the grace to be ashamed of yourself . "
Bush defended his decision to authorize domestic eavesdropping in cases involving conversations between the United States and terrorist suspects or their associates in other countries .
" I 'm not going to apologize for what I did on the terrorist surveillance program .
Would I apologize for that ?
The answer is , absolutely not , " he said .
The extraordinary encounter highlighted just how far Bush has come from the days when he limited his appearances to carefully screened crowds .
Bush rarely took questions , and when he did , they were almost always fawning .
That 's changed amid growing unease with the war in Iraq .
Aides acknowledge that Bush 's new willingness to take tough questions is part of an effort to respond to war worries .
Bush and Taylor agreed on at least one thing .
" I really appreciate the courtesy of allowing me to speak what I 'm saying to you right now , " Taylor said near the conclusion of his reprimand .
" That is part of what this country 's about . "
" It is , " Bush agreed .
TiECON 2007 , the big technology conference in Santa Clara , Calif. , kicked off yesterday .
The buzz on the expo floor was about Silicon Valley gaming startup Elementeo and its precocious 13 - year old founder and chief executive , Anshul Samar .
“ We inject fun into education , ” the fast talking entrepreneur confidently proclaimed , touting his new fantasy role playing board game which he believes will change the way kids learn chemistry .
The conference featured keynote presentations from the likes of Marc Benioff ( Salesforce.com ) , Vinod Khosla ( Khosla Ventures ) and Tim O’Reilly ( Web 2.0 thinker ) , but the young Samar better represented the theme of this year ’s conference : “ The New Face of Entrepreneurship . ”
VentureBeat interviewed the diminutive executive at Elementeo ’s TiECON booth .
Like other charismatic Silicon Valley CEOs – think Steve Jobs , Larry Ellison or Marc Benioff – Mr. Samar exudes confidence , vision and a passion to change the world .
He ’s more articulate than many CEOs four times his age .
Click here to see VentureBeat ’s video of Mr. Samar delivering his elevator pitch .
Samar argues that textbooks are boring and kids would rather spend their time battling enemies , blowing things up with bombs , and yes , even giving their opponents lead poisoning .
So he created a fantasy role playing game that combines the rapturous teenage joys of competition and carnage with the exciting properties of the periodic table of chemical elements .
Here ’s how the game works :
You command an army of chemical elements , compounds and catalysts — represented within a 66 - card deck ( the fire and brimstone card at left is for “ Sulfur , ” for example ) .
Your opponent has his own deck with the same number of cards .
Your goal is to battle your competitor and reduce his IQ down to zero .
Pit your oxygen card against your opponent ’s iron card , for example , and you learn that you create rust .
Score one for oxygen .
Kind of like rock - paper - scissors , but with chemicals , dice and 66 impressively illustrated cards featuring monster - themed caricatures of chemicals .
Samar would kick my butt in this game .
At least I ’d probably learn more about chemistry in an hour of game play than I learned in my high school chemistry class a couple decades ago .
Like all good Silicon Valley entrepreneurs , Samar was taking orders at the show even though he wo n’t start shipping product until he either receives his first 2,500 orders , or he closes a decent round of funding , whichever comes first .
As of Saturday , he had already booked 450 pre-orders .
Elementeo ’s initial seed funding , which was used to design prototypes , came in the form of a $ 500 grant from the California Association for the Gifted .
Now Samar says that if he can get $ 100,000 in funding , it will help him achieve his goal of $ 1 million in first year revenues by the time he graduates eighth grade in June 2008 ( Unlike most Silicon Valley companies , Mr. Samar ’s fiscal year ends at the start of summer vacation ) .
So what happens once the company secures funding ?
Will Mr. Samar and his team follow in the footsteps of Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg who famously dropped out of school ( in this case , Lawson Middle School in Cupertino ) to pursue their ventures full time ?
Elementeo Executive Team Elementeo Executive Team
“ We ’ll still be in school , but we ’ll be richer , ” joked Mr. Samar ’s 13 - year - old team member Daniel Tan , his big smile exposing a mouthful of braces .
Samar ’s sister , who at age 11 serves as the company ’s vice president of sales , jokes that after they ’re rich , they can hire someone to do their homework .
“ Just kidding , ” she emphasizes .
The company is considering an online version of the game , as well as extending the brand to include games for biology , math , and other school subjects they ’ve identified that have “ boring textbooks . ”
TiECON 2007 , attended by 3,800 people , concludes today ( Saturday ) at the Santa Clara Convention Center .

A house was set ablaze in Moshav Tefahot Tuesday in a second attempt to dissuade a non-Jewish couple from moving in .
One of the rooms in the house was set on fire last Thursday , after the couple , Hayman and Christina Khatib , received threats by local residents folowing their decision to rent a home in the religious , Upper Galilee moshav .
Tiberias Police Chief Ilan Sardel said the attacks were of a racist nature due to the husband 's ethnicity .
At first , Tefahot residents received Christina with open arms when she arrived at the moshav to look for a home , assuming that she had just made aliyah .
After finding out that she was in fact a Christian from Romania , and her husband a Druze from the Galilee , residents began making threats .
“ The moment they found out he was Arab , the threats began , ” Christina said .
“ They informed me that they would n’t accept the young children to the kindergarten , and they would n’t allow them on the school bus .
“ One of the neighbors said rocks would be thrown at us , and another neighbor threatened to burn down the house with the children in it , ” Christina added .
The two violent attacks on the house prompted its landlord to cancel the contract she had signed with the Khatibs .
“ This is sheer racism .
The moshav wants to supervise which people live in it , ” the landlord said .
Moshav council chairman Yenon Sheleg dismissed the landlord ’s comments .
“ The landlord lives in Herzliya and wants to tell us who can enter our moshav .
There are religious residents in the moshav , and we want to live in tranquility .
I offered her to sell the house , but she wants to cause us problems , ” Sheleg said .
The Israel office of the Anti-Defamation League issued a statement condemning the incident .
" We condemn this hateful attack .
None of us can afford to be bystanders in the face of this kind of blatant bigotry and violence .
We commend the Tiberius police for taking it seriously and we anticipate a prompt and thorough investigation .
All communities must speak out and teach our children that hate against one is hate against all .
“ Perpetrators of hate crimes send a message to their victims – and everyone else who shares the victim 's characteristics – that minorities are not welcome or safe .
We strongly condemn this intolerance . ”
Nearly half ( 47 % ) of those questioned thought quality of life in Britain had declined , with 47 % blaming a " lack of respect " and 46 % citing crime .
The study of 1,006 adults was conducted for BBC One 's Six O'Clock News .
The results of the ICM poll will feature in a series of special reports called the Changing Face of Britain .
Ben Rich , deputy editor of the BBC's One and Six O'Clock News , said : " Many changes in the way we live creep up on us and do not get widely reported day to day .
" These reports will try to capture some of those . "
According to the poll , 27 % of those questioned think that Britain is neither better nor worse than 20 years ago .
But they also said the cost of living and immigration had had an impact on British life .
However , terrorism was cited as the main challenge facing the country by the 24 % of adults who think it is now a better place to live .
The series will feature reports from BBC correspondents in a number of locations around the country including Christchurch in Dorset , Cardiff , Glasgow , Birmingham and the Yorkshire Dales .
They will focus on the increasing numbers of elderly people staying in the workforce ; the effect of European immigration on existing ethnic minority communities ; city dwellers moving out to rural areas and the ambitions of young people in old industrial areas .
Hate crime and differences in legislation between parts of Britain will also be scrutinised .
Mark Burey , a BBC spokesman , said : " One report will look at Britain 's ageing population - the oldest population in the UK is in Christchurch , Dorset .
" In Birmingham we will look at immigration and the Asian communities ' response to the influx of Eastern Europeans following the enlargement of the EU .
" It is a snapshot of how things are changing in Britain detailing the subtle changes , along with the obvious ones . "
No Disclaimer
by Ninjalicious
On many urban exploration websites you 'll see a disclaimer to the effect of " this site is for entertainment purposes only , trespassing is bad , do not try this at home . "
It 's tempting for me to throw one of those disclaimers on this site too , just to be on the safe side , but I can't quite bring myself to do it .
I do n't think there is anything wrong with urban exploration , at least not the type described here and on 95 percent of the other sites on the Internet , and I can't pretend I do .
Genuine urban explorers never vandalize , steal or damage anything  we do n't even litter .
We 're in it for the thrill of discovery and a few nice pictures , and probably have more respect for and appreciation of our cities ' hidden spaces than most of the people who think we 're naughty .
We do n't harm the places we explore .
We love the places we explore .
While it 's true that some aspects of the hobby happen to be illegal , it 's important not to confuse the words " illegal " and " immoral " .
Laws against trespassing are like laws against being out after curfew : people get into trouble not for actually doing anything harmful , but simply because the powers that be are worried that they might .
Nor is exploration illegal simply because it 's dangerous .
The liability - conscious may disagree , but in my opinion , the hobby is no less of a personally assessed risk than smoking , driving or even riding a bike .
I find it sad that most people go through life oblivious to the countless  free  wonders around them .
Too many of us think the only things worth looking at in our cities and towns are those safe and sanitized attractions that require an admission fee .
It 's no wonder people feel unfulfilled as they shuffle through the maze of velvet ropes on their way out through the gift shop .
Urban explorers strive to actually earn their experiences , by making discoveries that allow them to get in on the secret workings of cities and structures , and to appreciate fantastic , obscure spaces that might otherwise go completely neglected .
When you step away from the TV and think about it , humans are naturally curious creatures .
We can't help but want to see the world around us ; we 're designed to explore and to play , and these instincts have n't disappeared just because most of us now live in large cities where parking lots have replaced common areas , malls have replaced city squares and the only public spaces that remain are a few grudgingly conceded parkettes .
This is n't the way things should be , of course , since cities should be for citizens , but urban explorers are n't generally fighters .
We do n't seek to smash the state , just to ignore its advice on a subject it does n't really know much about .
When we see a sign that says " Danger : Do Not Enter " , we understand that this is simply a shorthand way of saying " Leaving Protected Zone : Demonstrate Personal Accountability Beyond This Point " .
Urban exploration is free , fun and hurts no one .
It 's a thrilling , mind - expanding hobby that encourages our natural instincts to explore and play in our own environment .
It encourages people to create their own adventures , like when they were kids , instead of buying the pre-packaged kind .
And it nurtures a sense of wonder in the everyday spaces we inhabit or pass by that few local history books could ever hope to recreate .
I 've had some of the best moments of my life while exploring , and I can't recommend the hobby enough .
So , no disclaimer .
Not for your entertainment only .
Please do try this at home .
Researchers have long recognized that for learning and memory to take place , certain genes must be activated to alter neuron activity inside the brain .
Disruptions in normal gene expression within these neurons can lead to alarming consequences , such as seizures and epilepsy .
But identifying and cataloging all the genes involved in learning is a daunting task .
In the March 13 issue of BMC Neuroscience , Carnegie Mellon University scientists show how an innovative computational approach can provide a rapid way to identify the likely members of this long sought - after set of genes .
" The work could ultimately lead to the development of drugs to treat neurological disorders , " said Alison Barth , assistant professor of biological sciences and a member of the Center for the Neural Basis of Cognition ( CNBC ) .
" We also expect this work to provide a valuable platform for any investigator to understand how neurons change at the molecular level during learning and the formation of memory . "
As an animal learns and remembers , specific neurons inside its brain are activated .
The molecular changes associated with learning alter a neuron 's function — a process called plasticity .
For many years , neuroscientists have known that two factors , CREB and zif268 , activate genes involved in neuronal plasticity and learning .
CREB and zif268 are transcription factors , binding to a cluster of chemical bases represented in the genetic code as letters .
Once bound , they regulate genes that , in turn , dictate the assembly of other proteins that alter a neuron during memory and learning .
The Carnegie Mellon team created a step - by - step set of instructions for a computer to search the letters of code that make up the human genome to find just those genes activated by CREB and zif268 .
They specifically searched almost 20,000 genes to find those that CREB and zif268 bind to .
This work , conducted by Carnegie Mellon undergraduate Andreas Pfenning and supervised by Assistant Professor of Biological Sciences Russell Schwartz , was also performed on our distant mammalian relative , the mouse .
The computer program found hundreds of instances of genes that bind with either CREB or zif268 — and sometimes both — in human and mouse genomes .
A huge proportion of these genes had never been previously identified as CREB or zif268 targets .
" Finding a gene that appears to be activated in both the mouse and human strongly suggests that the gene is involved in memory and learning , " said Schwartz .
" Genes that behave similarly in distantly related animals are more likely to have an important function that has been retained over the course of evolution . "
The Carnegie Mellon team has made its findings available and searchable via an open source / online journal .
Previous studies on genes associated with neural plasticity have not focused on a complete set of genes , nor has the work been searchable , according to Barth .
But now , their online database of the plasticity transcriptome includes the gene name , symbol and reference number — data that are not usually all collected and made freely available .
" By using standard nomenclature and multiple identifiers , we 've made this a robust set of data for future research studies , " Schwartz added .

Plans to sequence our cousins are unveiled at anniversary meeting .
DNA from Neanderthals ( artist 's impression above ) is hard to find .
© T. MCHUGH / SPL
We have the modern human genome .
Now researchers are set to sequence the DNA of our extinct cousins : Neanderthal man .
The Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig , Germany , in collaboration with 454 Life Sciences Corporation , in Branford , Connecticut , today announce a plan to have a first draft of the Homo neanderthalensis genome within two years .
Comparing the result to modern human and other primate genomes should help to clarify the evolutionary relationship between humans and Neanderthals .
It may also illuminate the genetic changes that enabled humans to leave Africa and rapidly spread around the world around 100,000 years ago .
The chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes ) has already been sequenced and stands ready to be compared to Neanderthals ( see Chimp genome special ) .
The US National Human Genome Research Institute ( NHGRI ) has set a goal of sequencing the genome of at least one genome from each of the major positions along the evolutionary primate tree , including the rhesus macaque , orangutan , marmoset , northern white - cheeked gibbon and gorilla .
DNA hunt
The announcement comes as scientists gather in Bonn , Germany , this week to mark the 150th anniversary of the discovery of Neanderthal man — made in Germany 's Neander Valley .
During 21 - 26 July , experts will debate all aspects of Neanderthal life , from how they migrated across Europe to what effect climate may have had on their evolution .
They will also debate how to find more and better samples to work with ( see Palaeoanthropology : Decoding our cousins ) .
Getting clean genetic material out of such ancient bones is a challenging task .
The DNA of the bacteria and fungi that degrade a body after it dies tends to get mixed up with the DNA of the host .
And what hominin DNA does survive is usually broken up into small bits over time .
But there are ways to reduce these problems — including using skeletons left from cannibalistic societies , where no flesh was left on the bones for bacteria to eat .
" The dream to find Neanderthal DNA started in the early 1980s , " says Paabo .
" The problems with contamination were difficult ; I almost gave up at times .
But now we have new technologies and fossils free of contamination . "
The Leipzig team has already sequenced about one million base pairs of nuclear Neanderthal DNA from a 38,000 - year - old Croatian fossil .
That success was reported by Svante Pääbo , director of the Institute 's department of evolutionary genetics , at a meeting at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory in New York this May .
But they have a long way to go ; the entire genome is thought to be 3 billion letters long .
Mother 's own
In addition to Pääbo's work with the Croatian fossil , there have been successes with mitochondrial DNA — a portion of the genome that tends to be better preserved , but which makes up only a tiny fraction of the entire sequence and is passed down only through the female line .
Almost ten years ago , Pääbo succeeded in sequencing Neanderthal mitochondrial DNA .
More recently , such DNA was extracted from a 100,000 - year - old Neanderthal fossil found in Belgium .

But a map of the nuclear DNA will prove the real prize , revealing much more about the Neanderthal genetic make - up .
The project will extract the nuclear DNA from bones or teeth from both the first Neanderthal specimen ever discovered , and some additional bones found in Croatia .

Nothing makes a great movie suck like people quoting it day in and day out for months at a time .
It 's the go - to route used by individuals who are n't clever enough to come up with their own material , made worse by them thinking ( thanks to the select few that laughed at their referencing ) they 've suddenly become the most hilarious stand - up comedian since George Carlin .
Hey dipshit - they were laughing at the actual line , not your " sensational " joke - telling abilities .
In fact , you probably butchered it .
It was a sympathy laugh .
They all secretly hate you .
You 're considered one big fucking joke .
Even your psychiatrist thinks you should kill yourself .
Also , your wife / girlfriend / hand is cheating on you .
And all because you would n't stop quoting movies like these ... These three characters in " Office Space " are hilarious , but lets be honest , they 're also unlikable and annoying .
So just when you think there 's nothing more aggravating than people quoting the same fucking movie over and over , this movie becomes popular and now people are quoting three alternatively irritating characters from the same fucking movie over and over .
Meanwhile , I just stand back , stare aggressively , and clench my fist , waiting for the right moment to go postal and start shouting , " I 'll show you a fucking O - face , you cocksucking motherfucker ! ! "
I have learned the courtrooms are not fond of this response .
Yes , actually , I did expect the Spanish Inquisition .
Maybe if you did n't use the quote so goddamn much , I would n't have .
I 'm going to conduct a test to see whether or not you 're qualified to quote " Wedding Crashers " .
Part 1 : Do something that 's as funny as this ... Oh , too bad .
You already failed .
I think we can all agree , Samuel L. Jackson is the baddest motherfucker alive .
His ability of taking an otherwise mundane sentence and injecting it with a level of such ferocity is incredible .
And it 's all thanks to two little words .
If used incorrectly though , those two little words can be deadly to a movie buff 's ears .
They can turn something that was once completely badass into something that is , quite frankly , completely gay .
This gayness stems from an inability to capture the awesomeness that is Sam " the mutha fuckin ' man " Jackson .
Think you 're up to the task ?
You 're not .
Do n't even bother trying .
You 'll just fail at it like you do everything else in life .
Motherfucker .
You know how I know you 're gay ?
Because you wo n't stop quoting the same fucking joke over and over again .
" Great Poseidon 's trident of racial injustice ! " " By the ball sweat of Hades ' dank nether regions !
" " Holy man -dolphins of the Utah state tax commission !
" See ?
I can do it too .
It 's not that hard to come up with your own variations of Will Ferrell schtick .
You just have to be as random as possible and end almost everything with an exclamation point .
For example , if you were at a party and the keg ran out , you could say ( in the most Ferrell - like voice you have ) , " This alcoholic beverage has been a temptress to my taste buds , and now she 's abandoned me for her brother - in - law like the pirate whore she is .
Oh cruel irony !
Why must you encompass my love in such rainbow - shaped bowls of heartache and frustration ! ?
" Or , you could choose not to look like a jackass .
Just stop imitating him full stop .
He may be funny when he does it , but you 're not .
This one has been especially painful to endure , because finding ways to contribute " Yeah , baby ! " to a conversation is quite possibly the easiest thing in the world .
Thus , even the dumbest of the dumb were doing it .
The context did n't even matter .
If somebody said something you agreed with , a piss - poor imitation of Mike Myers would follow .
This was made even more popular because it allowed people to narrowly escape looking like a fool by changing an intelligent conversation into a " humorous " one .
For example ... Smart Person # 1 : I find the latest news of this injustice egregiously underdeveloped .
Smart Person # 2 : Quite right .
The esoteric nature of the crimes leads me to believe the government is creating a factually false pretense intended to elude the citizens .
Smart Person # 1 : How about you , what are your thoughts on the matter ?
You : ...uhh ...
Yeah , baby , yeah !
This of course would then lead to outbursts of laughter from everyone around you , as the topic would quickly change into a discussion about your amazing comical prowess and undeniable wit .
Success !( Note : I apologize on behalf on my poorly constructed " smart person " talk .
I just strung a bunch of words I looked up in the thesaurus together in hopes of forming something remotely intellectual - sounding .
I do n't even know if what I wrote makes any sense . )
Is your name Sacha Baron Cohen ?
No ?
THEN SHUT YOUR FUCKING MOUTH .
This movie could 've earned itself a nice little cult following among respectable movie buffs .
Instead , thanks to Hot Topic and douchebag teeny boppers , it will forever be known as the film that led to countless beatings on the playgrounds against bandwagon hopping bitches who wore " Vote for Pedro " shirts and would never shut the fuck up about num - chucks and tater tots .
If you were one of those kids , kindly fuck off .
You 're not allowed to read my blog anymore .
No seriously , go away .
It was funny when the trailer came out .
It was funny when the movie hit theaters .
It was still pretty funny about a month after that .
But for fuck 's sake , it 's been almost a year !
GIVE IT A REST ALREADY .
Honestly , this is MADNESS !(... Do n't you dare fucking say it ... I willyou . )

Toshikatsu Matsuoka was embroiled in a financial scandal
The 62 - year - old was found hanged in his Tokyo apartment hours before he was to face questions in parliament over his links to a political funding scandal .
Opposition MPs had been calling for his resignation over unexplained expenses .
PM Shinzo
Abe expressed regret over the news saying he was conscious of his " responsibility as prime minister , and as the one who appointed him " .
" The effects on the cabinet will be great , " Mr Abe added as he went to attend a wake for the deceased minister late on Monday .
Mr Matsuoka was found unconscious in his flat around lunchtime on Monday .
Efforts to resuscitate him at hospital failed .
Police said he had hanged himself , but refused to comment on reports in the Japanese press that he had left a number of suicide notes in his apartment .
It is the first time a Japanese cabinet minister has killed himself since World War II , when the army minister committed suicide on news of Japan 's surrender .
Funding questions
Mr Matsuoka was embroiled in two political scandals , though he denied any wrong - doing .
He had allegedly claimed more than 28 m yen ( $ 236,600 ; £ 118,300 ) in utility fees at his parliamentary office , where utility costs are free .
It was also alleged that he had received electoral campaign donations from a businessman linked to a bid-rigging scandal .
Mr Abe had vigorously defended his minister , often against the advice of some within his own party , saying he had fulfilled his legal responsibilities .
The BBC's Chris Hogg in Tokyo says Mr Matsuoka 's death is another blow for Mr Abe 's government .
Even before news of Mr Matsuoka 's death emerged , opinion polls published on Monday suggested support for Mr Abe 's administration was already at the lowest point since he took office eight months ago .
It is recorded that President John Quincy Adams once observed to Chief Justice John Marshall that " law logic , " as he phrased it , is merely " an artificial system of reasoning , exclusively used in the courts , but good for nothing anywhere else . "
In the same era Charles Dickens had one of his more insightful characters , a certain Mr. Bumble , also reflect on the logic of the law and its not infrequently unfathomable assumptions :
" If the law supposes that , the law is a ass -- a idiot . "
The initial decision in the case of ACLU v. NSA may not have been affirmed last week , but the wisdom of John Q. and Mr. Bumble was .
In the matter of Mr. Bush 's stupendously illegal wiretapping program , " The majority in a three - judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit , in Cincinnati , ruled on a narrow ground , saying the plaintiffs , including lawyers and journalists , could not show injury direct and concrete enough to allow them to have standing to sue . "
And it may be an insurmountable hurdle for the plaintiffs ever to show direct and concrete injury to allow them to have standing to sue , because , as one the concurring appellate judges blithely put it , " the plaintiffs are ultimately prevented from establishing standing because of the state secrets privilege . "
That little legal gem " requires courts to limit or dismiss cases when allowing them to proceed would disclose information harmful to national security . "
Hence if some pea brain of an autocratic president patently violates his constitutional oath by trampling on your constitutional rights , and you in fact can prove it , you in fact can't prove it , because you can't " provide evidence that [ you ] are personally subject " to the patently unconstitutional violation , because the violator is permitted to claim that your proving it would be harmful to national security , which he happens to be dismantling by trampling on your First and Fourth Amendment rights , which is absurdly illegal , which you can prove , which is why you sued in the first place , but the president 's illegality against you is protected by his greater illegality against the nation .
Got it ?
Naturally the White House was delighted by the ruling .
Its deputy press secretary , Tony Fratto , issued a statement : " We have always believed that the district courtâ€™s decision declaring the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional was wrongly decided .
The court of appeals properly determined that the plaintiffs had failed to show their claims were entitled to review in federal court . "
This is the same deputy press secretary who , earlier this week , dismissed yet another Republican senator 's misgivings about the Iraq war by saying , " We would counsel a little bit of patience . "
Patience ?
What kind of swinishly bad joke is that ?
And now Mr. Fratto beams over his boss ' criminality getting tossed .
Allow me to counsel you a little bit , Mr. Deputy Press Secretary .
And allow me to do it in language to which this site is unaccustomed , yet is employed by no less than that inestimable personage of our vice president in the course of his Senate - floor statecraft -- and I quote : " Go f*** yourself . "
Sometimes " direct and concrete " advice is the best .

QM -SYSTEM NACH DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 / MPA NRW
ÜBERSETZUNGEN NACH DER NORM DIN EN ISO 17100:2015
Die Begriffe Übersetzungsbüro bzw .
Übersetzer oder Übersetzungen sind alltäglich und werden von Jedermann benutzt .
Was steckt aber heute hinter diesen Begriffen ?
Ist ein Übersetzer wirklich ein „ Einzelkämpfer “ , der mit einem Computer und ein paar Wörterbüchern ausgestattet in seiner einsamen Kammer seiner Arbeit nachgeht und ab und zu mal den einen oder anderen Fachbegriff nachschlägt ?
Ist ein Übersetzungsbüro nur eine Gruppe , die aus solchen Übersetzern besteht ?
Ja , das gibt es auch .
Die Assoziationen , die diese Begriffe auslösen , dürften aber im Allgemeinen kaum dem entsprechen , was der moderne Übersetzungsdienstleister darstellt .
Der Beruf des Übersetzers ist heute viel komplizierter .
Die qualifizierte Tätigkeit von Übersetzern und Übersetzungsbüros ist heute nicht zuletzt durch Qualitätsnormen , wie z.B. DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 und DIN EN ISO 17100:2015 geregelt .
Die erstgenannte Norm regelt generell Aspekte der Qualität aller Sparten während die letzte speziell Aspekte umfasst , die das Übersetzen bzw .
Übersetzungen betreffen .
Die Norm DIN EN ISO 17100:2015 benutzt nicht den Begriff Übersetzungsbüro , sondern Übersetzungsdienstleister bzw .
TSP ( Translation Service Provider ) und definiert ihn wie folgt : „ Sprachdienstleister … , der professionelle Übersetzungsdienstleistungen … bereitstellt “ .
Die Norm legt die Anforderungen fest , die die qualitativ hochwertigen Übersetzungsdienstleistungen erfordern und definiert sie .
Sie beschreibt sowohl den Übersetzungsprozess als auch Aspekte , die damit zusammenhängen , wie z .
B. Leitung von Übersetzungsprojekten , administrative Tätigkeiten , technische Aspekte der Projektvorbereitung , sprachliche Spezifikation , Kontrolle , Revision , Korrekturlesen , fachliche Prüfung , Mehrwertdienstleistungen , Verifizierung und Freigabe , etc .
Sie definiert sowohl die gängigen als auch die weniger bekannten Begriffe wie z.B. Projektmanagement , Locale , Textsortenkonvention , Sprachregister , fachliche Prüfung , zielsprachlicher Inhalt , Projektregistrierung , Projektzuweisung , Stilrichtlinien , Analyse des ausgangssprachlichen Inhalts , übersetzerische Kompetenz , sprachliche und textliche Kompetenz , Kompetenz beim Recherchieren , kulturelle Kompetenz , technische Kompetenz , Sachgebietskompetenz , Terminologie etc .
DIN EN ISO 17100:2015 sieht eine Konformitätsbewertung und Zertifizierung vor .
Interlingua , die anfänglich schwerpunktmäßig für Unternehmen in Hagen , Lüdenscheid , Bochum , Essen , Köln , Düsseldorf tätig war , erstellt heute als ein zertifiziertes Übersetzungsbüro bereits im zweiten Jahrzehnt in ganz Deutschland qualifizierte Übersetzungen nach den Normen DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 und DIN EN ISO 17100:2015 .
Die Zertifizierung nach der aktuellen Norm DIN EN ISO 17100:2015 Übersetzungsdienstleistungen - Anforderungen an Übersetzungsdienstleistungen erfolgte am 08.03.2017 , nach DIN EN ISO 9001:2015 am 25.01.2018 .
Einige Erläuterungen zur Registrierung
Zertifizierung nach DIN EN ISO 9001 : 2015 erfolgt durch eine weltweit anerkannte Akkreditierungsstelle auf der Grundlage des Nachweises eines zu diesem Zweck entwickelten , geprüften und zugelassenen Qualitäts - Management - Systems über die Erfüllung aller Normanforderungen .

Mit der Zertifizierung verpflichtet sich das Unternehmen zur Einhaltung einer Qualitätspolitik , die die Entwicklung , Aufrechterhaltung und ständige Verbesserung eines wirksamen und effizienten Qualitätsmanagementsystems umfasst .

Home Gilad Bracha on tuples Java was actually designed to have tuples from the start , but they never quite got in .
At one point , I tried to add a tuple - like construct as part of JSR - 65 .
We wanted to extend array initializers to full blown expressions .
Eventually , that effort got quashed ; I didnâ€™t really resist , since the extension was painful , as such things always are in Java .
We should have just done straight tuples as a separate construct - but at the time , that was frowned upon too .
Not surprisingly , Gilad thinks that tuples are great .

During his January 18 , 2006 testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee , Alberto Gonzales said this :
GONZALES : I would never , ever make a change in a United States attorney position for political reasons or if it would , in any way , jeopardize an ongoing serious investigation .
I just would not do it .
Download Download
When asked on Meet the Press this morning if he " had any evidence that a U.S. attorney was removed and that removal jeopardized an ongoing investigation , " Senator Schumer said he does and that the evidence is " becoming more and more overwhelming . "
This is why the prosecutor purge is a genuine scandal .
Not only is there clear evidence that the firings were unprecedented and purely politically - motivated , but Alberto Gonzales lied about it under oath and the White House keeps changing it 's story .
What conclusion can we draw from these lies and revisionisms other than they have something to hide ?
Namely , that these eight prosecutors were selectively fired because they did not sufficiently politicize their offices and succumb to pressure to do so , only later to be fired for " performance - related " reasons despite receiving exemplary evaluations .
Transcript below the fold ...
MSNBC :
SEN .
SCHUMER : [ B]ut , in these instances , the evidence is becoming more and more overwhelming that certain U.S. attorneys , and only certain ones , not all of them , but certain U.S. attorneys were fired because either they would n't prosecute a case that was politically advantageous to the White House or they were prosecuting a case that was disadvantageous to the White House .
Every legal commentator , left , right , center , says you can't do that , that 's the one thing you can't do .
MR. RUSSERT : Well , let 's be specific about this because I want to show you what the attorney general said in January testifying before your committee .
Let 's watch Alberto Gonzales .
( Videotape , January 18 , 2007 )
MR. ALBERTO GONZALES : I would never , ever make a change in a United States attorney position for political reasons or if it would , in any way , jeopardize an ongoing serious investigation .
I just would not do it .
( End videotape )
MR. RUSSERT : Do you have any evidence that a U.S. attorney was removed and that removal jeopardized an ongoing investigation ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : We do have evidence .
In fact , four of the U.S. attorneys who were fired believe that played a role in their removal .
Remember , these folks were called up all of a sudden on December 7th .
They thought they were doing , doing a good job .
They said , " You 're not doing - - you 're fired . "
" Why ? " " We ca n't tell you . "
Then they say -- there 's a little pressure .
They say they were n't doing their job right .
We get hold of the evaluations done by their peers , the judges , everyone in their district , they all get outstanding ratings .
And then it comes out that in four of these instances , they were asked to pursue cases , individual cases , not a general policy , they were asked to pursue individual cases that they thought they should n't or they were perhaps pressured to stop .
So , yes , there is evidence there in the -- in the U.S. attorney 's mind .
But , Tim , we do n't have proof yet , conclusive , beyond a reasonable doubt proof .
That 's why we have to go forward with the investigation .
MR. RUSSERT : But this is a very serious charge , Senator .
Let me show you a map of the United States and where these U.S. attorneys come from .
There you 'll see up in Michigan and then we have them in New Mexico , Nevada , Arizona , Arkansas , Washington state and two in California .
Where specifically did a U.S. attorney stop investigating or was a criminal justice case interrupted because of one of their removals ?
SEN .
SCHUMER : The most notorious is the Southern District of California , San Diego .
Ms. Lam , the U.S. attorney , had already brought about the conviction of Duke Cunningham .
It came out in the newspapers that she was continuing to pursue that investigation and it might lead to others , legislative and others .
And in the middle of this investigation , she was fired .
So I asked the deputy attorney general , " Why was she fired ? "
He said , " Well , she was n't doing enough immigration re-entry cases . "
I said , " Really ? "
She -- he said , did you tell - - I asked him , " Did you tell her ? "
She said yes .
I said , " Well , did she improve ? "
This was back in the summer .
" Did she improve ? "
He said , " I have no idea . "
Well , gee whiz , if you 're firing someone in the middle of the most heated political investigation in America , do n't you think you ought to have a reason and know the reason ?
As all software developers know , nine women can’t have a baby in a month .
Or in Fred Brooks ’s more elegant phrasing : “ The bearing of a child takes nine months , no matter how many women are assigned . ”
( The Mythical Man Month , p. 17 ) The point , of course , is that some tasks are , as Brooks would say , “ sequentially constrained ” .
They ’re going to take a certain amount of time no matter what — the time ca n’t be reduced by having more people work on them .
On the other hand , is it actually the case that one woman can have a baby in nine months ?
Suppose we have just been put in charge of Project New Baby that must produce a brand new baby in nine months .
How should we staff the project .
Easy enough — nine women can’t have a baby in a month , right ?
No point in overstaffing so we ’ve just got to find a couple , make sure they ’re both fertile and interested in having a kid , and we ’re good to go .
But wait a sec’ , what ’s the chance they ’ll miss our nine month deadline by more than a month ?
Pretty high , it turns out .
Typically a couple trying to get pregnant has about a 16 % chance in any given month .
Once they ’ve conceived , there ’s , sadly , about a 15 - 20 % chance of miscarriage , usually within the first three months .
So the chance our couple will produce a baby nine months from now is only .16 × .85 or 13.6 % .
If we wanted to we could compute the average time we should expect it to take for one couple to have a baby , using math similar to that in an earlier post .
But suppose the deadline is hard — we really , really need to finish Project New Baby in nine months — is there anything we can do ?
Sure .
Throw bodies at it .
While a single couple has a 86.4 % chance of missing our deadline , if we had two couples , the chance that they ’d both miss it is only .8642 or about 74.6 % .
With three couples , the chance of blowing it is down to 64.4 % .
To figure out how many couples we need to have a P chance of hitting our deadline , just plug P into this formula :
Of course , this could get expensive if we need to be really certain of hitting that deadline — to have a 90 % chance of hitting it we ’d need sixteen couples .
But depending on how important Project New Baby and it ’s deadline are , it might be worth it .
So what in software is like making babies ?
Let ’s take a look at how Brooks himself tied making babies to making software :
The bearing of a child takes nine months , no matter how many women are assigned .
Many software tasks have this characteristic because of the sequential nature of debugging .
( p. 17 )
Unfortunately , I have n’t been able to find anywhere where he explains what he means by “ the sequential nature of debugging ” but I can see how debugging is like having a baby .
And not that they both can be incredibly painful and that you have a great feeling of relief when you ’re done .
The similarity that I see is that the time it takes to find a bug has a large random component , like trying to conceive a child .
Basically when you ’re looking for a bug , there ’s some probability p that you ’ll find the bug for each unit of time that you spend looking , just like a couple has a 16 % chance of getting pregnant for each month they spend trying .
If you ’re a skillful debugger and know your code really well p will be higher but there ’s always a random element — if you go down the wrong path it can take you a while to realize it and all that time is lost whereas if you had tried a different path first , you might have found the bug right away .
This is why it ’s almost useless to try to estimate how long it will take to find a bug .
You could find it in the next five minutes or five weeks from now .
Once you find the bug of course you also have to fix it but that tends to be less random — unlike a pregnancy , which always lasts about nine months after conception , different bugs will require more or less work to fix , but once you ’ve found it you can usually characterize how big a job it ’ll be .
And for many , if not most , bugs finding them is the hard part — once you ’ve well and truly tracked them down , the fix is often trivial .
All of which suggests we can use the same technique to speeding up debugging as we did on Project New Baby — throw bodies at it .
Suppose we ’re ten days from the end of a release and there ’s one last serious bug to be tracked down .
Suppose my chance of finding it is 10 % per day .
The chance that I wo n’t find it in the next ten days is ( 1 − .1) 10 or about 35 % .
But if there ’s someone else who can also look for it — say a pair programming partner — who also has a 10 % chance of finding it per day , and we both work at it separately .
Then the chance that the bug will remain at large by the end of the release drops to 12 % .
If we can throw even more developers at it , then the chances of the bug escaping drop even more : 4 % chance with three developers , 1 % with four , 0.5 % with five .
Obviously , to be able to take advantage of this strategy requires having multiple developers with enough familiarity with the code to be able to pitch in .
Which seems to me a strong argument for practices such as pair programming and collective code ownership .
An interesting side question is whether , if you do have developers to throw at debugging in this way , it is better for them to work independently or should they pair up for the debugging on the grounds that two heads are better than one ?

This article has been superceded by one on my A Few Things Illconsidered Science Blogs location .
It remains here only for posterity , comments are turned off .
Please bookmark , visit and comment at the new How to Talk to a Global Warming Sceptic page .
Thanks to all who have commented and otherwise participated in this web resource .
I have spent about 18 months now rather obsessed with the controversy over Global Warming .
Firstly , as a matter of disclosure , IANACS ( I Am Not A Climate Scientist ) but rather an intelligent layman who is concerned about an issue with ramifications for all of us .
That said , I have read and discussed and enquired about a great deal of the scientific material that is out there and quite easily accessible .
The scientific case is actually not that difficult to follow even if you lack the specific and highly technical knowledge required to create it .
One thing I have noticed over these months is that there are a very limited number of objections or attacks on what is really very sound and well resolved science but they come up over and over again on sci.environment , alt.global - warming and the blogs I visit either regularily or occasionally .
I think this is an important debate and I want to help fight the good fight .
Now there are already a few very good FAQ's out there about the science , so I do n't feel the need to create yet another .
Rather what I would like to do is provide a layman 's guide to defending against the assorted specious attacks that are out there , both by pointing out the basic logical fallacies they are based on and providing some appropriate reference material to avoid the typical " is too , is not " exchanges these things frequently devolve into .
Nothing like a nice link to an authoritative resource to refute the factually incorrect pontifications .
Nothing like a calmly presented and solidly logical rebuttal to put the scaliwags in their place !
I invite suggestions for other Guide topics and any and all scientific corrections or clarifications .
Any advice I do take up , I reserve the right to delete from the comments just to keep a coherent page .
So without further ado here are links to the best responses I can think of for the following climate sceptic arguments , please feel free to refer to , paraphrase or quote as desired : ( View a list of all topics by Category AGW theory is not even scientific because you can not do experiments and make predictions .

Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee , Senator Patrick Leahy , ( D - VT ) was on " Meet The Press " this morning to discuss the ongoing DOJ and White House scandals .
and clearly states that if George Bush and Dick Cheney continue to withhold requested documents and ignore the subpoenas they have been issued , he will hold a vote to hold them in contempt of Congress .
If the Democrats are paying any attention to their miserable poll numbers and the blogs , they will see that America is clamoring for them to stand up to our out of control Executive Branch and force them to comply with the law .

Creative consumers have found plenty of ways to get some personal attention from faceless corporations .
No longer content to sit back and abide by the whims of fate ( or customer service ) , empowered consumers have been on a rampage this month ; let 's take a look .
First up is California 's Dennis Sheehan , who received a Gateway desktop computer with a monitor malfunction .
Because the monitor did not properly display graphics , Sheehan says that he was never presented with Gateway 's onscreen EULA that shows up on first boot .
That agreement says customer problems wo n't be handled by the court system but by arbitration .
Sheehan , who wanted no part of arbitrating , took the matter to a local small claims court — no lawyers allowed .
Sheehan convinced the judge that he had not accepted Gateway 's agreement , even though Gateway insisted that a paper version also came in the box .
The case is a murky one —
Gateway claims to have sent Sheehan an entirely new computer which he denies receiving — but Sheehan seems pleased to have at least gotten Gateway 's attention .
Linden Lab , the company behind Second Life , also found itself on the losing end of an arbitration battle when a judge ruled that the company could not enforce the arbitration portion of its " clickwrap " agreement .
Cases like these could well change the way that tech companies try to impose arbitration on consumers ; the EULA " arbitration only " clause is a popular choice but may be unenforceable .
A New Jersey resident also used small claims court to solve his own computer problem .
Pat Dori sued
Dell after the company lost his laptop , which had been sent in for repairs .
But here 's the twist : instead of serving the papers to Dell 's corporate headquarters , Dori had them served to a local Dell mall kiosk .
The predictable upshot was that when Dori showed up to court , he was unopposed .
Being unopposed , he won a default judgment against Dell .
The company , which initially planned to appeal , has now agreed to just cut its losses and move on .
For those unwilling or uninterested in the hassle of filing a lawsuit ( and in contributing to the culture of litigation here in the US ) , calling the CEO is another popular option .
The Consumerist has , among many recent stories on the topic , just published one person 's account of going straight to the top .
A call to the DirecTV CEO 's office got a problem taken care of far more effectively than calls to tech support ever had .
Had your own tech problems solved in a creative way ?

Whether you are in the middle of your college search , in college , or graduated from college , mascots are a big deal .
They should n’t be , but they are .
Some colleges boast powerful mascots , like bulldogs , panthers , knights , and hawks .
But not every school chooses a conventional– or even respectable– mascot .
In fact , some schools select rather unconventional ones and often for rather strange and unorthodox reasons .
Here are ten of the strangest , in no particular order — except for the last one .
1. Boll Weevils
At six millimeters longs , not many schools boast a mascot smaller than that of the University of Arkansas at Monticello .
Still , despite its diminutive size , the boll weevil is a formidable opponent — after all , it is the most destructive cotton pest in the United States .
With that in mind , it is curious why men ’s athletics at Monticello are represented by the Boll Weevils whereas the women are known as the “ Lady Blossoms . ”
2. Anteaters
Is it any wonder that the 1960s , a decade famous for political unrest and protest , would also see the rise of University of California - Irvine Anteaters ?
Inspired by Johnny Hart ’s comic strip , “ B.C. , ” Zot the Anteater was introduced at the school ’s first athletic event , a water - polo game , in which cheerleaders led the crowd in the now - infamous chant , “ Give ’em tongue ! ”
3. Banana Slugs
While famous for its marijuana culture as well as the infamous “ Porter Run , ” in which students streak en masse through campus one night of the year , the University of California - Santa Cruz is also known for its distinctive mascot .
The idea for the mascot grew out of the students ’ disapproval of the fierce athletic competition fostered at other universities — hence , they chose the peaceable slug .
4. Fighting Okra
There are several legends as to how the Delta State “ Statesmen ” actually became known as the “ Fighting Okra . ”
One version involves a group of athletes who decided to adopt a mascot that was more intimidating .
Okra was suggested because it was green ( the school color ) , Southern , and ugly .
The name stuck .
5. Chokers
Although this rather unfortunate name is also slang for athletes who “ choke ” in the final minute and fritter away an easy victory , the Grays Harbor Chokers actually refer to an archaic logging term .
Traditionally , “ chokers ” were men who wrapped logs with ropes prior to moving them to the lumberyard .
6. Vulcans
Given the volcanic activity in Hawaii , it is certainly appropriate that a local school would invoke the Roman God of Fire .
That being said , upon hearing of the mascot of the University of Hawaii - Hilo , do n’t most of us actually think of another prominent Vulcan as its representative ?
( Hint : Live long and prosper . )
7. Battling Bishops
Prior to 1925 , the Ohio Wesleyan teams were known as the “ The Red and Black ” or as simply “ The Methodists . ”
But given that there were a dozen Methodist colleges in the area , Ohio Wesleyan decided to have a contest and select a new name to distinguish itself .
“ Battling Bishops ” was the winner .
8. Artichokes
Coming on the heels of protest - mascots such as the Anteaters and the Banana Slugs , the Artichokes was chosen by the students of Scottsdale Community College in the early 1970s as a protest against the school administration ’s practice of using scholarships intended for Native Americans to attract out - of - state athletes .
9. Poets
Named for a prominent poet and leader in the abolitionist movement , John Greenleaf Whittier , the Whittier College Poets are not quite as intimidating as the Fighting Okra nor even as peace - loving as the docile banana slugs .
Then again , the Poets are also not as ridiculous as at least one mascot â€ ¦
10 . Fighting Pickles
Apparently , the Fighting Pickles was first suggested as a joke in 1972 when the North Carolina School of the Arts decided to have a contest to create a mascot .
As with many mascot - choosing contests — when will school administrators learn ? — the unlikely vegetable won , giving it not only the honor of becoming the school ’s official mascot but probably the most ridiculous mascot of all time .
Then again , what ’s your school ’s mascot ?
[ lavalinx code = ” 55|110 |11378 ″ ]
Steven Warshak , the man behind the " natural male enhancement " product Enzyte often advertised on late - night TV , has successfully challenged the government 's ability to access his e-mails without obtaining a search warrant or giving notification to Warshak .
The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled yesterday that the government had acted improperly in its wire fraud and money laundering case against Warshak and his company .
As part of the case ( which we reported on earlier ) , the feds secured a court order under the Stored Communications Act ( SCA ) that allowed them to access Warshak 's stored online e-mail .
A court order does not require the full " probable cause " level of evidence demanded by a subpoena , but it does involve some judicial oversight .
Normally , a court order of this kind requires notification so that the subject of the order can challenge it , but in this case , the judge gave the government 90 days to look at the e-mails before it needed to contact Warshak .
This is allowed under the SCA , but Warshak argued that gaining access to his e-mail without 1 ) a warrant or 2 ) a court order with notification was a violation of the Fourth Amendment .
The Appeals Court ruled in Warshak 's favor .
In the decision , the Court noted that the rules " still allow seizures of e-mails pursuant to a warrant or with prior notice to a subscriber " but that the ability to get the court order without notification was no longer allowed .
The court also responded positively to the idea that e-mails should be given the same privacy protection as phone calls .
This means that getting access to an ISP 's customer information database would be allowed without a warrant , but getting access to the actual text of the e-mails would not .
In the telecom world , this is analogous to the " pen register " that grabs data about what phone numbers are being dialed but does not provide access to the content of the call .
The Court found that " individuals maintain a reasonable expectation of privacy in e-mails that are stored with , or sent or received through , a commercial ISP , " dealing a blow to government attempts to get easier access to e-mails stored with an ISP than those stored on a suspect 's own computer .
Protecting the privacy of e-mail is " as important to Fourth Amendment principles today as protecting telephone conversations has been in the past . "
" E-mail users expect that their Hotmail and Gmail inboxes are just as private as their postal mail and their telephone calls , " said EFF staff attorney Kevin Bankston , who helped draft an amicus brief in the case .
" The government tried to get around this common - sense conclusion , but the Constitution applies online as well as offline , as the court correctly found .
That means that the government can't secretly seize your emails without a warrant . "
With that important e-mail issue resolved , the case against Warshak will continue .

Global warming a hot spot for investors Droughts .

Rising temperatures .
Melting glaciers .
In a world abuzz with talk about global warming , climate change is elbowing aside tech and biotech as the major investment theme of the future .
Wall Street 's savviest analysts are devising ways to cash in on crazy weather , just as they did in response to the profound changes brought on by the dawn of the digital age , globalization and the graying of America .
Discussions about what interest rates mean for stocks are giving way to chatter about what a 1 - degree rise each year in temperature would do to profits at businesses ranging from carmakers to solar companies .
Global warming has emerged as a major market - moving force that represents a generational shift likely to influence how people invest for decades .
The world 's biggest financial services firms are investing massive amounts of time and brainpower trying to pinpoint what stocks and sectors will benefit — and be hurt — by changes in Earth 's weather patterns .
" We are approaching a tipping point when it comes to climate change , " says Edward Kerschner , a strategist at Citigroup .
Kerschner should know .
He spent nine months researching " Climatic Consequences , " a 120 - page report that zeroes in on 74 companies in 18 countries well - positioned to profit from changing weather patterns .
" The interest in this report is unprecedented , " says Kerschner .
He says presentations to clients are booked through the fall .
Similarly , UBS released a 97 - page tome , " Climate Change : Beyond Whether . "
And Lehman Bros. , with input from analysts in London and Tokyo , this month published a 143 - page paper , " The Business of Climate Change " The well - being of the planet , the report concludes , has gone from a " fringe concern " of scientists and activists to a " central topic " for CEOs and investors .
" Global warming is likely to prove ( to be ) one of those tectonic forces that — like globalization or the aging of populations — gradually but powerfully changes the economic landscape , " writes John Llewellyn , senior economic policy adviser at Lehman .
And California 's Calpers , the nation 's largest public pension plan and considered a trendsetter among giant money managers , is committing $ 800 million to invest in clean technology in emerging markets of Eastern Europe , Latin America and Asia .
Earlier this month , the United Nations ' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) concluded that it was more than 90 % likely that human activity is causing global warming .
Former vice president Al Gore came to a similar conclusion in his film , An Inconvenient Truth , which Sunday won the Academy Award for best documentary feature .
The IPCC says temperatures around the globe could rise 2 to 12 degrees Fahrenheit by 2100 .
Likely result : more intense heat waves , more powerful tropical storms and a rise in sea levels that could swamp low - lying cities .
From an investors ' standpoint , it does n't matter if people believe global warming is real or if greenhouse gases are to blame , Kerschner says .
What does matter is if consumers , regulators , governments and corporations " react to the perceived threat . "
That is what creates investment opportunities — and risks , he says .
So here is what Wall Street 's cool , calculating minds say are some potential winners and losers from increasingly volatile weather .
Agriculture .
Ethanol , which is made mainly from corn , has been the talk of the farm since President Bush pushed for greater ethanol use in his January State of the Union address .
The biggest ethanol producers , Archer Daniels Midland , Aventine Renewable Energy , Pacific Ethanol and VeraSun , seem obvious places for investors .
The problem is , investments that are obvious rarely pan out .
Ethanol plays , at least in the short run , have been no exception .
These stocks have all tumbled as corn prices have soared , making the main raw ingredient used to make ethanol prohibitively pricey .
Corn , as a feed for ethanol , is limited , says Michael Hoover , managing director at U.S. Trust .
If ethanol were to provide just 10 % of the nation 's automotive fuel needs , it would consume 35 % of the nation 's corn crop .
And 25 % of all food prices are affected by corn prices , he says : " You 've got a food - vs. - fuel issue . "
But that does n't mean there 's no money to be made on the farm .
There are high hopes about cellulosic ethanol , which is made from farm leftovers ranging from grasses to empty corn husks and beets .
The trouble is , it takes more energy to extract starches from this " biomass " than it produces .
Companies such as Diversa are working on developing enzymes that could be a cheap way to extract parts from biomass to create fuel .
Cashing in on the food boom requires thinking more creatively .
For one thing , as in most gold rushes , the companies selling the picks and axes often cash in .
That 's why Kerschner thinks tractor - maker John Deere could benefit as farmers look to handle bigger crops more efficiently .
Citing strong demand for tractors because of rising corn prices , Deere issued a bullish outlook for 2007 , and analysts say the ethanol boom is just getting started .
Similarly , Monsanto is working on crops that are more resistant to drought .
Alternative energy .
Windmills .
Fuel cells .
Solar panels .
Those global warming plays pop into most investors ' minds .
There 's no shortage of companies working on these technologies .
Energy Conversion Devices and SunPower , for example , are developing types of clean solar panels with the hope of rivaling oil and coal , deemed " dirty " by scientists .
Do n't count on making big - time dough , says Robert Wilder , CEO of WilderShares , a company that creates stock indexes that track eco-friendly companies .
He says the technology is too immature .
Wilder is skeptical about how soon these technologies will make meaningful contributions .
Solar , for instance , provides only one - tenth of a percent of the world 's energy .
Even if production were ramped up tenfold , it would provide 1 % of current demand .
Alternative energy plays , he believes , are not the best route to profits .
He prefers technology that makes dirty energy sources , such as coal and oil , cleaner .
Fuel
Tech , for example , makes devices that help factories reduce the dangerous carbon spewed out of smokestacks .
" Ironically , people interested in benefiting from climate change should look at the really dirty stuff , not the clean stuff , " Wilder says .
Another potential play : nuclear power generators .
While disposing of nuclear waste is problematic , the actual generation of nuclear energy is clean and does n't produce carbon , he says .
FPL Group is a play on both nuclear and alternative energy because it produces nuclear power in addition to being the nation 's biggest producer of wind power , Wilder says .
Automotive .
Seems like people are pouring just about anything into their gas tanks .
There 's ethanol , hydrogen , clean diesel and biodiesel .
Each hold promise and any could be part of the solution , says Ron Cogan , editor and publisher of Green Car Journal .
Cogan lists hybrid technology as a can 't - miss investment .
Hybrid cars are powered by an intelligent system that knows when to run on liquid fuel and when to switch to electricity .
Hybrid technology works with all the fuels to make them more efficient .
Toyota , Honda , General Motors and Ford are the leaders , in that order , he says .
Another way to profit is to invest in companies that make the parts used to build hybrid vehicles .
International Rectifier , for instance , makes many of the components that end up in hybrids made by General Motors and Ford .
Energy Conversion makes the batteries .
Financial services .
One potential beneficiary , analysts say , is the Chicago Mercantile Exchange ( CME ) , a futures exchange with an already - broad weather - related product lineup and plans to create markets .
Last year , the CME traded 797,508 weather contracts valued at $ 21 billion , up nearly tenfold from $ 2.2 billion in 2004 .
Those options and futures enable insurance , energy and utility companies to hedge potential losses related to weather .
Similarly , the CME recently launched " hurricane contracts " that enable insurers to transfer risk to financial markets .
" Companies are becoming increasingly aware that climate is closely tied to profits , " says Felix Carabello , CME 's director of alternative investment products .
" Investors are always looking for new asset classes " to diversify portfolios .
Stock investors seeking broad exposure to " green " investments could consider mutual funds offered by Domini Social Investments .
All Domini holdings promote " the enrichment of our natural environment . "
Infrastructure .
While the Earth may be choking on contaminants , the world 's demand for energy is only accelerating as economies in places such as China and India enjoy growth spurts .
And that 's why heavy construction and engineering companies that build power plants will be busy , U.S. Trust 's Hoover says .
But the enlightened ones that build ecologically sensitive plants will steal market share .
Case in point : McDermott International .
It builds and designs everything from coal - fired boilers to power - generation systems in 90 countries and nuclear steam generators .
The company is finding ways to make these plants more efficient and cleaner .
One technology , clean coal , puts devices in smokestacks that pull the carbon out of the exhaust and plow it back into the soil .
" It 's about taking the harmful things out of the stack , " Hoover says .
Real estate .
In a post - Hurricane Katrina world , many folks may rethink their dream of buying or remaining in coastal homes with coveted water views , David Lereah , chief economist at the National Association of Realtors , writes in his upcoming book , All Real Estate Is Local .
Lereah cites global warming as a " megatrend " and notes that people have an " increasing aversion to locations on the water " and are avoiding " severe - weather - prone " areas .
He predicts households will " move from oceanfront properties to homes several miles away from the water . "
Many folks , he notes , are fleeing Florida in favor of the Smokey Mountain region , which includes Georgia , Tennessee and western North Carolina .
" They feel more secure in the mountains , " says Lereah .
Red Lyons , a Georgia Realtor , confirms a stream of buyers , many from Florida , are moving to the mountain region : " It 's without a doubt weather - related . "
Skyrocketing insurance premiums are also affecting property values .
" Higher premiums come directly out of the asking price , " says Dean Baker , co-director at the Center for Economic and Policy Research .
Technology .
Small parts and components that go into everything from washers and dryers to fighter jets and elevators could play a gigantic factor in curbing energy use .
Technology that exists right now could reduce the world 's power use by 30 % overnight , says Alex Lidow , CEO of advanced control maker International Rectifier .
About 11 % of the savings could be achieved with efficient electric motors inside washing machines , conveyor belts and other motors that use half the energy of older technology , Lidow says .
Another 11 % could be saved in transportation uses including hybrids .
The last 8 % can be saved with energy - efficient fluorescent bulbs .
Making devices that go into bulbs , hybrid cars and electric motors is paying off for International Rectifier .
It gets a third of its business , which is growing at an annual 25 % clip , from such energy - saving devices .
Those businesses focused on energy efficiency are also the company 's most profitable .
Despite the forward - looking mind - set of Wall Street analysts , profiting from climate change is still in its infancy .
Citigroup 's Kerschner learned that firsthand at a recent meeting with wealthy clients in Florida , a state known for both its beautiful beaches and run-ins with deadly hurricanes .
Says Kerschner : " I asked them , ' How many of you are aware of global warming ? '
Virtually everyone raised their hand .
Next I asked , ' How many of you are concerned about global warming ? '
Most kept their hands up .
Finally I asked , ' How many of you have adjusted your investments due to climate change ? '
Sheepishly , most put their hands down . "
At that moment , Kerschner says , he knew most investors had n't even started to think about how to profit from changes in the Earth 's weather patterns .

BASEL , Switzerland – When Kevin Herbert has a particularly intractable programming problem , or finds himself pondering a big career decision , he deploys a powerful mind expanding tool – LSD - 25 .
" It must be changing something about the internal communication in my brain .
Whatever my inner process is that lets me solve problems , it works differently , or maybe different parts of my brain are used , " said Herbert , 42 , an early employee of Cisco Systems who says he solved his toughest technical problems while tripping to drum solos by the Grateful Dead – who were among the many artists inspired by LSD .
" When I 'm on LSD and hearing something that 's pure rhythm , it takes me to another world and into anther brain state where I 've stopped thinking and started knowing , " said Herbert who intervened to ban drug testing of technologists at Cisco Systems .
Herbert , who lives in Santa Cruz , California , joined 2,000 researchers , scientists , artists and historians gathered here over the weekend to celebrate the 100th birthday of Albert Hofmann , the Swiss chemist who discovered LSD here in 1938 .
The centenarian received a congratulatory birthday letter from the Swiss president , roses and a spontaneous kiss from a young woman in the crowd .
In many ways , the conference , LSD : Problem Child and Wonder Drug , an International Symposium on the Occasion of the 100th Birthday of Albert Hofmann , was a scientific coming - out party for the drug Hofmann fathered .
" LSD wanted to tell me something , " Hofmann told the gathering Friday .
" It gave me an inner joy , an open mindedness , a gratefulness , open eyes and an internal sensitivity for the miracles of creation . "
Bent with age but still eloquent , Hofmann said he hoped the symposium would encourage the renewed therapeutic and spiritual use of LSD in supervised settings .
Lysergic acid diethylamide , a derivative of lysergic acid found in the alkaloids of the ergot grain fungus , has been illegal worldwide since the mid-1960s and still generates controversy .
The conference was picketed Saturday by a splinter group from Scientology opposed to drug use .
The storied history of LSD as a mind - expanding tool began five years after Hofmann discovered LSD - 25 , and had what he described as a " peculiar presentiment " compelling him to resynthesize the drug .
Without ingesting the substance , Hofmann managed to accidentally absorb enough of the chemical to experience its effects .
In a second intentional trip , Hoffman said he had a frightening experience that gave way to feelings of rebirth .
During the 1950s and 1960s , LSD was found to be a promising tool for psychiatry and psychotherapy and was studied by the CIA as a potential interrogation weapon .
It was criminalized after it escaped from the lab to be widely embraced by the youth culture .
Hofmannn said millions of people have taken LSD , but some had bad reactions when they took counterfeit drugs .
He would like to see a modern Eleusis , the ancient Greek site that held the rituals of Eleusinian Mysteries which took place for two millennia beginning in 1500 BC .
During the LSD symposium , mythologist Carl P. Ruck and chemist Peter Webster presented their research suggesting that an ergot preparation was the active ingredient for the Kykeon beverage used during the ritual .
" When Hofmann synthesized the chemical in LSD , he stumbled upon a 4,000 - year - old secret , " said Ruck , author of Road to Eleusis .
In 1958 , Hofmann was the first to isolate the psychoactive substances of psilocybin and psilocin from Mexican magic mushrooms ( psilocybe mexicana ) which were among a variety of sacred plants used around the world to invite ecstatic and spiritual experiences .
The United States Supreme Court is now considering an appeal brought by the New Mexican chapter of the Uniao do Vegetal , or UDV , which uses the outlawed ayahauska brew in its ceremonies and cites the Eleusinian Mysteries as a precedent for a psychoactive Eucharist .
At the symposium , presentations of electronic trance music and psychedelic art by painter Alex Grey encouraged meditative and spiritual reflection for participants – especially those in altered states of consciousness .
Participants eager to describe their modern - day spiritual LSD experiences were encouraged to contribute to a library of drug experiences on the Erowid website .
Earth and Fire Erowid , who operate the site , presented a sampling of comments at the symposium and documented the two to five known deaths that have been associated with LSD .
Geri Beil of Cologne , Germany , who attended the symposium , recalled his own ecstatic LSD experience on an Indian beach on New Year 's day , 2000 .
" I was crying from happiness , so thankful to my parents that they created me , " said Beil .
" This experience has not disappeared ; it has had a lasting effect . "
Like Herbert , many scientists and engineers also report heightened states of creativity while using LSD .
During a press conference on Friday , Hofmann revealed that he was told by Nobel - prize - winning chemist Kary Mullis that LSD had helped him develop the polymerase chain reaction that helps amplify specific DNA sequences .
" When you study natural science and the miracles of creation , if you do n't turn into a mystic you are not a natural scientist , " said Hofmann .
In his presentation , artist Alex Grey noted that Nobel - prize - winner Francis Crick , discoverer of the double helical structure of DNA , also told friends he received inspiration for his ideas from LSD , according to news reports .
The gathering included a discussion of how early computer pioneers used LSD for inspiration .
Douglas Englebart , the inventor of the mouse , Myron Stolaroff , a former Ampex engineer and LSD researcher who was attending the symposium , and Apple - cofounder Steve Jobs were among them .
In the 2005 book What the Dormouse Said , New York Times reporter John Markoff quotes Jobs describing his LSD experience as " one of the two or three most important things he has done in his life . "
But the symposium was n't just a census of LSD - using notables .
Attendees included psychotherapists and psychiatrists who discussed research into the therapeutic usefulness of psychedelic drugs .
Dr. Michael Mithoefer presented the preliminary findings of his study in Charleston , South Carolina , which is investigating whether MDMA is effective for treating post - traumatic stress disorder in people traumatized by crime or war .
Harvard University professor , Dr. John Halpern , discussed his proposed study – now awaiting DEA approval – using MDMA to treat anxiety in cancer patients .
The Florida - based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies ( MAPS ) is supporting studies and research in Canada investigating the use of ibogain to treat drug addiction .
And a study at the Harbor - UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles , supported by the Heffter Research Institute , is investigating whether psilocybin effectively eases the anxiety of terminal cancer patients .
Psychiatrist Charles Grob says his research group has located six of the needed 12 subjects and is looking for more participants .
While the data has yet to be analyzed , Grob told seminar participants that all the participants in the study have shown promising reactions , and he applauded the opportunity to share the data in an international gathering .
" It 's very encouraging to see such a large number of people , including very knowledgeable people , getting together and sharing a common vision that these compounds have tremendous potential to facilitate healing , especially in areas that do not respond well to conventional treatments , " said Grob .
" There is global healing in these compounds which have been used for millennia by indigenous people that have much to teach modern man and modern woman . "
MAPS founder Rick Doblin says his goal is to make psychedelic medicines into prescription drugs , lamenting that LSD is not yet being studied for therapeutic purposes .
" We have been deeply touched by our experiences with psychedelics and it is hard that there is not a single legal study with LSD given to humans anywhere in the world , " said Doblin .
" We need to bring what is underground and illegal back into a legal context . "
But Doblin notes that a group of people who say LSD provides relief from their cluster headaches have organized online and are pushing for a study at Harvard to explore a possible therapy using the drug .
If Harvard accepts the MDMA study , Doblin says it could pave the way for the symbolically important return of psychedelic research at Harvard that halted during the tenure of Timothy Leary .
His goal , says Doblin , is to secure an LSD study in time for Hofmann 's 101st birthday .
Dr. Andrew Sewell , a psychiatrist and neurologist from the Harvard Medical School who studies alcohol and drug abuse , says most problems with LSD occur when users take an unknown dose they do n't feel comfortable with , in an uncontrolled setting , without supervision to shield them from dangerous situations .
" LSD flashbacks are well - confirmed phenomenon but they are relatively rare and do n't seem to cause as much trouble as the media would have you believe , " said Dr. Sewell at the LSD symposium .
Dr. Sewell says people who have underlying mental disorders should not take LSD because it could make their symptoms worse .
" Like any powerful drug , if LSD is used incorrectly it can cause more harm than good , " said Dr. Sewell .
" LSD is a potentially dangerous drug and should be taken under medical supervision . "
" There is no evidence that LSD causes permanent brain damage – and quite a lot of evidence that it doesn't , " said Sewell .
" We are lucky that we have over 1,000 papers written in the '50s and '60s when LSD was given to thousands and thousands of research subjects so we have a pretty good idea at this point what it does and does not do . "
Asked if the world needs his invention , Hofmann said he hoped that the Basel LSD symposium would help create an appropriate place for LSD in society .
" I think that in human evolution it has never been as necessary to have this substance LSD , " said Hofmann .
" It is just a tool to turn us into what we are supposed to be . "

HARD disks dominate the field of computer memory .
They store oodles of information — which is why they are so useful .
But they are also slow , heavy and power - hungry .
Unfortunately solid - state memories , such as flash , that do not have these disadvantages are too expensive for stashing the vast programs needed to run a modern computer .
What engineers would like is a device that combines the best of both .
And a group of them have now taken a step towards developing such a piece of kit — a magnetic memory with no moving mechanical parts .
The idea began a few years ago when Stuart Parkin , who works at IBM's Almaden Research Centre in San Jose , California , worked out how to use a wire to store information magnetically .
It has now been improved by Guido Meier , of the University of Hamburg .
As he reports in Physical Review Letters , Dr Meier has taken Dr Parkin 's idea and speeded it up to the point where it might eventually make a practical technology for computer users .
Traditional hard drives employ electrodes called heads to create tiny magnetic regions , known as domains , on the surface of a plate as it spins .
The alignment of the north and south poles of each domain indicates whether it represents a one or a zero of the binary code — and that alignment can be read by a second head .
Dr Parkin 's wire is also divided into domains .
But instead of moving the wire to bring those domains under the heads , in the way that a spinning hard disk would , his device moves the domains themselves along the wire , using an electric current .
A wall between two domains represents a “ one ” ; the absence of wall in a place where one might be expected represents a “ zero ” .
Magnetism is , ultimately , the result of a quantum - mechanical property known as spin .
In particular , every electron has its own magnetic field aligned with the axis of its spin .
If the electrons are spinning at random , these fields cancel each other out .
If they are aligned , they reinforce each other to create a field that can be detected from the outside .
Both research groups use wire made of a standard alloy of nickel and iron that is easy to magnetise .
They create domains along the length of the wire , in which the spins of the electrons of the atoms in the wire are aligned .
Then they run pulses of current through the wire .
When a current flows in such a wire , the electrons that flow as electricity are forced to align their spins to those of the local atoms embedded in the wire .
This means that when they come to a boundary between two different domains , their spins flip .
That flip transfers angular momentum to the domain wall , pushing it along in the direction of the current .
By using short and intense bursts of current , a succession of domain walls can be shoved past a reading head .
It works like a tape , except that there are no moving spools .
The biggest problem with getting such an idea off the laboratory benchtop and onto the factory floor is the speed at which the domain walls travel .
Until now , this has been a hundredth of the velocity that theory predicted .
Which is where Dr Meier comes in .
He and his colleagues ( and also Dr Parkin , in a separate experiment ) have persuaded practice to match theory .
They report speeds of 110 metres a second , comfortably competitive with the speed of a hard disk .
Their trick was to shorten the lengths of the pulses of current to about a nanosecond .
Rapidly changing currents exert a greater force on domain walls than do slowly changing ones .
For the technology to work like a disk , though , the same bits of data will have to pass repeatedly under the reading and writing heads .
That means the wires will have to loop .
Dr Parkin is now working on integrating the technology with traditional silicon chips by inserting the ends of the wires into a chip to form U–shaped loops reminiscent of an ancient Roman hippodrome .
Indeed , he refers to the technology as a magnetic racetrack .

1. Cinema Paradiso
Giuseppe Tornatore , Italy / France , 1988
Our verdict : O Guardian readers , I love you and perhaps sometimes ( as a Guardian reader for 50 years ) I come close to understanding you .
But Cinema Paradiso as the best foreign language film of all time ?
Better than M , The Rules of the Game , Ugetsu Monogatari or ...
Maybe I 'm a snob , and I know we 're playing a game , not voting for president .
But ca n't you see that this is the kind of movie lousy presidents remember when they want to be kind to cinema and show their humanity ?
The film is clever and touching , and in its way it 's an ad for cinema .
But ... there is work to be done .

2. Amélie
Jean - Pierre Jeunet , France / Germany , 2001
Our verdict : Forget La Règle du Jeu ; forget L'Atalante ; forget Abel Gance 's Napoleon ; if there 's a single film that defines France in the eyes of the Guardian readership , it's this hyperactive magical - realist tale from the Gallic answer to Tim Burton , Jean - Pierre Jeunet .
Its self - consciously cutie - pie tone has meant that , even before its release , it was thoroughly scorned by the People Who Count ( ie , the Cannes film festival ) .
The fact that it 's cleaned up in country after country ( £ 4.32 m at the UK box office at the last time of asking ) shows that , approve of it or not , Amelie has got something .
As footballers are fond of saying , you can only beat what 's put in front of you , and Amélie has done that for years .

3. Seven Samurai
Akira Kurosawa , Japan , 1954
Our verdict :
This is still the best mixture of the western and an authentic samurai film , in which seven noble and skilled fighters ( beautifully delineated ) decide to defend a farming village against marauding bandits .
Kurosawa orders the action in waves and the weather deteriorates ( so you need to see the long version ) .
Today , perhaps , the ending begs for a touch more irony ( as villagers might turn on their heroes ) , but this set international standards for action cinema , the slow - mo grandeur of combat and the general infiltration of Japanese " stoicism " into the age of tight - lipped Clint Eastwood heroes .

4. City of God
Fernando Meirelles , Brazil / France / USA , 2002
Our verdict :
There are plenty of ways to read City of God 's fourth place in this poll - first , that young people are voting and seeking a true vision of the world from the movies ; second , that that hope has extended to Latin America and the slums of Rio , where Fernando Mereilles ' picture is set ; and third , that young moviegoers use the movies as a way of focusing their anger or despair about the unfairness of the world .
All the above could have been said about Luis Buñuel 's Los Olvidados , made in 1950 , and a better film .
But Los Olvidados never woke the world up as City of God did .

Our verdict :
You could argue that no modern movie has had more political influence .
For the tension in this dramatised documentary has been employed in the training and the inspiration of real - life terrorists opposed to occupying forces .
Pontecorvo used people who had known the real war in Algeria - from all sides - and you can tell yourself you are seeing the " true " face of outrage .
But , in fact , the picture is artfully made in a black - and - white that apparently appeals to Guardian readers a lot .
Above all , this reminds us that " real " coverage of terrible events is itself a political weapon .

6. Breathless
Jean - Luc Godard , France , 1960
Our verdict :
This is one of the turning points in film history , modernism made for peanuts , with a strange American starlet ( Jean Seberg ) talking away to a French Humphrey Bogart ( Jean - Paul Belmondo ) as Godard experimented with ways of interfering with his own story .
It was the start of the first period of Godard 's work , and if you are thrilled by it , I urge you to pursue richer and more emotional films ( such as Vivre Sa Vie , Contempt and Pierrot le Fou ) .
But Godard in the 60s is still radical , funny and captivated by his medium in ways that make later modernists seem lazy .

7. Jean de Florette / Manon des Sources
Claude Berri , France / Switzerland / Italy , 1986
Our verdict :
If any single event triggered the British exodus to Provence , the Dordogne and southern France , it was the release of the first part of this picturesque double - bill in 1986 - a good few years before Peter Mayle got going .
Issuing from Gérard Depardieu 's glory years and adapted from Marcel Pagnol 's novel L'Eau des Collines , it exudes a certain kind of rural Frenchness that has as become as exportable , in its way , as Richard Curtis 's England .
Its enduring hold on the Anglo - Saxon imagination is not something , I suspect , the French will be wild about .

8. Bicycle Thieves
Vittorio De Sica , Italy , 1948
Our verdict :
It 's fascinating that this classic of the Italian neo- realist movement holds its power more than 50 years after it was made .
A man needs a job desperately - putting up movie posters of Rita Hayworth .
For the job he needs a bike .
But in an impoverished city , the bike is stolen .
With his son , he goes on a great search in a city of bicycles .
De Sica judges the pathos very well , though as a rule he advanced on scenes where children taught adults about life .
Hollywood wanted a remake ( with Cary Grant ) , and in that crazed urge you can feel the end of Hollywood coming .
DT
9. Pan's Labyrinth
Guillermo del Toro , Mexico / Spain / USA , 2006
Our verdict : Del Toro placed himself at the vanguard of Latin - American film talent with his exotic Oscar - winning fairytale set in the aftermath of the Spanish Civil War .
On its release last year , the critic Mark Kermode hailed it as " the Citizen Kane of fantasy cinema " .
If that sounds a bit rich , you should sample the film itself - a dark gateau layered with true - life monsters ( that fascist colonel ) and fantastical freaks ( the terrifying pale man ) , and iced with imagery lifted from Goya and Arthur Rackham .
All told , it 's quite a treat .

10 . In the Mood for Love
Wong Kar Wai , Hong Kong / France , 2000
Our verdict : " Everyone " knows now : Asia makes the most interesting films , and most of them come from South Korea and Hong Kong .
Wong Kar Wai's great romance is set in the latter in the 60s .
It is a strange , secret love story between two people who try to rent the same apartment , starring Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung .
What sets this above so many other Asian films is the stylistic intricacy , the ambiguous relationship of story and politics , and the subtle implication that it 's a film about everything .
Hollywood , in that sense , now exists in the Far East - and we are far away .
DT
11 . Tokyo Story
Yasujiro Ozu , Japan , 1953
Our verdict :
What a great pleasure to see Guardian readers voting for this masterpiece by Ozu ( though I 'd like to remind them that the greatest of Japanese directors is still Kenji Mizoguchi ) .
Ozu developed a simple , withdrawn camera style perfect for the observation of different members of a family .
As always , this is about concession , compromise and the way the passage of time first reveals and then helps us pass over the unfairnesses in life .
After this , there are only about another 20 Ozu films worth seeing !

12 . Les Enfants du Paradis
Marcel Carné , France , 1945
Our verdict :
This is a tribute to the romantic energy of 19th - century French theatre - and to the same champagne excitement as Paris recovered from German occupation in 1944 - 45 .
Carné set it up as the Germans were still in town , but the film opened in a free city and it is as much of a patriotic endorsement as Olivier 's Henry V. But , written by Jacques Prévert and designed by Alexandre Trauner , it is a masterpiece of studio film - making .
Still hugely enjoyable and a treasure house of great performances from Arletty to Barrault .
DT
13 . The Seventh Seal
Ingmar Bergman , Sweden , 1957
Our verdict :
One of those films not subject to the vagaries of fashion or marketing , Bergman 's breakthrough hit remains arguably the most unforgiving , cold , user - hostile entry on the list .
That resonant opening scene , with medieval knight Max von Sydow taking on Death at chess , has become a much - parodied classic - Bill and Ted beating Death at Battleships springs to mind - but take the trouble to look again , and you find a stark crystallisation of Bergman 's key themes : faith , despair and the silence of God .
From a time before merchandising and date - movies were n't prime considerations , this is one to be cherished .
AP
14 . Jules and Jim
François Truffaut , France , 1962
Our verdict :
In so many ways , this is the ideal " new wave " film - it 's set in period ( the first world war ) and yet it 's a new version of sexual politics in which one impulsive , dangerous and utterly seductive woman can keep two men ( at least ) in her life .
So it was rich material in an age of new promiscuity .
It has fabulous black - and - white widescreen ( by Raoul Coutard ) and a classic score by Georges Delerue .
But , above all , it has Jeanne Moreau , one of the true and unstoppable " beasts " of cinema , devouring or changing everything she sees .
DT
15 . La Haine
Mathieu Kassovitz , France , 1995
Our verdict :
In the wake of the French election , the troubles of the banlieues have come in for one of their periodic bout of attention , but it was this agonised shout from the wrong side of the chemin de fer that first alerted the wider world to a nasty underside of the shiny Gallic dream .
Taking his cue from Boyz n the Hood , then - unknown actor Kassovitz cast another barely - known actor , his friend Vincent Cassel , as a gun-toting hoodlum driven bananas by racism and petty crime ; it 's clearly still got something to say .
AP
16 . Il Postino
Michael Radford , France / Italy / Belgium , 1994
Our verdict : Is Postino is better than Antonioni's La Notte ?
Than Rossellini's Open City ?
Than Bertolucci's The Conformist ?
Than 20 , 30 , 40 other Italian films ?
Why is it that Italy is connected with this sweet air of aberration ?
Is it that we want to live in Italy ?
Is it that such films as Il Postino awaken the tourist in us ?
Have we turned story , drama and characters into the sites of travelogue ?
I am serious - I think that Il Postino is not really a movie , but a kind of animated magazine section on the idyll of a certain kind of Italian life .
The great interest of this is that it shows fantasy - the engine of the movies - still thriving .
DT
17 . Oldboy
Chan-wook Park , South Korea , 2003
Our verdict :
This is a terrific Korean action film that unfolds the story content of about five lumbering US films in a bare two hours .
Director Chan-wook
Park never lets us settle .
It begins as a bad dream , moves to a 15 - year prison sentence and then explodes in flashbacks that trace the real crime .
In addition , it has a fantastic taste for eating and eateries , and an overall confidence that the films noirs made by RKO 60 years ago may be the most lively model for movies that explore the thriving prosperity and moral chaos of south - east Asia - and which leave us in little doubt that this is our future .
DT
18 . Delicatessen
Marc Caro & Jean - Pierre Jeunet , France , 1991
Our verdict : Delicatessen has lost none of its freshness in the years since it was first sprung on an unsuspecting public .
It 's a mad , Heath Robinson - esque assemblage : part comedy , part love story , part cyberpunk comic - strip , with its decaying tenement home to all manner of roguish inhabitants ( sad - faced clowns , cannibalistic butchers , lentil - eating guerrillas et al ) .
Forget trying to make sense of the plot .
It 's just a peg on which to drape the wacky misadventures and fiendishly choreographed set - pieces .
Co-director Jean - Pierre Jeunet went on to further success with Alien : Resurrection and the winsome Amélie , but he 's never equalled this bizarre and brilliant one - off .
XB
19 . La Dolce Vita
Federico Fellini , Italy / France , 1960
Our verdict :
Few films have their cake and eat it with quite the confidence - and abandon - of Fellini 's classic .
A freewheeling tour of the Rome party circuit , this lambasted the tawdry lifestyle of its modish characters while simultaneously luxuriating in it .
Along the way , it coined the term " paparazzo " and rustled up a crop of indelible , iconic images .
Nowadays we remember the famous shot of Anita Ekberg in the fountain far more than we recall that allegorical image of Christ being forcibly lifted out of the city .
If that 's not what Fellini would have wanted , one fears he has only himself to blame .
XB
20 . The 400 Blows
François Truffaut , France , 1959
Our verdict :
This was Truffaut 's first feature film , and it introduced Jean - Pierre Léaud as a version of Truffaut himself , leading a rough , tough life , and barely avoiding juvenile delinquency on the way to the great sea called cinema .
I love its unsentimental view of childhood , its adoration of a Paris seen in black and white ( thank you for voting so often for b/w ) and the naturalness of Léaud .
Truffaut would lose his touch later in life , I fear , and he started to make foolish pictures .
But for a few years in the 60s , the sight and sound of his work ( there 's another great score by Jean Constantin ) is enough to remind us all that cinema can be heavenly .

The Open Letter from Li Datong
In the matter of the shutdown of the Freezing Point weekly supplement of China Youth Daily , the world was obviously trying to interview the editor Li Datong ( see History Textbooks in China ) .
The following is a translation of his open letter .
His weblog has been shut down and any posting about this affair at bulletin board systems and forums will probably be deleted within moments of posting .
So the principal method of propagation is through blogs and emails .
If you have the means and connections , you should forward either the original or the translation to your network .

A public protest against the illegal stoppage of the Freezing Point weekly magazine
Dear news media colleagues , intellectuals , legal professional friends and devoted readers of Freezing Point inside and outside of China :
On January 24 , 2006 , Tuesday , which the deadline for the Freezing Point weekly magazine , the Beijing editorial staff of Freezing Point worked as usual to edit and proof - read the weekly edition scheduled for January 25 .
At just after 4 pm , we were ready with everything and the pages were forwarded to the editor - in - chief for review and print .
The unusual aspect was that there was no reaction for a long while .
We gathered that all the newspaper leadership had been called to the League Central Office for an emergency meeting and nobody was minding the store .
This meant that something extraordinary was about to happen .
Then the skies fell down .
The newspaper will be published as usual , because this is our obligation to our subscribers and readers .
We looked for any possible errors and we patiently waited for the breaking event .
Based on the fact that the Central Propaganda Department never ceased in their criticisms of Freezing Point and most recently the Central Propaganda Department criticism group issued an Cultural Revolution - style critique of Yuan Weishi 's essay on " Modernization and Historical Textbooks " on the Internet , I suspected that it was my moment to be dismissed as the editor - in - chief .
But the contemptible level was beyond the imagination of ordinary person .
At just after 5 pm , the telephone calls from various media friends around the country began to arrive .
They told us that they have received the notice from the Central Propaganda Department , the State Council and the Beijing News Office to " not report or comment on the stoppage of Freezing Point , " " not attend any press conference given by the editorial and reporting staff of Freezing Point , " " not hype , " " maintain the distance " and so on .
Thereafter , the overseas media reporters called non -stop to ask me to confirm the facts .
But until 7 pm , nobody had notified me formally .
When the newspaper leadership returned from the meeting the League Central , they went into a meeting to discuss matters .
I was the last person to know about this affair .
All the information proved that this was something certain persons in the upper level of the party dared to risk public contempt and plotted carefully to take this action .
This action had no legal or constitutional basis , and seriously violated and trampled upon the party constitution and political standards of the party .
As a professional media worker , I cannot understand the stoppage of Freezing Pont .
I can not accept this .
A newspapers is a public instrument .
The newspaper has a social contract with the subscribes and the readers , and it is a source of information that the readers pay money for and therefore the newspaper must fulfill its contract no matter what .
Therefore , the Freezing Point weekly magazine should be delivered into the hands of the subscribers .
Yet for the person who made this decision , what did the social impact mean ?
What does the broad readership mean ?
What does the reputation of a mainstream newspaper mean ?
What do the party constitution and the national constitution mean ?
What does the image of Chinese reform mean ?
What does the image of the governing party mean ?
They regard the social instrument as a personal property to be disposed of at their own will .
At 730 pm in the evening , I received a call from the publisher and editor - in - chief to go and speak to them .
The decision about me was made by the League Central Propaganda Department .
The " decision " gave Mr. Yuan Weishi an uncalled - for label and then announced that Freezing Point will be stopped for reorganization .
Apart from the personal attacks against the editor - in - chief and myself , there were also " economic sanctions . "
Who gave them that kind of power ?
They are so disgusting that I do n't know whether to cry or laugh .
Of course , with the aforementioned background , this conversation was a farce .
Obviously , this was controlled by a small number of people " above " in the background and the League Central was just playing the role of the fools .
I used reasoning to condemn the " decision " as well as the absurdity of the Central Propaganda Department 's News Criticisms .
I told the publisher and editor - in - chief that I will formally complain to the party central disciplinary committee about this illegal act .
On the day when Freezing Point weekly magazine stopped publication , the newspaper received a large number of telephone inquiries from readers .
I learned that readers are angrily terminating their subscriptions at the postal offices on account of the stoppage of Freezing Point .
A small number of people " above " have plotted for a long time to strangle Freezing Point .
On June 1 , 2005 , on the 60th anniversary of the victory of the anti-Fascist war , Freezing Point published the essay on " Pingyingguan battle and Pingyingguan victory " , in which we recorded the historical truth about how the Kuomintang and Communist Party worked together in the face of national survival to win the battle with their blood .
This was different from the unification propaganda , because Freezing Point was the first in mainstream media to objectively report on how the Kuomintang army sacrificed tens of thousands of warriors in this battle .
This true historical account attracted the brutal criticism by the Central Propaganda Department 's Criticism Group .
What is the basis of their criticism ?
It was based upon the " XX year XX publisher 's Chinese Communist Party history about the Pingyuanguan victory . "
The Freezing Point report " glorified the Kuomintang and debased the Communist Party . "
In the end , at the memorial meeting of the 60th anniversary of the victory in the anti-Fascist war , Communist Party General Secretary comrade Hu Jintao said in his memorial speech that he affirmed the contribution of the Kuomintang solders in the war of resistance against the Japanese .
It was clear that who was right and who was wrong in this case .
When Lian and Soong completed their visits to Taiwan , the renowned Taiwan writer Ms. Lung Yingtai published a long essay at Freezing Point titled " The Taiwan That You May Not Know . "
The essay used a rich content to objectively and truthfully present to the people of China for the first time the changes and developments in Taiwan over the past few decades .
It created a tremendous response and approval among readers and had an important impact on communication between the people on the two sides of the Taiwan strait .
But this essay was accused by certain people within the Central Propaganda Department as being " against the Communist Party at every step " and their narrow - mindedness was truly astonishing .
On November 18 , the party central held a solemn memorial for the great proletariat revolutionary Hu Yaobang 's 90th birthday .
Comrade Zeng Qinghong represented the Party Central Committee to pay tribute to Comrade Hu Yaobang 's glorious accomplishments and he was warmly received by the people .
But certain members in the Central Propaganda Department forbade the media to publish memorial articles of Comrade Hu Yaobang and required that all media can only publish the Xinhua release and nothing of their own creation .
On December 7 , 2005 , Freezing Point published Comrade Hu Qili 's long memorial essay " The Yaobang of My Heart " and drew a tremendous response .
The media inside and outside of China carried that essay .
Numerous netizens posted comments to say how they had been moved to tears .
About that well - received essay , the Central Propaganda Department called the newspaper to complain and claimed that the newspaper had violated rule of " not having any voluntary choice . " !
For those people , they felt no genuine emotion or grief over Comrade Hu Yaobang !
A small number at the Central Propaganda Department had numerous unreasonable complaints and criticisms against Freezing Point .
For example , on November 30 , 2005 , Freezing Point published a reporter 's investigation about the academic plagiarism by Wuhan law professor Zhou Yezhong .
When professor Zhou was interviewed by the Freezing Point reporter , he said : " You better not mind this matter !
Sooner or later , the Central Propaganda Department is going to come after you !
Your editor - in - chief will come after you ! "
When the report was published , certain people at the Central Propaganda Department came after us and complained that the essay had major problems with editorial directions .
Under these pressures , Freezing Pont withdrew its follow - up report .
On December 28 , 2005 , Freezing Point published a historical first weekly edition of only three pages .
We ask just who the small number of people at the Central Propaganda Department were protecting ?
Now , they are looking for a final accounting with Freezing Point !
The essay of Mr. Yuan Weishi is just an excuse .
Professor Yuan Weishi has published numerous works on contemporary history and he has great influence among intellectuals .
When Professor Yuan wrote this article , it was based upon historical materials and his theoretical basis is about the rationality of openness .
After the essay was published , it generated a great response .
On any discussion of historical issues , it is necessary to have materials as well as viewpoints and to exchange ideas in a calm and peaceful manner in order to reach agreement .
Of the many Internet commentary , even those netizens who disagreed with Mr. Yuan were very serious and their rebuttals were very solid .
I have personally forwarded some of these comments to Mr. Yuan and he replied afterwards that these essays were very rigorous and he would seriously consider their viewpoints and make the appropriate responses .
This is a healthy and normal kind of academic exchange .
But the Central Propaganda Department Criticism Group used insults and characterizations in the style of the Cultural Revolution and then nothing else !?
This incident exposes the basic flaws in the news control system of our country .
A small number of people in the Central Propaganda Department have a narrow worldview and mind and used dictatorial methods to impose controls that deaden what should be a lively political scene in which a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools speak out .
These people want obedience and not equality .
Which item in the party constitution of the Communist Party lets them do that ?
We will write elsewhere about the flaws of our national news control system .
Here , we just want to tell our colleagues , readers and friends just what had happened and why it happened .
When one does not have the truth , one is afraid of debates ; when one does not have the truth , one is afraid of openness .
Although certain people in the Central Propaganda Department used their power to lock up all the media and websites , we believe that you will see this letter !
You will know the power of truth !
We thank you sincerely !
Person of the Week : Danica McKellar Actress goes from " The Wonder Years " to inspire girls to excel in math .
Aug. 10 , 2007  --
At a time when so many young Hollywood stars are finding themselves in trouble with drugs , alcohol and the law , Danica McKellar is someone who escaped the perils of child stardom and now wants to present a different role model to young women .
" There is an epidemic right now of girls dumbing themselves down … in middle school because they think its makes them attractive , " she said .
" [ It ] could be because of the role models they are getting in the media . "
She 's trying to change that with a fun , sassy book about math to encourage middle school girls to recognize they can excel in both the classroom and their social life .
After this segment aired on " World News with Charles Gibson " McKellar answered viewer math questions in a Q+A here .
" Unfortunately girls think that being glamorous means making mistakes and being irresponsible .
And that 's just not true .
The smarter you are , the better prepared you are to make decisions in your life , the more likely you are to lead a satisfying life and be glamorous and fun and anything you want to be , " McKellar said .
The 32 - year - old got her start in Hollywood 20 years ago as Winnie Cooper on TV's " The Wonder Years , " and has since appeared on " The West Wing " and Lifetime 's " Inspector Mom . "
And as she was racking up acting credits , she was also excelling in math .
In high school she aced her math SAT and AP calculus exam and took a chance on a math degree at UCLA after some initial trepidation .
" I did n't think that college math was for me .
I did n't think I 'd be able to hack it , " McKellar said .
" And that perception of math not being for girls , not being for girls who see themselves as socially well adjusted has got to change . "
' Math Does n't Suck , ' Really !
After graduating summa cum laude with a degree in math and a published physics theorem , McKellar realized she had something to offer off - screen .
She believes that girls get the message in middle school that " if you 're really smart then you 're not cool . "
" When girls are asking themselves ' Who am I ? ' for the first time and they hear all this bad PR about math , they think , ' Well , whoever I am , I 'm not somebody who likes math , " said McKellar .
So she decided to write the book " Math Does n't Suck " to change that perception .
" The title was not my idea .
I was struggling with ideas because I wanted the book to give the feeling of look , math has got a friendly face , it 's doable , it 's fine , it 's accessible , but the names I was coming up with just did not work .
It was like , ' Make Friends with Math ' … God no , " she said .
It 's written in a whimsical voice , comparing math to acne and other preteen concerns .
" In reaching the middle school girl 's audience I wanted to keep in mind what are girls thinking about at that age ? …
Boys , makeup , jewelry , fashion , who am I ?
I took every quiz in every teen magazine known to man because you think you 're going to get the answer to ' Who am I ? ' " she explained .
" I thought , let me do it in that context , why not ?
Why not teach math in the context of being a girl ? "
Well , because some people think it is a contradiction to mix the superficial with the serious , but she disagrees .
" There is no problem with being able to look cute if you want to and do a math problem .
It does n't affect your brain .
The makeup does n't seep into your skull and allow you to not think as clearly . "

I 'm not entirely sure I can parse the sheer volume of possibly autistic Trekkie - ism required to create this detailed star map of the entire Federation of Planets , but I 'm almost certain that it would qualify as a neurological disorder .

The Netherlands has seen the number of registered organ donors skyrocket following a hoax reality show in which the top prize was purportedly a kidney from a dying woman .
More than 12,000 people have signed up as organ donors since the airing of Dutch broadcaster BNN's Big Donor Show , the country 's Health Ministry said in a statement on Monday .
" Normally the register receives 3,000 to 4,000 donor forms per month . "
Earlier this year , the producers of Big Donor Show drew almost universal derision and condemnation for the program , in which kidney patients appeared to be pitted against each other in an attempt to " win " a kidney from a woman diagnosed with inoperable brain cancer .
Eachcontestantmade a moving case as to why he or she would most benefit from the organ donation .
One by one , participants were eliminated for a variety of reasons , including their age , job status and even for bad habits , like smoking .
" Some people will think it 's tasteless , but we think the reality is even more shocking and tasteless : waiting for an organ is just like playing the lottery , " Laurens Drillich , chair of the BNN network , said at the time .
Controversial show made news worldwide
Having grabbed headlines around the globe , producers eventually revealed during the finale that the program had been a hoax designed to raise awareness about the country 's shortage of donors , and the lives and problems facing those waiting for organ donations .
Though the three finalists had been in on the hoax , each was indeed waiting for an organ donation in real life .
The donor was played by an actress .
The show was timed to coincide with the fifth anniversary of the death of Bart de Graaff , the Dutch TV network 's founder , who died after waiting seven years for an organ donation .
Before the show 's revealing finale , producers were condemned by everyone from Dutch Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende to the Royal Netherlands Medical Association .
However , afterwards , some praised the creators for their awareness - raising stunt .
A technician friend once opened the hood of a 1994 Topaz to find everything under the hood was covered in aluminum foil .
When he asked the lady why she would do such a thing , she said it was because the government was following her .
At the time we thought she was crazy , but she just may have been onto something .
Lawmakers in California are doing their best to paint Mercedes Benz into a corner by trying to force the luxury automaker to use the GPS in a suspect 's S430 to help bring him to justice .
The individual in question allegedly struck and killed a jaywalking pedestrian and drove off .
So far , Mercedes has flat - out refused to be helpful in the investigation , choosing instead to protect the privacy of one of their valued customers .
We can definitely understand why Mercedes would have trouble using one of its most expensive options against the very customer that shelled out the big bucks to get it .
At the same time , law enforcement is looking for any way to get a beat on crime to keep us safe .
As you read this , thugs , drug dealers , and bookies across the nation are hitting Google to find ways to disable their navigation systems .

先週のオルタナティブ・ブログで私が一番面白いと思ったのが今泉さんの「後だしジャンケンプラクティス」だった。
＃森川拓男記者が 「オルタナブログ通信」で何と言おうと私にはこの記事が一番印象に残った！w)
で、コメントしようと思ったのだがタイミングを外してしまうと共に長くなったのでエントリーにして以下に記載。
いや、こういう人は結構いますね。特に新規事業開発の場合にいろいろな細かいことにケチをつけるだけつけて自分は手を一切動かさない人。今泉さんのおっしゃるとおりこれって単なる後出しなんで基本的に最初の数回以降は相手にしても仕方がないというのが、私の持論です。
で私の過去の数少ない経験から言って、こういう小上司が新規開発プロジェクトの中間管理職になった場合の対処法は基本的には「あいだ飛ばし」です。該当の小上司の上司、あるいは最終責任者である役員などへの説明会や報告会を期限を切って設定してしまいます。そしてその期限にあわせてリミットをもうけ小上司には一応報告、そこで指摘されたことは反映しますが他はそのままで報告会へ望みます。その際も小上司はたいていグズルので、彼には一言「私は最終ＯＫは出していない」という発言を許してあげると共に、報告の冒頭で「これは今までに無い革新的な試みなので実行にあたっては各所から細かい意見は出ており、それらへも対応中です」という一言を添えておきます。
本音をいうとそういう後出しジャンケンを振りかざす中間管理職をそういうイノベーティブなプロジェクトのしかるべきポジションにおくということ自体が、その組織はイノベーティブな試みにあまりノウハウがない証拠で、そういう組織でイノベーティブな試みをやろうとするのは自殺行為なのであまりお勧めをしませんが、過去にこの手で切り抜けた経験が数度あります。
今泉さんがここで書かれた 「後出しジャンケンプラクティス」以外にも「世界には唯一絶対正しいやり方（答え）が存在する信仰」とか「（今現在のことはさておいといて）解決策の論理的完璧性追求症候群」なんてのもイノベーティブな試みの妨げになりやすい障壁ですよね。
本当にイノベーティブなモノって、過去に前例がないし誰もやったことがないことなんで、たいてい１つや２つは欠点があるものだし、最初から誰でも気がつく穴を持っていることもあります。それでも何か１つ超素晴らしい事があれば多少の欠点なんて吹き飛ばして市場を制覇するものです。そういう事が理解でき無い人はそもそもそういう業務に携わらない（携わらせない）事が一番だと思うんですがねぇ。
In the thirteen years I ’ve been on the web , twelve of which I ’ve spent doing professional web site design , and the last two of which have sent me to hundreds of artists ’ web sites , I ’ve come to the inevitable conclusion that the thing artists want most when placing their art on the web is for it not to be seen .
There are millions upon millions of bad sites on the web , but artists really work at it .
Never have I seen such an array of sites in which artsy designs , misplaced cleverness , highbrow concepts , amateur clumsiness , arrogance and ignorance have been painstakingly employed to drive visitors away .
As a result of this obvious desire of illustrators , painters , comics artists , concept designers and other artists not to be seen , I ’ve created a collection of handy tips for how to send editors , art directors , gallery owners , prospective buyers , webcomics readers and casual users hastily clicking away in search of some portfolio site other than yours .
Got your note pads ready ?
Use a “ free ” hosting service that only charges by making your site display pop -up ads .
Hey , free is free , right ?
Besides , everybody loves pop up ads .
Do n’t bother with real web hosting from decent hosting services even though it can cost $ 8 a month or less , and do n’t bother to look for reviews of hosting services on reputable sites like C / Net .
Also ignore the fact that blogs , when used with “ pages ” instead of “ posts ” can serve as easily constructed , pre-designed and free web sites .
Do n’t take the trouble to get a domain name .
Art directors will remember “ mac.com/users/~joeblow/web/portfolio/intro.html ” much more easily than “ joeblowillustration.com ” when they go to hire their next artist .
Plus “ tripod.com/members/~janedoe/paintings/gallery/thumbnails.html ” is so easy to mention in conversation or recommend to someone else , and it looks great on a business card .
Do n’t consider the fact that domain names can cost less than $ 10 a year , and are often free with real web hosting accounts .
Hey , the good ones are all taken or squatted on , right , so why bother ?
And if you do get a domain name , longer names that are more closely associated with your name or studio , and might be easier to remember , ca n’t possibly be a cool as bizarre , clever , short ones that have nothing to do with you or your work .
Speaking of “ clever ” be sure to use a clever interface design and enigmatic navigation .
All art directors and gallery owners love to play guessing games , and they have plenty of time to click around until they ’ve figured out where on your nifty “ concept site ” you ’ve hidden your artwork .
They ’ll be so impressed with your high concept that they ’ll feel the art is that much more valuable when they finally find it .
In fact , make them wait a bit in anticipation .
Use an Intro Page , especially with a long , clever animated Flash intro that that ca n’t be bypassed , to make sure they ’re in the right mood when they arrive at your fabulous Splash Page , the entire purpose of which is to force them to search for a tiny , almost invisible , “ Enter Site ” button and click on it in order to get to the Main Page , which should be as confusing as possible and from which they must choose “ Creative ” , or some other euphemism for “ Portfolio ” , in order to arrive at the Gallery Selection Page and be presented with choices for which section of the Gallery they want , hopefully named in some arcane terms only you and the members of your fan club would understand , and then choose a Sub - gallery , and ideally a Sub - sub - gallery , before showing them any images .
Make them work for it so they ’ll understand just how important your images are !
Hey , they would n’t have gotten this far if they were n’t , right ?
Use lots of bright , intense colors in the design , particularly in the gallery area .
You want to make sure the colors in your images are suppressed and overshadowed by the design .
After all , the web site itself is the important thing , is n’t it ?
Use tiny , square thumbnails with a nondescript crop from some obscure corner of the artwork .
You would n’t want someone to miss the fun of playing “ Concentration ” when trying to remember where a particular image is ; and if the thumbnails clearly described the images , visitors might actually go to one they like in the eleven seconds they have to look at your site .
Even better , why bother with thumbnails or preview images when clever little dots , squares or enigmatic shapes are so much more artsy ?
Everybody already knows how cool your stuff is , they ’ll certainly take the trouble to click through all the shapes to find an image .
Plus if they come back looking for a particular image , they have the fun of discovering all over again !
Use “ pop - up and close ” style gallery navigation .
Do n’t let them be lazy and click through all of your images with a simple “ Next , Previous , Thumbnails ” style navigation , they might go through your whole portfolio !
Better to make them work for it , open each image in a separate pop -up window and click to close it again before they can click on the next image .
Your fabulous art is worth the trouble !
For an extra incentive , make them wait for a JavaScript that cleverly re-sizes the pop -up window every time before displaying your image .
In fact , the more pop - up windows , the better !
Pop up each gallery , gallery subsection and individual image in a separate pop-up window !
Wheeeee !
Speaking of Javascript , be sure to use one that makes the user ’s browser window reposition itself , or forces it to full screen when they arrive at your site .
Nothing says “ Welcome ” like yanking the user ’s browser out of their hands and making it clear you do n’t think they know how to view your brilliant design properly because they ’re idiots .
Here ’s another good trick , use JavaScript on your thumbnails so that they can only see your full size images on rollover , and the instant they move the mouse , change the image .
The self - control necessary to keep the mouse steady , or carefully take their hands off of it to view the image for more than a split second will keep them on their toes .
You do n’t want any slackers looking at your stuff !
Plus , this has the added advantage of making them wait for the images to pre-load before they can see them .
While you ’ve got the JavaScript book out , pull out the Flash book too .
See if you can find some ways to make your galleries hard to scroll , keep the text from being read by search engines and make the images take forever to display , either by long fades , dramatic transitions or resizing display areas .
( Ignore the fact that Flash can be used responsibly and effectively if you learn how ; that stuff ’s for sissies ! )
Be sure to put your site in frames !
You would n’t want someone to be able to conveniently bookmark a page , or send a link to an individual page to , say , another art director .
You want them to go through the entire navigation process everytime .
Putting your entire site in a single Flash file is good for this too .
As long as you ’re coding , make sure your site is Internet Explorer specific .
You do n’t want any bums using Firefox , Mozilla , Opera , OmniWeb , UNIX , LINUX or a Mac to access your site .
If they ca n’t get a real computer , they should get lost .
Do n’t bother to find out how to make your site search - engine friendly .
True artists have always languished in obscurity .
If you do go insane and decide you ’d like your site to be found , do n’t take the trouble to go to searchenginewatch.com , or similar sites , and learn anything about search engine optimization ; be sure to hire a black - ops , fly - by - night search engine optimization outfit from a country whose name you can’t pronounce , that has sent you a spam email promising to post your site to “ hundreds of search engines ” .
( Those stories about 90 % of all searches taking place on the top four search engines ?
Just rumors !)
Play some tricks !
Use nondescript links , that unsuspecting users think are to other pages in your site , to send them without warning to eBay , your blog , a Flickr gallery or to start the unwanted download of a PDF file .
What fun !
Wow ’em with sound .
If your visitors are in an environment where music is inappropriate , and only have their sound on so Microsoft Word can seranede them when it belches out a document , they ’ll appreciate the welcome relief from boredom that your surprise music explosion brings to them , their unspecting co-workers , and their boss , who needs to loosen up anyway .
On the other hand , if they ’re in a sutuation where music is acceptable , they ’re certain to like what you have picked out better than what ’s on their iPod , and they ’ll appreciate the surprise mash - up of Eine Kleine Nachtmusik and Dust in the Wind .
Besides , your taste in what music they should listen to is obviously much better than theirs .
If you ’re creating your navigation in Flash to keep it hidden from search engines , you can add bonus sound effects to the buttons !
And do n’t let some namby - pamby usability expert talk you into subtle little camera shutter clicks to give user feedback when they click on a button ; imagine some art director ’s deilght at the button for your “ About ” page emitting a sound like a Star Wars light saber slicing through a jet engine housing !
Do n’t learn anything about usability , information design or good navigation practices .
If you ’re making your site yourself , you do n’t want to stifle your creativity with such things , nor do you want to be aware of them if you ’ve hired a “ creative ” web site designer or agency who has promised to make your site “ cutting edge ” .
All that nonsense about making a site easy to use just gets in the way .
Make sure you do n’t read books on web site usability , like Steve Krug ’s Do n’t make Me Think .
Do n’t try to look at your site like someone who ’s never been there before .
Hey , you know where everything is , if some newbies can’t figure it out , screw ’em !
Keep ’em guessing .
The home page is the first impression visitors have of your site , Whatever you do , do n’t set aside a space on the home page , or at the top of your blog , to give first time visitors a succinct description of who you are and what you do , or tell them what kind of site this is .
What fun is that ?
In fact , do what you can to make the intro to your site as enigmatic and obscure as possible ; this is très chic .
Besides , all the important people have already been to your site and know the score ; and the newcomers will love the feeling that they have arrived at the gate of a clandestine private club , and will appreciate the challenge of figuring out the puzzle while they decide whether or not to apply for membership .
Do n’t focus !
Since everybody important has already been to your site , design your home page for their benefit and fill it with the latest news of your comings and goings , or your insightful ruminations on last night ’s episode of Lost .
Do n’t waste that wonderful home page space on introductions for strangers !
Oh , and while you ’re at it , make sure to cram as much as possible on your home page .
It ’s the most important page , right ?
So everything should go there .
Make it long and scrolling and squeeze stuff into every corner .
You do n’t want any wasted white space !
The more stuff vying for attention , the better !
MAKE EVERY LINE A HEADLINE !
Mix colors !
MAKE YOUR HEADLINES LOOK LIKE LINKS !
MAKE YOUR LINKS LOOK LIKE HEADLINES !
Be sure to underline , italicize and bold all kinds of stuff for EMPHASIS !! .
Is n’t this fun ?!
Do n’t forget , the computer gods gave you a milliOn fOntS for a reason ; it would be a sin not to use them .
And be sure to center your text .
It ’s a well established principle
of graphic design that centered text is much easier to read than boring old justified
text .
That ’s why all novels , magazines and newspapers look like wedding
invitiations .
Once you ’ve made your images inaccessible , make yourself inaccessible .
Suppress any unwarranted urge you have to include a brief bio .
At the very least substitute a clever “ fake ” bio that ’s sure to leave ’em laughing .
Or , if you must add a real bio , be sure to write a lengthy multi- pager with your entire life story , your views on all aspects of art , religion and politics and the details on your penchant for eating Oreos dipped in Diet Coke at 4 am in your Sponge Bob underwear .
Do n’t include a short description of your working methods , that might be too interesting or informative .
Make certain your contact information is n’t available , or be sure it ’s presented as some kind of weirdly arranged interactive form , the location of which is hidden and the page for which makes it clear how much you do n’t want anyone to contact you unless you already know them , because they ’re obviously “ fans ” , and as such , beneath your notice .
Most importantly , make sure the images themselves are too small to really convey any feeling for your work .
Remember – all visitors to your portfolio site are malicious parasitic thieves , out to steal your precious artwork and print it on millions of knock - off T - shirts in China !
Do n’t give them anything that makes your work look good enough to steal !!
Better yet , keep your work safe by not putting it on the web at all !
If your work is in print , you need to write your senators and demand they outlaw inexpensive scanners , which can actually be used to grab a high - resolution , printable image of your art .
Now that I think of it , it ’s better to prevent your work from appearing in print too .
Keep it at home in a drawer so no one can see it but you !
Or just watermark everything .
Now we ’re talkin’ !
Make sure your watermark is big and ugly and obliterates any remnant of appeal your tiny images might still allow to be present in your work .
The best phrase to watermark across your images is : “ I think you ’re a thief , you ’re not worthy to look at my brilliant work and you would n’t understand it anyway !
Go away ! ”
See how easy it is ?
By following these simple rules , or just a few of them , you too can make your portfolio site as magnificently unappealing as many other artists !
So grab your copy of Front Page and have at it !
Addendum :
Due to the overwhelming response to this article , and the many requests for information that have stemmed from it , I ’ve started a less entertaining , but hopefully more directly helpful , series of articles on the subject of How to Display Your Art on the Web .

Editor 's note :
This is part of a series of reports CNN.com is featuring for " God 's Warriors , " a documentary hosted by CNN chief international correspondent Christiane Amanpour .
( CNN ) --
At one point in Jared Hutchins ' young life , the Beatles were a big problem .
The rallies , which draw mostly teens , are one part concert , one part Christian revival .
" I had to stop listening to them for a while , " said Hutchins , who lives in Cumming , Georgia , and plays the piano , guitar and harmonica .
He said the group 's world view " had a negative effect on me , " and made him irritable and angry .
" God owns my life , not the Beatles , " he said simply .
Although Hutchins said he enjoys a wide range of music -- from Pink Floyd and Arcade Fire to Christian bands such as Hillsong United -- he said he has to be careful of what music he listens to , for the same reason he temporarily turned off the Beatles .
Hutchins , a 16 - year - old graced with poise and thoughtfulness , is one of many teenagers who say that some part of popular culture , with its ubiquitous references to sex , drugs and violence , has harmed him .
Last year , Hutchins and his Christian youth group attended an Acquire the Fire rally in Atlanta , Georgia , he said .
Acquire the Fire -- regional rallies held across the country -- and BattleCry -- the larger rallies held this year in only three cities -- are the products of the evangelical Christian organization Teen Mania .
Go behind - the - scenes with CNN's Christiane Amanpour at a Battle Cry event »
One part concert , one part Christian revival , the rallies seek to " stage a reverse revolution " against secular popular culture .
They have the pull of headlining rock concerts , drawing thousands of people regardless of the region of the country , the month of year or the day of the week .
The audiences are nearly always predominantly teenagers and young adults .
From 2006 to 2007 , a total of 127,830 people attended the 34 Acquire the Fire rallies , and 71,414 people attended the three BattleCry events held in San Francisco , California ; Detroit , Michigan ; and Bristow , Virginia , according to Teen Mania .
Watch flags , fireworks and teens at rally
For Hutchins , who said he struggled in his early adolescence to fit in and be cool before having a personal experience with God about four years ago , the organization 's message is exactly right .
" We do n't have to be branded by the culture , we are branded by God , " he said .
" Be who God created you to be . "
But the glossy , glamorous appeal of popular culture too often obscures that path to God , Teen Mania followers say .
And so , Ron Luce , the 46 - year - old founder of the organization , has waged a modern - day crusade against " purveyors of popular culture , " whom he has condemned as " the enemy . "
More than two decades old , Teen Mania estimates it has reached more than 2 million teens with its message " of living completely for Christ . "
The organization is sprawling .
In addition to its live stadium rallies , there are BattleCry shirts and hats , mobile screen savers , books and a television program .
There are international mission trips -- Hutchins attended one in Tijuana , Mexico , this summer .
There is even a Teen Mania internship , a one - year program called the Honor Academy , based in Lindale , Texas .
In the live events , Luce couples the earnest appeal of a young father with a preacher 's ability to mobilize a crowd .
He weaves disturbing statistics about teenagers amid his gospel .
Today 's teenagers are in crisis , he says .
" We 're fighting for those who do n't know they have a voice , that are being manipulated by our pop culture indulging in things that , really , they 're not mature enough to be thinking about yet , " Luce told CNN .
" Kids are hurting , " he said .
And of those who he feels inflict these moral wounds , Luce said , " We call them terrorists , virtue terrorists , that are destroying our kids . "
" They 're raping virgin teenage America on the sidewalk , and everybody 's walking by and acting like everything 's OK .
And it 's just not OK . "
To some , Luce 's rhetoric is off - putting , hateful and divisive .
Opponents point to his views on homosexuality -- not " in God 's plan " -- and abortion -- the " ending of a precious life " -- and say Luce is imposing conservative values on vulnerable teenagers .
Explore Americans ' views on religion
It is this criticism that Luce and his followers confronted head - on in March at Battle Cry San Francisco .
There , in arguably the most liberal city in the United States , protesters , armed with megaphones and poster board signs , rallied against BattleCry on the steps of City Hall as the Christian teenagers circled and prayed in a demonstration of their own .
" Ron Luce is a liar ! " one protester shouted .
" Let me hear you say Christian fascist , " another yelled .
Luce and the youths , some as young as 11 , also raised their voices .
" God , I ask that as we do this BattleCry , Lord , that you would reveal yourself to the teenagers , God , here , God , " Mindy Peterson , shouted .
Peterson is a member of Teen Mania 's Honor Academy .
Afterward , Peterson railed against what she said was the protesters ' mischaracterization of BattleCry .
" These people think that our war is against other people .
They think that our war is against man .
And our war is n't .
Our war 's against ... the pain in teenagers ' hearts , like depression , alcoholism .
Those things that -- that are , like , tearing our teenagers apart , " she said .
While much milder in his terms , Hutchins agrees .
" We 're a generation that is kind of troubled , " he said .
Luce wants to " rescue the hearts of our generation , " he added .
And of the critics ' contention that the rallies , the organization , the message is neo-conservatism wrapped in Biblical verse ?
Hutchins smiles , nods patiently .
" I do n't go because I have a political agenda , " he said , adding that his friends do n't , either .
" Mostly , what we 're concerned with is Jesus . "

別に世の中が急に遅くなったわけではなくて、僕のほうが慌しくなっただけなのですが、たとえば育児や仕事の合間にメールをチェックしたいとき、ログイン（というかユーザの切り替え）やページのロードが3秒以内に終わらないと話になりません。短いときは10秒、長くても1分ぐらいすると、別の用ができるからです（会議が始まるとか、子供が寄ってくる:-)とか）。さらに、たとえば事務や学内関係のメールは大半がWordやPDFの添付ファイルなのですが、10秒ぐらいでメールをチェックしなければならないこともよくあるので、開いているだけで時間切れになります。家ではなおさらで、何かをしたくても10秒以内に済まないと、次に手が空くのは、もう夜寝る前だったりします。
というわけで、OSのログイン画面ないしロック画面からメールの表示まで、できれば0.1秒ぐらい、最大でも1秒以内に確実に完了するシステムを強く望みます（←自分で研究しろ）。メールだけではなくて、ブログも同様です。

Résumé
Ces désinformateurs ont :
* un mobile tromper le public en réduisant la diffusion d'informations qui desservent leurs opinions et en distillant de la désinformation .
* des moyens Wikipedia , dont les nombreux articles de qualité attirent des visiteurs et dont des failles laissent toute latitude aux désinformateurs organisés : censure d'information , cabales contre leurs critiques ... * des occasions ménagées par de nombreux contributeurs , par apathie , négligence ( de ce qui ne les concerne pas immédiatement et directement ) ou naïveté .
Afin d'enrayer leurs actions Wikipedia gagnerait à :
établir un mode de décision clair et adéquat donc éclairer les modalités de décision , interdire à quiconque de se substituer d'autorité à la communauté et n'accorder qu'une voix par contributeur ( personne physique ) combattre la profusion comme l'imprécision des règles , dont seuls les magouilleurs bénéficient appliquer la démarche encyclopédique , consistant à éclairer , à son propre mode de fonctionnement accorder à tous , y compris fort modestes , droit de constater laisser , comme stipulé dans le règlement de Wikipedia , tout contributeur faire état d'un constat , même s'il contredit une assertion d'organisme officiel accorder à tout ce qui existe droit d'être décrit interdire de supprimer un article sous prétexte de « faible notoriété » accorder à tous droit de débuter sans mobiliser beaucoup de contributeurs rôdés , automatiser , autant que faire se peut , l'aide aux débutants

Raison de la publication de cet exposé
Voici des incohérences et errements constatés .
Organisation de Wikipedia
Résumé
Wikipedia , en tant que projet ( hors espace encyclopédique , donc pour ce qui concerne les modalités , l'organisation ) et en dépit de ce que certains affirment et imposent , est en théorie démocratiquement piloté par tous les contributeurs ( plutôt que dirigé par un sous - ensemble de participants ) et le consensus y détermine le nécessaire règlement ()
par tous les contributeurs ( plutôt que dirigé par un sous - ensemble de participants ) et le consensus y détermine le nécessaire ( ) le consensus , présidant aux décisions , est mal défini ( exposé )
le consensus est éprouvé par un scrutin sans valeur car tout tricheur peut voter sous autant d'identités d'emprunt qu'il le souhaite ( exposé )
en théorie le contenu de l'encyclopédie n'est pas établi démocratiquement , mais la pratique ne doit rien à cela ( exposé )
Wikipedia n'est pas une démocratie
aux décisions relatives au contenu des articles ,
à l'intangibilité des principes fondateurs ( auxquels correspondent les règles principales )
La définition de Wikipedia énonçait cela ainsi :
Wikipédia n'est pas une démocratie dans la mesure où le contenu d'un article ne peut pas être représentatif de l'opinion de la majorité des contributeurs .
Dans le domaine de la connaissance , une minorité ou une personne seule doivent avoir gain de cause contre l'opinion majoritaire si leurs arguments et leurs raisonnements montrent qu'elles défendent la meilleure approche de la vérité . ( (... ) )
Il n'y a jamais de vote sur le texte d'un article , car la retranscription des connaissances ne peut pas être issue d'un processus démocratique .
En revanche , Wikipédia fait abondamment appel à des procédures de vote pour prendre des décisions ( lire les prises de décisions en cours ou passées ) .
Ces décisions concernent notamment : les règles de fonctionnement de la wikipédia en langue française ,
la suppression des articles , s'il est estimé qu'ils ne correspondent pas aux objectifs de Wikipédia ,
Même des tenants de la stance Wikipedia n'est pas une démocratie abusivement généralisée s'emploient à déterminer qui dirige .
Sitôt dans le présent soulignée cette question fut reprise , certains ne saisissant pas qu'il s'agit du mode de mise au point de l'organisation du projet ( conventions démocratiquement adoptées ) et non de celui du contenu encyclopédique ( non démocratique , car jusqu'à plus ample informé aucun participant ne souhaite établir de démocratie d'opinion ) , pour commencer au le bistro .
L'amalgame ne trompe pas tout le monde et les réponses de certains de ceux qui affirment que WP n'est pas démocratiquement organisé expriment semble - t - il un constat plutôt qu'un souhait , et que les plus hostiles à la démocratie sont les détenteurs du pouvoir .
Mi-2007 cette description du mode de fonctionnement a été supprimée et ce document n'énonce plus , depuis , comment sa communauté pilote ce projet ( hors de l'imprécis « Les règles et conventions d'écriture sont définies indépendamment dans chaque langue par les internautes » ) ... si elle le peut ...
Depuis fin 2007 et le massacre électoral ( cabalistique ? ! )
d'Hesoneofus ( le mode de gouvernement de wikipedia ( (... ) ) favorise l'apparition de groupes homogènes au détriment d'une représentativité de la communauté ) le front semble calme , mais accrochages et défections ne manquent pas .
Imprécision de la notion de « vérité » et de son importance
Discrets aménagements
Or la règle fondamentale citée ci-devant en appelait à une meilleure approche de la vérité .
Cela sera supprimé mi-2007 mais la mention « Cette démarche risque de viser à atteindre le consensus social plutôt que la vérité » échappait alors encore , dans cette règle , aux manipulations .
L'expression de ce souci de la vérité a été supprimée en février 2008 par Barraki , qui commenta cette destruction d'un « dites , ça sert à quoi les articles détaillés ? » laissant entendre que ce qu'il supprimait ainsi était ou serait ventilé , ce qui revient à considérer la vérité comme ancillaire dans Wikipédia donc est discutable .
Pis , il ne reproduisit ainsi qu'une faible partie de l'exposé , le reste passa semble - t - il aux oubliettes .
Cette éjection du souci de vérité ne provoqua aucune réaction .
Les autres éléments ainsi supprimés de l'article traitaient de l'« Absence de filtrage des éditeurs et de comité de validation » et de « Neutralité de point de vue et recherche du consensus » .
Ils y restèrent longtemps donc étaient considérés comme des caractéristiques fondamentales de Wikipedia et le sont encore , à notre sens , pour de nombreux contributeurs .
Une partie de l'exposé a purement et simplement disparu , une autre se trouve à présent dans un obscur article de l'espace encyclopédique « Critiques de Wikipédia » ( alors même qu'un article mieux placé ( zone ' Wikipédia ' ) existe ) , donc est ramenée au rang de simple critique alors qu'elle resta longtemps une caractéristique proclamée .
Ces suppressions et rejets aux oubliettes de sections relatives à l'absence de comité de validation , à la neutralité de point de vue et à la recherche du consensus n'étonnent pas car leur exécuteur , par Barraki , n'est autre que Bourbaki , dont des déclarations , formulées un an plus tôt , montrent qu'il souhaite transformer Wikipedia en revue à comité de lecture .
Ce que nous venons d'exposer tout comme son peu d'empressement à répondre aux questions gênantes relatives à l'affaire J- P Petit , laissent craindre qu'il agit déjà comme si c'était le cas ( et comme s'il était membre de ce comité , refusant ou détruisant arbitrairement du contenu ) .
Les objectifs des contributeurs
Si nous étions quelques siècles en arrière , WP affirmerait - elle principalement que le Soleil tourne autour de la Terre ?
La formulation :
n'établit pas clairement que la question porte sur la ' vérité officielle ' ( donc de l'« état actuel du savoir » , ce qui n'est pas « la somme des savoirs » ) voire de la ' vérité du commun ' ( ce que pensent la plupart des vivants ) le ' principalement ' cause une inutile imprécision , elle n'est pas équivalente à « faut - il ne tolérer que l'explication acceptée par les autorités du moment ? » le choix d'un thème scientifique ( astronomie ) évacue une bonne part de la difficulté ( le sondage concerne implicitement l'ensemble des articles , relevant parfois de thèmes pour lesquels aucune ' vérité ' établie n'existe ) ,
en ne négligeant pas les théories autres
ne pas faire la part trop belle aux thèses marginales
et l'état des controverses
rend compte éventuellement des théories alternatives
si les théories alternatives se basent sur un raisonnement logique , scientifique elles ont également leur place sur Wikipédia
Ce qui ne veut pas dire qu'il faut oublier de mentionner les thèses minoritaires
les thèses minoritaires / contestées doivent être aussi citées
si une seule personne fournit la preuve que sa théorie est juste alors elle doit être mentionnée en priorité
Espace proportionnel à la reconnaissance des points de vue respectifs
se doit de mentionner les polémiques en cours
il est capital dans nos contributions de ne pas donner seulement la théorie dominante
sans négliger de présenter aussi les controverses
Imprécision de la notion de consensus
Precise numbers for " supermajority " are hard to establish , and Wikipedia is not a majoritarian democracy , so simple vote - counting should never be the key part of the interpretation of a debate .
However , when supermajority voting is used , it should be seen as a process of ' testing ' for consensus , rather than reaching consensus ( (... ) )
This issue is controversial , and there is no consensus about having numerical guidelines .
That said , the numbers mentioned as being sufficient to reach supermajority vary from about 60 % to over 80 %
Le consensus même reste mal défini et rien de mesurable n'en rend compte .
En théorie il est atteint lorsqu'aucun droit de veto n'est exercé , comme rappelé en ces termes :
Le droit de veto , détenu par chacun sur une proposition du reste du groupe , est la pierre angulaire de la méthode du consensus . ( (... ) )
Les prises de décision par nombreuses communautés virtuelles , comme celles de la Wikipédia , souvent suivent ce type d'approche .
D'autres exposèrent divers effets de la quête de consensus et le caractère disputé de cette notion apparaît clairement dans le Wikipedia en anglais ( bandeau
The status of this policy or guideline is disputed ) .
En pratique un scrutin tranche souvent une question en laissant une proportion de mécontents incompatible avec le consensus ( exemple ) .
Mauvaise gestion des scrutins
Le règlement invite chacun à publier liste de ses faux nez et à ne pas les employer de façon abusive , par exemple afin de voter plusieurs fois .
Toutefois aucune liste électorale ne garantit , entre autres , que nulle personne physique ne vote plusieurs fois .
Des conseils officiellement dispensés énoncent :
Si jamais quelqu'un suggère que Wikipédia devrait devenir une communauté exemple de démocratie par la majorité ...
Faites part à l'individu concerné que c'est tout à fait possible pour les wikipédiens de se créer d'autres noms et de voter plus d'une fois .
Ne créez pas sept autres pseudo - wikipédiens qui seront toujours de votre avis .
Si certains emploient honnêtement des faux nez , les abus avérés ne manquent pas ( Kouroineko - Nezumi ... ) et laissent redouter la présence de magouilleurs plus discrets .
Le tricheur Kouroineko -' Nezumi ' écrivit , en guise de conclusion : profitez en pour réfléchir aux limites de cette procédure , actuellement les élections ( (... ) ) n'ont plus beaucoup de signification , mais cela n'a pas ouvert de réflexion et le défaut demeure .
Pis : l'identité véritable ( dans la vie civile ) des tricheurs chassés reste inconnue , on peut redouter que certains reviennent derechef sous d'autres pseudonymes .
Nezumi a par exemple été , début 2007 , détecté sous de nouveaux pseudonymes ( en mars puis en juin 2007 ) , toutefois des astuces simples rendent quasi impossible d'être ainsi découvert .
Les dispositions proposées sont d'ordre quantitatif car portent sur les efforts que doit concéder un tricheur afin d'obtenir ou de conserver une voix .
Ce dernier , l'audience de Wikipedia augmentant , jugera vraisemblablement utile de contribuer sous divers faux - nez afin d'obtenir des droits de vote grâce auxquels il distordra le contenu de l'encyclopédie , par exemple en désinformant afin de favoriser ses opinions ou produits .
Cette disposition , en l'état , augmente la probabilité qu'en moyenne " l'électeur honnête , qui n'emploie pas de faux nez afin de voter " participe donc connaisse bien le projet .
Mais elle ne découragera pas les tricheurs , surtout résolus ( les plus dangereux ) , tant que l'organisation des élections restera discutable .
En 2011 la Fondation gérant le projet analyse l'évolution de l'activité et prend conscience que quelque chose ne fonctionne pas au mieux .
En WP fr un moyen officiel de contester le statut d'un administrateur est proposé .
Des scrutins établissent une part du contenu de l'encyclopédie
le contenu d'un article ne peut pas être représentatif de l'opinion de la majorité des contributeurs
il n'y a jamais de vote pour déterminer le contenu d'un article
En pratique le contenu de l'encyclopédie est établi par voie de scrutin puisque la suppression d'articles est ainsi décidée , or déterminer ce qui n'a pas droit de cité dans l'encyclopédie façonne son contenu .
D'une certaine façon il en va de même avec les articles de qualité ( AdQ ) , qui relèvent également d'une forme de démocratie d'opinion .
Le règlement énonce qu'après un scrutin ' page à supprimer ' si aucun consensus clair ne se dégage , le choix est laissé à l'appréciation de l'administrateur .
Comme nous l'avons exposé le caractère ' clair ' d'un consensus reste indéfini donc , en pratique , des administrateurs peuvent détruire ce qui leur déplaît et des débats houleux suivent parfois une suppression abusive .
Même un briscard s'en soucie .
Une sorte de démocratie règne également , au quotidien et malgré les principes énoncés , en ce qui concerne le contenu d'un article donné ( exemple ) comme en matière de taxinomie .
Or il n'est pas de démocratie peuplée d'anonymes .
Anonymat
En revanche l'anonymat dissimule si nécessaire des causes de biais possibles , par exemple l'activité professionnelle .
Toutefois l'anonymat reste parfois nécessaire .
Ce que nous proposons ne l'interdit pas grâce à une liste associant une personne physique et un pseudonyme donné , à laquelle seul un cercle restreint de responsables Wikipedia accéderait .
Wikipedia devient un vecteur de désinformation
la propagande est à la démocratie ce qu'est la matraque à l'état totalitaire
Des désinformateurs emploient divers moyens , exposant le projet à divers risques .
Risque induit par la distorsion des critères d'admission d'un exposé
neutralité de point de vue
consensuelle
" Partout publié " n'implique ni " non criticable " , ni " neutre "
Les articles relevant d'autres domaines pâtissent parfois des effets de paradoxes nés du souci même d'exhaustivité de représentation des savoirs et de neutralité .
Ni vrai ni neutre n'y ont parfois de sens universellement accepté .
Seuls certains propos scientifiques peuvent être " vrais et neutres " pour tous .
Existe - t - il un exposé vrai et neutre d'ordre politique , spirituel ou historique ?
Certains contributeurs de Wikipedia négligent cela et distordent la neutralité en affirmant que ce qui vaut pour le scientifique est universel , donc en ne tolérant , dans les articles , que des exposés qualifiés de factuels et en mesurant cette qualité par l'importance relative de leurs ' sources ' ( émetteurs ) : statut , nombre d'individus représentés , richesse , réputation ...
Par fait , ces contributeurs entendent en somme information partout relayée , oubliant que cette définition ne vaut que dans le domaine scientifique où tous les acteurs disposent de moyens et où la publication mène à une efficace revue par les pairs grâce à laquelle tout un chacun peut montrer la fausseté d'une assertion .
Ils jugent en somme que le caractère vérifiable de la publication d'une information implique son exposition publique laissant à tout un chacun la possibilité de l'examiner , ce qui est vrai .
Toutefois ils affirment qu'elle sera par conséquent examinée , ce qui est faux , et , pis , que toute critique étayée sera publiée par une source d'information connue voire mènera les auteurs de l'errement à publier un rectificatif .
Ne tolérer que des assertions très diffusées avantage celles des riches et des puissants car lorsque la notoriété se mesure grâce à Google n'importe qui peut , en dépensant temps et argent , se forger une " notoriété " .
Il en irait du Web comme des organes de presse où les plus riches forgent l'opinion .
Relayons , répétons ... il en délestera toujours quelque chose
le quantitatif ( nombre et importances des sources ) garantit le qualitatif ( exactitude , exhaustivité et neutralité )
Ces fâcheux donnent raison à Goebbels clamant que tout mensonge suffisamment répété devient vérité , à Staline s'exclamant Le Patriarche ... combien de divisions ? , au benêt serinant ce que diffuse le Ministère de l'Information est toujours factuel ! .
Ils savent présenter une citation comme si elle reflétait un fait alors même qu'il est parfois aisé de montrer qu'elle omet des éléments importants , distord le propos , voire recèle un mensonge .
Risque induit par l'absence de perspective
Après avoir lu un article beaucoup ne mémorisent pas telle grande entité proclama que BLABLA mais bien Wikipedia , qui me semble honnête et rigoureuse , publie qu'un Grand Établissement affirma que BLABLA ... donc BLABLA est vrai .
Ces risques ne menaçaient en théorie pas Wikipedia ...
pertinente , étayée , ne recèle pas de théorie nouvelle ni n'en utilise , ne propose pas de synthèse et est exposée de façon neutre
Dans certains cas , par exemple lorsque les moyens des critiques potentiels sont très inférieurs à ceux des émetteurs de certaines " informations " , l'auteur d'une mise en perspective recevable est un inconnu .
Selon certains contributeurs de Wikipedia elle ne recèle aucune valeur encyclopédique .
Le règlement de Wikipedia rejetait ce critère car énonçait : les affirmations dont la vérification expérimentale est triviale ( par exemple : les voitures des facteurs français sont jaunes ) ne requièrent pas de sources et le critère relatif aux travaux inédits précisa longtemps :
((... ) ) une référence sourcée est souhaitable .
Ceci ne signifie pas que seuls les travaux publiés peuvent être repris dans Wikipédia : la connaissance n'est pas qu'une affaire de spécialistes .
Une remarque de bon sens ( même originale ) est bien entendu légitime dans un article , de même que le rappel d'informations pertinentes dont la validité n'est pas sujette à critique .
Les travaux inédits correspondent à des recherches qui n'ont jamais été publiées en dehors de Wikipédia , ou que l'on ne peut associer qu'à des sources jugées confidentielles et / ou peu fiables .
... en pratique la désinformation va bon train
C'est inapplicable à Wikipedia où le gros des contributeurs reste anonyme ( lui - même l'est ) , ce qui rend difficile de prouver une expertise .
Par ailleurs s'en tenir à cela négligerait que certains sont juges et parties .
Dans le passé certains pensaient que les méfaits du tabac n'étaient jamais mieux exposés que par les experts donc les professionnels du domaine , fabricants de cigarettes en tête ...
Par ailleurs il choisit ainsi d'ignorer les dispositions citées qui écartent explicitement cela ( " la connaissance n'est pas qu'une affaire de spécialistes " ) , bien résumées par la présentation officielle du projet :
Écrit dans le respect de la « neutralité de point de vue » , définie par Jimmy Wales comme le fait de « décrire le débat plutôt que d'y participer » .
Dans la mesure du possible , toute écriture encyclopédique dans Wikipédia doit se garder de prendre parti pour un point de vue dans une discussion argumentée .
La neutralité de point de vue consiste à présenter les idées et les faits de manière indépendante des préjugés et opinions idéologiques , culturels , religieux , identitaires , philosophiques , etc. de façon à satisfaire les partisans autant que les détracteurs d'un sujet polémique .
Bien entendu , il est difficile de parvenir à un accord dans tous les cas .
Sur Wikipédia , les règles d'écriture visent à convenir aux personnes rationnelles , même si celles - ci ne sont pas toujours du même avis .
La politique de neutralité de Wikipédia indique que toutes les facettes d'un point controversé doivent être évoquées , et que l'article ne doit en aucune façon déclarer ou insinuer qu'un des points de vue est celui qui est correct a priori .
La neutralité n'implique cependant pas la représentation à égalité des différents points de vue .
Wikipédia accorde naturellement plus de place à des points de vue répandus , notamment chez les spécialistes , et bien étayés , qu'aux points de vue de certains groupes minoritaires .
De plus , si un point de vue est très minoritaire , par exemple soutenu uniquement par des groupes aux tendances idéologiques spécifiques , il sera décrit comme tel .
seules les thèses officielles ont droit de cité
They must find it difficult ... Those who have taken authority as the truth , rather than truth as the authority
Ces factions emploient divers artifices afin d'écoeurer , d'épuiser , de censurer voire de bloquer d'autres contributeurs .
Faute de pouvoir prouver qu'un exposé n'est pas pertinent et exact , un censeur le rejettera en exploitant une règle employée de façon abusive ou bien un motif flou , sans montrer qu'il s'applique .
Pour cela il le qualifiera sans étayer de :
Il semble parfois difficile de déterminer si une mise en perspective donnée doit ou non trouver place dans un article .
Dans certains cas une guerre d'édition ( un contributeur ajoute une thèse dans l'article , un autre l'en retire , puis le premier l'y restaure ... ) fait rage , ou la ' discussion ' relative au contenu d'un article s'enlise .
Sélection des sources ( « pertinence »...)
M. Jancovici et Greenpeace : 54/106 en WP fr , 6/280 en WP
en
M. Jancovici publie également en langue anglaise .
Son rayonnement international semble toutefois limité car seuls 6 articles encyclopédiques de Wikipedia anglais ( " WP en " ) référencent son site .
Dans l'un d'entre eux le lien a été ajouté par un administrateur de Wikipedia en français , dont c'est la seule " contribution " réelle à l'article et qui référence ainsi un travail inédit , théoriquement non admissible .
Dans un autre un certain « Thierryc » ( on peut penser qu'il s'agit vraisemblablement d'un francophone ... ) ajouta un lien de même nature , et c'était là encore sa seule " contribution " à l'article .
Dans deux autres articles ( ici et là ) le même « Thierryc » continue sa campagne de promotion ( car l'intéressant concept d'« esclave énergétique » n'est a priori pas une première de M. Jancovici mais plus vraisemblablement de Buckminster Fuller ou d'Hans - Peter Dürr , WP fr est à ce titre plus au fait , tandis que la notion de scénario d'émission n'est pas davantage l'un de ses décisifs apports et est bien exposée dans des articles de WP en , en particulier Climate_change_scenario ) .
Dans un autre article le lien est une fois de plus contribution unique , cette fois d'un anonyme dont le numéro IP laisse supposer qu'il se trouvait alors en Belgique , et porte aussi sur l'esclave énergétique .
L'auteur d'un autre , qui est encore un « travail inédit » , est Couposanto , qui annonce avoir pour langue maternelle le français et cite par ailleurs Luc Ferry ( l'ex - ministre ) .
En résumé ces quelques liens proviennent manifestement de francophones ( de français ? ) et fleurent la promotion , aucun des documents ainsi référencés ne recèle d'élément nouveau ou clé et tous sont théoriquement non pertinents dans Wikipedia car relèvent du travail inédit .
On peut supposer que ces liens perdurent par négligence tandis que d'autres furent rejetés .
Chacun jugera du " rayonnement " international et de l'intérêt de tout cela .
Côté WP fr la question de la pertinence est tranchée car des documents de M. Jancovici sont , en avril 2011 , cités dans 54 articles encyclopédiques .
Certains de ces derniers gratifient en outre le lecteur de liens vers des ouvrages de M. Jancovici ( par exemple Bilan carbone ) .
Afin de mettre en perspective précisons que Greenpeace est cité dans 106 articles de Wikipedia en français et dans 280 de WP en anglais .
Cette association publie des études , parfois réalisées par des experts reconnus qui sont citées par Wikipedia en français lorsqu'elles ne menacent pas un pré carré ( par exemple dans Thon ) .
Dans le cas cité de l'article traitant du bilan carbone l'association Greenpeace , qui publia à ce propos ( par exemple un document , plus autorisé car co-signé « E&E Consultant ; Expert - réviseur du Groupe « mitigation » au 4e rapport du GIEC ») n'est ... pas même évoquée .
De surcroît M. Jancovici ne s'occupe que d'énergétique et de changement climatique tandis que le champ d'action de Greenpeace est plus large ( énergie et climat mais aussi espèces menacées , OGM , océans ... ) , ce qui devrait creuser l'écart en faveur de l'association .
En résumé Greenpeace n'est sur Wikipedia en français , pour ce qui concerne l'électronucléaire , manifestement pas aussi en odeur de sainteté que ce dont M. Jancovic nous honore .
Wikipedia en français ... L'« encyclopédie » où les publications d'un expert rémunéré par le ministère de tutelle d'une filière , et dont l'expertise ( maladroitement promue sur WP en anglais ) est négligée par les tiers sont ... en proportion davantage citées que celles , forgées par des experts internationaux , d'une association connue formant théoriquement contre - pouvoir quant aux informations diffusées .
Il n'y a vraisemblablement aucune conspiration sous - jacente mais les opinions de contributeurs influents de WP fr les exposent manifestement à juger « plus pertinent » ce qui leur plaît .
Titres des articles concernés .
sont - ils pertinents , étayés , sans théorie nouvelle et exposés de façon neutre ?
Ces scrutins n'ont d'autre intérêt que d'exposer de façon synthétique et publique des controverses trop souvent aujourd ' hui noyées dans les discussions liées aux articles .
Ils rendront mesurables les actions de groupes soucieux de garder la mainmise sur des pans du contenu de l'encyclopédie .
Procéder par voie de scrutin n'aurait rien de nouveau car , par exemple et comme déjà exposé , le processus de suppression d'article s'applique à des cas tout aussi apparemment difficiles à dénouer puisqu'il vise à déterminer dans quelle mesure un article ( nous citerons ici des éléments du document officiel ( note ) : traite d'un sujet dont la notoriété ou l'intérêt encyclopédique est nul , est incompréhensible , diffame , est un poème , contient une grossièreté , est une discussion ...
La documentation Wikipedia relative aux critères d'admissibilité des articles n'offre quasi pas de critères mesurables .
Dans un monde idéal la précision de leur énoncé rendrait leur application automatisable , mais c'est pour le moment impossible .
Par conséquent tout contributeur serait invité à participer à leur application via un scrutin déclenché par l'un d'eux en vertu d'au moins un critère et dont le résultat scellerait pour un temps le sort de l'article considéré .
Déterminer si une mise en perspective disputée relève ou non des critères flous nous semble moins difficile qu'appliquer ceux relatifs à la notoriété ou à la clarté , or la procédure aujourd ' hui réservée à la suppression des articles repose sur ces derniers .
Nous proposons que le règlement recommande d'employer un scrutin afin de trancher les débats portant sur la pertinence d'un exposé , donc de prononcer caduc le principe selon lequel il n'y a jamais de vote pour déterminer le contenu d'un article ( en pratique il l'est déjà ) .
Ce serait à notre sens imparfait mais moins arbitraire .
Exemple de désinformation : l'article " catastrophe de Tchernobyl "
4000 en tout
Une présentation chronologique des faits éclaire les errements .
Certains contributeurs ( note : notre pseudonyme , sur Wikipedia , est ' Natmaka ' ) refusèrent toute modification de l'article proposée afin qu'il rende compte de ceux des travers pourtant alors déjà patents et décrits de l'hypothèse diffusée qui découlaient du simple rappel d'informations pertinentes dont la validité n'est pas sujette à critique .
L'article Wikipedia relaya par conséquent durant des mois de la désinformation , sans aucune mise en perspective .
Pis : il laisse entendre que le Dr. Repacholi , éditeur du rapport de l'OMS , cautionne le chapeau du communiqué ( " max 4000 décès " ) proposé , alors qu'il le rejette .
Cette distorsion est encore publiée en décembre 2007 .
Mais peu importe aux naïfs et aux désinformateurs soucieux de ne consigner dans l'article Wikipedia que le ' résumé ' de cette ' étude ' publié par de grands établissements ( agences de l'ONU ) , sans aucun commentaire éclairant .
Il est facile de montrer que son contenu est mensonger mais ils rejettent tout exposé le révélant .
De la même façon , à leur sens , seules les contre - thèses émises par des établissement reconnus peuvent résider dans l'article Wikipedia , et dévoiler la nature mensongère d'un propos en fournissant les références d'informations sûres constitue selon eux une " recherche originale " , une " opinion " ou l'un quelconque des critères flous grâce auxquels ils censurent .
Nous n'avons pu , malgré de longues et pénibles tentatives , faire admettre ne serait - ce que des faits établis .
Par conséquent nombre de lecteurs de l'article , faute d'adéquate mise en perspective , mémorisèrent les " résultats " présentés : une étude scientifique définitive et adoptée par l'ONU prévoit que la catastrophe de Tchernobyl causera 4000 décès en tout .
Cette désinformation régna sans contrepoint dans l'édition française de Wikipedia jusqu 'en avril 2006 , puis des doutes furent de nouveau émis mais il resta impossible de publier l'exposé montrant que le public fut mal informé car les auteurs des informations douteuses , bien relayées , publièrent un nouveau rapport au contenu et résumé différents mais ne diffusèrent pas de rectificatif .
Le terme '' désinformation ' ' semble à ce titre adéquat et nul n'a pris la peine de montrer qu'il ne s'applique pas ou bien de prouver l'inanité des éléments étayant l'exposé proposé , par conséquent seule une arbitraire censure chasse de l'article cette information , ainsi que ce qui l'étaye , au profit d'une version partiale et lénifiante et au mépris de toute demande d'explication , alors même que le fond de l'exposé écarté a déjà été repris par des sources d'information fiables ( entre autres New Scientist et Nature ) .
Même une longue lutte ne laissa pas moyen d'énoncer des faits , tandis que le mensonge véhiculé par le communiqué officiel trouva d'emblée droit de cité .
Wikipedia publie par conséquent depuis longtemps ( juillet 2006 , novembre 2007 ) un exposé lénifiant et trompeur car :
le communiqué qualifie le rapport de prévoyant un maximum de 4000 décès en tout , définitif , ONU et scientifique alors que des informations publiques ( disponibles dès sa publication ) montrent que rien de tout cela n'est recevable .
Les éléments en révélant le caractère mensonger ( non définitif , non scientifique , non ONU ) seraient , selon les censeurs , des " travaux inédits " ou des " opinions " alors qu'ils sont en réalité des constats facilement vérifiables ( non définitif puisque remplacé en avril 2006 , non scientifique car le responsable de l'étude les rejeta , non ONU car cet organisme publia celui d'avril 2006 ) .
Par conséquent , et pour les raisons déjà exposées , ils devraient se trouver dans l'article .
alors que des informations publiques ( disponibles dès sa publication ) montrent que rien de tout cela n'est recevable .
Les éléments en révélant le caractère mensonger ( non définitif , non scientifique , non ONU ) seraient , selon les censeurs , des " travaux inédits " ou des " opinions " alors qu'ils sont en réalité des constats facilement vérifiables ( non définitif puisque remplacé en avril 2006 , non scientifique car le responsable de l'étude les rejeta , non ONU car cet organisme publia celui d'avril 2006 ) .
Par conséquent , et pour les raisons déjà exposées , ils devraient se trouver dans l'article .
l'article accorde le bénéfice du doute aux auteurs du communiqué mensonger dont le lecteur peut penser que la présentation n'était abusive que par erreur .
Or leur mauvaise foi est patente , puisqu'ils ne publièrent pas de rectificatif ( annonçant clairement que les éléments de fin 2005 n'étaient ni définitifs , ni ONU ... ) , même après publication du rapport véritablement définitif ( et alors que les media reprirent durant des mois les " informations " mensongères ) , or l'article ne l'expose pas mais recèle par exemple : la phrase L'ambiguïté du communiqué , qui met en avant un chiffre de 4 000 morts qui n'est expliqué et nuancé que plus loin , a incité la presse et les médias à présenter ce chiffre comme un bilan total de toutes les victimes de l'accident . , exonèrant à bon compte les désinformateurs , la douteuse " citation " des propos du Dr Repacholi .
la formule
Le contenu du communiqué complète cette estimation , employée dans l'article , est mensongère car la présentation du communiqué ( Au maximum 4000 décès en tout , globalement ) à laquelle elle se réfère ne reflète pas le contenu du rapport ( qui énonçait alors 4000 dans un sous - groupe , qui ne saurait « compléter » 4000 en tout ) .
Un communiqué de presse publié en septembre 2005 par l'IAEA et l'OMS résume un rapport provisoire .
Le chapeau du communiqué prévoit 4000 décès en tout et présente ce bilan comme un rapport de l'ONU émanant de nombreux scientifiques .
Voici le titre et le premier paragraphe de la version française officielle du communiqué :
__________________
Tchernobyl : l'ampleur réelle de l'accident 20 ans après , un rapport d'institutions des Nations Unies donne des réponses définitives et propose des moyens de reconstruire des vies Jusqu'à 4 000 personnes au total pourraient à terme décéder des suites d'une radio - exposition consécutive à l'accident survenu il y a une vingtaine d'années dans la centrale nucléaire de Tchernobyl : telles sont les conclusions d'une équipe internationale de plus d'une centaine de scientifiques .
__________________
Le contenu du communiqué ( page 7 ) prévoit 4000 décès ( cancers et leucémies ) parmi les 600000 personnes les plus touchées ( et non au total ) .
Le communiqué présentait le rapport sous - jacent comme adopté par l'ONU , or il ne l'était pas car les agences de cette organisation doivent lui soumettre leurs études pour approbation ( Cf. statuts de l'IAEA , IV.5.E.6 : Approve reports to be submitted to the United Nations as required by the relationship agreement between the Agency and the United Nations ) , ce qui n'avait alors pas été fait puisque l'ONU adoptera une autre version du rapport , publiée en avril 2006 et ajoutant 5000 décès parmi 6 millions de personnes proches du site tout en restreignant le périmètre de l'ensemble des 9000 décès aux seuls cancers solides .
Les noms des scientifiques qui , selon le chapeau du communiqué de 2005 , auraient formulé le bilan d'emblée proposé ( Jusqu'à 4 000 personnes au total ... telles sont les conclusions d'une équipe internationale de plus d'une centaine de scientifiques ) ne furent pas publiés .
Le responsable du rapport pour l'OMS ( M. Repacholi , qui quitta l'OMS en juin 2006 ) déclara , durant une conférence tenue en septembre 2005 , que les scientifiques chargés de l'étude , face à l'incertitude , ne souhaitaient pas communiquer de données numériques relatives aux nombre de décès prévus mais que le service chargé des relations publiques voulait que le résumé en contienne ( cf. Nuclear News , revue professionnelle de l'industrie nucléaire , numéro d'octobre 2005 , page 46 ) .
Par ailleurs le rapport d'étude dont cette hypothèse découlait n'existait alors qu'à l'état de brouillon , donc n'avait pas subi la revue par les pairs .
Le chapeau du communiqué , en somme , présentait l'hypothèse de bilan comme globale alors qu'elle ne l'était pas , et la qualifiait à tort d'issue d'un rapport émanant de l'ONU , définitive et scientifiquement établi .
De très nombreux media et établissements divers relayèrent , et citent parfois encore , les éléments inexacts exprimés dans le chapeau du communiqué .
Certains , toutefois , la critiquèrent ( « La présentation du Forum Tchernobyl en septembre 2005 est ( il n'y pas d'autre mot ) mensongère » , selon H. Kempf ( Le Monde du 26 Avril 2006 ) .
L'IAEA et l'OMS ne publièrent pas d'erratum , même lors de l'adoption du rapport final par l'ONU ( 7 mois après publication du communiqué ) , donc laissent les media propager l'hypothèse de bilan erronée .
Le bilan d'emblée proposé est-il bien " Jusqu'à 4 000 personnes au total " ?
Est-il bien suivi de " telles sont les conclusions d'une équipe internationale de plus d'une centaine de scientifiques " ?
Pouvez - vous exhiber le document reprenant cette hypothèse ( 4000 morts au total ) et signé de scientifiques ?
Si vous ne le pouvez : cette thèse est - elle scientifique ?
Autre approche ( je vous facilite la tâche en fournissant les réponses correctes entre parenthèses ) : Repacholi est-il scientifique ( OUI ) ?
Est -il l'éditeur du rapport ( OUI ) ?
Est-il , à ce titre , autorisé à déterminer ce qui est ou non scientifique ( OUI ) ?
A - t - il déclaré que les scientifiques refusaient de citer un nombre dans le résumé ( OUI ) ?
Un nombre y a -t - il été cité ( OUI ) ?
Ce nombre était - il présenté , dans le chapeau , comme l'hypothèse des scientifiques ( OUI ) ?
Est-il , par conséquent , raisonnable d'écrire que le nombre était présenté en tant qu'hypothèse scientifique alors qu'il ne l'était pas ( OUI ) ?
Autre approche : soit l'assertion 4000 décès au total , dite " A " , et 4000 décès imputables aux seuls cancers solides et leucémies , parmi les seuls 600000 les plus exposés , dite " B " . " A " se trouvait - elle dans le brouillon de rapport des scientifiques ( NON ) ?
" A " se trouvait - elle dans le communiqué ( OUI ) ?
" A " est - elle équivalente à " B " ( NON ) ?
" A " est-elle , dans le communiqué , présentée comme formulée par les scientifiques ( OUI ) ?
Par ailleurs : " B " se trouvait - elle dans le brouillon de rapport des scientifiques ( OUI , comme énoncé dans le texte proposé : " Le contenu du communiqué propose une autre estimation ... " ) , mais cela ne change rien ici .
Chacune de ces approches n'est - elle pas suffisante ?
Un mensonge constitué de strates de citations biaisées
des descriptions nouvelles et des interprétations historiques avec des citations de documents primaires visant à appuyer leur interprétation
Si des déclarations lénifiantes et incohérentes abusivement prêtées à l'ONU semblent bienvenues sur Wikipedia fr , ce que formula en public le secrétaire général de cette organisation n'y a pas droit de cité ( une autre modification révèle encore mieux l'objectif poursuivi ) .
Exemple de coterie cabaliste à l'oeuvre
Les membres d'une coterie s'échangent peut - être plus ou moins explicitement des prestations ( " je te soutiens , tu m'assisteras en retour ... " ) et bénéficient de bonnes réputations fondées sur de la belle ouvrage ( chasser des dingues , des pollueurs et des idiots ) accomplie , voire de postes reconnus .
Ils emploient leurs réputations et titres afin de dissimuler l'élimination de contributions recevables mais desservant leurs opinions .
D'aucuns croiront détecter ici une « théorie du complot » mais nous leur saurons gré d'examiner les références ( liens ) étayant notre exposé et à nous expédier leurs critiques .
Ce que peu distinguent n'en existe pas moins et les faits décrits ci-après procèdent selon nous de cabales ( dans le sens Intrigues secrètes ourdies contre quelqu'un , pour l'atteindre dans sa réputation , ses actions ou ses oeuvres ) menées afin d'éloigner de Wikipedia des contributeurs soucieux d'exposer certains faits .
Nous employons ici délibérément ce terme qui , outre le fait d'être adéquat , interdit semble - t- il à nombre de sots , avant tout soucieux du respect de la " langue de bois " , de lire plus avant .
Selon certains tout ceci relève de notre " parano " mais cela ne vaudrait que s'il n'y avait pas d'enjeu , donc si nul ne souhaitait désinformer ou si Wikipedia n'était pas , pour ce faire , un vecteur adéquat .
Par ailleurs la cabale peut naître de l'exploitation d'un groupe issu d'une communauté de vues et d'actions , qui n'élit pas les contestataires .
Comme l'exprima le contributeur « Saint - martin » : Soit la cabale n'existe pas et dans ce cas , la page diffame des cabalistes qui n'existent pas ( c'est - à - dire personne ) ; soit la cabale existe et on ne saurait parler de diffamation , les faits étant avérés . .
C'est aussi une question de visions , ou de point de vue .
Voici les étapes de la tactique qui écoeura nombre de contributeurs ( au point que certains témoignent : Wikipediareview , Wikipedia criticism , Wikipedia - Watch ) .
Elle procède de ce que M.- F. Hirigoyen détaille dans son ouvrage " Le Harcèlement moral : la violence perverse au quotidien " .
Nous l'illustrons par des actions menées par une coterie pro-nucléaire souhaitant interdire l'exposé de certains faits dans l'article traitant de la catastrophe de Tchernobyl ( note : notre pseudonyme , sur Wikipedia , est ' Natmaka ' ) .
Certaines premières réactions d'arbitres laissent redouter que , selon eux et de façon habilement implicite , RamaR aurait sur le fond raison .
Nous redoutions un arbitrage dont la substance serait " tout ne pouvant être réglementé , un administrateur dispose de latitude d'appréciation et d'action dont le champ comme les effets échappent au comité d'arbitrage " , ce qui nous semblerait inadéquat car notre affaire ne recèle rien d'inhabituel et tout y correspond à des éléments définis dans le règlement .
La liste des critères de blocage n'est aujourd ' hui encore pas règle mais simple proposition .
RamaR ne se croit semble - t - il pas tenu de la respecter .
Par ailleurs il évoque des blocages donnés pour similaires , ce qui semble discutable ( mais nul arbitre ne répondit ) .
Un arbitrage ainsi prononcé conduirait à un blanc - seing délivré par le comité d'arbitrage aux administrateurs qui , en pratique , pourront dès lors négliger le règlement .
Cela enthousiasmerait les coteries .
La brouillon de première ( 20060605 ) proposition de décision d'arbitrage énonce en substance que la plainte est abusive , que le conflit de personne n'est pas établi , que tout le monde est de bonne foi et que le blocage n'était pas abusif .
Plusieurs arbitres s'y rallient d'emblée , évacuant ainsi la douloureuse nécessité de tancer RamaR , administrateur influent .
L'arbitre Pabix énoncera : il faut recommander de justifier les blocages pour des conflits personnels .
Ce n'était donc pas un conflit , mais il rappelle la nécessité de justifier les blocages pour des conflits personnels .
Cet arbitre sera ensuite remplacé par Traroth .
Au moins trois arbitres jugèrent ensuite sur pièces puis consignèrent leurs commentaires sans souci de ménager qui que ce soit .
Nous les en remercions vivement .
Le comité d'arbitrage a considéré qu'il n'y avait pas de dérapages graves ni d'actes de vandalisme évidents et que Ramar , administrateur était partie au conflit et a bloque l'autre partie , donc estimé que le blocage était abusif .
Des résumés de cette décision nous semblent distordus et partiaux :
" tords partagés " ( sic )
Agressivité reconnue tandis que RamaR semble sans reproche alors que l'arbitrage ne traite pas d'agressivité et énonce que le blocage était abusif
Le blocage n'est pas abusif
Un débat résume certains éléments .

Un réacteur à la conception et à la construction déficiente

Or les sources de ces éléments , non révélées dans l'article , sont potentiellement biaisées car il s'agit d'un lobby d'industriels du nucléaire , ainsi que de l'AIEA et du CEA , tous promoteurs du nucléaire soucieux de présenter les causes de la catastrophe comme spécifiques à la centrale soviétique donc peu probables ailleurs .
Les censeurs cités , qui condamnèrent par ailleurs efficacement des " travaux originaux " qui n'en sont pas , semblent peu soucieux de lever les doutes pesant sur l'origine d'explications conformes à leurs thèses .

Débat sur l'énergie nucléaire
pas de Tchernobyl possible en France
Prétendre que les centrales nucléaires modernes risquent de reproduire Tchernobyl , c'est comme prétendre que les réservoires de voitures risquent d'exploser de façon spectaculaire en cas d'accident de la route : c'est juste faux .
C'était vrai dans certains cas , maintenant c'est faux .
retire le blabla sur la gravité de Tchernobyl qui est hors sujet
on _sait_ que Chernobyl est _impossible
Des protestations s'élevèrent mais n'éteignirent pas ces affirmations .
Nous avons ensuite montré , grâce à une source solide , l'inanité du sens le plus pertinent , dans cet article , de ces déclarations :
Une catastrophe aussi grave que celle de Tchernobyl n'est pas possible ici , car une catastrophe semblable ( gravité 7 , accident majeur , fusion du réacteur et explosion ) à celle de Tchernobyl est bien possible , comme Alvaro le notait .
Cela déclencha l'ire de désinformateurs qui bataillèrent sans arguments puis accusèrent et provoquèrent gratuitement .
Le wikipompier s'employant à éteindre la querelle écrira à ce propos : Ramar est chiant , il est admin pourtant il n'a pas l'air d'en avoir le comportement ... et ce n'est pas la 1re fois que ça lui est reproché ...
Si un jour quelqu'un peut le désadministré ça ne fera pas de mal . .
Ce dernier dresse ensuite une liste prometteuse des éclaircissements souhaitables puis propose d'évacuer discrètement la question embarrassante par La catastrophe de Tchernobyl de 1986 est souvent utilisée pour arguer de risques dans l'industrie électronucléaire dont le caractère vague laisse entendre que l'argument évoqué ne tient guère .
Dans ces domaines ' sensibles ' l'encyclopédie devrait donc à son sens , lorsque les énoncés à l'ambiguïté lénifiante font l'objet de protestations étayées , " faire l'impasse " , façon " de la désinformation , sinon rien " .
Certains puissants sur WP , ainsi , se posent en compétents afin de tenter d'imposer de la désinformation puis , si leurs viles manoeuvres sont dévoilées , polluent la discussion afin de " justifier " une destruction incluant les critiques étayées .
Ils peuvent ainsi systématiquement tenter de biaiser les articles sans jamais redouter d'être punis et en écoeurant les auteurs de contradictions étayées .
Notre exposé de tout cela sur WP a , comme prévu , été censuré .
Pendant ce temps l'agence des énergies renouvellables allemande a décidé d'améliorer les articles traitant de son thème en payant des experts ainsi qu'un contributeur .
Une demande d'arbitrage s'ensuivit .

Autre coterie menant procès d'intention ( affaire José Fontaine )
factuel : Nuisible , à exclure !
Ses intentions sont mauvaises
solide : Pymouss 44 retient pour ' fond ' un renommage non contesté , des citations choisies ( alors que chacun peut compléter ) , trop de travail ( J. Fontaine effectue de nombreuses modifications sans passage préalable par un bac à sable où il s'exposerait aux collisions et où , de toutes façons , nul ne relirait à mesure ) et un comportement de fonceur .
Alex1973 fournit quelques arguments qui procèdent du fond , donc vraisemblablement ( il convient d'accorder confiance a priori ! ) de mauvaise compréhension ( cela n'épargne aucun contributeur , surtout très actif ) ou de querelle d'experts .
Les arbitres ne sauraient sanctionner cela .
JNélis juge des intentions et rejette les contributions de J. Fontaine sans prendre la peine d'en citer , afin de le critiquer précisément , quoi que ce soit .
Par ailleurs le frère du plaignant condamna explicitement le cumul politique - Wikipedia mais néglige que son frère s'en rend ' coupable ' .
L'accusateur , après une superbe envolée non étayée puisqu'il ne fait qu'interpréter des citations et rappeler des anathèmes , emploie le mot d'ordre magique , celui qui justifie tout : « j'agis désormais pour un intérêt que je considère comme supérieur : le projet WP » .
Comme l'exprime J. Fontaine :
Que ceux qui me considèrent mal , donnent les preuves de leurs accusations .
Admins en folie
Exemple : le cas ' Essjay '
Exemple : le cas ' SlimVirgin '
Certains commentaires ouvrent peut - être d'autres pistes semblables .
Certaines entités concernées ne dissimulent guère leurs intentions .
Accorder confiance a priori ( Assume good faith )
Elle semble souhaitable et bien exprimée par Ici il faut avoir confiance a priori ! .
Lorsqu'au fil des échanges les actions explicables par la seule mauvaise foi se multiplient ... ' a priori ' ne joue plus guère et il convient d'en tirer un enseignement .
Assume good faith semble souhaitable d'emblée ... mais tant que mérité , ou plutôt tant que la probabilité de l'appliquer à bon escient est non négligeable .
Nous nous employons à l'appliquer , comme le montre selon nous nos autres premiers échanges avec d'autres contributeurs .
Toutefois lorsque des fâcheux la hissent en un étendard grâce auquel ils espèrent ne pas percevoir juste rétribution de nombreux d'agissements sournois ... ' a priori ' n'est plus de mise .
À ce stade tendre la joue gauche reste possible mais on peut préfèrer contester car il ne s'agit pas ici de spiritualité mais de progresser sur le plan des connaissances , contexte dans lequel l'émulation voire l'hostilité au mensonge , qui devient affrontement , assure depuis longtemps les meilleurs rendements .
Éviter l'affrontement reste préférable mais n'est pas toujours possible , même si d'aucuns y excellent car comprennent les ' natures / mouvements ' d'autrui , sont plus délicats ou diplomates voire hypocrites .
Des manipulateurs distillant leur désinformation dans Wikipedia en profitant de l'attrait exercé par les autres articles distordent cette confiance a priori en un faites toujours et malgré tout confiance ( implicitement : même malgré des abus répétés ) .
Cette confiance a priori accordée quant aux intentions des contributeurs sert le désinformateur qui , lorsqu'on lui reproche un abus , prétend agir dans l'intérêt de Wikipedia , sans démontrer l'intérêt et l'inocuité de son action , donc comme si cette manifestation d'intention excusait tout écart .
Nous lui préférons la recommandation officielle selon laquelle
Une des particularités de Wikipédia est d'être fondée sur la méfiance : il est en effet demandé aux wikipédiens d'être vigilants et critiques sur la qualité des contributions des autres acteurs .
Éditer ou détruire des articles comme bloquer des contributeurs sont autant de contributions pour lesquelles l'expérience montre la nécessité de la vigilance comme du sens critique .
On pourrait croire que ces administrateurs bénéficient du flou des règles dans leur guerre permanente contre d'habiles saboteurs exploitant des interstices du règlement .
Nous avons demandé à plusieurs administrateurs des pseudos de fâcheux .
Seuls 4 cas potentiels ( " Gemme / Floreal / Flo( / Caverna ? ) " , " Papotages " , " Stuart Little " et un non-nommé employant de nombreux faux nez afin de bruiter ) furent cités et des arbitrages , parfois difficiles , résolurent les 3 premiers ( archives ) .
Les règles en place , rendant possible le blocage immédiat en cas de sabotage ou d'insulte patent , conviennent manifestement dans l'immense majorité des cas ( en ne laissant , en 2 ans , que 4 cas non résolus ) donc les administrateurs ne sont pas débordés à cause de la précision des règles .
L'argument selon lequel des hordes de saligauds habiles exploitent le règlement , donc les critères d'exclusion doivent rester flous afin que l'admin tranche rapidement et annonçant qu'à défaut la situation deviendra « ingérable » , est par conséquent nul et non avenu .
Qui refuse ces conclusions , considère impossible de forger des règles suffisantes et souhaite compenser cela en accordant totale confiance aux administrateurs doit admettre que ce n'est pas ce que décrivent aujourd ' hui le règlement et les explications publiées , alors que le projet se veut transparent .
D'autre part nul ne semble soucieux de la dérive majeure éclairée par le présent ( entente entre administrateurs => pas / peu d'instruction ( examen des cas ) => des administrateurs désinformateurs exécutent sommairement leurs contradicteurs ) .
Enfin sociaux !
Enfin libres !
Notons par ailleurs que , pour ce que nous en comprenons , nos sociétés ( dans le monde réel ) semblent peu désireuses de laisser des policiers s'arroger un pouvoir .
La quantité d'interstices dans le règlement augmente avec son flou donc , indépendamment de la capacité des administrateurs à bloquer sans en appeler à une règle précise , la proportion de bloqués souhaitant arbitrage augmente avec l'imprécision des règles , qui par surcroît rendrait l'arbitrage plus difficile et critiquable .
Or durant longtemps nul ne s'inquiéta de la proportion de contributeurs qui , bloqués par un administrateur ( indélicat ou emporté ) alors qu'ils ne commettent rien d'indéniablement fâcheux ( vandalisme , injure , menace , violation du droit de la propriété intellectuelle ... patents ) , cessent de participer .
Une " carte blanche " délivrée aux administrateurs ne chassera peut - être apparemment personne mais certains de ses effets ( blocage abusif , sans recours possible ) écoeurent des contributeurs potentiellement précieux , qui renoncent au projet sans que nul n'en tienne compte .
Nous ne préconisons pas d'étoffer les règles et l'appareil ( par exemple en y greffant avocats et procureurs ) , mais au contraire de rendre le règlement clair , précis , concis et légitime car explicitement accepté par la communauté et respecté .
Écarter vandales et ahuris semble possible sans pour autant laisser des administrateurs commettre impunément des abus .
Lire à ce propos un discussion révélatrice suivie d'une proposition , comme on pouvait le craindre d'emblée dénigrée puis négligée .
Le règlement est nécessaire
Wikipedia élabore une encyclopédie , non un règlement
Notre but avec Wikipédia est de créer une encyclopédie libre ( (... ) ) )
Atteindre ce but nécessite l'édification de règles communes pour nous assurer que nous travaillons ensemble , dans la bonne direction , avec le moins de heurts possibles .
Il existe donc certaines règles communes et autres recommandations
Erasoft écrivit :
la façon d'éviter qu'il y ait débat , c'est qu'il y ait des règles .
La situation est clarifiée , il n'y a plus débat .
Finalement , l'utilité sociale d'une règle est souvent plus grande que celle des discussions éternelles qui sont la conséquence de son absence ( (... ) )
Juridictionnaliser et bien juridictionnaliser : c'est - dire qu'à cause égale , il y a conséquences égales .
C'est inscrire le bon-sens dans une règle .
C'est dire que s'il faut du cas par cas , et bien on dit que c'est au cas par cas .
C'est exclure le doute , préjudiciable aux arbitrés , et dont les malins profiteront toujours .
Par ailleurs des saboteurs ( vandales ... ) menacent le projet , et leur interdire de nuire au projet justifie le règlement définissant les comportements non souhaités , appliqué par une police ( les administrateurs ) et par un comité d'arbitrage ( afin de séparer les pouvoirs ) ...
Un règlement est donc bien nécessaire lorsque tous peuvent participer mais que certains sabotent .
Déclarer par exemple oublions ces règles , place à la rédaction encyclopédique ne tiendrait qu'en l'absence d'abus distordant des articles ou écoeurant des contributeurs , or ces écarts existent .
Ne pas respecter une règle en invoquant le document
De l'interprétation créative des règles ( résumé par Si les règles t'empêchent d'améliorer ou de maintenir la qualité de Wikipédia , ignore - les ) afin de rejeter les critiques ne devrait pas être toléré en cas de protestation car il précise : Invoquer ce principe d'interprétation des règles ne convaincra pas pour autant tout le monde que vous avez raison , vous devrez donc persuader le reste de la communauté que vos actions étaient une amélioration de l'encyclopédie .
Cela correspond à un consensus manifesté par l'absence de veto , malheureusement aujourd ' hui négligé .
Chapmancentral et Mr. Magoo
Nous avons demandé à l'auteur d'éclaircir cela :
Another Magoo sidesteping I do n't understand this : " a long - standing principle which allows you to sidestep any bureaucracy in order to get straight to where , by common consent , the project needs to be .
On the roads , this is the average driver .
On Wikipedia , this is the average editor .
Some people just do n't get it .
The Mr Magoo types .
One must kindly but firmly escort them to the door . "
When it comes to sidestep any rule by common consent how can one say that there is common consent when some disagree ?
Is n't a true , full and complete consensus only attained when every contributor has a veto right ?
On the road a driver often refuses a sidestep , pertinent rules therefore apply and I have to see one asking the other drivers around for help to boot him off the road !
However , as WP puts it , " A too - strict requirement of consensus may effectively give a small self - interested minority group veto power over decisions . " .
Therefore a project can either enforce the too - strict requirement of consensus ( everyone benefits from a veto right ) or it can set up a vote for each contested proposal , to forbid abusive vetoes .
But votes only have value when there is no major fraud , which in turn forbids anonymity ( sock puppets ... ) .
Wikipedia seems not ready for this .
Such voting system also imply a clear decision about some proportions needed for a proposal to pass ( I mean for example some " when at least 1/20 among contributor vote , and 2/3 of all votes accept the prosal ( vote ' pro ' ) " .
There is nothing like that on WP , and I could not find any explanation giving answers to all those considerations .
Worse : this " escort them to the door " , which seems to be often used on Wikipedia , is much more unfair than a more classic approach ( non-sidestepable rules , arbcom when there is a dispute ... ) because it is less systematic and transparent .
It directly leads to some form of mob rule , especially administrators ( sysops ) escaping their pure ' cop ' ( " applying the rules " ) mission and elevating themselves to the judge or even proprietor status ( assessing a situation and freely acting , " creating rules on - the - fly " ) .
It is possible because , in such a case , very few other admins and contributors will take the time to analyze the case at hand , as most will think " a pair / trio of admins say that a given user is a vandal / aggressor / whatever so let 's boot him / her " .
I was a victim of this approach on WP fr , then the arbcom recognized it at abusive , but for one ready to fight like me , how many arbitrarily booted ?
Leveraging the project implies contributors , letting them cooperate imply rules , rules are there to be respected and enforced .
This ' sidesteping ' thing works by common consent .
Deciding to ignore any refusal in order to spare time is somewhat like the quick and dirty approach in software development , which often induces growing pain .
English is not my mother tongue , I 'm French and I may even be a Mr. Magoo , so bare with me .

Le bel esprit encyclopédique que voilà ...
Participation de l'administrateur aux décisions portant sur sa mission
C'est pourquoi un administrateur rigoureux donc soucieux de servir la communauté plutôt que d'imposer sa vision , s'abstient de voter ( mais pas de conseiller ) lors des décisions portant sur le règlement encadrant sa fonction , et que le sens ( fond ) de toute règle doit être réputé intangible pour tous hors prise de décision , surtout lorsque l'urgence des modifications n'est pas démontrée .
Coup d'état / blague / folie / piratage en cours ?
Ces modifications du règlement , effectuées sous un compte d'administrateur , ne furent adoptées ( ni même discutées ) par la communauté .
Elles établissent que " Dans des cas moins tranchés , il ( ( l'admin ) ) doit s'en remettre à la communauté " , donc " hors de ce qui ne figure pas dans la liste non exhaustive , il faudra obtenir la permission " , ce qui signifie en pratique " feu à volonté ! " car une liste " non exhaustive " autorise tout .
Notre exposé public de cela , sur Wikipedia , a été écarté .
Puis un amendement ( effectué par un autre administrateur ) tout aussi imprécis ( remplacement de liste non exhaustive par entres autres et ajout tout aussi imprécis de la la communauté dans la liste des instances de recours ) , suivi d'une autre version floue ne restaura à notre sens pas le règlement théoriquement en vigueur .
Le règlement passe ainsi de " voici ce que l'administrateur doit faire , en cas d'abus le comité d'arbitrage tranchera " à " l'administrateur fait ce que bon lui semble , voici quelques exemples .
En cas d'abus le comité d'arbitrage et la communauté trancheront " ( sans aucune précision quant aux modalités ) .
Un contributeur ancien , réputé et bureaucrate Wikipedia s'en étonna comme nous .
Tout cela néglige les sanctions établies par une décision ainsi qu'une prise de décision pertinente qui s'étiole .
Cet embarras a fait l'objet d'un arbitrage durant lequel , sitôt notre notre réponse lue , l'administrateur en cause souhaita l'interrompre et déclara vouloir discuter ( après avoir refusé de le faire ) puis se défaussa aussitôt .
Les non-administrateurs soucieux de tranquillité restent en rangs par deux et filent droit , d'autant que le comité d'arbitrage compta ensuite certains des administrateurs aux comportements illustrés dans le présent ( élection ) .
I , for one , welcome our new Trusted ( coucou Alvaro ! )
Masters .
Deux administrateurs ( ~ Pyb et Solensean ) sont membres du comité d'arbitrage .
Ils ne sont pas mauvais bougres mais connaissent personnellement la coterie , ce qui pourrait ajouter aux biais consécutifs à la confiance a priori accordée à tout collègue administrateur , à une étrange conception de l'esprit de corps .
Anecdote : coup de folie d'administrateur .
Début 2007 , vraisemblablement suite à divers propos échangés lors des discussions liées à un arbitrage en cours , des admins effectuèrent des modifications semblables .
Nous avons en vain demandé de passer par une prise de décision de la communauté .
Une proposition de décision résoudra peut - être cela .
En mars 2007 une affaire semblable , mais réciproque ( un utilisateur modifiait une page méta qui n'est pas une règle ) , naquit .
Les manipulations douteuses d'aministrateurs ( le commentaire est trompeur , bloquer plus de 24 heures un contributeur s'il s'agit d'un premier blocage disparaît sans consultation et selon les circonstances apparaît de même ) continuent et leurs effets perdurent .
Des policiers écrivent ainsi seuls les lois qu'ils sont chargés de faire respecter puis jugent sommairement ... et cela n'inquiète pas la communauté .
WP : POINT laisse toute latitude aux administrateurs
contester une règle de WP ou bien contester son application par un administrateur , même si elle est jugée maladroite ou injuste , n'autorise personne à les détourner ni à se livrer , en se faisant justice soi-même , à des actes assimilables à du vandalisme .
Nulle définition de ce qui est assimilable à du vandalisme n'est proposée , donc tout administrateur douteux peut saquer en assimilant arbitrairement ( All resistance is futile , you will be assimilated ! ) .
La proposition précise :
Dans un tel cas , mieux vaut s'appliquer sereinement à prouver sa bonne foi , en s'inspirant de cas similaires qui ont connu d'autres issues ( la « jurisprudence wikipédienne » )
s 'appliquer sereinement à prouver sa bonne foi
L'adoption de cette recommandation rend plus difficile de protester lorsqu'un administrateur censure de façon partisane .
Les admins bannissent librement

HDDTZUZDSQ , 200607
de désorganiser Wikipedia pour une argumentation personnelle
L'argument selon lequel la vision personnelle des objectifs de Wikipedia du contributeur ne serait pas adéquate tranche , d'autorité , une proposition de suppression émise par l'administrateur bloqueur lui-même , 26 heures plus tôt ..
Un autre administrateur se chargea dès lors du blocage et cela déclencha la curée .
Une justification proposée ne procède nullement de la définition officielle de la mission d'un administrateur : Markadet considère que tu es un activiste ( (... ) ) activité normale d'un admin qui empêche la dégradation de l'encyclopédie par un activiste .
Les éléments étayables et pertinents , par exemple proposés par M. Menal ( HDD a tenté à plusieurs reprises le passage en force ... ) semblent recevables mais l'affaire relève du comité d'arbitrage , non d'une exécution immédiate par une cohorte d'administrateurs .

WP en anglais n'est pas épargnée .
L'historique de ses contributions révèle selon nous que certains ne souhaitaient pas que Wikipedia détaille sa théorie des « univers jumeaux » , pourtant publiée dans une revue scientifique ( Astrophysics and Space Science , 1995 ) .
Selon la règle relative aux travaux inédits cette publication suffit à rendre le sujet pertinent dans l'encyclopédie ( que la théorie soit ou non démontrée fausse ou avérée ) et nous n'avons su trouver de déclaration mettant en doute sa réalité , le sérieux de la revue ou un motif de rejet relevant du règlement .
Tout se déroula comme des administrateurs de Wikipedia y formaient comité de lecture .

On pourra lire un dialogue pertinent et le témoignage de l'intéressé , avec le recul comme à chaud .
À ces critiques étayées nous n'avons guère trouvé que les piètres réponses habituelles .
Un scientifique soucieux d'écarter les scories s'emploiera , plutôt qu'à les censurer , à en montrer l'inanité ( en montrant que rien n'est publié dans une revue sérieuse à comité de lecture , ou que nul autre communication publiée ne cita voire que des communications réfutèrent la thèse , donc sans WP : TI ) .
Le traitement de la thèse d'Elisabeth Teissier , par exemple , est conforme aux conventions et règles : WP rend compte de son existence et de son contexte , puis du fait que des sommités la rejetèrent .
Opinion du co-fondateur de Wikipedia
serious and endemic problems
The community does not enforce its own rules effectively or consistently .
Consequently , administrators and ordinary participants alike are able essentially to act abusively with impunity , which begets a never - ending cycle of abuse .
C. Castoriadis
L'histoire récente et présente montre des exemples massifs et épouvantables où les dernières traces de réflexivité et de volonté propre que peuvent posséder des êtres humains sont ramenées à zéro par l'institution sociale ( politique ) .
La première étape de l'anéantissement de la « réflexivité et de [ la ] volonté propre » , c'est la suppression du nom propre , imposer l'anonymat : les auteurs ne s'expriment plus en leur nom à eux , mais au nom de la cause , du parti , du peuple , de la communauté .
L'argument pour faire accepter cette annihilation de soi , c'est la lutte contre les autorités bourgeoises , les mandarins .
L'idée derrière , c'est que l'individu , entièrement déterminé par sa position dans les rapports de production , n'a que l'illusion de l'autonomie .
Bien sûr c'est une fallace : les bureaucrates qui tirent les ficelles capitalisent sur ce travail anonyme dont ils peuvent s'attribuer le mérite .

Témoignage d'admin , en anglais
Hi everyone , to those I 've known at Wikipedia and worked well with , thanks for the good times .
I used to believe in Wikipedia .
It was worth a lot to me , it was fun , it was good to work on articles .
But I 'm quitting .
It 's sad to say , I know , and even sadder that due to my reasons for quitting , I can't trust leaving a goodbye message on my user page or mailing from my normal account .
But for the things I am about to say , I know that several admins and possibly those higher up in the project would ban me just for saying it .
I know this message may never reach this list either , but I 'm at least going to try .
I 'm doing it this way because someday , I might want to come back , and I 'd like to be able to come back under the same username I left .
I 'm quitting wikipedia because I do n't like what I 've seen too many admins become .
Self - righteous , arrogant , self - centered , conceited ... jerks .
I 've seen too many admins who believe that our civility policies only apply to the normal editors .
Too many admins whose first course is to insult a new user in order to see if they get a " reaction " so that they can spank the new user for talking back to an admin .
I 've seen too many admins block accounts for infinite duration on flimsy evidence or mere whim .
I 've seen admins block accounts with the reason of " name .. " , and then block another account for the reason that it was a " suspected sockpuppet " - of the offensive username block .
I 've seen more accusations thrown around of someone being a " sockpuppet " of another user .
Time and again , I looked through the edits , and I did n't see it .
Instead , what I saw were users who were systematically hounded until they finally broke down and broke the civility rules , and then as an afterthought someone came up and said " oh , it does n't matter , they were a sockpuppet of X anyways " , thereby removing all culpability on the part of the abusive users who had spent time hounding and abusing the newbie to the point of cussing or vandalizing .
I 've seen the way accusations of " sockpuppet " have become a way of life in content disputes , and I 've see how the admins on wikipedia do absolutely nothing about it .
Too many despicable pov warriors spend their time accusing anyone they disagree with on one article or another of being a " sockpuppet " , and never does a CheckUser come back innocent .
The one time I ever saw CU come back inconclusive , the admin blocked them for being a sockpuppet anyways , claiming they had " proof " in the form of edit summaries , which is to say that the user was editing on the same article where the admin 's friends had previously harassed someone .
I saw a thread earlier today which I thought was monstrous - a user whose talk page was locked for " unblock template abuse " , whose only crime or " abuse " of the template was removing the template after the blocking admin consistently and maliciously removed it .
This thread was stopped by the assertion of David Gerard that the person who started the thread was " Enviroknot . "
I do n't give a damn who started the thread , if the question is valid , the question is valid .
I looked at the user in question , and I see plenty of problems with the way it was handled , and at least two admins who deserve at the least a stern censure and at the most , de-adminning for abusive behavior .
We NEED users to bring these problems up .
We NEED to cull the herd of abusive administrators .
But there 's no way in hell I can say that with my normal username , because David 's terms are clear : the usage of the term " sockpuppet " stops all rational discussion , and anyone disagreeing with David gets banned .
Anyone who says that there are abusive administrators out there , or speaks out against a specific one they 've had a run-in with ?
The cry of " Rouge Admin lololol lets see how can I pwn this noob today , take that and stop annoying the admins " is the cry that goes out , not " that sounds serious , I 'll take a look . "
We are too arrogant .
I 've seen Jimbo use the excuse of " well troll X does n't like it so they are doing right " or " well you must be correct because the wikipediareview crowd does n't like you " as a way to justify bad behavior in the wikimedia IRC room and even on this list .
I 've seen countless times where good users are attacked for speaking up and saying this same thing :
We , the overwhelming number of admins on the project , are too arrogant .
Too self - centered .
We spend too much time " defending " wikipedia and not enough time bringing new users into the fold , being polite , being nice .
Teaching them about policies , about the manual of style .
Editing alongside them .
Admins are supposed to be " just another editor with a few extra buttons " , but too many admins today get drunk on that power .
They insist that normal editors are " beneath " them , that they should be able to own articles and give their friends a hand up when content disputes arise .
If you 're friends with an admin , rest assured that your buddies will call someone a name , get one called back , and then ask you to punish the other guy for " incivility . "
And you 'll do it , too , without a moment 's hesitation , simply because you have the power to do it .
I 've sat in the IRC channel watching a user come in to ask for help only to be rebuffed , attacked , insulted , and finally booted because " no new user could ever find the IRC chat room , they are obviously a sockpuppet of some disruptive user . "
I sat by silently because I knew if I spoke out , they 'd just boot me too for being " disruptive . "
And you know what ?
I 'm tired of it .
Our articles are suffering because even the good edits of supposed " sockpuppets " are being reverted by overly - zealous admins who believe that they have to hunt for every edit made by someone they think is banned - even if it 's just a typo fix - and revert it .
Yes , I have watched this in action .
I have watched admins put obvious page - tagging edits like an insertion of " joe is a fag " back because the user who reverted the vandalism was someone deemed a " sockpuppet " by our completely erroneous and pointless system .
The Wiki is broken .
It 's not the vandals who broke it .
Those we could handle .
It 's not the edit warriors who broke it .
Those we can handle .
WE , the admins of wikipedia , broke it .
We broke it by being stuck - up jerks .
We broke it by thinking we are better than normal editors , by getting full of ourselves .
And every one of the admins on wikipedia , myself included , has been guilty of it at one point .
Some are more guilty than others .
Some are jerks 100 % of the time .
Some have become so obsessed with their pet sockpuppet , be it Enviroknot , Freestylefrappe , Willy on Wheels , Entmoots , Pigsonthewing , JarlaxleArtemis , Karmafist , Lir , PoolGuy , or whatever else their pet sockpuppet of the week is that they are no longer useful .
Some never should have passed RFA to start with .
Some deliberately gamed the system and pulled support from a specific interest group to get passed , then turned around and started immediately abusing their power to help the interest group and have n't stopped since .
Some are likely sockpuppets of serial edit warriors .
Some are just insane .
And some of us just are human , and fail to appreciate that , and fall victim to power tripping behavior .
I think that the admin behavior which made this list moderation - default falls under that .
But that 's another of those things that is " not up for discussion . "
Too many things are not open for discussion .
Too many of the verboten topics center around people who are on power trips , or were at the time they took some action .
Too many times admins seeking to consolidate their power bases or trading favors with other admins have stood up for improper , abusive behavior .
So , I 'm out .
As long as the cult of adminship reigns here , wikipedia 's not going to improve .
New articles may come and edits might be made eventually , but the state of wikipedia , our accuracy , our reliability , WILL fail as long as admins are allowed to champion abusive users or be abusive themselves and simply get away with it time and again , rubber stamped by secret evidence and higher - ups who are more interested in their own power than making a better encyclopedia .
Jimbo , this might as well be an open letter to you too .
None of the rest of these spineless yes - men will ever say these things to your face .
Hell , I could n't at the last meetup , because I was so afraid that you or Danny or one of the other high - ups would note down my username and ban me .
That 's the atmosphere you 've cultivated .
Peace out .
Alvaro monte au créneau
Une discussion révèle tout d'abord que certains , y compris au moins un administrateur - arbitre , prennent conscience d'abus :
Dorémi ( ( NdÉ : un contributeur protestant contre la censure ) ) arrive avec des tonnes de sources , des évènements notables .
Et Rama , en petit chef : « ah non , accidentel » « pas notable » ... sans rien de solide .
Bref , je fais la gueule .
Alvaro 20 décembre 2006 à 17:30 ( CET )
Je ne suis pas ( pas plus que Markov ) spécialement intéressé par ces articles .
Nous sommes arrivés tous deux là-dedans en tant qu'arbitres suite à la demanande de déblocage de Dorémi auprès du comité d'arbitrage .
Markov et moi devions surveiller Dorémi , d'où mon blocage , par exemple .
Et là j'ai vu comment étaient menées les discussions .
D'un côté , Dorémi avec des arguments ( faut trier aussi ;-)... de l'autre que dalle ou presque , que de l'ironie , des attaques perso . ( (... ) )
Med et Rama sont 2 admins en qui j'ai toute confiance quant à leur implication dans notre projet .
Mais je n'ai plus de doute sur leur côté partisan concernant tout ce qui touche au nucléaire ( (... ) ) qu'avons - nous constaté ?
D'un côté , des gens contribuant depuis pas mal de temps sur wp , parfois en années , dont des admins , de l'autre un nouveau contributeur , affichant ouvertement ses idées .
Entre les deux , un tas de règles , genre sourcez , restez au plus près des arguments , soyez courtois , pas d'attaque perso ...
Et là , Markov et moi sommes tombés sur le cul .
C'est les vieux contributeurs qui respectaient pas nos règles , multipliaient les digressions hors - sujet , les attaques persos , alors que le nouveau contributeur , lui , respectait nos textes !
D'où mes coups de gueule contre Rama et Med
Gageons toutefois que cet administrateur clairvoyant donc accusateur a reçu un appel à l'union sacrée voire a été menacé , de façon plus ou moins voilée , d'être publiquement accusé de troller voire de trahir .
Cette façon de ne pas traiter des problèmes ne correspond pas aux valeurs du projet ( communauté donc transparence des dialogues relatifs à des comportements publics , méritocratie ... ) mais les coteries échappent aux règles .
Les accusations non négligeables et recevables seront ainsi enterrées , un peu de temps laissera la poussière retomber puis la désinformation reprendra comme devant .
C'est manifestement d'ores le cas en ce qui concerne Med , dont Alvaro dénonça le 23 décembre certains abus et qui parvient à faire balayer sous le tapis l'exposé de ses turpitudes , par ses accusations ( tu n'adhères pas au concept de neutralité de point de vue ) dont il ne montre pas la pertinence .
La réécriture de l'histoire cède place à la déportation dans l'historique : certains escamotent l'histoire - risque .
Nous redoutions que de semblables pourparlers soient menés en sourdine ( IRC , mail ... ) avec RamaR , de façon plus efficace car discrète , mais ...
... Alvaro déposa le 4 janvier une remarquable demande d'arbitrage .
Merci à lui de traiter ainsi , courageusement , de méfaits constatés .
Les arbitres , pour la plupart admins , décidèrent de ne pas tancer leurs collègues mis en cause puis quelques protestations s'élevèrent .
L'exposé de Markov nous semble mesuré .
Candidat au Comité d'Arbitrage , nous avons essuyé un tir de barrage de votes hostiles d'admins donc supposons que ce dont traite le présent semble normal à tous ou que le gros des contributeurs accepte la mainmise ( The Calculus of Consent ... ) .
Traroth monte au créneau
Support Our Troops
Chomsky écrivait :
the point of public relations slogans like " Support Our Troops " is that they do n't mean anything [...] that 's the whole point of good propaganda .
You want to create a slogan that nobody is gonna be against and I suppose everybody will be for , because nobody knows what it means , because it does n't mean anything .
But its crucial value is that it diverts your attention from a question that does mean something , do you support our policy ?
And that 's the one you 're not allowed to talk about .
Le scrutin visant officiellement à aider un administrateur à décider de la suppression d'un article confère beaucoup de pouvoir à ses participants car , si une " prise de pouvoir " menant à l'investiture d'un comité de censure paraît peu vraisemblable , l'entrisme menace et progresse grâce à l'inertie et au manque de moyens .
Nul ne connaît la proportion d' opinions ( " suffrages " ) exprimés par des faux - nez ) impliqués lors de chacun de ces scrutins .
Critères de la notoriété et de l'intérêt encyclopédique
Pour ce que nous en savons les encyclopédistes classiques , aux moyens limités , employaient ces critères afin de décider de ce dont il leur fallait traiter au plus vite , en négligeant temporairement le reste .
On pouvait alors également redouter que le gabarit de l'encyclopédie augmente au point d'en rendre le nombre de volumes imprimés rédhibitoire , ou que l'on traite de sujets trop volatils car immatures , en devenir .
Ces critères sont inutiles sur Wikipedia car :
seuls des volontaires rédigent des articles .
Les moyens ( énergie , temps , compétences ... ) dont disposait le groupe circonscrit des encyclopédistes classiques sont à présent ceux du groupe ouvert et en expansion formé par les contributeurs .
Plus explicitement : si un volontaire rédige un article ... tant mieux !
S'il est débutant il commettra probablement des erreurs mais cela ne doit rien à l'importance ( secondaire ou non ) du sujet de l'article .
L'article sera imparfait mais cela n'importe que s'il est consulté et , en ce cas , la probabilité d'amélioration augmente avec le nombre de lecteurs .
la capacité de traitement ( stockage et communication ) des ordinateurs augmente plus vite que celle des auteurs d'articles à produire des données .
Même un improbable débordement de capacité ( si le volume total des articles occupait tout l'espace de stockage disponible , ce qui semble ridicule car , en 2008 , tout Wikipedia en anglais et français tiennent dans 2 TB qui coûtent environ 1000 euros en RAID10 ) serait facilement résolu par une purge automatisable , pour lequel une sorte de ramasse - miettes oeuvrerait .
Ce logiciel analyserait les traces d'activité des serveurs Wikipedia afin d'archiver les articles les moins consultés .
Nous proposons d'adopter pour cela un ' score ' ainsi établi : " articles les plus massifs et vieux de ceux qui eurent peu de lecteurs vraisemblablement distincts ( causèrent le moins de ' hits ' par des numéros IP distincts ) " .
Par ailleurs une vraisemblable évolution du mode d'hébergement rendrait caduc ce problème théorique de capacité .
L'ectoplasmique ' notoriété ' volant au secours d'un non-problème ( « parce qu'il est impossible de traiter de tout » ) ressemble étrangement à la stance " Blaming the ham that 's bigger than the pan " dont Erin McKean montra l'absurdité .
la mise - à- jour du contenu de Wikipedia est immédiate et un article daté , dans les deux sens de ce terme , semble plus souhaitable qu'une lacune car l'absence d'article n'est pas aussi engageante , pour un amateur du thème , qu'un article imprécis voire faux .
À défaut d'article beaucoup pensent Rien !
Bon , mon thème de prédilection n'intéresse personne ici tandis que face à un article perfectible l'amateur éclairé sursaute Je souhaite améliorer ! , ce qui suscite des vocations d'encyclopédistes ( pour ce que nous en savons une bonne part des contributeurs rejoignirent ainsi le projet ) .
Par ailleurs l'encyclopédie érige ce dont elle traite au rang de " savoir " ( le dictionnaire ne recèle que des conventions ) et , puisqu'elle vise à l'exhaustivité , certains lecteurs jugent que ce qui n'y figure pas n'est vraisemblablement pas un savoir .
Il nous semblerait juste et utile de renoncer aux critères de notoriété et d'intérêt encyclopédique , à présent inutiles et que certains emploient afin de censurer ce qui ne correspond pas à leurs convictions / thèses ou bien pour se poser ainsi en " juges " épurant Wikipedia .
Pitoyable tentative de vengeance
Critique : risque de vandalisme et de diffamation
Je me demande donc s'il faudrait renforcer les critères de notoriété et d'intérêt , ou leur application , afin d'éviter de se retrouver avec une myriade d'articles que personne ne suit et qui sont un terrain pour le vandalisme et la diffamation .
La résolution de ce problème , non propre aux articles peu consultés , passe par un examen systématique préalable à sa publication ( modération , imprimatur , censure ... ) .
D'autre part il nous semble que le vandalisme et la diffamation sont d'autant moins probables que l'article est souvent :
consulté , car en ce cas il semble difficile de croire que tous les visiteurs intéressés par le thème ne détecteront rien ou resteront passifs ;
modifié que par de nombreux contributeurs vraisemblablement distincts ;
De plus la probabilité qu'un article isolé de ce genre soit consulté par une personne concernée , capable et soucieuse de le corriger , augmente avec le temps .
À notre sens un logiciel utilitaire , périodiquement invoqué , résoudrait ce problème .
Il détecterait le gros des articles aux contenus potentiellement risqué et leur ajouterait un bandeau de mise en garde ( Cet article est peu lu et mis au point , il abrite peut - être des erreurs voire des errements , merci de participer blablabla ) , suffirait ( sur le plan technique le logiciel ajouterait un attribut par lequel le gestionnaire de contenu lui ajouterait automatiquement le ' bandeau ' , mais peu importe ici ) .
de ce qui importe
interdira aux désinformateurs et aux naïfs de jouer les censeurs voire les épurateurs ( leurs actions découragent certains contributeurs ) ;
épargnera le temps précieux des contributeurs honnêtes qui participent aujourd ' hui aux scrutins de suppression d'articles traitant de thèmes manquant selon certains de notoriété , et n'auront plus à le faire ;
, et n'auront plus à le faire ; n'induira aucun risque réel de saturation des moyens ( espace de stockage des données ... ) ;
catalysera la mobilisation de nouveaux contributeurs , tout d'abord venus là afin de consulter puis améliorer les articles traitant de leurs marottes ;
augmentera la réactivité de Wikipedia en constituant un stock d'articles et de discussions peu consultés mais disponibles , au pire en guise de substrat , en cas de brusque intérêt pour le thème ( par exemple causé par l'actualité ) ;
rendra inutile de continuer à tenter vaindement de définir un mode précis et consensuel de détermination du degré de ' notoriété ' et d'" intérêt encyclopédique " de toute information .
Ce critère discutable causa le premier appel au boycott d'envergure .
Résumé et considérations personnelles
Un administrateur a beaucoup contribué et applique le règlement au nom de tous les réels propriétaires du projet , ensemble formé de ceux qui y contribuent et l'ont élu .
Tout cela ôte au pur vandale banni moyen de protester d'un mais Wikipedia n'est pas moins mon projet que le vôtre ! .
L'administrateur vient peu à peu à en concevoir que le projet lui doit beaucoup voire lui appartient , à tout le moins pour partie , au point de s'affranchir de justifier ses accusations ( ou blocages ... ) .
Il croit disposer d'un mandat non encadré par le règlement , ce qui n'est pas le cas , qui serait résumé par fais ce qui te semble bon .
En théorie policier chargé d'appliquer les règles forgées par la communauté , il se comporte dès lors en juge aux procès parfois sommaires .
Certains emploient alors les outils et attributs de la fonction d'administrateur , entregent compris , afin d'imposer leurs vues en chassant les contradicteurs .
Lors de conflits certains de ses pairs le soutiennent a priori , sans plus d'argument donc vraisemblablement sans examen , en un inquiétant esprit de corps ressemblant parfois à des échanges de bons procédés .
Ils jettent l'anathème tu n'as pas compris ce qu'est Wikipedia donc n'as rien à faire ici , sans détailler leurs griefs et avec un bel ensemble révélant mot d'ordre voire conditionnement .
Ils forment ainsi , peu à peu , une sorte de corporation ( gestionnaire d'un bien public ) .
Le faible intérêt manifesté par le gros des contributeurs ( ceux qui bossent tranquillement dans leur coin ) pour les questions de police ( car la mission de l'administrateur relève des éléments nobles de cet office ) découle du fait qu'ils ne sont pas victimes de censure car oeuvrent sur des thèmes non ou peu " chargés " .
Dans d'autres domaines , prêtant à polémique et relevant de choix de société disputés , le tenant d'une thèse détestera voir " son " encyclopédie publier une critique de ce qu'il apprécie .
Certains administrateurs , plus ou moins consciemment , pensent j'ai beaucoup contribué , l'encyclopédie m'appartient plus qu'à ces contributeurs critiquant ce que je sais être Juste et Bon , je n'ai pas envie de donner droit de cité à leurs informations contrant mes Absolues Vérités , donc je crois ( ou feins de le faire ) qu'au moins l'un des critères flous s'applique afin de les chasser . .
Ce processus peut être plus ou moins inconscient , comme le résume Chomsky : if there 's something you want to do , it 's really easy to convince yourself it 's right and just .
You put away evidence that shows that 's not true . .
En toute rigueur ceux il faudrait apposer un bandeau " ce qui déplaît à certains administrateurs sera supprimé " .
Cela conduit à des excès , délibérés ou non , parfois rendus plus saillants par les effets ( plus ou moins composés et observés de part et d'autre ) de l'incompréhension , du manque de diplomatie , de l'antipathie , du sentiment d'urgence chassant la souhaitable hâte au profit d'une regrettable précipitation , de tiers peu soucieux d'apaiser ...
Les déclarations d'administrateurs reposent souvent sur un a priori selon lequel un administrateur est toujours impartial ( neutre ) et ne s'en prend qu'à des voyous .
Si c'est le plus souvent le cas , ce n'est pas toujours vrai .
Selon des administrateurs un " fâcheux " ne serait pas un contributeur enfreignant le règlement mais un contributeur pris à partie par un administrateur tandis que cette dernière fonction conférerait magiquement parfaite rigueur et probité .
Bref : pas de vagues !
L'examen de certains abus révèle , entre autres dérives , l'orientation par laquelle certains s'emploient à rendre a priori intolérable toute critique d'un administrateur .
Promouvoir au rang d'administrateur ceux qui bossent tranquillement dans leur coin , comme l'évoquait Alvaro , mobiliserait et rendrait la définition de la mission d'administrateur plus claire et son application plus omniprésente .
Wikipedia , sur ce plan , constitue un exemple supplémentaire du vain espoir , cultivé par nombre d'informaticiens , de résoudre un problème au moyen d'un logiciel , sur le mode « avec de bons outils collaboratifs les contributeurs oeuvreront harmonieusement !».
De façon semblable laisser le projet reposer sur une confiance :
autorisant tout contributeur , explicitement ou en pratique , à adopter une approche aux effets pervers si ses intentions ne sont pas nobles ( négliger le règlement , mener scrutin sans liste électorale , administrer en façonnant communauté ou contenu ... )
excluant le gros des moyens de contrôle efficaces réduisant les effets pervers de l'adoption de ces approches douteuses par des magouilleurs
La quête de consensus ne fonctionne pas toujours , parfois la question n'intéresse guère ou bien les débats s'éternisent .
Il faut trancher , déterminer ce que l'encyclopédie contiendra jusqu'à plus ample informé ( «ne rien faire » est alors une sorte de décision ) , mais nul n'en est chargé .
Les administrateurs se sont en pratique chargés de cela .
C'est discutable car offre un efficace outil aux propagandistes , conduit à des décisions peu homogènes et n'est pas exposé dans les décriptions officielles du projet .
Parallèle avec le soviétisme
mots d'ordre
peu de réponses aux critiques , hors langue de bois ou généralisation abusive ( par exemple qui critique une action d'un admin est l'ennemi de tous les admins )
) culte de la personnalité virtuelle des admins , réputés intouchables et sans reproches s'ils justifient toute action de la déclaration souveraine : nous savons ce qu'est le projet et oeuvrons pour lui ! .
Ils forment Politburo et Nomenklatura
.
Ils forment Politburo et Nomenklatura harcèlement de toute personne révélant un abus , abusivement étiquetée ' vandale ' ou ' troll ' ( afin d'amalgamer son cas avec ceux des réels fauteurs de troubles ) ou ' ignorant des objectifs ou usages de Wikipedia ' , tout comme le pouvoir soviétique déclarait les dissidents ' fous ' ou ' traîtres '
Chomsky écrivait :
In crude and brutal societies , the Party Line is publicly proclaimed and must be obeyed -- or else .
What you actually believe is your own business and of far less concern .
In societies where the state has lost the capacity to control by force , the Party Line is simply presupposed ; then , vigorous debate is encouraged within the limits imposed by unstated doctrinal orthodoxy .
The cruder of the two systems leads , naturally enough , to disbelief ; the sophisticated variant gives an impression of openness and freedom , and so far more effectively serves to instill the Party Line .
It becomes beyond question , beyond thought itself , like the air we breathe .
En 2013 - 2015 la mainmise perdure
Pis : Wikipedia tend à peu à peu absorber tout contenu libre ( voire le reste ... ) qui , tout d'abord publié ailleurs , sera recopié / transposé dans ses articles , eux - mêmes mieux référencés par les moteurs de recherche ) , donc l'influence sur l'opinion de ses administrateurs sera de plus en plus décisive .
C'est peut - être en cela que le projet Wikipedia est le plus fragile : la centralisation n'offre plus d'intérêt pratique et facilite les menées propagandistes .
En définitive le succès de Wikipedia révèle l'inadéquation des moteurs de recherche qui , parfaits , livreraient en réponse à une " recherche " un " échantillon " raisonné et de nature encyclopédique de tous les documents publiés correspondants à une question donnée .
Mais cela relève de l'IA forte et néglige l'existence de considérables quantités de documents non disponibles en ligne .
Les contributeurs de Wikipedia assument la transition , qui pourrait être longue .
Les incohérences des conventions structurant le projet couplées à la courte vue ou malhonn êteté de certains participants transforment le gros des articles à caractère polémique en autant de bouses .
Les vandales ne sont pas les plus dangereux fâcheux car , à terme , l'insidieux travail de sape des désinformateurs pourrait gagner le gros du projet .
Ils souhaitent distiller leurs thèses et interdire à toute information factuelle qui en montre les limites de trouver droit de cité , et apprécient de voir la qualité et quantité de certains types d'articles Wikipedia ( technique , science ... ) s'améliorer car cela draîne sans cesse davantage de lecteurs vers leur propagande .
Ils écartent leurs contradicteurs afin de transformer les articles traitant d'un thème donné en vecteurs de désinformation par omission , par distorsion voire par mensonge .
Cela cause , surtout hors des disciplines structurées ( sciences et techniques ) , des efforts inutiles de réduction de la désinformation délibérément publiée .
Le gros des thèmes controversés est aujourd ' hui mal traité par Wikipedia et , sans évolution majeure , ne le sera jamais bien .
Des volontaires ( parfois grâce à des projets et robots ) , aujourd ' hui , relisent et corrigent .
La détection automatique de ces errements et négligences , déclenchant des tutoriels adéquats , nous semble propre à ménager les volontaires qui accompagnent les débutants .
La détection , assurée par un logiciel ad hoc , aura lieu lors de l'enregistrement ( action sur le bouton ' Sauvegarder ' ) .
En cas de détection d'au moins une erreur le contributeur verrait des panneaux d'aide détaillant les problèmes de son article .
Chaque panneau citerait un élément douteux de son article ( mise en page , structuration , emploi de certains termes , manque de wikification , absence de catégorie ... ) , bien commenté ( à la façon d'un compilateur produisant un avertissement ou message d'erreur ) et flanqué d'extraits ( et de pointeurs vers ) des sections pertinentes de la documentation de Wikipedia .
Si l'auteur est un utilisateur enregistré le seuil de l'algorithme de détection est proportionnel au nombre d'articles créés ( le détecteur serait moins ' pointilleux ' lors de l'examen de la contribution d'un débutant ) .
Par ailleurs limiter le nombre de panneaux d'aide affichés par session réduirait l'impression de ' matraquage ' .
Le logiciel de détection pourrait également , dans une certaine mesure , traiter ainsi le non-respect du copyright ( détection par la vitesse de saisie , en divisant le gabarit de l'article par la durée de la phase d'édition , voire par une recherche ( Google ) et comparaison après normalisation ... ) ainsi que la nécessité de fusionner des articles ( plusieurs articles créés par un même utilisateur et traitant du même sujet , détection par l'utilisation de mots par ailleurs rares ) .
Pour cela le moteur de Wikipedia ( WikiMedia ) fournirait de l'aide contextuelle lors de la soumission d'un article .

Only Impeachment , Removal or General Strike Can Stop Him
By Webster G. Tarpley
A few days ago , a group of lawyers from western Massachusetts met with the local congressman , Democrat John Olver .
Their request was that Olver take part in the urgent effort to impeach Bush and Cheney .
Olver responded by saying that he had no intention of doing anything to support impeachment .
He went further , offering the information that the United States would soon attack Iran , and that these hostilities would be followed by the imposition of a martial law regime here .
( Original Article )
Senator Dodd is stepping up to the plate and tomorrow will stand tall :
Washington - Senator Chris Dodd ( D - CT ) , an outspoken opponent of the Military Commission Act of 2006 , today introduced legislation which would amend existing law in order to have an effective process for bringing terrorists to justice .
The Effective Terrorists Prosecution Act : * Restores Habeas Corpus protections to detainees
* Narrows the definition of unlawful enemy combatant to individuals who directly participate in hostilities against the United States who are not lawful combatants
* Bars information gained through coercion from being introduced as evidence in trials
* Empowers military judges to exclude hearsay evidence the deem to be unreliable
* Authorizes the US Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces to review decisions by the Military commissions
* Limits the authority of the President to interpret the meaning and application of the Geneva Conventions and makes that authority subject to congressional and judicial oversight
* Provides for expedited judicial review of the Military Commissions
Act of 2006 to determine the constitutionally of its provisions
This is currently not the case under the Military Commission Act , which will be the subject of endless legal challenges .
As important , the bill would also seek to ensure that U.S.servicemen and women are afforded the maximum protection of a strong international legal framework guaranteed by respect for such provisions as the Geneva Conventions and other international standards , and to restore America ’s moral authority as the leader in the world in advancing the rule of law .
“ I take a backseat to no one when it comes to protecting this country from terrorists , ” Sen .
Dodd said .
“ But there is a right way to do this
and a wrong way to do this .
It ’s clear the people who perpetrated these horrendous crimes against our country and our people have no moral compass and deserve to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law .
But in taking away their legal rights , the rights first codified in our country ’s Constitution , we ’re taking away our own moral compass , as well . ”
I 'm not a lawyer , so have at it .

New Horizons at Io
Credit : NASA , JHU / APL , SwRI - Additional Processing : Sean Walker
Explanation : Spewed from a volcano , a complex plume rises over 300 kilometers above the horizon of Jupiter 's moon
Io in this image from cameras onboard the New Horizons spacecraft .
The volcano , Tvashtar , is marked by the bright glow ( about 1 o'clock ) at the moon 's edge , beyond the terminator or night / day shadow line .
The shadow of Io cuts across the plume itself .
Also capturing stunning details on the dayside surface , the high resolution image was recorded when the spacecraft was 2.3 million kilometers from Io .
Later it was combined with lower resolution color data by astro-imager Sean Walker to produce this sharp portrait of the solar system 's most active moon .
Outward bound at almost 23 kilometers per second , the New Horizons spacecraft should cross the orbit of Saturn in June next year , and is ultimately destined to encounter Pluto in 2015 .
U.S. hopes to build on success at Olympics
Recommended Video :
TURIN , ITALY - Hump day of the 2006 Winter Olympics did n't determine who will emerge as this year 's faces to remember .
But on several fronts , Saturday set the agenda for what is to come in the next eight days .
After a week in which no one emerged as Turin 's champion of champions , several familiar names stated their cases Saturday , the busiest day of the Games with nine gold medals awarded .
Two veterans performed like champions in Alpine skiing .
Janica Kostelic of Croatia , who won three gold medals and four overall in 2002 but missed the women 's downhill last week because of illness , won the weather - delayed women 's combined .
Kjetil Andre Aamodt of Norway , the most decorated Alpine skier in history with seven medals , won an eighth by edging Austria 's Hermann Maier for the gold in the men 's super -G .
In speedskating , the U.S. men have gone three - for - three in individual races with a 1 - 2 finish in the 1,000 meters .
Joey Cheek , who won the 500 , added a silver medal , and Shani Davis won the gold after being outdistanced by Chad Hedrick in the 5,000 meters on the first day of speedskating .
Hedrick finished sixth .
Davis ' gold medal was the seventh of the Games — the most of any nation — for the United States .
The U.S. has 13 total medals , including six from snowboarding and four from speedskating .
Norway leads the overall medal count with 16 , followed by Germany with 15 and Russia with 13 .
With a week to go , the U.S. on Saturday tied its record of 13 medals for a non-domestic Games , set in 1998 in Nagano and 1994 in Lillehammer .
The U.S. won 34 medals , including 10 golds , in 2002 in Salt Lake City .
" We are very pleased with where we stand , " said U.S. Olympic Committee spokesman Darryl Seibel .
" We 're doing well in speedskating .
We 're doing well in the new snowboarding events .
Those are popular TV events with spectators , and that helps drive sponsorships and capture the interest of the American public . "
There have been some fine individual performances thus far :
• The German women swept the podium in luge , as expected .
• Tatiana Totmianina and Maxim Marinin in pairs and Evgeni Plushenko in men's singles took Russia halfway to a gold medal sweep .
• The Germans are cleaning up in biathlon and the Koreans are dominating short track speedskting .
• Estonia has three golds in cross country , including two by Kristina Smigun .
More to come
Women 's figure skating , the signature event of the Games , is yet to come , and the winner of that event will take her place in the forefront of collective memory .
But sheer number of events dictates that other faces to remember will come from skiing and speedskating , and each offers all sorts of possibilities .
Kostelic , whose four golds are the most for any female Alpine skier , is entered in the super - G today against a field that includes downhill gold medalist Michaela Dorfmeister of Austria but she said she may skip the race .
She is scheduled to compete in the slalom on Wednesday and the giant slalom next Friday .
" Records are meant to be broken , " she said .
" Someone else is probably going to come along and win five gold medals , but to win four is nice .
" I have two more races to come here .
This medal happened .
I 'll put it behind my back and concentrate on my next races , and then we can celebrate after the Olympics . "
Aamodt , meanwhile , became the only man to win four Alpine golds and the first to win the same event at three Olympics — and he is n't finished .
He said he will ski at least one more year .
As a group , the U.S. snowboarders have been as spectacular as any team in town , with 1 - 2 finishes in men's and women 's halfpipe among their six medals .
" Seeing the halfpipe guys and girls throw down the way they did , then coming out here and make history with the first snowboardcross and seeing the amount of marketing in the U.S. that went in the sport , I think snowboarding is becoming the heart and soul of the American team and the Olympic Games , " said Seth Wescott , who won the snowboard cross gold medal .
Speedskaters soaring
Wescott might get some argument on that point from the men's speedskating team , which had four skaters in the top 10 in the 1,000 meters Saturday and now has swept the three individual gold medals : Cheek in the 500 , Davis in the 1,000 and Hedrick at 5,000 .
Hedrick and Davis are medal possibilities at 1,500 meters , where Hedrick holds the world record , and Hedrick also holds the record at 10,000 meters , which will wrap up the speedskating program .
The possibility of another Davis - Hedrick duel at a distance where both have excelled , could play a major role in determining who emerges as the most decorated men's speedskater of the Games .
" I 'm not somebody who goes off the line trying for second , " Hedrick said .
" Once Shani beat me ( in the 1,000 ) , I did n't care if I got a bronze medal or whatever , I 'm here to win .
That 's my attitude .
It 's all or nothing . "
That 's been the attitude , too , of Bode Miller , who failed to finish the men 's super - G on Saturday and is now 0 - for - 3 for the 2006 Olympics .
The U.S. men's
Alpine ski team , which billed itself as the best in the world entering the Games , has won one medal , Ted Ligety 's gold in the men 's combined .
" I think it 's ( the U.S. performance ) pretty poor right now , " said Daron Rahlves , who was 10th in the downhill and ninth in the super - G. " I think we should have been able to medal in every event .
" You look at the downhill and super G , that 's bad .
What Ted ( Ligety ) did was awesome .
He pretty much saved our butts .
But we 're not looking for him to be the guy on top .
That 's where you expect Bode and me to show up . "

US forces kill Iraqi civilians every day
By James Cogan
17 July 2007
For more than four years of US occupation , the Iraqi people have known that coming too close to American troops can be a death sentence .
Now , internal statistics presented to US Iraq commander General David Petraeus , and subsequently leaked to the McClatchy news service , shed some light on the extent of civilian killings .
In the 12 months since July 2006 , according to McClatchy ’s sources , the US military has officially admitted to killing or wounding 429 Iraqis in 3,200 “ escalation of force ” incidents — situations where US troops on patrol , manning checkpoints or escorting vehicle convoys have opened fire on men , women and children they considered a threat .
The figures indicate that civilians are shot at by US forces somewhere in Iraq at least every three hours .
The rate at which civilians are being fired on has sharply risen with the deployment of 30,000 additional US troops to Iraq and the intensification of American operations in densely populated residential areas of Baghdad and other cities .
In July 2006 , 22 civilians were reported killed or maimed .
In February 2007 , as the Bush administration ’s “ surge ” went into motion , 46 Iraqi civilian casualties were officially documented by the US military .
A number of factors come into play in the wanton civilian deaths caused by US troops : sheer fear of being killed themselves ; the devaluation of Iraqi lives by military propaganda ; and the general brutalisation of military personnel who are exposed to constant death and destruction .
Interviews with 50 Iraq combat veterans published by the Nation magazine on July 9 and soon to be presented in a new book , Collateral Damage , provide first - hand testimony of the conduct of US troops against the Iraqi population .
The current July 30 edition of the Nation contains a lengthy presentation of the veteran ’s statements .
( See “ The Other War : Iraq Vets Bear Witness ” )
Specialist Ben Schrader , who served with an armoured unit from February 2004 to February 2005 , told the Nation : “ One example I can give you , we ’d be driving down the road in a convoy and all of the sudden an IED blows up .
And you know , you ’ve got these scared kids on these guns and they start opening fire .
And there could be innocent people everywhere .
And I ’ve seen this .
I mean , on numerous occasions where innocent people died because we ’re cruising down and a bomb goes off . ”
Sergeant Dustin Flatt , who also served in 2004 , recounted how troops protecting a convoy that passed his position near Mosul opened fire on a civilian car behind them : “ Basically they took shots at the car .
Warning shots , I do n’t know .
But they shot the car .
Well , one of the bullets happened to just pierce the windscreen and went straight into the face of this woman in the car .
And she was , as far as I know , instantly killed ...
Her son was driving the car and she had her three little girls in the back seat ...
And they came up to us , because we were actually in a defensive position right next to the hospital ... she was obviously dead and the girls were crying . ”
Another soldier , Geoffrey Milfred , told the Nation about an incident he knew of that occurred at a checkpoint : “ This unit sets up this traffic control point and this 18 - year - old kid is on top of an armoured Humvee with a .50 - calibre machine gun .
This car speeds at him pretty quick and he makes a split - second decision that that ’s a suicide bomber and he presses the butterfly trigger and puts 200 rounds in less than a minute into this vehicle .
It killed the mother , father and two kids .
The boy was aged four and the daughter was aged three .
And they briefed this to the general ...
And this colonel turns around to this full division staff and says , “ If these **** hajis [ derogatory term for Arabs ] learned to drive , this **** would n’t happen . ”
Lieutenant Jonathan Morgenstein , an officer attached in 2004 - 2005 to a marine civil affairs unit — which investigated “ escalation of force ” incidents — told the Nation : “ You physically could not do an investigation every time a civilian was wounded or killed because it just happens a lot and you ’d spend all your time doing that . ”
Attempting to sum up the prevailing mentality , Specialist Jeff Englehart told the magazine : “ I guess while I was there , the general attitude was ‘ A dead Iraqi is just another dead Iraqi . ’ ”
At a July 13 press conference in Arlington , Virginia , US Defence Secretary Robert Gates and Joints Chief of Staff General Peter Pace were not asked by any journalist to confirm , deny or comment on either the McClatchy report , which had been published two days earlier , or the publication of the Nation interviews .
The media silence is remarkable considering that the official figures are clearly a vast underestimation of the real scale of civilian killings in occupied Iraq .
As McClatchy ’s Nancy Youssef noted in her July 11 article : “ The statistics do n’t include instances of American soldiers killing civilians during raids , arrests or in the midst of battle with armed groups , and it remains unclear how the US military tracks such information .
Often rotating units use their own systems and there have been several incidents of soldiers not reporting the deaths of civilians , most notably the November 2005 shooting of 24 civilians in the northern Iraqi town of Haditha . ”
In the November 19 , 2005 , marines went on a rampage in Haditha after a roadside bomb killed one of their squad .
Five civilians were murdered in a taxi , one gunned down on the street and 18 men , women and children were slaughtered in their homes .
Despite the obvious evidence of a massacre , both the marines ’ commanding officer and US military intelligence reported the dead Iraqis as armed insurgents .
There is no reason to believe the cover - up surrounding Haditha was an isolated incident .
In a recent US military mental health survey , published in May , 45 percent of army personnel and 60 percent of marines in Iraq stated they would not report a fellow serviceman for killing or injuring an innocent non-combatant .
In the trial that began on June 30 of two US soldiers charged with murdering civilians , the defendants are accused of placing weapons beside their victims so they would be classified as insurgents .
A third soldier of the same unit was charged with murder and cover - up on July 2 .
( See “ US troops charged with murders , cover-ups in Iraq ” )
Moreover , the official figures do not include the civilians who have been killed or wounded at the hands of the thousands of private security contractors employed by the US government in Iraq .
Security contractors have the same right to fire on Iraqi civilians they believe to be a threat as the US military .
They are obliged to display a sign in English and Arabic stating “ Danger .
Keep back .
Authorised to use lethal force ” .
Unlike US troops who travel in recognisable military vehicles , contractors generally travel in unmarked civilian vehicles and sometimes disguise themselves in local attire .
How many Iraqis have been victim to contractor killings is unknown .
Some incidents have come to light , however .
In May , employees of Blackwater Security shot and killed an Iraqi who drove “ too close ” to their vehicle .
According to an Iraqi official cited by the Washington Post , the man had just driven out of a petrol station onto the road and witnesses stated the shooting was “ unprovoked ” .
In 2005 , a so - called “ trophy ” video was posted on a website , showing four incidents in which contractors fired into Iraqi cars that appeared to come within 30 metres or so of their vehicle .
In at least one of the shootings , bullets clearly impacted on the driver - side windscreen and the vehicle veered suddenly off the road .
The website was allegedly connected to employees of the British security company Aegis .
At the time , Captain Adnan Tawfiq of the Iraqi Interior Ministry told the British Sunday Telegraph : “ When the security companies kill people , they just drive away and nothing is done .
Sometimes we ring the companies concerned and they deny everything .
The families do n’t get any money or compensation .
I would say we have had about 50 - 60 incidents of this kind . ”
As the WSWS has warned before , the carnage being inflicted against civilians will have ramifications in the United States as well as on generations of Iraqis .
Thousands of young men and women — both former soldiers and contractors — are returning from Iraq bearing the psychological scars of having participated in , or witnessed acts of staggering brutality and indifference to human life .
The primary responsibility for these war crimes rests with the Bush administration , which ordered the illegal invasion of Iraq and is waging a vicious neo-colonial war to suppress any opposition to its continued occupation of the country .

The Virtis image shows a " vortex " over the south pole
They show the hothouse planet 's south pole from a distance of 206,452 km .
Mission scientists are already intrigued by a dark " vortex " feature which can be clearly seen in one image .
Venus Express will orbit the planet for about 500 Earth days to study its atmosphere , which is thought to have undergone runaway greenhouse warming .
Venus ' dense , largely carbon dioxide , atmosphere acts as a blanket , trapping incoming solar radiation to heat the surface to an average temperature of 467C ( 872 F ) - hot enough to melt lead .
Polar vortex
Experts had previously suspected the south pole might have a vortex feature ; a vast vortex with an unusual double - eye feature has already been observed over the planet 's north pole .
But the south polar region has scarcely been observed .
" We can see there is a twister here that is similar to that which we know from the north pole , " said mission scientist Horst Uwe Keller .
The VMC imaged the south pole in ultraviolet
European Space Agency ( Esa ) officials said the pictures were " surprisingly clear " , with " unexpected detail " .
They were captured on 12 April by the Virtis ( Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer ) and Venus Monitoring Camera ( VMC ) instruments onboard , as the spacecraft passed below the planet in an elliptical arc .
The false - colour Virtis composite image shows Venus ' day side at left and night side at right , and corresponds to a scale of 50 km per pixel .
Night half
The spectacular night half was taken via an infrared filter and shows dynamic spiral cloud structures in the lower atmosphere , around 55 km in altitude .
The darker regions correspond to thicker cloud cover , while the brighter regions correspond to thinner clouds .
Mariner 10 took this image of the north polar vortex in the 1970s
Venus Express successfully executed a 50 - minute main engine burn on Tuesday designed to slow its speed enough to be captured by the planet 's gravitational pull .
As the spacecraft tightens its orbit in the coming months , scientists expect it to capture more detailed and revealing images of the planet .
Scientists hope to learn how Venus , which is similar to Earth in size , mass and composition , evolved so differently over the last 4.6 billion years .
The mission is the first to be sent to the planet in 15 years .

Original article and images by Belfast resident Liam Moore .
Belfast , the capital city of Northern Ireland , has been home to some of the worst violence Ireland has endured .
The Troubles , between the late 1960 ’s and 1998 , divided the nation , mainly between Nationalist Catholics and Unionist Protestants .
The Agreement on Good Friday ( April 10th , 1998 ) brought an end to 30 years of suffering and bitter feuding between these communities .
Throughout The Troubles both sides painted large murals on buildings , particularly in residential areas on houses at the end of terraced rows :
Many of these murals glorify paramilitary groups such as the Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) or the Ulster Volunteer Force ( UVF ) .
The murals of Belfast have acted as beacons to people , declaring allegiances from one area to the next :
Murals of Belfast have in the past and still do create a sense belonging and identity for residents .
However , not all such murals were designed to incite hatred or divide communities .
Some show a more Celtic flair and inject colour into less established areas :
Murals concerning the political polices of the USA and the war in Israel have been popular as well , because many Belfast residents feel they can relate to the violence in other countries :
As Belfast emerges from a decade of peace brought on by the Good Friday Agreement , things have begun to change .
Murals promoting a political or religious belief within Northern Ireland are being painted over and replaced by neutral colors or advertising for local businesses :
Iconic soccer figures such as George Best and Samuel English now grace some of the walls too .
Belfast residents now prefer looking up to a different kind of hero than the paramilitary fighters of the past .
A new generation is emerging , growing up in less dangerous times :
It is fair to say the murals of Belfast are as diverse as they are artistic , made with dedication and skill by people of different communities and differing opinions , each wanting to make their voice heard .
They are a way for people to make known who they are .
A way of belonging .

President Bush is sending his top aide on national security affairs to Capitol Hill on Thursday to confront what has become a tough crowd on the Iraq war .
A majority of senators believe troops should start coming home within the next few months .
A new House investigation concluded this week that the Iraqis have little control over an ailing security force .
And House Republicans are calling to revive the independent Iraq Study Group to give the nation options .
Keep Dreaming
The summer can be miserable unless you know what to do .
Unfortunately , most people would rather spend their days inside rather than think of something exciting .
To help you get the most out of your summer , I have compiled a list of my favorite activities along with pros , cons , and helpful tips .
And you thought programming your hentai website in C++ was exhilarating !
No matter how stubborn or picky you are there should be at least one thing on this list able to please your lazy ass .
Alright , the sun is out , and your fun day is already wasting away .
So set down whatever nerd things you 're doing , put some pants on , and come outside .
Camping
Camping is a great way to rid yourself of time wasting habits .
Instead of sitting in front of a computer , you can start sitting in front of a campfire .
If it helps pass the time , think of the fire as the planet 's first operating system .
Camping is common among creepy white trash and loud , drunk white trash , so spending the night in a public camping ground means having these people flanking your five - foot plot .
It 's fine that the neighbors are obnoxious and untrustworthy , you traveled twenty minutes outside of town to enjoy nature , not to sing the newest Tim McGraw song .
Sleeping in the woods allows a person to return to his or her natural beginnings ; unfortunately , returning to one 's natural beginning requires four hundred dollars worth of gear .
Helpful Tip : Avoid rape by reading Froloxio 's helpful tips !
Pro
Basic living in nature ( with the aid of toilets , electrical outlets , propane grills , bug spray , tents , showers , flashlights , disposable silverware , power generator , lighter fluid , and a modest 70 foot R.V. )
Mom can't tell you it 's bedtime
( not true if your mom brought you ) dfdfdfdfd
Con
Regardless of the campsite 's size , your neighbor will set their tent up inches away
Everything smells like dead fish
You will get poison ivy on your face and crotch within the first five , resulting in your front end looking like two proboscis monkeys stacked on top of one another
Bird Watching
Prefered Method
I know , it seems weird , but trust me .
Bird watching can be a lot of fun .
As a hobby , it is enthralling and relaxing .
Simply choose someplace you feel comfortable ( backyard , local park , not EB games ) and wait .
The idea of bird watching is to go unseen , so your extensive collection of camouflage pants will finally come in handy .
You may have to stay still for at least thirty seconds , so be sure to bring an extra dose of Ritalin .
If you want to attract more birds to your area , try scraping sesame seeds off the top of your Baconator into a bird tray .
Helpful Tip :
If you see a rare bird , kill it .
That way you can show others !
Pro
Feeling of success when you spot a new bird
The same skills needed to be a successful birdwatcher are the same skills you use to stalk young girls

David George said two crocodiles stalked him each night
David George 's ordeal
David George , 53 , said he was forced to take such drastic action after he accidentally strayed into a crocodile - infested area of Queensland .
He only had two meat sandwiches to keep him going , as crocodiles moved beneath his tree each night until his rescue .
Mr George said he decided it was safer to hold out for a rescue team than try to make a run for it .
His problems began after he fell off his horse while out in the northern Australia outback .
If I had n't seen the crocs circling me ...
I would have made a push for it .
But I knew the safest thing was for me to sit tight and wait
David George
Dazed and bleeding , he climbed back on his horse and hoped it would lead him home .
It was only when he regained his senses he realised he had been taken deep into a crocodile - infested swamp .
" I had to get off the horse and fall on the long 8 ft ( 2.4 m ) high swamp grass to clear a path , when I fell straight into a crocodile nest , " he told Brisbane 's Courier Newspaper .
" That spooked me .
There were some monstrous tracks and the big ones are never far from the nest .
" I could n't go back , it was too far and too dangerous , so I headed to the nearest high ground and stayed there , hoping someone would come and find me before the crocs did . "
' Red eyes '
Mr George , manager of the Silver Plains cattle station near Coen in Queensland 's far north , said he was stalked each night by two crocodiles that would sit at the bottom of the tree staring at him .
" All I could see was two sets of red eyes below me and all night I had to listen to a big bull croc bellowing a bit further out , " he said .
Although Mr George 's two sandwiches ran out after three days , he was able to get running water during the day and knew rescuers were looking for him as he could see helicopters in the air above his tree .
" If I had n't seen the crocs circling me , and if I had n't fallen into the croc nest , I would have made a push for it .
But I knew the safest thing was for me to sit tight and wait , " he said .
A chocolate bar , given to him by rescuers after being winched to safety , " was like a gourmet meal , " he told the newspaper .

UPDATE : I was just about the only one who did n’t know the Boyscout Law .
Many Cryptogon readers did .
I ’m not really sure why both of those visits happened at the same exact moment .
And both user agent headers were the same .
Does it have something to do with the fact that that the TSC user clicked the Google cache link instead of clicking the direct link to Cryptogon ?
Something to do with the spooky splice jobs ?
Now , you might be wondering , “ Kevin , how do you know it ’s the Terrorist Screening Center if the hostname is techtrack.gov ? ”
In Review of the Terrorist Screening Center ( Redacted for Public Release ) Audit Report 05 - 27 June 2005 Office of the Inspector General Appendix IV Terrorist Screening Center Response , under IT Operations , Grasshopper will find exactly two sentences that have not been redacted :
For SBU connectivity , each of the partner agencies has brought its system into TSC space and used those paths to pass data to and from the home systems .
Purely unclassified connectivity is provided by the Techtrack system .
Grasshopper may also refer to page 14 of the Michigan Chapter of The Association of Public - Safety Communications Officials – International , Inc. – APCO International Newsletter from May / June 2005 which mentions the “ possible terrorist alert ” handling codes and procedures for law enforcement .
This information was provided by the Terrorist Screening Center .
Note the email address and domain name to which questions about the TSC should be sent .
That ’s right .
It goes to techtrack.gov .
That thing is some kind of TSC gateway to the public Internet .
( Now , I do n’t know about you , but I think that the Michigan Chapter of The Association of Public - Safety Communications Officials – International , Inc. f#@ * %d up big time by placing that document on the Internet .
Let me know if they remove that information . )
Since the number of people being added to the terrorist watch list is “ out of control ” there is an increasing chance that you might find yourself in a situation where a cop is handling you according to the directives on page 14 of that document above .
In short , NOT volunteering information to pigs is more important than ever , since the Homeland ’s Magic 8 - Ball might have you listed with the “ handling codes ” 3 or 4 .
If that system lists you with the “ handling codes ” 1 or 2 , you ’re going to be arrested / detained on terrorism related offenses regardless of what you say or do n’t say to the cop .
Note to the TSC user ( and other clueless computer users ) about trying to avoid showing up in server logs by using Google cache :
Google caches only the text of the Web page .
All the external files ( Javascript , Cascading Style Sheets , images , Flash , etc. ) are not saved by Google .
If a Web site deletes its style sheet , for instance , and the old page is viewed in Google ’s cache , it will render without the style sheet .
Same thing for images , etc .
When a browser requests a file from a Web server , that request is stored in the Web site ’s logs .
So it is only if a Web page has no external files that you will not show up in someone ’s Web log by viewing Google ’s cache .
Thanks Terrorist Screening Center user .
Because of your stupidity , we learned some interesting information about how evil works today .
An anti-evolutionary Christian extremist suspected of sending threatening letters to biology professors at the University of Colorado has gone on the lam , according to a staff member familiar with a police investigation into the matter .
Police at the University of Colorado say they know the identity of the individual who sent threatening letters to several biology professors who taught evolution .
However , the police wo n't name the individual until they make an arrest , said detective lieutenant commander John Kish .
Staff at the biology department have been issued a picture of Michael Korn , a messianic Jew , who has said he is the " messenger of God " and runs a website called JesusOverIsrael .
" ( Korn 's ) picture has been circulated on flyers saying : ' If you see this guy dial this number , ' " said Jeffry Mitton , professor and chair of the department of ecology and evolutionary biology , and one of the instructors who received the threats .
" He does not seem to be around , " Mitton added .
" We believe he is gone , we know not where . "
Korn was seen distributing flyers suggesting the instructors were " child molesters " for teaching evolution to students .
In the last year , a series of threatening letters and e-mails – the most recent referring to " killing the enemies of Christian society " – were sent to several professors at the biology department in Boulder .
( Read more on the developing story in the Wired Science blog . )
How serious are the threats ?
It 's unknown , but the letters appear to mark one of the most aggressive statements yet in a growing debate over the place of evolutionary theory in education .
At a time when the Virginia Tech and Columbine school shootings are fresh in Americans ' minds , the threats are particularly worrisome for Mitton and his colleagues .
" Debate is fine , " said Branson Hilliard , a spokesman for the university .
" But threats and invocations of violence and intimations of violence are not what go on at a college campus .
Students cannot learn in a context of fear . "
At first , professors considered the letters a nuisance , but the most recent threats were delivered after business hours when the biology building was closed , and police were called .
The letters were slipped under professors ' doors in envelopes sealed with tape and decorated with skull and crossbones .
This week , biology professors met several times with police about increasing security and canceled extracurricular activities in their building .
" There have been a lot of meetings about what times the doors will be closed … .
We 've increased not only patrols around the building but also ( have police doing ) walkthroughs , " said Mitton .
According to Mitton , Korn appears to have skipped town .
Police visited Korn 's apartment , but found that he and his wife were gone .
The apartment had been sublet and his wife had quit her job , said Mitton , who added he has met and spoken to Korn on several occasions .
Contacted earlier this week , Korn declined to address specific questions from Wired News , but he forwarded e-mail messages he had previously sent to the Denver Post , which published a story on July 10 about the case .
His e-mail message did n't admit to sending the recent threatening letters , but tried to explain their meaning .
" The skull and crossbones on the envelopes given to the EBIO ( evolutionary biology ) professors symbolize the human fossils about whose age they constantly lie to the public , " Korn wrote .
Approval Voting Home Page
Approval voting has several compelling advantages over other voting procedures :
It is eminently practicable and easy to understand
It will reduce negative campaigning
It will increase voter turnout
It helps elect the strongest candidate
It gives voters flexible and simple options
It will give minority candidates their proper due
Citizens for Approval Voting is an educational and outreach organization formed in 2003 whose attractive web site provides good information about and arguments for Approval voting .
There is also a sister political organization Americans for Approval Voting which is dedicated to getting Approval Voting adopted for single officeholder elections in America .
I think it is clear that this would put our democracy on much better footings and I heartily endorse Americans for Approval Voting .
Read on for more background on voting and evidence for all these claims .
See also Approval Voting , J. Econ Perspectives 9 ( 1 ) , Winter 1995 , by Robert J. Weber , who came up with the name " Approval Voting " in 1971 and was one of its discoverers .
Other good references :
Comparison of voting systems
Single - Winner
When there is just one winner in an election , a wide array of alternative voting reforms have been put forth .
Lest you get lost in the details , keep in mind that nearly everyone agrees that the traditional single - vote - plurality system does the worst job of picking the candidate that the voters prefer .
The first solidly researched comparison that I saw , which includes computer simulations based on models of voting behavior , was Making Multicandidate Elections More Democratic , by Samuel Merrill , Princeton University Press , 1988 .
It concludes that the most reliable systems for meeting the " Condorcet " and " maximum social utility " criteria are approval voting and the Instant Runoff Vote ( also known as IRV or Preferential Voting ) and traditional runoff methods .
Among these three , approval voting ranks slightly higher and is much easier to implement .
IRV suffers from significant problems in real life .
This was demonstrated in the 2009 Burlington mayoral contest , where a candidate that clearly beat each other candidate head - to - head ended up being eliminated early on !
A more recent approach , Range Voting shares many of the advantages of Approval Voting and allows more nuanced votes , but makes ballot design and public education somewhat more difficult .
Other methods , such as the Borda Count and those based on the Condorcet tally itself , tend in practice to be vulnerable to " strategic voting " .
I.e. , voters have incentive to vote insincerely ( e.g. punish their favorite 's chief rival with a last - place vote ) , and the resulting outcome matches the Condorcet criteria less than methods which do n't reward voters for insincere votes .
And the Borda Count is supported in a book that compares it with Approval Voting : Chaotic Elections !
A Mathematician Looks at Voting by Donald G. Saari
It seems clear to me that approval voting is the most practical and best system for single - winner elections .
Here are some more references to other perspectives :
Multiple - Winner
When there is more than one winner the situation is very different .
Most countries have a different perspective on what it actually means to select a legislative body that represents the people , focusing more on representing viewpoints than geographical areas .
See the Center for Voting and Democracy to learn about Proportional Representation .
No matter what voting system is used , it is important for you to learn about the candidates and issues ( yahoo | NPR ) and vote !
Working from an office in Jerusalem , and possibly another in the West Bank , Mr Blair will become the special representative for the Middle East quartet of UN , EU , US and Russia .
The announcement comes on the eve of his departure from Downing Street tomorrow and is privately welcomed by Gordon Brown .
The arrangement , which has been under preparation for weeks , is due to be agreed at a meeting of the quartet today .
Friends of Mr Blair suggest he would make it a central purpose of his mission to work to restore Palestinian unity after the armed takeover of the Gaza Strip by the Islamist movement Hamas .
At times he has had to bend with an American willingness to bolster Mahmoud Abbas , the Fatah leader , while ignoring the plight of 1.4 m Palestinians in Gaza .
The idea of Mr Blair doing this job is understood to have originated with the prime minister himself in conversation with George Bush , who then suggested it to the UN .
The UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , is said to be a keen supporter and Washington was reported last night to have mounted " an enormous push " to ensure Mr Blair got the post .
Diplomats said there was some disquiet over the way US talks with Mr Blair were well advanced before any details were shared with the other quartet partners .
Mr Blair has contantly pressed Mr Bush to take a more active role in securing a two - state solution for Israel and Palestine .
Though his standing in the so - called Arab street may be low because of his role in the invasion of Iraq , he is held in high standing among Arab political elites , and he has frequently spoken of his passion to play a part in helping to secure peace in the Middle East .
It was being stressed last night that Mr Blair 's role - in the short term at least - would not be to act as a mediator between the Palestinians and the Israelis , or to become a negotiator for the road map to peace .
He might , however , be responsible for trying to persuade the Palestinians to accept the conditions for ending the international boycott of Hamas .
The now defunct Hamas government has not received any international aid since its election in March 2006 , although aid has been sent directly to the poorest Palestinians through a temporary international mechanism .
The quartet says aid can only be conditional on the Palestinians accepting the right of Israel to exist and giving a commitment to exclusively peaceful means and to abide by all previous agreements .
Critics have claimed the preconditions have impoverished the Palestinians , boosted unemployment and led to the radicalisation of Hamas , culminating in Hamas controlling Gaza , and Fatah the West Bank .
Diplomats familiar with the proposed mandate for Mr Blair said it did not differ in substance from that of his predecessor , Jim Wolfensohn , who left the job in April 2006 .
Mr Wolfensohn worked on issues such as galvanising international economic assistance to the Palestinians , economic development , governance , justice and human rights .
Mr Blair 's appointment was discussed by Mr Ban and Condoleezza Rice , the US secretary of state , at a conference in Paris yesterday before the quartet envoys met to conclude the deal in Jerusalem this morning .
The four envoys are David Welch for the US , Michael Williams for the UN , Marc Otte for the EU and Sergei Yakovlev for Russia .
It was Mr Welch , assistant secretary of state for the Middle East , who discussed the idea with the prime minister in London last week .
Russia had initially been opposed to the plan but Sergei Lavrov , the country 's foreign minister , referred the proposal back to Vladimir Putin , the president , diplomats said .
Although Mr Putin and Mr Blair held a relatively heated bilateral meeting at the G8 last month , Mr Putin is not going to deploy his veto .
Mr Blair 's reputation as a negotiator in Northern Ireland suggests that he has the patience and determination to bring differing sides together .
He has repeatedly said the Middle East peace talks need to be micro-managed in the way that he handled the Northern Ireland peace process .
Diplomats say the prime minister is in a better position than Mr Wolfensohn , a former World Bank president who was backed by Kofi Annan at the UN but eventually opposed by the US .
" That may not be the case with Blair because he has such a hold in Washington , " said one .
An Arab official was more sceptical .
" I do n't know what Blair is going to be able to achieve , " he said .
" And anyway , what does Palestinian governance mean at this point in time when there is a geographical and political separation between the West Bank and Gaza ? "
Mr Blair 's talks in Rome with the Pope were largely centred on his strategy to build a bridge between faiths .
One of his great aims is to secure a reconciliation between Islam and Christianity .
His appointment would come at a low ebb for the peace process , although there were slightly more optimistic noises from a summit in Egypt yesterday .
The Israeli prime minister , Ehud Olmert , said last night that he would release 250 Palestinian prisoners in an effort to restart the long - stalled peace process , after meeting Mr Abbas , King Abdullah of Jordan and the Egyptian president , Hosni Mubarak .
Fox tries a second take on apology for mistaking black Congressman with indicted colleague
Michael Roston
Published : Wednesday June 6 , 2007 Print This Email This
Fox News 's Martha MacCallum did a second take of her apology to Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) for mixing him up with indicted Louisiana Democrat William Jefferson in a Monday afternoon broadcast .
" In error , we aired some video of Congressman John Conyers ... we in no way meant to suggest that there was any connection between the Jefferson indictment and Congressman Conyers , " she said .
The Live Desk host 's 30 - second apology for confusing Conyers with another African - American lawmaker came after an 8 - second clip on Tuesday afternoon in which MacCallum failed to explain the particular error her production team had made .
RAW STORY reported on Conyers ' angry response to the first apology on Tuesday .
" This type of disrespect for people of color should no longer be tolerated .
I am personally offended by the network 's complete disregard for accuracy in reporting and lackluster on - air apology , " said Conyers , the veteran lawmaker who is Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
The video Fox News played in the Monday segment on Jefferson showed Conyers greeting Attorney General Alberto Gonzales at a May 10 hearing on the firing of 8 US Attorneys .
Fox pinned the error on a young staff member in an Associated Press report Tuesday night .
" Fox blamed the mistake on a 22 - year - old production assistant hurriedly grabbing a wrong videotape .
Fox 's Washington bureau chief , Brian Wilson , said he was mortified by the error , " the news service reported .
As Fox News offered its second apology , groups criticizing the Congressional Black Caucus for cooperating with the network on sponsoring a Democratic presidential debate before the 2008 primaries seized on the Monday gaffe as evidence that the network was racially insensitive .
" We applaud Chairman Conyers for calling attention to Foxs history of marginalizing and denigrating black Americans , " said James Rucker , executive director of ColorOfChange.org .
" Today , were calling other CBC members to stand with Congressman Conyers and denounce Fox , a network that has called black churches cults , implied repeatedly that Senator Obama is a terrorist , and has used the solemn occasion of Coretta Scott Kings funeral to call black leaders ' racist . ' "
The video clip of MacCallum 's second apology is below .

Hello visitors from boingboing / slashdot .
I ’m a doctor and I write in the Guardian and the BMJ about quackery , health scares , and pseudoscience in the media .
Ben Goldacre
Saturday May 26 , 2007
The Guardian
Wo n’t somebody , please , think of the children ?
Three weeks ago I received my favourite email of all time , from a science teacher .
“ I ’ve just had to ask a BBC Panorama film crew not to film in my school or in my class because of the bad science they were trying to carry out , ”  it began , describing in perfect detail the Panorama which aired this week .
[ you ’ll need to skip through the last two minutes of Eastenders to watch it …]
This show was on the suppressed dangers of radiation from Wi -Fi networks , and how they are harming children .
There was no science in it , just some “ experiments ” they did for themselves , and some conflicting experts .
Panorama disagreed with the WHO expert , so he was smeared for not being “ independent ” enough , and working for a phone company in the past .
I do n’t do personal smear .
But Panorama started it .
How independent were they , and the “ experiments ” they did ?
They had 28 minutes , I have under 700 words .
Here we go .
In the show , you can see them walking around Norwich with a special “ radiation monitor ” .
Radiation , incidentally , is their favourite word , and they use it 30 times , although Wi-Fi is “ radiation ” in the same sense that light is .
“ Ooh its well into the red there , ”  says reporter Paul Kenyon , holding up the detector ( 19 minutes in ) .
Gosh that sounds bad .
Well into the red on what ?
It ’s tricky to callibrate measurements , and to decide what to measure , and what the cut off point is for “ red ”  .
Panorama ’s readings were “ well into the red ” on “ The COM Monitor ” , a special piece of detecting equipment designed from scratch and built by none other than Alasdair Philips of Powerwatch , the man who leads the campaign against WiFi .
His bespoke device is manufactured exclusively for Powerwatch , and he will sell one to you for just £ 175 .
Alasdair decided what “ red ” meant on Panorama ’s device .
So not very independent then .
Panorama did not disclose where this detector came from .
And they know that Alasdair Philips is no ordinary “ engineer doing the readings ” , because they told us in the show , but they did n’t tell the school that .
“ They wanted to take some mesurements in my class room , compare them to the radiation from a phone mast and film some kids using wireless laptops .
They introduced ‘ the engineer ’ , whom I googled . ” 
He found it was the same man who runs Powerwatch , the pressure group campaigning against mobile phones , Wi-Fi , and “ electrosmog ”  .
In Alasdair ’s Powerwatch shop you can buy shielded netting for your windows at just £ 70.50 per metre , and special shielding paint at £ 50.99 per litre .
To paint a small eleven foot square bedroom in your house with Powerwatch ’s products you would need about 10 litres , costing you £ 500 .
When the children saw Alasdair ’s Powerwatch website , and the excellent picture of the insulating mesh beekeeper hat that he sells ( £ 27 ) to “ protect your head from excess microwave exposure ” , they were astonished and outraged .
Panorama were calmly expelled from the school .
So what about Panorama ’s classroom experiment ?
Not very independent , and not very well designed , as the children pointed out .
“ They set about downloading the biggest file they could get hold of – so the Wi-Fi signal was working as powerfully as possible – and took the peak reading during that , ” says our noble science teacher .
It was a great teaching exercise , and the children made valuable criticisms of Panorama ’s methodology , such as “ well , we ’re not allowed to download files so it would n’t be that strong ” , “ only a couple of classes have wifi ” , and , “ we only use the laptops a couple of times a week ” .
Panorama planned to have the man from Powerwatch talk to the students for about 10 minutes about how Wi -Fi worked , and what effects it had on the human body .
Then they were going to reveal the readings he had got from the mast , compare them to what Powerwatch had measured in the classrom , and film the kids reaction to the news .
So not very independent then .
“ Surprisingly enough the readings in my room were going to be higher ( about 3 times higher I believe ) and with the kids having been briefed by the engineer from Powerwatch first they were hoping for a reaction that would make good telly . ”
Sadly for them it did n’t happen .
“ We told Panorama this morning that as they had n’t been honest with us about what was going on and because of the bad science they were trying to pass off , we did n’t want them to film in the school or with our students . ” 
The images you see of children in the show are just library footage .
I ’m sure there should be more research into Wi-Fi .
If Panorama had made a 28 minute show about the scientific evidence , we would be discussing that .
Instead they produced “ radiation ” scares , and smears about whether people are “ independent ” .
People in glass houses are welcome to throw stones , at their own risk .
A BBC Spokesperson said : “ Alistair Phillips is one of a handful of people with the right equipment to do this test .
He was only used in this capacity and was not given an opportunity to interpret the readings let alone campaign on them in the film .
We filmed the tests taken at the school and did n’t return . ”
Please send your bad science to bad.science@guardian.co.uk
More :
There ’s some more general criticism of the program and a response here , and if you were going to make a complaint , you might be disappointed by the response , since it was written before you complained .
To me this is a very uncomplicated situation of heinous scaremongering and bias .
For a start , since the BBC is a broadcasting organisation , they will be absolutely chockablock full of radio frequency engineers who could have helped them do a proper sensible show .
If they really had wanted to measure exposure in classrooms , for example , they could have simply taken some readings up close , a metre away from a laptop ( some while it was downloading hard , some while it was n’t ) , and lots of ambient measurements from around the room , and combined them .
This would have provided a meaningful , naturalistic , real world figure describing what a child is actually exposed to during a day .
I ca n’t see any sense in measuring anything other than that .
Instead , while throwing around accusations of other people being biased , to produce a scare , Panorama – quite unnecessarily – took an “ electrosmog ” pressure group campaigner , let him decide what to measure , how , where , and with what equipment .
They completely failed to come clean on this .
The reality is , the producers probably did n’t even know what they were having measured .
They say it was because there was nobody else to ask : the BBC is the biggest broadcaster in the UK , probably one of the biggest employers of engineers who know about that kind of thing .
And that ’s just looking at those parts of the program .
There is the issue of Panorama ’s other experts , like associate professor Olle Johansson , awarded Misleader Of The Year 2004 in his native country .
But there are far bigger issues , and ones where Panorama were unambiguously scurrilous .
They spent a long time covering “ electrosensitivity ” .
There are over 30 double blind studies of people who believe that their symptoms , such as dizziness and heaches , are caused by immediate exposure to electromagnetic signals : essentially these studies all show that sufferers cannot tell when a source of signal is present or absent ( full story and references here ) .
But there was no mention of these studies in Panorama .
Instead they showed us just one subject in an unfinished , unpublished study : Why ?
Apparently she has guessed if the signal is on or not , correctly , 2/3 of the time .
Is that statistically significant ?
What about the other subjects in the study ?
It ’s meaningless : it ’s an anecdote dressed up as science with some pictures of some measuring equipment .
It will be very interesting if the results of this study overall are positive , and it will be very interesting to try and understand why theirs were positive , given that over thirty other studies were negative .
If the Essex results are negative , will Panorama broadcast that too ?
I ’d guess “ no ” , and here ’s just one reason why .
Then they talk about how the Swedish government officially “ recognises ” electrosensitivity .
They praise Sweden for paying for special paint ( like that sold by Alasdair at Powerwatch at £ 50.99 a litre ) .
But in fact Sweden simply pays disability benefits for some people who believe they have the condition , in a spirit of compassionate pragmatism ( and quite right too ) .
They seem to be making a spectacular fuss about some largely administrative differences in the generous Swedish disability benefits system .
Let ’s remember that 13 % of Sweden ’s working age population claim disability benefits , and the Wall Street Journal reported prominently just two weeks ago that they are cutting back , and specifically on payments for electrosensitivity .
I could go on .
Of course you should be vigilant about health risks .
I do n’t question that there may be some issues worth sober investigation around Wi -Fi safety .
But this documentary was the lowest , most misleading scaremongering I have seen in a very long time .
It gets trashed on BBC24 here :

To name just a few .
Paul Kenyon Podcast
I ’ve had a fairly long chat on the phone with the presenter , “ stilted ” while the tape was on , cheery when it was n’t .
He conceded essentially what he conceded on News24 , along with some new stuff on electrosensitivity , and generally passed the buck in a polite fashion .
Unfortunately it ’s recorded off the phone and onto what I can only describe as “ audio cassette ” – not posh podcast recorder – because you stingy bastards do n’t ever spend anything here or here , and god bless you for it , ideas were meant to be free .
I ’ll try and transfer it over if I can buy this weird audio cable and grab an hour or two , I think it should be just about audible .
You ’ve , er , heard the quality of the previous recordings of course .

Anyway [ holds pistol aloft ] : “ Discuss ” .
Except it ’s a balmy bank holiday weekend , so maybe discuss in the park instead .
I ’m going to an Indian wedding .
Cheers !
Update BBC24 Newswatch :
The BBC ’s Newswatch show has got onto this – since so many of you got in touch over the week – and called the presenter in for a drubbing .
Panorama do n’t come out of it looking too good .
Although the presenter Paul Kenyon still manages to add to the nonsense .
The American Institute of Mathematics ( AIM ) , one of the leading math institutes in the U.S. , announced today that after four years of intensive collaboration , 18 leading mathematicians and computer scientists from the U.S. and Europe have successfully mapped E 8 , one of the largest and most complicated structures in mathematics .
Partners on this project included MIT , Cornell University , University of Michigan , University of Utah and University of Maryland .
The E8 root system consists of 240 vectors in an eight - dimensional space .
See what is E8 ?
Those vectors are the vertices ( corners ) of an eight - dimensional object called the Gosset polytope 421 .
In the 1960s , Peter McMullen drew ( by hand ) a 2 - dimensional representation of the Gosset polytope 421 .
The image shown below was computer - generated by John Stembridge , based on McMullen 's drawing .
Credit : AIM
The findings will be unveiled today , Monday , March 19 at 2 p.m. Eastern , at a presentation by David Vogan , Professor of Mathematics at MIT and member of the team that mapped E8 .
The presentation is open to the public and is taking place at MIT , Building 1 , Room 190 .
E 8 , ( pronounced " E eight " ) is an example of a Lie ( pronounced " Lee " ) group .
Lie groups were invented by the 19th century Norwegian mathematician Sophus Lie to study symmetry .
Underlying any symmetrical object , such as a sphere , is a Lie group .
Balls , cylinders or cones are familiar examples of symmetric three - dimensional objects .
Mathematicians study symmetries in higher dimensions .
In fact , E 8 is the symmetries of a geometric object like a sphere , cylinder or cone , but this object is 57 - dimensional .
E 8 is itself is 248 - dimensional .
For details on E 8 visit http://aimath.org/E8/.
" E8 was discovered over a century ago , in 1887 , and until now , no one thought the structure could ever be understood , " said Jeffrey Adams , Project Leader and Mathematics Professor at the University of Maryland .
" This groundbreaking achievement is significant both as an advance in basic knowledge , as well as a major advance in the use of large scale computing to solve complicated mathematical problems . "
The mapping of E 8 may well have unforeseen implications in mathematics and physics which wo n’t be evident for years to come .
" This is an exciting breakthrough , " said Peter Sarnak , Eugene Higgins Professor of Mathematics at Princeton University and Chair of AIM 's Scientific Board .
" Understanding and classifying the representations of E 8 and Lie groups has been critical to understanding phenomena in many different areas of mathematics and science including algebra , geometry , number theory , physics and chemistry .
This project will be invaluable for future mathematicians and scientists . "
Bigger than the Human Genome
The magnitude and nature of the E 8 calculation invite comparison with the Human Genome Project .
The human genome , which contains all the genetic information of a cell , is less than a gigabyte in size .
The result of the E 8 calculation , which contains all the information about E 8 and its representations , is 60 gigabytes in size .
This is enough to store 45 days of continuous music in MP3 - format .
If written out on paper , the answer would cover an area the size of Manhattan .
The computation required sophisticated new mathematical techniques and computing power not available even a few years ago .
While many scientific projects involve processing large amounts of data , the E 8 calculation is very different , as the size of the input is comparatively small , but the answer itself is enormous , and very dense .
" This is an impressive achievement , " said Hermann Nicolai , Director of the Albert Einstein Institute in Potsdam , Germany .
" While mathematicians have known for a long time about the beauty and the uniqueness of E 8 , we physicists have come to appreciate its exceptional role only more recently .
Understanding the inner workings of E 8 is not only a great advance for pure mathematics , but may also help physicists in their quest for a unified theory . "
According to Brian Conrey , Executive Director of the American Institute of Mathematics , " The E 8 calculation is notable for both its magnitude as well as the way it was achieved .
The mapping of E8 breaks the ‘ mold ’ of mathematicians typically known for their solitary style .
People will look back on this project as a significant landmark and because of this breakthrough , mathematics will now be viewed as a team sport . "
The E 8 Calculation
The team that produced the E 8 calculation began work four years ago .
They meet together at the American Institute of Mathematics every summer , and in smaller groups throughout the year .
Their work requires a mix of theoretical mathematics and intricate computer programming .
According to team member David Vogan from MIT , " The literature on this subject is very dense and very difficult to understand .
Even after we understood the underlying mathematics it still took more than two years to implement it on a computer . "
And then there came the problem of finding a computer large enough to do the calculation .
For another year , the team worked to make the calculation more efficient , so that it might fit on existing supercomputers , but it remained just beyond the capacity of the hardware available to them .
The team was contemplating the prospect of waiting for a larger computer when Noam Elkies of Harvard pointed out an ingenious way to perform several small versions of the calculation , each producing an incomplete version of the answer .
These incomplete answers could be assembled to give the final solution .
The cost was having to run the calculation four times , plus the time to combine the answers .
In the end the calculation took about 77 hours on the supercomputer Sage .
Beautiful Symmetry
At the most basic level , the E 8 calculation is an investigation of symmetry .
Mathematicians invented the Lie groups to capture the essence of symmetry : underlying any symmetrical object , such as a sphere , is a Lie group .
Lie groups come in families .
The classical groups A1 , A2 , A3 , ... B1 , B2 , B3 , ... C1 , C2 , C3 , ... and D1 , D2 , D3 , ... rise like gentle rolling hills towards the horizon .
Jutting out of this mathematical landscape are the jagged peaks of the exceptional groups G2 , F4 , E6 , E7 and , towering above them all , E 8 .
E 8 is an extraordinarily complicated group : it is the symmetries of a particular 57 - dimensional object , and E 8 itself is 248 - dimensional !
To describe the new result requires one more level of abstraction .
The ways that E 8 manifests itself as a symmetry group are called representations .
The goal is to describe all the possible representations of E 8 .
These representations are extremely complicated , but mathematicians describe them in terms of basic building blocks .
The new result is a complete list of these building blocks for the representations of E 8 , and a precise description of the relations between them , all encoded in a matrix with 205,263,363,600 entries .
Atlas project members , Palo Alto , 2004
The Atlas of Lie Groups Project
The E 8 calculation is part of an ambitious project sponsored by AIM and the National Science Foundation , known as the Atlas of Lie Groups and Representations .
The goal of the Atlas project is to determine the unitary representations of all the Lie groups ( E8 is the largest of the exceptional Lie groups ) .
This is one of the most important unsolved problems of mathematics .
The E 8 calculation is a major step , and suggest that the Atlas team is well on the way to solving this problem .
The Atlas team consists of 18 researchers from around the globe .
The core group consists of Jeffrey Adams ( University of Maryland ) , Dan Barbasch ( Cornell ) , John Stembridge ( University of Michigan ) , Peter Trapa ( University of Utah ) , Marc van Leeuwen ( Poitiers ) , David Vogan ( MIT ) , and ( until his death in 2006 ) Fokko du Cloux ( Lyon ) .

The BBC has been branded ' insensitive ' and ' mad ' after staging a giant explosion in a crowded city centre , just hours after the latest terror attacks .
Shocked shoppers feared terrorists had struck again when the blast rocked streets during filming for Dr Who spin - off series Torchwood .
Police only issued an alert on the day of the explosion , meaning many shoppers were completely unaware of the plans and thought they had been the latest city to be targeted by Islamic extremists after London and Glasgow .
Scroll down for more ...
Members of the public vented their fury at the ill - judged decision to carry on with the explosion next to the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff just yards from the busy shopping streets , restaurants and bars in the Welsh capital on Sunday evening .
They became alarmed when the blast happened in an old courtroom building which sent a huge pall of smoke over the city centre .
Father - of - three Pete Humphries , 47 , said : " The BBC must be mad doing this now .
It was loud and frightening .
It is incredibly insensitive .
My blood ran cold when I heard that bang . "
Mum - of - two Amanda Thomas , 34 , said : " I jumped out of my skin .
It was a huge bang - and I thought of terrorism straight away .
Scroll down for more ...
" You 'd think the police might have stopped the BBC doing it after what 's happened over the last few days with terrorism .
They 've targeted London and Glasgow so any major city might be next . "
Her mum Brenda Protheroe , 59 , said : " What an earth were the BBC thinking of doing this now - could n't it have waited a couple of weeks . "
The BBC issued their own warning on local radio and online on the same day of the blast .
But it was too late for many of the frightened shoppers .
It was due to have two blasts two hours apart but cut it to one after the security alert .
Scroll down for more ...
Police sent uniformed officers to calm people passing and the BBC has their own private security teams on stand - by .
Inspector Andy Walbeoff , of South Wales Police , said : " We decided to issue the warning to the public because of the heightened state of alert following the other incidents .
" It was short notice because of the change of events but we realised some people would be frightened
We did n't want people running away thinking they were real bombs going off .
" We watched the explosion from our control rooms on our cameras and it seemed to make a mighty bang . "
Huge cannons sent papers into the street , a pall of smoke went out and stunt people were seen rolling around in agony .
The filming was for new Torchwood series starring John Barrowman due to be screened later this year .
A BBC production team insider said : " The filming was planned many weeks ago before the recent terrorist incidents .
" We had informed neighbouring businesses but could not tell everyone who might be in the city centre .
We apologise if anyone was frightened . "
A BBC spokesman said that controlled explosion had taken place with the cooperation of both the police and local authorities and had followed all the health and safety procedures .
He added that safety marshals were present and that the area had been cordoned off .
Fireworks have always been a source of mystery and nostalgia for many people .
Perhaps its because we are generally introduced to these noisy and colourful displays when we are young and at a most impressionable age , after all being allowed to stay up late and go outside in the dark with the adults is pretty exciting stuff for a 4 year old .
For me fireworks started with a few sparklers and the dads lofting up some bottle rockets .
I then progressed to the larger , but still modest , shows held by the PTA at my local primary school .
In Japan fireworks , or “ Hanabi ” , are in a different league and are taken very seriously .
Every summer usually around late July hundreds of major displays each with tens of thousands of explosions draw huge crowds .
Fireworks in Japan have evolved technically over the generations into far more complex aesthetic endeavours than what I ever saw when I was child .
Part of the reason that fireworks in Japan are so advanced maybe because they are seen as much a form of entertainment for adults as for children .
In the past they were the exclusive domain of the upper class , rich daimyo’s would gaze at them as they floated on river boats , eating and drinking delicacies and being entertained by geishya .
These days some of the most spectacular shows are the Hanabi Taikai , or competitive events where teams of pyrotechnics from around the country come together at live televised events to be judged on their technical and artistic merits .
One of bigger “ crackers ” ( bombs ? ) the Japanese make One of bigger “ crackers ” ( bombs ? ) the Japanese make
At this level , fireworks no longer resemble the cylindrical rocket shaped crackers with a stick poking out the bottom , they are spheres made of papier - mâché and string pasted together .
Inside the shell ‘ stars ’ are packed in with black powder to help ignite them .
A firecracker - like bursting charge is inserted in the middle of the shell , and a fuse attached to it from outside the shell .
If you ’ve ever seen one of these shells up close or handled one the first thing that will impress you is the weight , they are almost completely filled solidly with powder and with diameters ranging from about 7 cm to well over a meter they can weigh up to and beyond 400Kg a piece !
The shells are launched through huge mortar - like tubes , up to 30Kg of black powder is needed to shoot the larger shells up to their explosion elevation of about 600m .
To make the display last as long as possible , firework - makers have learned to use the largest grains of black powder in their stars as possible , and not to mix the powder ’s ingredients too thoroughly .
That way , the fuel inside the stars gets starved of oxygen slightly , making the combustion leaner , brighter and last longer .
While the Chinese remain the world ’s largest producers of commercial fireworks , the Japanese have some of the most sought - after designs .
Manufactures have an arsenal of various techniques they draw on to wow the crowds , such as pressing their stars , onion - like , with separate layers containing different colouring agents — so the display can change colour as the stars burn .
And while the spherical design is also used elsewhere , the Japanese trick that foreign firework - makers have yet to master has more to do with the manufacture of the shell itself rather than the ingredients that go into it .
Thanks to their paper making traditions , the Japanese know better than most how to paste layers of paper on the shell ’s surface and how to dry the shell so its strength balances the explosive power of the firework ’s bursting charge precisely .
I ’ve come a long way since my sparkler days , but thanks to the amazing skill of the Japanese at this art form fireworks still have that magical quality they always had .

JACKSON , Miss . ( AP ) —
A federal judge has ruled that a majority - black county in eastern Mississippi violated whites ’ voting rights in what prosecutors said is the first lawsuit to use the Voting Rights
Act on behalf of whites .
U.S. District Judge Tom S. Lee ruled late Friday that Noxubee County Democratic Party leader Ike Brown and the county Democratic Executive Committee “ manipulated the political process in ways specifically intended and designed to impair and impede participation of white voters and to dilute their votes . ”
The Justice Department accused Mr. Brown of trying to limit whites ’ participation in local elections in violation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act , written to protect racial minorities when Southern states strictly enforced segregation .
“ Every American has the right to vote free from racial discrimination , ” said Wan J. Kim , assistant attorney general for the Department of Justice ’s Civil Rights Division .
“ The court ’s ruling is another victory in the department ’s vigorous efforts to protect the voting rights of all Americans , ” Mr. Kim said .
Noxubee County is a rural area along the Alabama line with a population of about 12,500 , of whom 70 percent are black .
Mr. Brown did not return calls yesterday from the Associated Press seeking comment .
The Justice Department charged in the 2006 lawsuit that Noxubee County blacks tried to shut whites out of the voting process .
Mr. Brown claimed that the Justice Department was misconstruing his attempts to keep Republicans from voting in Democratic primaries as racial intimidation .
Judge Lee , who presided over the case without a jury , gave attorneys on both sides until July 29 to file briefs suggesting how to end the discrimination .
The case was a civil matter carrying no criminal penalties , but defendants who violate Judge Lee ’s final order could face contempt of court charges and fines , prosecutors said .
The judge said there was a pattern to Mr. Brown ’s efforts to keep all whites out of the county ’s Democratic Party , including holding party caucuses in private homes rather than public voting precincts and inviting only blacks to the meetings .
“ If the same facts were presented to the court on behalf of the rights of black voters , this court would find that [ the Voting Rights Act ] was violated , ” Judge Lee said in his ruling .
He said he could not find that the defendants had a specific animosity against white people .
“ Brown , in fact , claims a number of whites as friends , ” Judge Lee wrote .
“ However , there is no doubt from the evidence presented at trial that Brown , in particular , is firmly of the view that blacks , being the majority race in Noxubee County , should hold all elected offices , to the exclusion of whites ; and this view is apparently shared by his allies and associates on the [ Noxubee Democratic Executive Commitee ] , who , along with Brown , effectively control the election process in Noxubee County . ”

IN RECENT years Brussels has been a fine place to observe the irresistible rise of English as Europe 's lingua franca .
For native speakers of English who are lazy about learning languages ( yes , they exist ) , Brussels has become an embarrassingly easy place to work or visit .
English is increasingly audible and visible in this scruffily charming Belgian city , and frankly rampant in the concrete - and - glass European quarter .
Now , however , signs of a backlash are building .
This is not based on sentiment , but on chewy points of economic efficiency and political fairness .
And in a neat coincidence , Brussels is again a good place to watch the backlash develop .
Start in the European district , where to the sound of much grinding of French and German teeth , the expansion of the European Union has left English not just edging ahead of the two other working languages , but in a position of utter dominance .
The union now boasts 27 members and 23 official languages , but the result has been the opposite of a new tower of Babel .
Only grand meetings boast interpreters .
At lower levels , it turns out , when you put officials from Berlin , Bratislava , Bucharest and Budapest in the same room , English is by far the easiest option .
Is this good for Europe ?
It feels efficient , but being a native English - speaker also seems to many to confer an unfair advantage .
It is far easier to argue a point in your mother tongue .
It is also hard work for even the best non-native speakers to understand other non-native versions of English , whereas it is no great strain for the British or Irish to decipher the various accents .
François Grin , a Swiss economist , argues that Britain enjoys hidden transfers from its neighbours worth billions of euros a year , thanks to the English language .
He offers several reasons , starting with spending in Britain on language teaching in schools , which is proportionately lower than in France or Switzerland , say .
To add insult to injury , Britain profits from teaching English to foreigners .
“ Elevating one language to a position of dominance is tantamount to giving a huge handout to the country or countries that use it as a native language , ” he insists .
What about the Europe outside the bubble of EU politics ?
Surely the rise of English as a universal second language is good for business ?
Perhaps , but even here a backlash is starting , led by linguists with close ties to European institutions and governments .
They argue that the rush to learn English can sometimes hurt business by making it harder to find any staff who are willing to master less glamorous European languages .
English is all very well for globe - spanning deals , suggests Hugo Baetens Beardsmore , a Belgian academic and adviser on language policy to the European Commission .
But across much of the continent , firms do the bulk of their business with their neighbours .
Dutch firms need delivery drivers who can speak German to customers , and vice versa .
Belgium itself is a country divided between people who speak Dutch ( Flemish ) and French .
A local plumber needs both to find the cheapest suppliers , or to land jobs in nearby France and the Netherlands .
“ English , in effect , blocks the learning of other languages , ” claims Mr Baetens Beardsmore .
Just as the global rise of English makes life easy for idle Britons or Americans , it breeds complacency among those with English as their second language .
“ People say , ‘ well , I speak English and I have no need to learn another language . ' ”
He cites research by the European Commission suggesting that this risk can be avoided if school pupils are taught English as a third tongue after something else .
A huge government - financed survey of Brussels businesses reveals a dire shortage of candidates who can speak the right local languages ( 40 % of firms have reported losing contracts because of a lack of languages ) .
One result is a very odd labour market .
By day , Brussels is more or less bilingual , hosting a third of a million Dutch - and French - speaking commuters from the prim suburbs , who fill the lion 's share of well - paid graduate jobs .
Once night falls , Dutch - speakers are in a small minority .
Not getting on their bikes
Moreover , among permanent Brussels residents , unemployment hovers around 20 % .
Just a short journey away , in Dutch - speaking suburbs such as Zaventem ( home to the airport ) , unemployment is 4 - 5 % and employers complain of worsening labour shortages .
Even within Brussels , thousands of job vacancies go unfilled every month because nine in ten jobseekers cannot read and write in French and Dutch , prompting employers to bin their applications .
Olivier Willocx of the Brussels Chamber of Commerce and Industry argues that too many Brussels natives are “ allergic to learning Dutch ” .
The rise of Dutch is painful for some .
French was once the language of the Belgian and Brussels elite , but the post - war period has seen Dutch - speaking Flanders ( as the north of Belgium is known ) boom .
“ Like it or not , the real economic power in Brussels is Flemish , ” contends Mr Willocx .
Hardline nationalist politicians in Flanders must take some blame because they have done a lot to make French - speakers feel unwelcome .
The head of the Brussels employment service , Eddy Courthéoux , also questions the sheer number of job advertisements that demand both Dutch and French , saying that for some “ it is just a way of avoiding hiring a foreigner ” : code for Moroccan , Turkish or African immigrants .
Perhaps Brussels should accept its fate as an international city , and switch to English , like some European Singapore ( although with waffles , frites and dirty streets ) ?
For all his problems finding jobs for monolingual locals , Mr Courthéoux looks appalled .
“ Living in a bilingual city is not a misfortune , it makes life rich and interesting , ” he argues .
Some would call this pure sentiment , others might suggest that it reflects hard - nosed economics .
But Brussels is actually a good place in which to hear the point and simply nod your head .

こんなエントリーを読んで、私はちょっと事情は違うけれど、本当にそのとおりだなー、と思った。
談合社会の崩壊の中で 「 お母さん」たちが担っているもの - アンカテ
今日も今日とて、息子の学校での「対策会議」に行ってきた。ウチの子の学校は、アメリカの中では「レベルが低い」と言われるカリフォルニア州の、お金持ちでもない小さい学区のフツーの公立校。それでも、いつも対策会議のたびに、そのノウハウや仕組みにいちいち感心してしまう。
ウチの息子は読み書きの学習障害があるが（詳細は「視覚発達障害」カテゴリー参照）、ビジョン・セラピーやここまでの種々の対策のおかげで、読むほうはだいぶよくなってきた。今回は、これまでの進歩の様子を確認して、この先どういった対策が必要かを判断するためのテストをした結果の報告と、その後の方針を話し合うミーティングだった。
スピーチ・セラピーの先生は、一種の 「 IQテスト」のようなフォーマットの各種テストを使い、「見たものを理解・推論する力」「ビジュアル・メモリー」「オーディトリー・メモリー（耳から聞いたものを記憶して、頭の中で並べ替えたり計算したりする力）」など４つの項目についてテストをした。ラーニング・センターの先生は、算数や英語の短作文などのアカデミックなテストをした。どちらの先生も、学校でなく学区に所属している。結果は、いずれも、テストのスコアと、それが他の生徒との比較で何%のところに位置するかのパーセンタイルが出る。その結果、彼はこれこれの分野は強いが、この分野が弱い、ということがはっきり数字でわかる。
これに従って、これまで続けているスピーチ・セラピーでは、オーディトリー・メモリーに重点を移し、ラーニング・センターでは、「書く」能力の訓練（Occupational Therapyという）のために、まずアセスメント・テストを行い、これに従って、スモール・モーター（細かい動作をするための指や腕の運動能力）の訓練、スペリング、文章の構成の基礎訓練、などのトレーニングを一年間行う、ということになった。こうした追加の訓練は、いずれも学区のオーソライズした「対策会議」で決まったことなので、無料だし、学校での通常の授業を少しだけ抜けて行うので、居残りなどもしなくてよい。
スピーチ・セラピーの先生によると、「もし、この弱い分野がなければ彼の成績は最上位ぐらいになるはずで、本当は彼はとても頭がよいのだ。でも、書くことができないために成績は平均程度になっている。それで本人もフラストレーションがあるだろうし、実にもったいない」ということなのだそうだ。
このあと、ミドルスクール（中学）に行くと、レポートを書くことも多くなり、ますます書くことの苦手が効いてきてしまうので、その前に一年間みっちり書く訓練をする。「彼はとてもマジメでやる気と責任感があり、覚えは早いので、きっと大丈夫だろう」と言っていただいた。どうしてもできない部分は、それを補うための「戦略」も教えてくれる。
本当に、涙が出そうになってしまう。３年前に対策会議の対象に指名されたときは、どうしようかと思った。フラストレーションがひどくて授業中に問題行動を起こしたり、家でもずいぶんキレて荒れていた。それが、ここまで来られた。こうして細かく分析してもらうと、問題を絞り込んでピンポイントで対策もできるし、専門家が指導してくれて、経験豊富だから「この程度の時間でこの程度までいけそう」という目標も立てられるし、これまでの進捗からすると、きっと達成できるだろうという希望も持てる。本人にも、分析結果とこれから何をやるかを説明して、本人も納得した。こうしてちゃんと対策をとるようになってから、「ボクはバカなんじゃない。これさえ克服すればいいんだ。」と自信も持てるようになり、人が変わったように明るくなり、意義がわかっているから、セラピーにも積極的に取り組んでいる。
一方、もし私たちが日本にいたら、と思うとぞっとする。日本の学校も、私の子供の頃からはずいぶん変わっていると思うが、それでも夏の体験学習や補習校の感じを見ていると、とてもここまで、体系的にテストして分析することも、それに基づいて専門家が指導してくれることも、きっとないだろうと思う。
先 生 「お宅のお子さんは、本当はとっても頭がよさそうなんですが、書くのが苦手で困ります。もっときれいに字を書けるよう、ご家庭で指導してくださいね、お母さん。」
私 「え、どうやって？何を？いつ？・・・」
で終わりだろうと思う。とにかく、基準から外れていることは、お母さん任せ。こんなことに直面するのは、個々のお母さんはそれぞれに初めてなのだから、具体的にどうやっていいかなんてわかりゃーしない。ただひたすら、字を書かせることぐらいしかできない。子供は苦手なことを強制されて、ますますイヤがって、お母さんにも学校にも反発。フラストレーションがたまって学校でも家でも暴れる。しまいにはグレて学校にも行かなくなる・・・
なんてこともあるかも。
アメリカだって、貧乏地区の学校はこうは行かないだろうし、まあーいろいろあるのだが、ウチの学区が平均程度のレベルだとすると、少なくとも半分ぐらいの学校では、このレベルの専門家がいるんだろうなー、と思う。
で、例えばトム・クルーズとか、証券会社を興したチャールズ・シュワブ、サンフランシスコ市長のガビン・ニューサムなど、学習障害を克服して活躍している人がたくさんいるとか、BitTorrentのソフトを書いたブラム・コーエンは自閉症だとか、ビル・ゲイツやスティーブ・ジョブスなんかもきっとあんまりフツーの子供じゃなかっただろうな・・とかいったことを考える。こういうフツーじゃない子供がちゃんと社会で活躍できることは、いろんな種が混血した雑種のほうが強いという意味で、アメリカの活力になってると思うのだ。
これが、 「豊かな社会の教育ノウハウ」の一つじゃないかと思うのだ。ちょっとフツーから外れていても、今の世の中ならなんとかサバイブしていけるのだから、足りないところを補うように発達した才能を生かせるような、ちょっとフツーじゃない人間でもいい。で、それも日本だと、「勉強ができなくても、スポーツや美術とか、じゃなければガテン系・・」みたいな話にすぐなってしまうが、そうじゃなくて、学問や技術や、経営者や政治家の世界でこそ、異色の才能が生かせないといけないと思うのだ。そのためには、大学にも行かなきゃならないから、そのための個別サポートもする。
豊かだからこそできる、こういうゼータクな教育をやって、経済の中心部分にもいろんな異色の人間がたくさんいるからこそ、中国やインドと差別化できるんじゃないかな。
そういう意味で、アメリカの教育を極めてミクロ・レベルから見て、「やっぱこいつらにはかなわねー」と、思っちゃうのだ。
たくさんのブックマーク、トラックバック、コメントをいただき、ありがとうございます。息子に関しては、多くの周囲の方から「ひとことアドバイス」をいただいたことが、本格的な解決法を見つける糸口になり、そのことにとても感謝しています。だから、今度は私が、どこかで同じ状況で悩んでいる子供さんや親御さんに、ひとことアドバイスをお返しするつもりで書きました。日本でも、アメリカほどに手厚くはないけれど、きっと専門家がいて相談できるはずだと思いますし、「専門家を増やしてほしい」と学校や文科省などに、親御さんが声を挙げるきっかけの一つ、「wisdom of crowds」の小さなビットの一つになれば、と思って書きました。賛成でも反対でも、どうか、どんどん私の記事を引用・コピペをしてください。
息子のケースは、明らかなディスレクシアではなく、例えば算数は普通にできるなど、ちょっと見ると単にサボって勉強していない、あるいは手をぬいて汚い字で書いている、というふうに見えてしまうような、ボーダーラインのケースです。それで、私も「障害」と認識しないうちは、「あんたがちゃんと覚えようとしないからよ！」と怒鳴りつけたし、先生から「勉強が足りない」と叱られたりしました。
先生が息子に関して言われた言葉が、どこかで、いくらがんばっても漢字が覚えられず、自分を責めて、泣きながら机に頭を打ち付けている子供さんに伝わるといい、一人でも「ボクはバカじゃないんだ」「私みたいな人間こそ、いま社会が必要としているんだ」と思って、元気の出る子供さんがいればいい、と願っています。
これまでのセラピーの詳細については、「視覚発達障害 」
「聴覚発達障害」のカテゴリーにまとめてありますので、ご興味があればご覧ください。また、機会があったら体験談を書いて行きたいと思います。
Researchers have developed a model of a shrinking universe that existed prior to the Big Bang .

The Big Bang describes how the Universe began as a single point 13.7 billion years ago , and has been expanding ever since , but it does n’t explain what happened before that .
Researchers from Penn State University believe that there should be traces of evidence in our current universe that could used to look back before the Big Bang .
According to their research , there was a contracting universe with similar space - time geometry to our expanding universe .
The universe collapsed and then “ bounced ” as the Big Bang .
According to Einstein ’s general theory of relativity , the Big Bang represents The Beginning , the grand event at which not only matter but space - time itself was born .
While classical theories offer no clues about existence before that moment , a research team at Penn State has used quantum gravitational calculations to find threads that lead to an earlier time .
“ General relativity can be used to describe the universe back to a point at which matter becomes so dense that its equations do n’t hold up , ” says Abhay Ashtekar , Holder of the Eberly Family Chair in Physics and Director of the Institute for Gravitational Physics and Geometry at Penn State .
“ Beyond that point , we needed to apply quantum tools that were not available to Einstein . ”
By combining quantum physics with general relativity , Ashtekar and two of his post - doctoral researchers , Tomasz Pawlowski and Parmpreet Singh , were able to develop a model that traces through the Big Bang to a shrinking universe that exhibits physics similar to ours .
In research reported in the current issue of Physical Review Letters , the team shows that , prior to the Big Bang , there was a contracting universe with space - time geometry that otherwise is similar to that of our current expanding universe .
As gravitational forces pulled this previous universe inward , it reached a point at which the quantum properties of space - time cause gravity to become repulsive , rather than attractive .
“ Using quantum modifications of Einstein ’s cosmological equations , we have shown that in place of a classical Big Bang there is in fact a quantum Bounce , ” says Ashtekar .
“ We were so surprised by the finding that there is another classical , pre-Big Bang universe that we repeated the simulations with different parameter values over several months , but we found that the Big Bounce scenario is robust . ”
While the general idea of another universe existing prior to the Big Bang has been proposed before , this is the first mathematical description that systematically establishes its existence and deduces properties of space - time geometry in that universe .
The research team used loop quantum gravity , a leading approach to the problem of the unification of general relativity with quantum physics , which also was pioneered at the Penn State Institute of Gravitational Physics and Geometry .
In this theory , space - time geometry itself has a discrete ‘ atomic ’ structure and the familiar continuum is only an approximation .
The fabric of space is literally woven by one - dimensional quantum threads .
Near the Big - Bang , this fabric is violently torn and the quantum nature of geometry becomes important .
It makes gravity strongly repulsive , giving rise to the Big Bounce .
“ Our initial work assumes a homogenous model of our universe , ” says Ashtekar .
“ However , it has given us confidence in the underlying ideas of loop quantum gravity .
We will continue to refine the model to better portray the universe as we know it and to better understand the features of quantum gravity . ”
The research was sponsored by the National Science Foundation , the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation , and the Penn State Eberly College of Science .

Operations Northwoods Documents
On the Website of the
US National Archives and Records Administration
According to ABC News and government documents on Operation Northwoods , America 's top military leaders drafted plans to kill innocent people and commit acts of terrorism in US cities to trick the public into supporting a war against Cuba in the early 1960s .
Approved in writing by the Pentagon Joint Chiefs , Operation Northwoods even proposed blowing up a US ship and hijacking planes as a false pretext for war .
A summary of key quotes from the Operation Northwoods documents is given below these instructions .
To access the Operation Northwoods documents in the U.S. National Archives , first go to the webpage of the National Archives Catalog at :
http://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/
Then , in the search box of the page that appears , type " Northwoods " and click on the " Search " button to the right of the box .
You will then see the following item :
Plan for U.S. Military Intervention in Cuba Codenamed Northwoods
Click on the title , which is a link .
You will then see the first of 181 pages available , though the first page does not mention Operation Northwoods .
The most revealing 15 pages of Operations Northwoods documents begin on page 129 and continue to 143 .
Thanks for caring enough to investigate Operation Northwoods .
These documents demonstrate clearly that some top leaders in the U.S. military have no moral or ethical difficulty in developing plans which not only sacrifice the lives of innocent American citizens , but clearly trick and manipulate the American people in order to forward the war agenda .

By each of us spreading this information far and wide , we can build a critical mass of people who join in calling for a return to open government and stronger democracy in order that we might build a brighter future together .
Key quotes from Operation Northwoods documents :
The Operation Northwoods documents were approved in writing by the Joint Chiefs of Staff – the top generals of each branch of the US armed forces–and submitted to the Secretary of Defense McNamara , though never acted upon .
The documents only came to light because of a Freedom of Information Act request in the late 1990s .
Page numbers are listed to assist in finding the quotes on the original documents .
Could similar tactics to those listed below have been used in regards to 9/11 ?

13 March 1962
MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE
Subject : Justification for US Military Intervention in Cuba
The Joint Chiefs of Staff have considered the attached Memorandum for the Chief of Operations , Cuba Project , which responds to a request of that office for brief but precise description of pretexts which could provide justification for US military intervention in Cuba .
It is assumed that a single agency will be given the primary responsibility for developing military and para-military aspects of the basic plan .
It is recommended that this responsibility for both overt and covert military operations be assigned the Joint Chiefs of Staff .
Page 133 of file ( page 2 of actual Joint Chiefs report )
The suggested courses of action ... are based on the premise that US military intervention will result from a period of heightened US - Cuban tensions which place the United States in the position of suffering justifiable grievances .
World opinion , and the United Nations forum should be favorably affected by developing the international image of the Cuban government as rash and irresponsible , and as an alarming and unpredictable threat to the peace of the Western Hemisphere .
Page 136 of file ( page 5 of actual Joint Chiefs report )
This plan ... should be developed to focus all efforts on a specific ultimate objective which would provide adequate justification for US military intervention .
Such a plan would enable a logical build - up of incidents to be combined with other seemingly unrelated events to camouflage the ultimate objective .
Page 138-139 of file ( page 7 - 8 of actual Joint Chiefs report )
A series of well coordinated incidents will be planned to take place in and around Guantanamo to give genuine appearance of being done by hostile Cuban forces .
A. Incidents to establish a credible attack :
(1) Start rumors ( many ) .
Use clandestine radio .
(2) Land friendly Cubans in uniform " over - the - fence " to stage attack on base .
(3) Capture Cuban ( friendly ) saboteurs inside the base .
(4) Start riots near the base main gate ( friendly Cubans ) .
(5) Blow up ammunition inside the base : start fires .
(6) Burn aircraft on air base ( sabotage ) .
(7) Lob mortar shells from outside of base into base .
(8) Capture assault teams approaching from the sea or vicinity of Guantanamo City .
(9 ) Capture militia group which storms base .
( 10 ) Sabotage ship in harbor ; large fires – naphthalene .
( 11 ) Sink ship near harbor entrance .
Conduct funerals for mock - victims .
A " Remember the Maine " incident could be arranged :
We could blow up a US ship in Guantanamo Bay and blame Cuba .
Casualty lists in US newspapers would cause a helpful wave of national indignation .
We could develop a Communist Cuban terror campaign in the Miami area , in other Florida cities and even in Washington .
Page 140 of file ( page 9 of actual Joint Chiefs report )
Use of MIG type aircraft by US pilots could provide additional provocation .
Harassment of civil air , attacks on surface shipping and destruction of US military drone aircraft by MIG type planes would be useful as complementary actions .
Reasonable copies of the MIG could be produced from US resources in about three months .
Page 141 of file ( page 10 of actual Joint Chiefs report )
Hijacking attempts against civil air and surface craft should appear to continue as harassing measures condoned by the government of Cuba .
It is possible to create an incident which will demonstrate convincingly that a Cuban aircraft has attacked and shot down a chartered civil airliner enroute from the United States .
The destination would be chosen only to cause the flight plan to cross Cuba .
The passengers could be a group of college students off on a holiday .
An aircraft at Eglin AFB would be painted and numbered as an exact duplicate for a civil registered aircraft belonging to a CIA proprietary organization in the Miami area .
At the designated time the duplicate would be substituted for the actual civil aircraft and would be loaded with selected passengers , all boarded under carefully prepared aliases .
The actual aircraft would be converted to a drone .
The drone aircraft and the actual aircraft will be scheduled to allow a rendezvous south of Florida .
From the rendezvous point the passenger - carrying aircraft will descend to minimum altitude and go directly into an auxiliary field at Eglin AFB where arrangements will have been made to evacuate the passengers and return the aircraft to its original status .
The drone aircraft meanwhile will continue to fly the filed flight plan .
When over Cuba the drone will be transmitting on the international distress frequency a " MAY DAY " message stating he is under attack by Cuban MIG aircraft .
The transmission will be interrupted by destruction of the aircraft which will be triggered by radio signal .
Note from WantToKnow.info :
As you explore some of the other strange facts you find on our website , we invite you to remember how the top US military leaders planned to manipulate public opinion to support their objectives in Operation Northwoods .
Considering the above , is it beyond comprehension that similar tactics might have been used in relation to the 9/11 attacks to create a pretext for war in Afghanistan and Iraq ?
9/11 Information Center
New Danish research shows that large parts of Greenland were covered by forest .
This was discovered by analysing fossil DNA which had been preserved under the kilometre - thick icecap .
The DNA - traces are likely close to 450,000 years old , and that means that Greenland was also covered in a large ice sheet 125,000 years ago during the earth 's last warm period , Eem .
This was while the climate was 5 degrees warmer than the interglacial period we currently live in .

Ancient Greenland was green .
New Danish research has shown that it was covered in conifer forest and , like southern Sweden today , had a relatively mild climate .
Eske Willerslev , a professor at Copenhagen University , has analysed the world ’s oldest DNA , preserved under the kilometre - thick icecap .
The DNA is likely close to half a million years old , and the research is painting a picture which is overturning all previous assumptions about biological life and the climate in Greenland .
The results have just been published in the prestigious scientific journal Science .
Ten percent of the Earth ’s surface has been covered with ice for thousands of years .
No one knows what lies beneath the kilometre - deep icecaps .
These are the earth ’s unknown and unexplored regions .
But some have begun the exploration .
Several projects under Danish leadership have been drilling through the icecap on Greenland , and collected complete columns of ice all the way from the top to the bottom .
The ice has annual layers and is a frozen archive of the world ’s climate .
“ I wonder , if there could also be DNA down there ” , thought Eske Willerslev , who is the world ’s leading expert in extracting DNA from organisms buried in permafrost .
His thinking was that perhaps he could reconstruct the environment of the past .
Ice - core samples of ancient sediment
The icecap itself is comprised of pure ice , but the lower sections are mixed with mud from the bottom , and it was this mud that Eske Willerslev wanted to research .
He got base layer samples from three drillings ; DYE - 3 drilling in the southern part of Greenland , the GRIP drilling in the middle of the Greenlandic ice sheet , and for the third core base layer sample he used the John Evans glacier in Canada .
The Canadian glacier is only a few thousand years old , and samples from it were used to test the method .
From the base layer samples of the ice he found DNA from three of the four most common plants which grow in the area .
“ That means that , what one finds under the ice , represents the local environment ” explains Eske Willerslev .
In the base layer sample from the GRIP drilling , from the middle of the Greenlandic ice sheet , there were no DNA remains at all - not from plants , mammals or insects .
“ The explanation , ” he says , “ is that the ice in the middle of the ice sheet is very thick - over three kilometres , and the greater pressure produces a higher temperature at the base , and so the DNA material , which cannot tolerate warmth , disintegrates ” .
Ancient Flora and Fauna
At the DYE - 3 drilling - site , the ice is ‘ only ’ two kilometres thick , and here the DNA - material was so well preserved that Eske Willerslev could extract genetic traces of a long list of plants and insects and thereby reconstruct ancient plant and animal life .
“ This genetic material presents a biological environment , which is completely different to what we see today . ” he says .
“ We have found grain , pine , yew and alder .
These correspond to the landscapes we find in Eastern Canada and in the Swedish forests today .
The trees provide a backdrop from which we can also ascertain the climate since each species has its own temperature requirements .
The yew trees reveal that the temperature during the winter could not have been lower than minus 17 degrees Celsius , and the presence of other trees shows that summer temperatures were at least 10 degrees ” .
Climate theories over - turned
The research results are the first direct proof that there was forest in southern Greenland .
Furthermore Willerslev found genetic traces of insects such as butterflies , moths , flies and beetles .
But when was that "
According to most scientific theories to date , all of southern Greenland and most of the northern part were ice - free during the last interglacial period 125,000 years ago , when the climate was 5 degrees warmer than the interglacial period we currently live in .
This theory however , was not confirmed by Willerslev and co-workers subsequent datings .
He analysed the insects ’ mitochondria , which are special genomes that change with time and like a clock can be used to date the DNA .
He also analysed their amino acids which also change over time .
Both datings showed that the insects were at least 450,000 years old .
The ice - core researchers are experts at analysing the fine dust which blows onto the ice and is preserved year by year .
They advocate two further datings .
One is dating by optically stimulated luminescence .
It is a method where the examined minerals can be affected to give off a type of light , which depends on how long it has been since the minerals were last exposed to sunlight .
The other method is radioactive dating .
“ We can fix when the ice was last in contact with the atmosphere , ” says Jørgen Peder Steffensen who is a researcher in the Ice and Climate group at the Niles Bohr Institute at Copenhagen University .
He explains that the special isotopes , Beryllium - 10 and Chlorine - 36 both have a particular half - life of radioactive decay ( just like Carbon - 14 ) .
The relation between them can date when the ice and dust were buried and no longer came in contact with the atmosphere .
The dating of dust particles also showed that it has been at least 450,000 years ago since the area of the DYE - 3 drilling , in the southern part of Greenland , was ice - free .
That signifies that there was ice there during the Eemian interglacial period 125,000 years ago .
It means that although we are now confronted with global warming , the whole ice sheet will not melt and bring about the tremendous sea - level rises which have been the subject of so much discussion .
