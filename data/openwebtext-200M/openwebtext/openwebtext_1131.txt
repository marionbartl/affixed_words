The Cleveland Indians traded Cliff Lee and outfielder Ben Francisco to the Philadelphia Phillies for four minor leaguers on Wednesday .
Triple - A right - hander Carlos Carrasco , Class A righty Jason Knapp , catcher Lou Marson -- the likely heir apparent to Victor Martinez -- and shortstop Jason Donald were sent to Cleveland .
" At the root of this deal was balancing the conviction of our ability to compete in 2010 with the opportunity to impact the team 's construction for years to come , " Indians general manager Mark Shapiro said in a statement .
" Without the sense of confidence in the team 's ultimate competitiveness , we acted aggressively to add players that will impact the organization in 2010 and beyond . "
The Phillies were n't required to give up pitcher J.A. Happ or the three prospects they balked at trading for Roy Halladay -- outfielders Dominic Brown and Michael Taylor and pitcher Kyle Drabek .
Asked in Seattle whether he felt the Blue Jays dodged a bullet by the Phillies acquiring Lee instead of Halladay , Toronto manager Cito Gaston noted that some of Philadelphia 's top prospects were still available and said with a chuckle , " Yeah , I guess .
Who knows ?
They may come back and get [ Halladay ] , too .
That 'd be a pretty good staff there , would n't it ? "
Lee , the 2008 AL Cy Young winner who turns 31 next month , is having another solid season for the Indians , posting a 3.14 ERA while walking just 33 in 152 innings .
He will make $ 8 million in 2010 and then be eligible for free agency .
Lee , who was a guest on ESPN950 in Philadelphia on Wednesday morning , was asked if he definitely plans to test free agency .
" That 's where every player wants to be , so honestly , the closer I get to that point , the more likelihood I 'm going to be testing free agency , " he said .
" But I still have a year and two months ' til then , so we 'll see . "
Lee would be the sixth Cy Young winner to be traded in the offseason or during the season following his Cy Young win .
Last season , 2007 AL Cy Young winner CC Sabathia was traded by the Indians to the Milwaukee Brewers .
This should be good news for the Drill Here , Drill Now contingent , right ?
The Obama administration has committed $ 2 billion in loans to exploit offshore oil resources in hopes of extracting a major new source of petroleum .
Despite the White House pursuit of a cap - and - trade scheme to limit the use of fossil fuels , the new field could help bring lower energy prices , and their support of this exploration of American resources shows their flexibility on energy policy .
Wait — did I say American resources ?
That ’s true , but only in the South American sense ( via Gateway Pundit ) :
The U.S. is going to lend billions of dollars to Brazil ’s state - owned oil company , Petrobras , to finance exploration of the huge offshore discovery in Brazil ’s Tupi oil field in the Santos Basin near Rio de Janeiro .
Brazil ’s planning minister confirmed that White House National Security Adviser James Jones met this month with Brazilian officials to talk about the loan .
The U.S. Export - Import Bank tells us it has issued a “ preliminary commitment ” letter to Petrobras in the amount of $ 2 billion and has discussed with Brazil the possibility of increasing that amount .
Ex - Im Bank says it has not decided whether the money will come in the form of a direct loan or loan guarantees .
Either way , this corporate foreign aid may strike some readers as odd , given that the U.S. Treasury seems desperate for cash and Petrobras is one of the largest corporations in the Americas . …
But it still does n’t allow the U.S. to explore in Alaska or along the East and West Coasts , which could be our equivalent of the Tupi oil fields , which are set to make Brazil a leading oil exporter .
Americans are right to wonder why Mr. Obama is underwriting in Brazil what he wo n’t allow at home .
This seems odd in several ways .
For this particular administration to offer billions in loans to a foreign oil company makes a mockery of a number of Obama talking points .
First , why does Petrobas need loan guarantees to pursue its exploration ?
As the WSJ notes , it is a very large corporation , which should have the resources to get to the oil on its own .
Obama , who has ripped American corporations for their supposed subsidies in American tax policy , now wants to use an empty Treasury to give cash to a Brazilian oil company .
Next , Obama keeps insisting that we cut back on our use of fossil fuels .
He and his allies in Congress have blocked exploration of American oil fields off both shores for decades , and Obama insists that we would only keep enabling our oil addiction if we started drilling off of our own coasts .
Yet he has no trouble committing $ 2,000,000,000 of our money for Brazil to drill off its own coast .
Here ’s a proposal : Let American companies do what Obama is paying Brazilian companies to do — drill offshore .
We wo n’t have to pay them money or float them any loans to do it , either .
In fact , we will make money off of the leases , while the effort creates hundreds of thousands of high - paying jobs in the US , creating more tax revenue rather than emptying out the Treasury .
Update : Who else besides Obama has taken an interest in Petrobras ?
Hmmmmmm :
His New York - based hedge - fund firm , Soros Fund Management LLC , sold 22 million U.S. - listed common shares of Petrobras , as the Brazilian oil company is known , according to a filing today with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
Soros bought 5.8 million of the company ’s U.S. - traded preferred shares .
Soros is taking advantage of the spread between the two types of U.S. - listed Petrobras shares , said Luis Maizel , president of LM Capital Group LLC , which manages about $ 4 billion .
The common shares were 21 percent more expensive than preferred today , according to data compiled by Bloomberg .
…
Petrobras preferred shares have also a 10 percent additional dividend , said William Landers , a senior portfolio manager for Latin America at Blackrock Inc .
“ Given that there will most likely never be a change in control in the company , I see no reason to pay a higher price for the common shares . ”
Brazil ’s government controls Petrobras and has a majority stake of voting shares .
This story is from last Friday .
Is it a coincidence that Obama backer George Soros repositioned himself in Petrobras to get dividends just a few days before Obama committed $ 2 billion in loans and guarantees for Petrobras ’ offshore operations ?
Hmmmmmmmmmm .
A Stab At Resolving The Inflation / Deflation Debate
There is a great debate raging between students of monetary economics .
On the one hand , there are the deflationists who point to the massive deleveraging in the housing , mortgage , credit and stock markets .
The fall in prices in these asset markets , at least through March 2009 , was devastating and destroyed trillions of dollars of wealth and credit .
On the other hand , there are the inflationists who focus on Fed policies and the money supply .
Since the onset of the financial crisis , the Fed has taken the federal funds rate down to 0 % and initiated countless programs including the purchase of $ 1.45 trillion in Fannie and Freddie debt and mortgage backed securities , guaranteeing hundreds of billions of dollars in new bank debt , purcashing hundreds of billions of commercial paper , etc …
This has resulted in a massive increase in the money supply which logically will lead to inflation , argue the inflationists .
This has been a very thorny debate , with good arguments and respected voices on both sides .
But little ground has been given and little progress made as participants of both camps seem unimpressed by the arguments of the other side .
This is unfortunate because in my estimation the two sides are talking past each other and both are right .
That is , there are both inflationary and deflationary forces at work in the economy right now and which one is ultimately stronger can only be answered by future history .
All we can do is inventory these forces and do our best to weigh them in making a forecast about the future .
Let ’s start with what the deflationists obviously have right .
The driver of the current economy and the policy response was the bust in the housing market and as a result the busts in the mortgage , credit and stock markets .
These busts substracted tens of trillions of dollars of wealth and credit from the global financial system from August 2005 through March 2009 as prices of the various assets declined precipitously .
This is clearly deflationary .
The housing , mortgage , credit and stock markets were in a deflationary spiral with prices dropping on the order of 50 % .
On the other hand , the policy response from the Federal government is clearly inflationary .
0 % fed funds rate , all the various Fed programs , cash for clunkers , the $ 8,000 first time home buyers credit and the stimulus package are being primarily financed by money creation .
The federal government does n’t have the money for all these programs which is why we are going to run a $ 2 trillion deficit this year .
They fill the gap by borrowing and by money creation .
Much of the borrowing will be repaid in the future by money creation .
The massive scope of these inflationary programs makes inflationists jaw drop when they hear anyone forecasting deflation .
How is that possible with the trillions of dollars the Fed is printing right now ?
Does n’t that money have to filter out into the economy and cause inflation ?
*****
At this point , it is crucial to understand a key point about the process of inflation made by the great scholar of the business cycle , the Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises .
On pages 399-400 of his magnum opus , Human Action , von Mises wrote :
There is first of all the spurious idea of the supposed neutrality of money .
An outgrowth of this doctrine was the notion of the “ level ” of prices that rises or falls proportionately with the increase or decrease in the quantity of money in circulation .
It was not realized that changes in the quantity of money can never affect the prices of all goods and services at the same time and to the same extent . ……
It is not recognized that changes in these magnitudes do not emerge in the Volkswirtschaft as such , but in the individual actors ’ conditions , and that it is the interplay of the reactions of these actors that results in alterations of the price structure .
What Mises is saying here is that the course of any inflation / deflation is always an individual and historical one and that you cannot predict inflation / deflation by looking at the overall price level or money supply .
That ’s because new money enters the economy not uniformly but at specific points and via specific actors .
There was actually massive inflation from 2002 - 2007 but it was focused in one particular area of the economy : the housing sector .
The Fed ’s low interest rates created a boom in the mortgage market and consequently huge inflation in house prices .
This point is key in understanding that both the deflationists and inflationists are right .
As I wrote at the outset , there are both deflationary and inflationary forces at work in the economy right now .
Interestingly , all of the easy money policies of the Fed and stimulus from the Treasury have begun to have some real impact in the last 6 months .
The best explanation of the boom in stock , credit and mortgage markets are the all the government policies which have put a floor under these asset markets .
All these government programs , which are inflationary , have started to re-inflate asset markets resulting in a 60 % rally in the stock market and corresponding moves in mortgage and credit markets , including a stabilization of housing prices .
These inflationary forces are starting to counteract the deflationary forces that have dominated asset markets since 2007 .
The forces of deflation and inflation are now fighting it out in asset markets .
*****
Notice that I wrote “ in asset markets ” .
That ’s because our economy has become quite speculative and asset based and the inflations and deflations we ’ve experienced of late have been focused on asset markets .
Government policies have caused artificial booms in stocks , real estate and other assets and the busts have occurred in these asset prices as well .
But what of “ consumer prices ” , which are of greater concern to most of us ?
What about the things we need to live like gas , food , phone bills , household goods , etc … ?
Is deflation of inflation in the cards for consumer prices ?
For the immediate moment , the forces of deflation seem to be carrying the day .
That ’s because the massive destruction of wealth has resulted in a reverse wealth effect .
Having less wealth and feeling less wealthy , the average American is cutting back on consumer spending .
In addition , the contraction of the economy is causing un - and - under employment , sapping the purchasing power of many Americans .
That decrease in demand lowers prices and that appears to be what we are seeing in consumer prices : mild declines i.e. mild deflation .
But I believe the forces of inflation in consumer prices are gathering themselves for a mighty storm .
The fiscal stimulus programs currently in effect are inflationary .
The $ 8,000 1st time home buyer tax credit will put $ 15 billion in the hands of first time home buyers through Nov. 30 and the program will likely be extended through May of next year putting another $ 15 billion in their hands as well .
The cash for clunkers program put a couple billion in the hands of auto dealers and manufacturers .
The $ 787 billion stimulus package will put real money in the hands of construction , environmental , health and whatever other programs Congress decides to allocate the money to .
The tax breaks will increase the amount of money in the hands of businesses and consumers .
All that money will work its way through the economy and because it is not being offset by a corresponding decrease in goverment expenditures , but rather created via money printing , it will be inflationary .
It is a process and it takes time for this money to enter and work its way through the economy , but it is happening .
*****
Interestingly and importantly , much of the inflationary potential for consumer prices is being mitigated for now by the willingness of foreign central banks to continue to finance our economy .
A great deal of the goods Americans consume are produced overseas .
Americans actually consume far more foreign goods , especially those produced in Asia , than they consume of our goods .
That results in what is called a current account deficit .
The difference in monetary value between what we pay them for their stuff and what they pay us for our stuff is made up by their purchasing a great amount of our financial assets , historically primarily government debt .
Their manufacturers convert dollars earned from selling products to us into local currencies and the central banks ends up holding all these dollars which they recycle into government debt .
It ’s only their willingness to continue holding dollars and buying our debt that keeps the dollar and treasuries strong in markets .
Once they tire of this arrangment , it will be a large pressure on the dollar and US treasuries .
And they are tiring of the arrangement .
They know what all these easy money Fed policies and stimulus packages mean .
It means we will print money to pay them back , destroying the purchasing power of their massive dollar and US debt holdings .
That ’s why they ’re starting to grumble about our policies .
For now , their willingness to pay the price for our profligacy is holding consumer price inflation in check .
Once they tire of this arrangement , and all signs are that this is happening and will play out over a number of years , however , the consumer price inflation inherent in our current government policies will be felt .
That ’s because Asian central banks refusal to continue accumulating dollars and treasuries will mean a drop in the price of both .
A drop in the price of the dollar relative to the yuan , yen and other Asian currencies will increase the prices of all the goods we import from them and depend on .
A drop in the price of treasuries will cause a rise in interest rates .
The rise in interest rates will cripple our over - debted economy but will actually be deflationary .
Debt service costs will squeeze consumers and businesses and leave less money to spend on other things .
The higher cost of debt will constrain borrowing that was formerly used to buy stuff .
But the drop in the dollar and corresponding rise in the price of imports will be inflationary .
It will increase the cost for average Americans of all the everyday things they buy and use that are now made overseas , especially in Asia .
This is all very abstract but it is very real and it will result in consumer price inflation .
For now , much of the inherent inflationary potential of our governments current spending spree is being buffetted by the bizarre economic system that has grown up between the US and Asia in the last 30 years .
As that system unwinds , the ultimate inflationary results of our policies will be felt at the level of consumer prices .
*****
In conclusion , the deflationists and inflationists are both right .
Deflationary and inflationary forces are both at work in our economy .
For now , most of the action has been concentrated in asset markets .
The bizarre economic system that has sprung up between the US and Asia has kept consumer price inflation in check , for now .
As it unwinds , however , the massive inflation inherent in our current government spending spree will be felt at the level of consumer prices .
The realities of real world inflation / deflation are intricate and empirical .
Therefore , the debate is not solvable at the theoretical level at which it usually takes place .
As Mises showed , inflation / deflation is at plays in various sectors of the economy and works its way through the system in idiosyncratic and specific ways .
When we break it down , we can see that both inflationary and deflationary forces are at work and make educated forecasts about the weight and timing to attribute to each of them .

The copyright consultation is days away from its conclusion and missing content from the consultation website has emerged as a problem .
The posting of submissions has been inconsistent throughout the process , but that may be a result of volume .
The delays in posting transcripts from the invitation - only roundtables , however , is inexcusable .
The Toronto roundtable took place on August 27th and the Peterborough roundtable on September 1st .
It should not take more than a week to post a transcript of each event .
While there are audio files available ( which led to my post on the Bell comments in Toronto ) , most people do not have three hours to listen to the events .
Instead , many rely on transcripts and may want to respond to what is said in their final submissions .

Since we released our statement announcing the news this morning , another company , S.C. Johnson ( Pledge , Ziplock , Off ! ) told us that it was a mistake for their ads to be running on Beck 's show , and that they 'd make sure it would n't happen again in the future .
( UPDATE : Our contact at S.C. Johnson wanted us to clarify that they have had no knowledge of their ad running on the Glenn Beck show ( they wanted to verify this for themselves ) , and if it did happen , it was not something they requested . )
This is great progress , and it shows how effective it can be when thousands of people tell advertisers not to support this kind of hateful rhetoric .
Now we need to step up the pressure on Beck 's other advertisers .
While Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble and Progressive Insurance were quick to respond , many others have avoided answering us , or refused to budge .
We 're currently in conversations with advertisers , and the more people they see joining this campaign , the more reason they 'll have to listen .
If you have n't done so already , please sign our petition to Beck 's advertisers , and ask your friends and family to do the same .
Moving forward , we 'll keep you informed about effective ways you can pressure the advertisers to withdraw their support from Beck 's show .
Here 's what Lawyers.com , Procter & Gamble , and Progressive Insurance told us this week :
" Thank you for bringing this matter to our attention , " said John Michaels , Senior Communications Manager at LexisNexis in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" We have suspended further advertising during Mr. Beck 's program . "
" We have no plans to continue advertising on Mr. Beck 's show , " Michaels continued in another email .
When executives at Procter & Gamble were contacted by ColorOfChange.org , they said that any ads run during Glenn Beck were run by mistake , and that they would correct the problem going forward .
" No P&G ads should have appeared on this program in the first place , " said Martha Depenbrock , Brand Building Stakeholder Relations for Procter & Gamble in an email .
" To be clear , if any of our advertising appeared on the Glenn Beck show , it was in error and we appreciate you bringing this matter to our attention .
We will do what we can to see that it does n't happen again . "

Progressive Insurance said any ads running during Glenn Beck were a mistake by Fox News Channel -- a mistake they have asked the network to fix immediately .
" Our ( advertising ) order specifies no Glenn Beck , " said Linda J. Harris , Media Director at Progressive Insurance in an email to ColorOfChange.org .
" We have confirmed with the network that our spots should not be running there , " Harris said in a later email .
The decision by these three advertisers to distance themselves from Beck should help increase the pressure on others .
The writing is on the wall -- Beck should not have the backing of mainstream advertisers .
If we keep the pressure on , we believe we can seriously threaten his platform .

It is not easy to whip out a pistol and split a playing card edgewise at 30 paces .
Joe Bowman did it routinely , and he had a few more tricks up his elaborately embroidered western sleeve .
“ I remember him throwing a washer up in the air , firing a pistol , and saying , ‘ I shot right through it , ’ ” said Dan Pastorini , a former quarterback for the Houston Oilers and a longtime friend of Mr. Bowman .
“ I laughed and said , ‘ Sure , Joe . ’
So he wrapped a piece of tape over the hole in the washer , threw it in the air and fired again .
The tape was gone . ”
Joe Bowman , known as the Straight Shooter and the Master of Triggernometry , died June 29 in Junction , Tex. , where he had stopped for the night after putting on a fast - draw and sharpshooting exhibition for the Single Action Shooting Society ’s annual convention near Albuquerque .
He was 84 and lived in Houston .
The cause was a heart attack , his wife , Betty Reid - Bowman , said .
At gun shows and rodeos all over the country , Mr. Bowman dazzled audiences with his fancy gunplay and sharpshooting with pistol and rifle .
In one of his more elaborate stunts , he put two lighted candles on either side of an ax blade , balanced a . 22 - caliber bullet on the blade and then split the bullet with a rifle shot .
The two pieces of the bullet extinguished the candle flames .
Mandelson goes to war on teenagers downloading their music and movies ... just days after dining with anti-piracy billionaire
Shake on it : Peter Mandelson and David Geffen meet in Curfu last week
Lord Mandelson launched a crackdown on internet piracy just days after meeting a leading Hollywood critic of illegal file sharing .
The business secretary plans to criminalise the estimated seven million people - one in 12 of the population - who illicitly download music and films over the internet .
In what critics describe as a gross attack on civil liberties , those flouting new laws could see their internet accounts suspended and face fines of up to £ 50,000 .
Parents could even be thrown off the net even if it is their children are caught downloading tracks upstairs in their bedrooms , not them .
Lord Mandelson ordered officials to draw up the draconian regulations days after dinner with David Geffen , who founded the Asylum record label which signed Bob Dylan .
The pair dined on 7 August at the Rothschild family villa on Corfu , while Mandelson was holidaying on the Greek island .
Tory backbencher David Davies said : ' It does seem a remarkable coincidence .
Peter Mandelson should be forced to reveal the full extent of his meetings with wealthy friends on holiday and , in the name of openness , disclose exactly what they discussed . '
Poll Should people who download music and films for free be criminalised ?
Yes No Should people who download music and films for free be criminalised ?

The controversial new laws , set to be announced in a ' Digital Britain ' bill to be published next month , would target broadband users who persistently download music and films for nothing .
But former digital engagement minister Tom Watson is leading a campaign against the legislation , which is due to form a key plank of this autumn 's Queen 's Speech .
Writing in the Independent on Sunday , Mr Watson called for people who upload illegal content should be targeted , rather than downloaders .
' Not only do the sanctions ultimately risk criminalising a large proportion of UK citizens , but they also attach an unbearable regulatory burden on an emerging technology that has the power to transform society , with no guarantees at the end that our artists and our culture will get any richer , ' he said .
' Working on the safe assumptions that ( a ) people like downloading music from the internet , and ( b ) most people would prefer not to break the law , we should aim to map a way forward for businesses to take financial advantage of the digital market . '
Last week the Pirate Party , which won a Swedish European Parliament seat in June on a platform of legal file sharing , announced it would be standing in the General Election .
Andrew Robinson , leader of the Pirate Party UK , who will be standing against Worcester Labour MP Michael Foster , said the proposed laws represented an attack on civil liberties .
' This is about proving to the major parties that there are so many votes to be had in adopting policies like ours , ' he said .
A spokesman for Lord Mandelson said file sharing was not discussed at the dinner with Mr Geffen .
' Work has been ongoing on these issues for a matter of weeks , ' he said .
' Lord Mandelson does not believe Digital Britain is even on David Geffen 's radar . '
But a source at his business department said : ' Until the past week , Mandelson had shown little personal interest in the Digital Britain agenda .
Suddenly Peter returned from holiday and effectively issued this edict that the regulation needs to be tougher . '
Yesterday a poll for the Sunday Mirror showed that Lord Mandelson was emerging as a favourite to succeed Gordon Brown as Labour leader .
Party members place him second behind David Miliband as their choice .

Those poor choices apparently included his pillow talk with the 26 - year - old postgraduate student from Newtown whom he met in mid-March at the Art Gallery of NSW .
Kate says he told her all about his ambition to oust Nathan Rees - a '' freckle - faced Latham ' ' - from the leadership .
After an affair lasting almost six months , Kate now doubts whether he has the character for the job : '' If he is capable of lying to his wife and children … why would n't he do that in other aspects of his career ? ''
On August 5 , she called it off , having given up hope that Della Bosca would leave his wife , the federal Labor MP Belinda Neal .
Last night there was no sign of Kate at her home in a converted Victorian terrace .
But last Wednesday she decided to go public and phoned The Daily Telegraph .
She felt betrayed and was angered by the fuss about Della Bosca plotting to take the premiership .
At the same time , however , Channel Nine 's Kevin Wilde was preparing a story for that night 's news - Kristina Keneally , not Della Bosca , would seize the premiership on Monday .
That story proved to be wildly speculative .
Della Bosca had no idea that Monday would bring a much bigger bombshell .
About 5 pm that day , the Telegraph 's editor , Garry Linnell , called the minister and requested a meeting .
'' He said , ' Should I be worried ? ' ''
Linnell told the ABC's 7.30 Report last night .
'' I said , ' I would just like to see you . ' ''
They met in Della Bosca 's office and he listened , stunned , although Linnell said he endured the process with '' an enormous amount of dignity and grace ' ' .
That night , Rees says an adviser called him to warn that the story was about to break .
Half an hour later , Della Bosca phoned Rees and offered his resignation .
The Telegraph 's story did not name Della Bosca 's former lover .
She appeared in a silhouetted photograph .
But she volunteered that she had found Della Bosca '' hot ' ' and '' sexy ' ' ; that they entered Parliament House without security checks or signing the visitors ' register , then had sex on a couch in his office ; that she fell in love with him ; and that ' 'he kept telling me he was going to leave his wife ' ' .
At his news conference , Della Bosca was asked if he believed he had been set up .
He paused for seven chilling seconds , then answered with apparent sincerity : '' There is no possible way in which anything that has occurred could be described as a set - up … I have to take responsibility for those poor personal decisions . ''
But what was Della Bosca thinking ?
Who , amid a backroom campaign to become premier , would enter into an affair with a woman half his age ?
Who would leave a trail of text messages ?
'' Boy oh boy am I in love with you , '' he said in one .
Who , if they were Della Bosca , a year after he had resurrected a career shattered by the Iguanas affair , in which he and his wife had been accused of abusing nightclub staff , would do such a thing ?
'' I did n't think he would be that stupid , '' said the president of the Labor Party 's Brooklyn , Mooney Mooney and Lower Hawkesbury branch , Bob Brownrigg .
Della Bosca refused to respond to '' personal matters ' ' .
But he insisted he breached no ministerial or security protocols .
It is understood MPs are allowed to take family and friends into Parliament House without signing them in .
The Speaker , Richard Torbay , is seeking clarification from the head of security .
Linnell says the woman was '' definitely not a stripper ' ' , as had been reported .
He told ABC radio : '' She made it clear to us from the start that she did not want any money .
She was very angry . ''
Della Bosca was surely angry , too .
He contained it .
'' I 've taken my medicine , I have to live up to my poor decisions . ''
He regretted the ' 'embarrassment to my colleagues , my friends , my community , my church and my family ' ' .
A Catholic and an old boy of De La Salle at Cronulla , he said he did not want to pass judgment on the woman for going public .
Rees had the same approach to Della Bosca .
'' I 'm not going to make moral judgments , '' he said .
What about the unkind things the woman says Della Bosca said about Rees ?
Loading '' It does n't matter , '' the Premier said .
'' It 's immaterial . ''

The Clojure programming language
Take advantage of the Clojure plug - in for Eclipse
This article covers the Clojure programming language .
Clojure is a Lisp dialect .
It is assumed that you do not already know Lisp .
Instead , it is assumed that you have knowledge of Java technology .
To write Clojure programs , you need a Java Development Kit V5 or higher and the Clojure library .
For this article , JDK V1.6.0_13 and Clojure V1 were used .
You should also take advantage of the Clojure plug - in for Eclipse ( clojure - dev ) , and you will need Eclipse for that .
For this article , Eclipse V3.5 was used , along with clojure - dev 0.0.34 .
See Related topics for links .
What is Clojure ?
It was not that long ago when running your programs on the Java Virtual Machine ( JVM ) meant writing your program using the Java programming language .
Those days are long gone because now you have many choices .
Many popular choices , such as Groovy , Ruby ( via JRuby ) , and Python ( via Jython ) , allow for a more procedural , scripting style of programming , or they have their own flavor of object - oriented programming .
These are both paradigms familiar to Java programmers .
One could argue that with these languages , you write programs similar to what you would write in the Java language ; you just get to use a different syntax .
Clojure is yet another programming language for the JVM .
However , it is quite different from Java technology or any of the other JVM languages mentioned .
It is a dialect of Lisp .
The Lisp family of programming languages have been around a long time — since the 1950s , in fact .
Lisp uses the distinct S - expressions or prefix notation .
This notation can be summarized as ( function arguments ... ) .
You always start with the name of a function , and list zero or more arguments to pass in to that function .
The function and its arguments are organized together by surrounding them with parentheses .
This leads to one of the trademarks of Lisp : a lot of parentheses .
As you might guess , Clojure is a functional programming language .
Academics can debate its " purity , " but it definitely embraces the pillars of functional programming : avoid mutable state , recursion , higher - order functions , etc .
Clojure is also a dynamically typed language , though you can optionally add type information to improve performance for critical paths in your code .
Clojure not only runs on the JVM but is designed with Java interoperability in mind .
Finally , Clojure is a language designed with concurrency in mind and has some unique features related to concurrent programming .
Clojure by example
For many , the best way to learn a new language is to start writing code .
In this spirit , we will take some simple programming problems and solve them using Clojure .
We will go through the solutions in detail to gain a better understanding of how Clojure works , how you can use it , and what kind of things it does well .
However , like any other language , we need to set up a development environment for working with it .
Luckily , this is pretty easy with Clojure .
Minimal setup
All you need for working with Clojure is a JDK and the Clojure library , which is a single JAR file .
There are two common ways to develop and run Clojure programs .
The most common is using its read - eval - print - loop ( REPL ) .
Listing 1 . The Clojure REPL
$ java - cp clojure - 1.0.0.jar clojure.lang .Repl Clojure 1.0.0 - user= >
The command was run from the directory where the Clojure JAR was located .
Adjust the path to the JAR as needed .
You can also create a script and execute the script .
To do this , you need to execute a Java class called clojure .
main .
Listing 2 . Clojure main
$ java - cp clojure - 1.0.0.jar clojure.main /some/path/to/Euler1.clj
233168
Again , you need to adjust the path to your Clojure JAR and your scripts .
Finally , there is IDE support for Clojure .
Eclipse users can install the clojure - dev plug - in using its Eclipse update site .
Once it is installed , make sure you are in the Java perspective , then you can create a new Clojure project and new Clojure files , as shown below .
Figure 1 .
Using clojure - dev , the Clojure plug - in for Eclipse
With clojure - dev , you get some basic syntax highlighting , including parentheses matching ( a must - have for any Lisp ) .
You can also launch any script in an REPL that is embedded directly in Eclipse .
The plug - in is still very new , as of the writing of this article , and its features are moving forward rapidly .
Now that we have the basic setup out of the way , let 's explore the language by writing some Clojure programs .
Example 1 : Working with sequences
The name Lisp comes from " list processing , " and it is often said that everything in Lisp is a list .
In Clojure , this is generalized as sequences .
For the first example , we will take the following programming problem .
If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5 , we get 3 , 5 , 6 , and 9 .
The sum of these multiples is 23 .
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1,000 .
This problem is taken from Project Euler , a collection of mathematical problems that can be solved using clever ( or sometimes not - so - clever ) computer programming .
In fact it is Problem No. 1 . Listing 3 shows a solution to it using Clojure .
Listing 3 . Example 1 from Project Euler
( defn divisible - by - 3 - or - 5 ? [ num ] ( or ( == ( mod num 3 ) 0 ) ( == ( mod num 5 ) 0 ) ) ) ( println ( reduce + ( filter divisible - by - 3 - or - 5 ? ( range 1000 ) ) ) )
The first line defines a function .
Remember : Functions are the primary building blocks of programs in Clojure .
Most Java programmers are used to objects being the building blocks of their programs , so using functions can take some getting used to .
You might think that defn is a keyword of the language , but it is actually a macro .
A macro allows you to extend the Clojure compiler to essentially add new keywords to the language .
Thus , defn is not part of the language specification but it is added by the language 's core library .
In this case , it is creating a function called divisible - by - 3 - or - 5 ? .
This follows Clojure naming conventions .
Words are separated by hyphens , and the function 's name ends with a question mark , indicating it is a predicate in that it returns true or false .
The function takes a single parameter named num .
If there were more input parameters , they would appear inside the square brackets , separated by spaces .
Next comes the body of the function .
First , we call the or function .
This is the normal logical or are used to ; it 's just a function , not an operator .
We pass it to parameters .
Each of these are also expressions .
The first expression starts with the == function .
This does a value - based comparison of the parameters passed to it .
There are two parameters passed to it .
The first is another expression ; this expression calls the mod function .
This is the modulo operator from mathematics , or the % operator in the Java language .
It returns the remainder , so in this case , the remainder when num is divided by 3 .
That remainder is compared to 0 ( it is the remainder 0 and , thus , num is divisible by 3 ) .
Similarly , we check to see what is the remainder when num is divided by 5 is 0 .
If either of these remainders is 0 , the function returns true .
On the next line , we are creating an expression and printing it out .
Let 's start from the innermost set of parentheses .
Here , we call the range function and pass in the number 1,000 .
This creates a sequence , starting with 0 , of all numbers less than 1,000 .
This is exactly the set of numbers we want to check to see if they are divisible by 3 or 5 .
Moving out , we call the filter function .
This takes two parameters :
The first is another function that must be a predicate in that it must return true or false ; the second parameter is a sequence — in this case , the sequence ( 0 , 1 , 2 , ... 999 ) .
The filter function applies the predicate , and if it returns true , the element in the sequence is added to the result .
The predicate is just the divisible - by - 3 - or - 5 ? function defined on the line above .
So the filter expression will result in a sequence of integers where each is less than 1,000 and divisible by 3 or 5 .
This is exactly the set of integers we are interested in , so now we just need to add them .
To do this , we use the reduce function .
This function takes two parameters : a function and a sequence .
It applies the function to the first two elements in the sequence .
Then it applies the function to the previous result and the next element in the sequence .
In this case , the function is the + function , or addition .
Thus , it will add all of the elements in the sequence .
Taking a look at Listing 3 , a lot happens in a small amount of code .
That is one of the appeals of Clojure .
A lot happens , but yet once you get used to the notation , the code is self - explanatory .
Certainly , it would take a lot more Java code to do the same thing .
Let 's move on to another example .
Example 2 : Laziness is a virtue
For this example , we will take a look at recursion and at laziness in Clojure .
This is another concept new to many Java programmers .
Clojure lets you define sequences that are " lazy " because their elements are not calculated until they are needed .
This allows you to define infinite sequences , and you definitely do not see those in the Java language .
To see an example of when this is especially useful , let 's take a look at an example that involves another important aspect of functional programming : recursion .
Once again , we use a programming problem from Project Euler , but this time it 's Problem No. 2 .
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms .
By starting with 1 and 2 , the first 10 terms will be : 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 , 55 , 89 , ...
Find the sum of all the even - valued terms in the sequence that do not exceed 4 million .
To solve this problem , a Java programmer might be tempted to define a function that gives you the nth Fibonacci number .
A naive implementation of this is shown below .
Listing 4 . A naive Fibonacci function
( defn fib [ n ] ( if ( = n 0 ) 0 ( if ( = n 1 ) 1 (+ ( fib (- n 1 ) ) ( fib (- n 2 ) ) ) ) ) )
This checks if n is 0 ; if so , it returns 0 .
Then it checks if n is 1 .
If so , it returns 1 .
Otherwise , it calculates the ( n - 1)th Fibonacci number and the ( n - 2 ) th Fibonacci number and adds them together .
This is certainly correct , but if you have done much Java programming , you see the problem .
A recursive definition like this is going to fill up the stack rapidly and lead to a stack overflow .
The Fibonacci numbers form an infinite sequence , so it should be described as such using Clojure 's infinite lazy sequences .
This is shown in Listing 5 .
Note that although Clojure has a more efficient Fibonacci implementation that is part of the standard library ( clojure - contrib ) , it is more complex , so the Fibonacci sequence shown here comes from Stuart Halloway 's book ( see Related topics for more information ) .
Listing 5 . A lazy sequence for the Fibonacci numbers
( defn lazy - seq - fibo ( [ ] ( concat [ 0 1 ] ( lazy - seq - fibo 0 1 ) ) ) ( [ a b ] ( let [ n (+ a b ) ] ( lazy - seq ( cons n ( lazy - seq - fibo b n ) ) ) ) ) )
In Listing 5 , the lazy - seq - fibo function has two definitions .
The first definition has no arguments , hence the empty square brackets .
The second definition takes two arguments [ a b ] .
For the no-arguments case , we take the sequence [ 0 1 ] and concatenate it to an expression .
That expression is a recursive call to lazy - seq - fibo , but this time , it is calling the two argument case , passing in 0 and 1 to it .
The two - argument case starts off with a let expression .
This is variable assignment in Clojure .
The expression [ n (+ a b ) ] is defining a variable n and setting it equal to a+b .
It is then using the lazy - seq macro .
As the name suggests , the lazy - seq macro is used to create a lazy sequence .
Its body is an expression .
In this case , it 's using the cons function .
This is a classic function in Lisp .
It takes in an element and a sequence and returns a new sequence by prepending the element to the sequence .
In this case , the sequence is the result of again calling the lazy - seq - fibo function .
If this sequence was not lazy , the lazy - seq - fibo function would get called again and again .
However , the lazy - seq macro ensures that the function will only be invoked as the elements are accessed .
To see this sequence in action , you can use the REPL , as shown in Listing 6 .
Listing 6 . Generating Fibonacci numbers
1:1 user= > ( defn lazy - seq - fibo ( [ ] ( concat [ 0 1 ] ( lazy - seq - fibo 0 1 ) ) ) ( [ a b ] ( let [ n (+ a b ) ] ( lazy - seq ( cons n ( lazy - seq - fibo b n ) ) ) ) ) ) #'user / lazy - seq- fibo 1:8 user= > ( take 10 ( lazy - seq- fibo ) ) ( 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 )
The take function is used to take a certain number ( in this case , 10 ) of elements from a sequence .
Now that we have a good way to generate Fibonacci numbers , let 's solve the problem .
Listing 7 . Example 2
( defn less - than - four - million ? [ n ] (< n 4000000 ) ) ( println ( reduce + ( filter even ?
( take - while less - than - four - million ? ( lazy - seq - fibo ) ) ) ) )
In Listing 7 , we define a function called less - than - four - million ? .
This simply tests if its input is less than 4 million .
In the next expression , it is useful to start in the innermost expression .
We first get the infinite Fibonacci sequence .
We then use the take - while function .
This is like the take function , but it takes a predicate .
Once the predicate returns false , it stops taking from the sequence .
So in this case , as soon as we get a Fibonacci number greater than 4 million , we stop taking .
We take this result and apply a filter .
The filter uses the built - in even ? function .
This function does just what you would think :
It tests if a number is even .
The result is all of the Fibonacci numbers less than 4 million and even .
Now we total them up using reduce , just as we did in the first example .
Listing 7 solves the problem at hand , but it is not completely satisfying .
To use the take - while function , we had to define a very simple function called less - than - four - million ? .
It turns out that this is not necessary .
It should come as no surprise that Clojure has support for closures .
This can simplify code like that in Listing 8 .
Closures in Clojure
Closures are common in many programming languages , especially in functional languages , such as Clojure .
Not only are functions first - class citizens and can be passed as arguments to other functions but they can be defined inline or anonymously .
Listing 8 shows a simplification of Listing 7 , using a closure .
Listing 8 . Simpler solution
( println ( reduce + ( filter even ?
( take - while ( fn [ n ] ( < n 4000000 ) ) ( lazy - seq - fibo ) ) ) ) )
In Listing 8 , we have used the fn macro .
This creates an anonymous function and returns it .
Predicate functions are often very simple and better off being defined using a closure .
As it turns out , Clojure has an even more - abbreviated way to define closures .
Listing 9 . Shorthand closure
( println ( reduce + ( filter even ?
( take - while #(< % 4000000 ) ( lazy - seq - fibo ) ) ) ) )
We have used # to create the closure instead of the fn macro .
We have also used the % symbol for the first parameter passed to the function .
You could also use % 1 for the first parameter and similarly % 2 , %3 , etc. if the function accepted multiple parameters .
With just these two simple examples , we have seen many features of Clojure .
One other important aspect of Clojure is its tight integration with the Java language .
Let 's look at another example where leveraging Java from Clojure is helpful .
Example 3 : Using Java technology
The Java platform has a lot to offer .
The performance of JVM and the richness of both the core APIs and the numerous third - party libraries written in the Java language are all powerful tools that can save you from reinventing too many wheels .
Clojure is built around these ideas .
It is easy to call Java methods , create Java objects , implement Java interfaces , and extend Java classes .
To see some examples of this , let 's take a look at another Project Euler problem .
Listing 10 .
Problem No. 8 from Project Euler
Find the greatest product of five consecutive digits in the 1000 - digit number .
73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934 96983520312774506326239578318016984801869478851843 85861560789112949495459501737958331952853208805511 12540698747158523863050715693290963295227443043557 66896648950445244523161731856403098711121722383113 62229893423380308135336276614282806444486645238749 30358907296290491560440772390713810515859307960866

In this problem , we have a 1,000 - digit number .
This could be represented numerically in Java technology using a BigInteger .
However , we do not need to do computations on the entire number — only five digits at a time .
Thus it is easier to treat it as a string .
However , to make calculations , we need to treat the digits as integers .
Luckily , there are APIs in the Java language for going back and forth between strings and integers .
To start with , we need to deal with the large piece of unruly text from above .
Listing 11 .
Parsing the text
( def big - num - str ( str " 73167176531330624919225119674426574742355349194934 96983520312774506326239578318016984801869478851843 85861560789112949495459501737958331952853208805511 12540698747158523863050715693290963295227443043557 66896648950445244523161731856403098711121722383113 62229893423380308135336276614282806444486645238749 30358907296290491560440772390713810515859307960866
70172427121883998797908792274921901699720888093776 65727333001053367881220235421809751254540594752243 52584907711670556013604839586446706324415722155397 53697817977846174064955149290862569321978468622482 83972241375657056057490261407972968652414535100474 82166370484403199890008895243450658541227588666881 16427171479924442928230863465674813919123162824586 17866458359124566529476545682848912883142607690042 24219022671055626321111109370544217506941658960408 07198403850962455444362981230987879927244284909188 84580156166097919133875499200524063689912560717606
05886116467109405077541002256983155200055935729725 71636269561882670428252483600823257530420752963450 " ) )
Here , we take advantage of Clojure 's support for multi-line strings .
We use the str function to parse the multi-line string literal .
We then use the def macro to define a constant called big - num - str .
However , what will be most useful to turn this into a sequence of integers .
This is done in Listing 12 .
Listing 12 .
Creating a numerical sequence
( def the - digits ( map #( Integer . ( str % ) ) ( filter #( Character / isDigit % ) ( seq big - num - str ) ) ) )
Again , let 's start in the innermost expression .
We use the seq function to turn big - num - str into a sequence .
However , it turns out that this sequence is not exactly what we want .
You can see this with help of the REPL , shown below .
Listing 13 .
Examining the big - num - str sequence
user= > ( seq big- num - str ) ( \7 \ 3 \ 1 \ 6 \ 7 \ 1 \ 7 \ 6 \ 5 \ 3 \ 1 \ 3 \ 3 \0 \ 6 \ 2 \ 4 \ 9 \ 1 \ 9 \ 2 \ 2 \ 5 \ 1 \ 1 \ 9 \ 6 \ 7 \ 4 \ 4 \ 2 \ 6 \ 5 \ 7 \ 4 \ 7 \ 4 \ 2 \ 3 \ 5 \ 5 \ 3 \ 4 \ 9 \ 1 \ 9 \ 4 \ 9 \ 3 \4
ewline ...
The REPL shows characters ( a Java char ) as \c .
So \ 7 is the char 7 , and
ewline is the char
( a new line ) .
This is what we get for parsing the text directly .
Clearly , we need to get rid of the newlines and covert to integers before we can do any useful calculations .
This is what we do in Listing 11 .
There we use a filter to remove the newlines .
Notice that once again , we used a shorthand closure for the predicate function passed to the filter function .
The closure is using Character / isDigit .
This is the static method is Digit from java.lang .
Character .
Thus , the filter only allows in chars that are numeric digits , discarding the newline characters .
Now we have gotten rid of the newlines , so we need to convert to integers .
Moving inside - out in Listing 12 , notice that we use the map function , which takes two parameters : a function and a sequence .
It returns a new sequence where the nth element of the sequence is the result of applying the function to the nth element of the original sequence .
For the function , we are once again using the shorthand closure notation .
First we use the str function from Clojure to convert the char to a string .
Why do we do this ?
Because next , we create an integer using the constructor for java.lang .
Integer .
This is denoted by Integer .
You could think of this expression as new java.lang .
Integer ( str ( % ) ) .
Using this with the map function , we get a sequence of integers , just as we wanted .
Now we can solve the problem .
Listing 14 .
Example 3
( println ( apply max ( map #( reduce * % ) ( for [ idx ( range ( count the - digits ) ) ] ( take 5 ( drop idx the - digits ) ) ) ) ) )
To understand this piece of code , let 's start with the for macro .
This is not like a for loop in the Java language .
Instead , it is a sequence comprehension .
First , we create a binding using the square brackets .
In this case , we are binding the variable idx to a sequence from 0 ... N - 1 where N is the number of elements in the sequence the - digits , ( N = 1,000 , as the original number had 1,000 digits ) .
Next , the for macro takes an expression it uses to generate a new sequence .
It will iterate over each element of the idx sequence , evaluate the expression , and add the result to the return sequence .
You can see how in some ways this does act kind of like a for loop .
The expression used in the comprehension will first use the drop function to drop the first M elements of the sequence , then use the take function to take the first five elements of the shortened sequence .
Remember that M will be 0 , then 1 , then 2 , etc. , so the result will be a sequence of sequences , where the first element will be ( e1 , e2 , e3 , e4 , e5 ) , the next element will be ( e2 , e3 , e4 , e5 , e6 ) , etc. , where e1 , e2 , etc. are the elements from the - digits .
Now that we have this sequence of sequences , we use the map function .
We transform each sequence of five numbers to the product of those five numbers by using the reduce function .
Now we have a sequence of integers , where the first element is the product of elements 1 - 5 , the second element is the product of elements 2 - 6 , etc .
We want the maximum such product .
To do this , we use the max function .
However , max expects multiple elements passed to it , not a single sequence .
To turn the sequence into multiple elements to pass to max , we use the apply function .
This produces the maximum that we wanted to solve the problem , and of course prints out the answer .
Now you have solved several problems while learning how to use Clojure at the same time .
Summary
In this article , we have introduced the Clojure programming language and have benefited from the use of the Clojure plug - in for Eclipse .
We took a brief look at some of its philosophies and features , but concentrated on code examples .
In those simple examples , we have seen many of the core features of the language : functions , macros , bindings , recursion , lazy sequences , closures , comprehensions , and integration with Java technology .
There are many more aspects to Clojure .
Hopefully , the language has caught your attention , and you will take a look at some of the resources and learn more about it .

Divorce : 5 Things Men Should Know
Page 1 of 2
Divorce is popular — too popular .
It 's like your favorite local band ruined by fame :
Once the masses first got their hands on the no-fault divorce in 1970s America , they abused it .
Now , thanks to them , it 's primed for a major backlash .
This backlash does n't mean the public has developed a distaste for the divorce - related details of others — not on your life .
But there are some universal details that are often overlooked ... until now .
We offer up 5 things you did n't know about divorce .
1- Born-again Christians have the highest divorce rate
The first thing you did n't know about divorce is that some predictors of divorce need to be shouted from the mountain top .
A study by Barna Research Group found that the 33 % divorce rate among born - again Christians — or evangelicals — was the highest among Christian denominations .
Not surprisingly , these results met with a flood of criticism , much of which raised one of the most disputed questions in this field :
What is the biggest predictor of divorce among the broader population — the most common of all the common denominators ?
The answer generally depends on whom you ask , but two predictors frequently mentioned are age at marriage and income .
Notably , couples under age 20 with an income under $ 25,000 have a very high risk of divorcing .
Throw in a pregnancy , and they 're pretty much doomed .
2- The average divorce costs over $ 50,000
The popular legal DIY site legalzoom.com tells potential customers that divorce " does n't have to be complicated or costly " and that their services can wrap up an uncontested divorce " in three simple steps , " all for $ 299 .
What that fee does not cover ( and does n't purport to cover ) are all the hidden costs .
Using a variety of statistics from the 2006 US Census Bureau , divorce360.com came to an average figure for those hidden costs : about $ 53,000 .
While admitting that every divorce is different , the site nonetheless reached that figure by adding up costs such as couples / marriage therapy before the divorce , individual therapy for each spouse and for their children after divorce , moving costs , fees for attorneys and financial advisors , the costs of selling the marital home , of acquiring a new mortgage on a smaller home for one spouse , and apartment rental costs for the other spouse .
Point being , there 's far more to divorce than three simple steps .

To ensure food service establishments follow food safety training best practices , most states passed laws requiring that at least one employee is a Certified Food Protection Manager .
Even if it ’s not required by state law , most employers need to have someone with managerial duties on - premises who understands HACCP guidelines .
So if you ’re responsible for food safety , then you need to get your food manager certification .

WASHINGTON – The FBI has released its Domestic Investigations and Operations Guide ( DIOG ) , an internal policy document that explains how FBI agents would implement the unconstitutionally broad surveillance powers of the 2008 Mukasey Attorney General Guidelines ( AGGs ) .
One particularly bizarre provision allows the FBI to violate the AGGs without approval from , or notice to , the Attorney General .
The DIOG , written on December 16 , 2008 , was released with heavy redactions late Friday as a result of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Muslim Advocates .
The original Attorney General Guidelines were adopted in the mid-1970 ’s to limit the FBI ’s investigative authority after it was discovered that the agency was engaged in widespread abuses and violations of constitutional rights – including politically - motivated spying on figures like Martin Luther King , Jr. Mukasey ’s 2008 AGGs are much broader and allow FBI agents to use paid informants , spy on a person ’s activities or engage in other types of intrusive surveillance without “ factual predication ” – that is , without probable cause or any evidence of wrongdoing .
The American Civil Liberties Union is urging Congress to create a legislative charter that prohibits the FBI from spying on innocent Americans .
The following can be attributed to Michael Macleod - Ball , Acting Director of the ACLU Washington Legislative Office :
“ It sets an extremely confusing and dangerous precedent to create an ambiguous set of guidelines for invasive surveillance of Americans and then grant the FBI the authority to violate those guidelines unilaterally .
We remain concerned that the Mukasey Guidelines were written so broadly that they imposed essentially no restrictions at all on FBI investigations , and now we see the FBI has interpreted them in exactly the same way .
Congress needs to create a statutory framework that limits the FBI ’s authority to conduct investigations without reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing as soon as possible .
The FBI has considerable authority – and a noted history of abusing that authority .
Its investigative powers must have nothing less than clear , bright and easily understood boundaries . ”
We left Vienna around 3 PM , after visiting a little bit of Schonbrunn and eating .
Czech Republic is only 30 kilometers away from Vienna and so we got there pretty fast .
The Czech border welcome us with a fine selection of night clubs and obvious signs about “ new girls every night ” .
Other than that the cities looked cleaner and decent .
The architecture was absolutely fabulous .
We got to Prague around 7 PM , driving slowly and looking around .
In Prague , the quest for a hotel started again .
We already had some ideas ( and , of course , addresses ) of what we want , but the Internet can be sometimes so different than the real world .
Meaning the hotel were either fully booked , either too far , either smaller than we saw on the Internet and so on …
On top of that was driving in the old center of Prague , with a lot of one way streets and names in a completely new language .
At some point , driving around in circles , we spotted a small hotel on a small street .
And a big sign : “ last rooms available ” .
I got inÂ and after a short talk with the lady at the reception we were in .
The hotel , called “ U Zlatohe Jelene ” ( the golden deer , I suppose ) was absolutely incredible .
We took an apartment ( for a price of a normal room in Budapest ) and what we found was gorgeous : old , high rooms ( I suppose the ceiling was somewhere at 4 meters ) and the strangest bathroom I ever saw : I had to go down an old wood stair to reach it , but once there , everything was brand new and made with quality materials ) .
The only inconvenient was parking .
I had to take the car in an underground parking of a mall , 200 meters away from the hotel .
But since we were decided to walk and not use the car too much , that was acceptable .
We went out and eat , starting to explore a little bit the surroundings .
It was already pretty late when we got back in the room , but we had quite a good idea about what we ’re going to do the next day .
Prague – Day One
After we woke up , we had breakfast at the hotel .
The breakfast room was in another building , which was also pretty interesting .
Took our cameras , and started to explore Prague ’s old town :
And that would be one of the oldest gothic gates of the city .
Every street has fantastic buildings :
We soon realized we were like 20 meters from a large square , featuring a big astronomical clock :
We walked about 10 minutes and got to a bridge .
We crossed the main river , Vltava , and headed towards what seemed a funicular or something like this .
After waiting in the queue for about 15 minutes , we were up on a big hill , on the other side of the city .
In front of us , a strange tower , resembling Eiffel Tower , seemed like an interesting place .
It was called Petrin Observation Tower , and besides being pretty crowded it had a little bit of incentive , so to speak : the elevator was out of order :
I climbed up the stairs ( did n’t count , but it took around 3 - 4 minutes to get up to the top ) only to find an incredible view of the city .
First , there was the Prague ’s Castle ( the biggest castle in the world ) :
and then was this view of Vltava and its bridges :
We sat down for about half an hour , having drinks at the bottom of the tower and then decided it ’s time to visit the castle .
Took us around 35 minutes to get down from the hill by walking , including some stops at a small souvenir shop and a at a small fountain .
The castle was absolutely gorgeous and the Cathedral of St. Vitus almost unbelievable :
The cathedral had some parts in restauration , but even so , it was looking fantastic from any angle :
Near the castle exit there was a small buffet and a nice looking red building :
We sat at the buffet and ate .
This buffet stop and the next hour will be covered in a later post , because it was something completely unexpected and really , really fun .
So , stay tuned for this episode in the next days .
For now , let ’s assume we ’re one hour late , walking around Prague historical center , watching old streets :
featuring old houses :
or even old gray castles :
As we approached the old city area , where our hotel was located , we started to spot other interesting and strange things , like this costumed guy in front of a restaurant :
I ’m sure there must be a pretty good reason for him to be dressed like this , but I ’m telling you , I ai n’t gonna eat there :-) .
On another street , a stone guy was relaxing on a bench :
Soon we got near our church :
but this time taking new and complicated routes on the small streets of the old city :
It was slowly starting to get dark :
while the astrologer tour was still dominating the square :
And soon it was really , really dark .
Guided by the lights , we got in our hotel room :
The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation is trying to figure out who is sending laptop computers to state governors across the U.S. , including West Virginia Governor Joe Mahchin and Wyoming Governor Dave Freudenthal .
Some state officials are worried that they may contain malicious software .
According to sources familiar with the investigation , other states have been targeted too , with HP laptops mysteriously ordered for officials in 10 states .
Four of the orders were delivered , while the remaining six were intercepted , according to a source who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation .
The West Virginia laptops were delivered to the governor 's office several weeks ago , prompting state officials to contact police , according to Kyle Schafer , the state 's chief technology officer .
" We were notified by the governor 's office that they had received the laptops and they had not ordered them , " he said .
" We checked our records and we had not ordered them . "
State officials in Vermont told him they 've received similar unsolicited orders , Schafer said .
Representatives from those states could not be reached for comment Thursday .
Schafer does n't know what 's on the laptops , but he handed them over to the authorities .
" Our expectation is that this is not a gesture of good will , " he said .
" People do n't just send you five laptops for no good reason . "
The computers are now being held as evidence by state police , who are working with the FBI to figure out how the machines were sent to the governor 's office , said Michael Baylous , a sergeant with the West Virginia State Police .
The West Virginia laptops were delivered Aug. 5 , according to the Charleston Gazette , which first reported the story .
The laptops sent to the Wyoming governor 's office arrived in two separate shipments on Aug. 3 and Aug. 6 , according to Cara Eastwood , a spokeswoman for Governor Freudenthal .
" We received one package , opened it and realized that it was an error since no one in our office had ordered them , " she said .
" The next day we received another package .
At this point we realized that they needed to be turned over to law enforcement . "
Although there is no evidence that the computers contain malicious code , HP confirmed Thursday that there have been several such orders and that they have been linked to fraud .
" HP is aware that fraudulent state government orders recently have been placed for small amounts of HP equipment , " spokeswoman Pamela Bonney said in an e-mail message .
" HP took prompt corrective action to address the fraudulent orders and is working with law enforcement personnel on a criminal investigation . "
With users now more reluctant to install suspicious software or open attachments on their networks , scammers appear to be looking for new ways to get inside the firewall .
Criminals have tried to put malware on USB devices and then left them outside company offices , hoping someone would plug them into a computer and inadvertently install malicious software on the network .
Many Windows systems are configured to automatically run software included on CDs and USB devices using a Windows feature called AutoRun .
Many organized criminals would be happy to spend the cost of five PCs in order to access government computers , said Steve Santorelli , director of investigations with security consultancy Team Cymru .
" What is a netbook ?
$ 700 ?
You send five of them ; you 're dropping three grand , and say you get into the Congressional e-mail system .
How valuable would that be ? "
Catholic Church criticises Italy ’s £ 112 million lottery fever as ‘ idolatry ’
The Roman Catholic Church has criticised Italy ’s lottery fever as millions across the country flocked to stores to buy tickets , tempted by the world record jackpot of £ 112 million .
|PIC1 | The Catholic Church slammed the huge sum as “ immoral ” and warned the winner that it could lead to tragedy rather than the ‘ dream life ’ they might expect .
The world record amount has accumulated since January , the last time a top prize was claimed in the Super Enalotto lucky numbers draw .
The amount rose massively over the past weeks as the country became gripped with lottery fever .
However , Monsignor Domenico Sigalini , from the Italian Catholic Bishops Conference , said : “ This draw is immoral .
It really has become a form of idol worship as here man really is worshipping money instead of God .
“ It 's a well - known fact that all those who have won a lot of money in the past have ended up being worse off - winning a lot of money is not a stroke of luck but a stroke of tragedy . ”
The Archbishop of Lecce , Cosmo Franceso Ruppi , joined in the criticism , saying : “ There should be an immediate law putting a cap on the size of the jackpot .
This lottery fever must be stopped as soon as possible as it has created a form of idolatry . ”
Other critics have tried to be constructive , suggesting that the top prize should be scrapped and be donated to the reconstruction project in Abruzzo where 300 people were killed and 50,000 left homeless in April ’s devastating earthquake .
The temptation to try their luck in the lottery has not only affected regular Italians , but even thousands of tourists have reportedly entered the lottery this week .
Last week a total of 338 million six - number combinations were played , compared to 304.2 million the week before , a jump of 11.1 per cent .
The fever is good news for lottery organisers SuperEnalotto .
So far this year they have already taken in 1.93 billion Euros , more than all of 2007 , and are on course to easily surpass the 2.5 billion Euro collected last year .
The odds of winning the lottery are 622 million to one .
School kids in America could certainly stand to learn about copyright in the classroom — it's a fascinating topic that increasingly impacts the life of every " digital native " and intersects with law , history , art , and technology .
But should they be exposed to industry - funded materials meant to teach kids :
That taking music without paying for it ( " songlifting " ) is illegal and unfair to others ( RIAA )
Why illegally downloading music hurts more people than they think ( ASCAP )
How the DVD - sniffing dogs , Lucky and Flo , help uncover film piracy ( MPAA )
To use problem - solving approaches to investigate and understand film piracy ( The Film Foundation )
The importance of using legal software as well as the meaning of copyright laws and why it 's essential to protect copyrighted works such as software ( Business Software Alliance )
If this sounds more like " propaganda " than " education , " that 's probably because Big Content funds such educational initiatives to decrease what it variously refers to in these curricula as " songlifting , " " bootlegging , " and " piracy . "
Music 's rules
The industry loves to talk about the need for " education " ( it did so again this morning at an FCC broadband hearing ) , and it 's proud of the work that it produces .
As students start a new school year across the country , the RIAA is talking up its recently updated Music Rules !
curriculum , which really does attempt to lay down the Ten Commandments for online activity .
( Number 10 : " Always show respect for intellectual property " ) .
We took a look at the updated curriculum , which was developed by " curriculum specialists . "
A closer look at the program documents show that Music Rules ! was developed by Young Minds Inspired — a group that also wrote the Copyright Alliance 's classroom program and produced one for the Entertainment Software Association .
The YMI websites shows that the company 's most recent " free " materials were in support of movies , TV shows , and the NFL ( which actually passes out football trading cards to students and includes a helpful guide of football terms for " those with little or no knowledge of the game " ) .
Like most such efforts , Music Rules !
is n't so much " wrong " as it is " woefully incomplete . "
When one of the program 's stated objectives is to teach students that " taking music without paying for it is illegal and unfair to others , " it 's clear that this is not a subtle approach ( one wonders how Radiohead , Trent Reznor , Jonathan Coulton , and pretty much every band everywhere who gives away free songs on its website would react to this statement ) .
There 's something to be said for simplification , but this is ridiculous .
Music Rules !
starts by defining the terms that teachers need to know about copyright in order to cover the material .
The complete list ( we kid you not ) is : counterfeit recordings , DMCA notice , " Grokster " ruling , legal downloading , online piracy , peer - to - peer file sharing , pirate recordings , songlifting , and US copyright law .
That 's it !
The fact that " pirate " appears twice while " fair use " is entirely absent pretty much sums up the approach .
At least the curriculum does n't pull any punches by pretending to offer anything approaching " copyright education " ; it is only about " respecting all forms of intellectual property , especially music recordings . "
But that does n't mean schools should be adopting it , free or not .
Consider the very first suggested activity , one targeted at students in grades 3 - 5 .
It 's about " songlifting , " a term we have never seen before , and it suggests that students calculate how much harm songlifting does to copyright owners .
This is " educational " because , as the program notes , students " will be using their math skills to investigate songlifting . "
Unfortunately , critical thinking skills will be left at the classroom door .
The exercise asks students to " choose a realistic number of songs they would take if they could get them all for free . "
With a teacher 's help , students then calculate how " big a problem " songlifting is — by multiplying the total number of songs by $ 0.99 .
The included worksheet calculation shows that 7,800,000 songs equate to $ 7,722,000 .
Teaching the factual claim that " sharing full copyrighted files without the rightsholder 's permission is generally illegal " is fine , but this sort of calculation is simply ridiculous .
If students in grades 3 - 5 are downloading songs from P2P networks and the music industry truly believes it's " losing " $ 0.99 each time , some " education " is certainly needed , but not necessarily for the students .
The curricula does n't show much thought ( or updating ; it still talks about the Rio , Zen , and Walkman as common portable media players ) .
The first grade 6 - 8 activity is identical to the one described above ... but the calculation is done on a spreadsheet .
Genius !
Students are also asked to pretend that they are entering a recording studio ; one suggested " rap " they are to sing follows :
Music is worth it , if you ’re asking me
True words , new rhythms , sweet melody
Just tell me where to get it and I ’ll gladly pay
For a song that says what my heart wants to say .
But do n’t try to fool me with aphony [ sic ] copy ,
‘ Cause songlifting ’s wrong , and it ’s got to stop , see ?
At the end comes a pledge that students can sign , in which they vow to " respect all forms of intellectual property , " " obey the copyright laws that protect intellectual property , " " always use computer technology responsibly , " " always use Internet technology safely , " " never accept illegal copies of songs online or on disc . "
Corporate - funded education materials have always been controversial , and the Music Rules !
program reminds us why that is .
Teachers are encouraged to advocate for one specific industry and address one specific concern , rather than broadly talking about copyright .
The agenda is obvious ; so too is a general lack of interest in fair use , the public domain , Creative Commons , the history of copyright and its absurd post - 1976 expansion , students as copyright owners , the repeated " moral panics " over the player piano , home taping , and the VCR , etc , etc .
Still , it could probably be worse .

I ’ve been running a Minimalist Gmail setup lately , stripped of nearly everything but , you know , emails … and I ’m in love with its simplicity .
There ’s something pure about having nothing but the essentials .
Now , some of you will recall a couple of other posts I did , and let ’s quickly review them for background :
1 . Not long ago , I did a post on How to Make Gmail Your Ultimate Productivity Center .
This was Gmail fully loaded , with gadgets for Google Calendar , Google Docs , delicious , Twitter , and much more .
This was good , and I still recommend it to most people who want one place for everything they do .
2 . Even less ago , I boldly announced I was Killing Email and ditching my inbox .
A dramatic announcement , I know , from someone who has been such a Gmail fanboy for at least a few years .
So , two things : one , I have n’t completely killed email .
I still use Gmail , though not as often .
I have moved most of my communication to Twitter , Google Docs , a wiki , and Basecamp .
But I still do email , a little .
It ’s a hard thing to kill , but maybe drastically reduced email usage is OK with me .
It ’s certainly less stressful .
Two , when I do use Gmail , lately , I am bothered by all the clutter .
I removed all the gadgets , and still too much .
Google is known for its simplicity , but I really wanted to strip out not only ads but chat and the navigation menus at the top and more .
So I did .
I ’ve used Greasemonkey for Firefox and some great user scripts , listed below , to achieve this .
I thought of rewriting Gmail ’s CSS , but user scripts are much easier .
It did n’t take long — just Googled every little thing I wanted to do , and found others had already solved the problems , one at a time .
Here ’s how I ’ve made Gmail into a minimalist inbox :
1. Fire and Grease .
First , be sure you ’re running Firefox with Greasemonkey installed .
I love the minimalism of Google Chrome — been running both the dev version and latest Chromium builds — but unfortunately it ca n’t do what Greasemonkey can , at the moment .
So I mostly just use Firefox for Gmail now .
2. Remove gadgets .
First thing I removed was gadgets — go to Settings , then Gadgets , and remove any you have installed .
I had Twitter and Delicious .
Then I went to Labs under Settings , and disabled “ Multiple Inboxes ” and the Google Docs and Google Calendar gadgets , as well as the option to move the Chat box to the right side of Gmail .
Things were starting to get cleaned up !
3 . Hide labels , chat , footer .
I really wanted to remove chat but could n’t figure it out .
Also , the clutter in Gmail ’s footer was bothering me .
So I found this brilliant user script : Gmail 3 : Hide Labels , Chat and Footer .
Install it in a click , and voila !
Lovely .
4. Remove ads .
Ads on the right side of email messages also bothered me .
Found a script to do this : Gmail Ad Remover .
Added benefit of maximizing your screen space for messages .
5. Remove stars .
It ’s a minor thing , but the stars are unnecessary for me .
I do n’t use them for task management ( did at one time ) , so what ’s the point ?
Gmail Remove Stars to the rescue .
6. Gmail logo and searchbar .
Found Gmail toggle searchbar area script .
Cleans things up nicely .
You can always toggle the search area back on if you need it , but most of the time when I ’m processing email , responding , I do n’t need this .
7. Menu navigation bar .
This was the most annoying .
I could n’t figure out how to remove the navigation menus that run across the top of Gmail .
Then found the Gmail Real Estate script .
It actually toggles not only the navigation menus , but the search area too .
This somewhat duplicates the logo and searchbar script ’s function above , but I ’ve found they actually work nicely together , allowing you to show just a minimal navigation bar if you like , or whatever you feel like showing at the moment .
I normally have everything minimized .
Updated : 8 . Clean up rows and remove the “ inbox is empty ” message !
Matt Constantine responded to this post by writing two excellent Greasemonkey scripts .
The first , called Gmail Clean Rows , removes the lines and other clutter from your inbox ’s list of emails .
The second is called Gmail Empty is Empty , and removed a small annoyance of mine — the message that shows up when your inbox is empty that says “ No new mail !
Want to read updates from your favorite sites ?
Try Google Reader ” .
Now the empty inbox is really empty , which is lovely lovely .
Updated : 9 . Remove extraneous buttons .
Matt Constantine took it a step further , at my request , and wrote Gmail Inbox with Less Buttons , removing all the buttons above and below the inbox , except archive , report spam and delete .
This is perfect , because I do n’t have a need for the move - to , label or more actions drop - down buttons , or the refresh link , or the Select links below all the buttons .
Your needs may vary .
And that ’s it .
It might sound complicated , but basically it ’s turning off some options in Gmail ’s settings , and then installing a few user scripts .
It should just take a few minutes .
See the before and after pics below .
How I Use Gmail , the Minimalist Way
Now that everything is stripped down — no gadgets , no chat , no labels or stars — I just process and reply to email , and empty my inbox .
Here ’s how :
1 . Use keyboard shortcuts .
See this list if you do n’t already know them .
Pressing a key such as “ c ” or “ r ” or “ a ” to do email messages , or “ j ” or “ k ” or “ x ” or “ y ” to navigate and select and archive , is much faster than using the mouse .
I can process very quickly using shortcuts .
2. Remove all unnecessary incoming email streams .
Very important .
Unsubscribe from all newsletters , all ads sent to you from businesses , all notifications from other services you use .
Filter out messages from people who just forward jokes or chain mail .
I no longer publish my email address , and give people other options for getting the info they want , so only my closest friends or business partners email me .
Leaves the inbox relatively uncluttered .
3. Process quickly .
Just run through your inbox , processing like lightning .
Each email requires instant action : archive or trash , reply then archive , put on your task list ( see next item ) and archive .
Or just do the task now , and archive .
Those are the only options .
Should take 10 minutes tops .
4 . Tasks .
I use a separate task list these days ( Anxiety , a very simple Mac app ) to make a quick note of any tasks , so that I can archive an email without needing it in the inbox as a reminder .
Gmail
Tasks is another good option — I do n’t use it these days because I keep my email closed most of the time , and want my small task list open when I need it without having to open Gmail .
5 . Short messages .
Keep things short , and it does n’t take long to reply .
I try to do it in 3 - 5 sentences .
I rarely go over this .
Before and After Pics
Took some screenshots to illustrate the changes .
Click the thumbnails to see full images .
Update : I ’ve changed the “ after ” screenshot to illustrate the new scripts noted above by Matt Constantine .
Edit : The Firefox theme you see in the screenshots is Chromifox Basic , modeled after Google Chrome .
I did n’t mention this above , but I removed most of the toolbars and icons from Firefox awhile back , to make Firefox as minimalist as I can .
You can do this in the View -> Toolbars menu , unselecting toolbars and removing icons as you please .

An elementary school in Sarasota , Florida is sending several hundred working Macs to the trash heap — in keeping with the school district ’s “ PC - only ” policy .
Piled up in the cafeteria of the Emma Booker school , 140 G3 and G4 laptops and over 50 iMac and eMac machines await the scrap heap .
An account in the local paper takes on dramatic overtones :
Sarasota County Public School system employees who alerted the Pelican Press to the salvage effort asked not to be identified because they feared retribution .
“ All of the machines are still working , ” said one .
“ The teachers asked if they could buy them or give them to the kids .
We were told , ‘ No . ’ ”
Putting the Macs out to pasture is the result of a decision by Superintendent Gary Norris , who headed the school system from 2004 - 2008 , who declared the school system would be PC - only , the paper said .
Even the county school district ’s program that donates computers to needy kids , called Texcellence , is a Mac - free zone .
“ We ’ve never used Macs , ” foundation spokeswoman Laura Breeze told Pelican Press .
The group recently received 1,100 used PC computers and is refurbishing them and adding software before giving them out .
At a time when budgets are tight , you have to wonder why a school district would send working computers to the scrap heap .
This thread is for ALL developers : ( in no particular order ) - Cyanogen-JesusFreke_LucidREM-Haykuro - TheDudeOfLife-Justanothercrowd-Shafty023 ( anyothers that want to take a shot at it ) First and foremost THANK YOU for all your hard work and dedication to giving us some of the best toys around !
We all know that the biggest issue with running Hero on the G1 is the lack of speed .
The second biggest issue ( for me ) is the lack of Bluetooh .
So in hopes of motivating developers ( and we all know money makes the world go round ) .
I will donate / pay the first developer / xda member that gets Bluetooth working $ 100 COD of FULLY WORKING ROM !!!!
Im sure im not the only one that would benifit from this .
Now to make this interesting and more competitive , I will break it down like this : $ 200 - 96hrs ( 4 days ) ( $ 50 each - ccyrowski and thedominator ) $ 100 - 120hrs ( 5 days ) $ 50 - 148hrs ( 6 days ) $ 25 - 182hrs ( 7days ) So if someone gets it working with the next 96hrs I will donate / pay $ 100 , if it takes 182hrs I will ONLY donate / pay $ 25 .
Now if others want to donate to the Hero Bluetooth fix , let me know .
( [ email protected ]
Im sure $ 200 can buy Haykuro a few weeks worth of Nesquik , Cyanogen a keq of beer and pork rinds .
As for the rest , I dont know what you can spend $ 200 on , smokes , crack , hookers what ever floats your boat .

The Iranian government has announced that the nation will be participating in a missile defense test which could take place as early as tomorrow .
According to the IRNA , Iran 's official news agency , the test is an annual exercise aimed to " maintain and develop " defense capabilities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard .
The exercise is named ' Great Prophet 4 ' and will involve shooting a variety of live missiles at targets .
Reports say the drill will be conducted in several unknown locations and will last for several days .
The exercise also falls on the Jewish holiday of Yom Kippur .
The announcement comes just hours after the Iranian government stated that the nation was building a second nuclear power facility .
The announcement was made in a September 21 letter from the Iranian government to the United Nations Security Council that a second nuclear plant was being constructed in the city of Qom .

" I had to get us out of this , " the elderly man said from the other side of the glass at San Diego central jail .
" I 've never done a bad thing in my life .
But when you get desperate , I guess you throw all that sh-- out the window . "
Listening to how Michael Casey Wilson of Santee tells it , a 17 percent mortgage , the threat of homelessness and a terminal health condition will turn a man to crime .
Wilson , 69 , is accused of walking into the Bank of America branch in the 4100 block of El Cajon Boulevard in City Heights and handing a bank manager a demand note , saying he had a bomb .
Prosecutors said he made off with $ 107,000 before he was caught lying on a front porch near the bank .
" I wrote them an apology .
I am so sorry , " he said referring to the employees who rushed out of the bank .
" It 's not my purpose in life to scare people . "
" If it would 've worked the way I wanted it to , it would 've just been he and I .
But he told everybody .
He should n't have done that , " Wilson said .
On Thursday he pleaded not guilty to three counts of robbery and one count of falsely reporting a bomb to a business .
In an interview Friday , Wilson was very open about the plan he had hatched to save his home .
" I was hoping to get $ 50,000 to pay off my mortgage , " he said .
" Just to get the money and get the hell out of there . "
Wilson said he had planned to hail a taxi and drive with the bank manager to the airport .
Once the manager was gone , Wilson said he had hoped to pick up another taxi to take him to his home in Santee .
But he said he never thought the bank manager " had the balls to call the police . "
" I saw all of a sudden all the people rushing out and I knew I was had , " he said .
" I knew that he had called me in .
C'est la vie . "
Wilson said he lives with his 73 - year old wife , who he described as a " gentle soul . "
He said he feared for her future living on the streets if he could n't make their house payment .
Looking at Wilson , you can see his health is suffering .
He claims doctors have diagnosed him with severe arthritis , sleep apnea , heart problems , and a disease he described as one " that makes you fly off the handle . "
Wilson said he was told he had one to two years to live .
When he hatched the bank robbery plan , he said that he had considered the consequences but thought , " It was 50 - 50 .
Well if I get caught , I get caught .
I 'm dying anyway so what different does it make . "
Wilson could face more than seven years in prison if he is convicted .
His bail was set at $ 50,000 .
" Let 's face it , " he said .
" Here 's a man who ( screwed ) up his life and his family 's life but I did it with good intentions .
Just stupid intentions . "
Click here to watch part of the jailhouse interview .
Checking up on my posts from 2007 I noticed how I would evangelize some technologies as being the next wave of the web , and those should already be mainstream in 2009 .
Here are my thoughts on the matter , very subjective to my opinion and experiences .
Microformats
In 2009 I see large media websites and social networks to be adopting microformats , but corporate websites and such have n’t really though about it .
Webdesigners and Webdevelopers that deserve such titles are already implementing microformats in their pages because it ’s really simple to do so .
I believe traditional corporate developers do n’t really care about this technologies .
They are not a requirement for their projects and therefore not worth the time .
A good way of correcting the problem would be to have Java and .NET promote these technologies .
The problem with microformats is not the server implementation .
Wordpress alone transforms a lot of websites and blogs into a semantic repository .
Long - tail websites like Upcoming and LastFM also provide microformats for their content .
The major issue I find is the lack of uses , and browser integration for those .
It ’s 2009 and none of the major browsers support the majority of microformats by default .
It almost got into FF3 and it ’s somehow in IE8 , but not at the point people actually use it .
Another opportunity would be using hCard information for the default data when you register an account in a new website .
At least uFs are out there just waiting to be used .
The reverse would be much worse !
We just have to give tools for people and machines to use them .
OpenID
OpenID suffers from the same browser - support problems as microformats , but in this one I agree it ’s not browser - ready .
There are few mainstream websites that support OpenID , and those that do have faulty implementations ( usually the 1 account – 1 openid problem , or the problems in maintaining an UI for both traditional and openid logins ) .
Websites that support this technology are aimed at geeks or alpha-users go into the trouble of implementing OpenID .
Others do n’t , and until a perfect UI is reached I would n’t do it for a general user target .
OpenID is acceptable in a technical view , but when it comes to implement it may not be that simple ( Google itself said they were taking their time to do it ) and when it comes to UX the gap may be too big for the mom and dad kind of user .
What I happen to see a lot is twitter / facebook / etc … login option .
Since the majority of uber - geeks have accounts in those websites , it ’s easier to ask them to login in those websites than rather ask for an URL .
You are what ?
OpenSearch
OpenSearch has n’t evolve at all .
FF , IE and Opera all support it ( safari does n’t want to loose its simplicity , probably ) and popular search engines also offer the description file ( as well as this website ) .
Users just do n’t use it at all , since it ’s easier to use google with one or two extra keywords .
Maybe when Google ’s monopoly in online searches is at risk this might change .
OAuth
Of all three , this is the one that is working the best .
It ’s aimed at tech people , so with a few libraries , it ’s a nice way of dealing with authentication of web APIs .
I actually think it limits the developer to include a way of accepting the token in a web view , but most developers do n’t seem to complain .
Asking for user and password is not secure , and people are starting to know that .
Developers know that as well , and therefore want to offer a secure alternative .
OAuth is the answer , and it ’s looking pretty good .
Even in Twitter mashups !
Discouraged on the public option being voted down today by the scum - sucking , insurance industry - loving weasels on the Senate Finance Committee ?
Do n't be , says Tom Harkin :
HARKIN : I believe that when we merge these two bills , we will have a public option in there that we will take to the floor of the Senate and we 're going to pass it .
SCHULTZ : Well , okay , so despite what happened in the Senate Finance Committee today , you think you 've got the votes to get a public option coming out of the Senate ?
Cause I 'm not so worried about the House anymore and I think the American people , I mean , this is gonna be reported , all the talking heads are gonna say , " Hey , public option is dead . "
I need to have some confidence tonight with you , Senator Harkin , that you think you can get these votes out of the Senate .
HARKIN : Well here 's one thing I will guarantee you , Ed , and I will tell you again as I 've told you before -- we will have a bill on the President 's desk before Christmas and it will have a public option .
SCHULTZ : Well that 's what the American people want to hear .
Now ...
HARKIN : I know it and most of the doctors want it , 73 % of the doctors polled want a public option , uh , sixty - some percent of the American people want a public option and the vast majority of Democrats , over fifty in the United States Senate , also want a public option .
SCHULTZ : Okay now , are you going to have to go reconciliation ?
You 're not going to get sixty at this point are you ?
HARKIN : Well , I would n't give up on that yet .
I still think that we can get sixty votes to bring the bill on the floor of the Senate .
And then we 'll have amendments and then we 'll have , probably have to have a cloture on the bill to bring it to a close .
Now that will be the tough vote .
I still believe that we can get the sixty votes for that .
SCHULTZ : Okay , what about ...
HARKIN : But if we do n't , Ed , if we do n't , we 're going to go to reconciliation .
As I said to you , and as I say to the American people , we will have this bill on the President 's desk by Christmas , one way or the other .

Authorities responded to four reports of bears in homes or yards west of Boulder on Tuesday night , including one in which a bear walked into a house in Sunshine Canyon .
The Daily Camera reported the bear entered the home through an open door , according to Bruce Rice , the homeowner at 373 Seven Hills Drive , about 1 1/2 miles up the canyon .
Rice was watching a Colorado Rockies game and did n’t know the bear was in his home until his neighbor saw the animal and called police .
The neighbor , Peter Schindler , also yelled to warn Rice .
The bear was snacking on fruit in the kitchen .
The men made loud noises , and the bear fled and ran up a nearby tree .
In other bear news :
• A bear ripped apart Pepsi and Dr Pepper boxes at the Dusty Boot in Beaver Creek on Monday night , drinking about 25 pounds of Pepsi syrup , according to Glenwood Springs Independent newspaper .
• On Tuesday , a bear briefly entered the historic Hotel Colorado in Glenwood Springs .
Wildlife officers gave chase , and the bear eventually went up a tree east of the Glenwood Adventure Park gondola and was tranquilized .
Last week 's denial - of - service attack that knocked Twitter offline was aimed at one man — a blogger in the former Soviet republic of Georgia called Cyxymu .
Nonetheless , it caused the entire Twitter universe to blink out of existence for hours .
This struck some detractors of the service as hilarious ( how do " these people " complain about Twitter being down if Twitter is down ? ) .
But the truth of the matter is that Twitter is an increasingly important lubricant for greasing the wheels of the web .
Twitter has a measurable effect on how fast information travels online , and when it 's down , the information - time continuum slows .
For instance , YouTube told us that their popular videos are getting popular faster now than they used to - a phenomenon to which Twitter almost certainly contributes .
Twitter — or , rather , the idea of a pervasive , public short messaging network — could be too important to be left under one entity 's control .
The people behind the OpenMicroBlogging ( OMB ) movement say it 's time for the 140 - character , publicly - subscribable format pioneered by Twitter to become an open standard , in part because , as last week 's attack showed , Twitter is as vulnerable as it is vital .
" The total failure of Twitter during the DDoS attacks highlights the fact that , with Twitter , we ’re relying on a single service for mass communication of this type , " said open microblogging supporter and Ektron CTO Bill Cava .
" Most everyone understands it ’s ridiculous to expect one service to provide email support to the world .
The same is true for micro messaging .
The reality is , it can't and wo n't continue this way for too much longer . "
The OpenMicroBlogging standard already exists — it 's just that Twitter 's not playing along , possibly because it could lose market share if the open standard succeeds before it manages to monetize its service .
One platform that adheres to the Open MicroBlogging ( OMB ) standard is Laconi.ca , an open - source Twitter - style network launched by Status . net on July 2 of last year ( others include OpenMicroBlogger and Google 's Jaiku ) .
Laconi.ca , which seems to have gained more traction than the other two OMB platforms , forms the backbone of Identi.ca – an open - source Twitter clone with features Twitter lacks ( image uploading , trackbacks , native video playback , OpenID ) that lets you post updates to its own network as well as Twitter and Facebook .
Status.net will soon add the ability to follow Twitter and Facebook feeds using the corresponding APIs , so users will soon be able to make Identi.ca their default short messaging communications hub — even if those services wo n't use the open standard .
" I think that if Twitter decided to open and be part of an open protocol , that would be a very helpful thing for us , " said Status. net CEO Evan Prodromou .
" And I think it would be really good for the web , too . "
Identi.ca provides the " open Twitter " experience for the regular user .
But if you want to take your micro-blogging independence to the next level , port your Identi.ca account into free , open - source Laconi.ca software running on your own server .
Essentially , this means you can operate your own Twitter - like network , for free – either a general competitor to Twitter or a microblogging service focused on a specific niche .
Examples include the German Bleeper , the Vietnamese Saigonica , and other Twitter - for - other - languages sites , as well as FLOSS ( open - source community ) , TWiT Army ( like a whole Twitter network for Leo LaPorte followers ) , a general interest micro-blogging network called F*** Twitter .
For a real sense of the possibilities , imagine a million little Twitters — each of which can post to each other , as well as Twitter , Facebook , and everywhere else .
Prodromou , who built Laconi.ca and Identi.ca , estimates that thousands of companies already use Laconi.ca to set up private , company - wide Twitter - like networks , and that hundreds of public sites like the ones mentioned above use it too .
His own Laconi.ca implementation , Indenti.ca , has nearly 80,000 users so far and is growing at a thousand users per day .
He plans to make money from this open - source software by offering it as a hosted service , so companies do n't have to run it from their own servers , and selling administrative services , so that companies do n't have to set it up or run it on their own – a model we 've seen quite a bit of lately ( Kaltura , GeoServer , Red Hat Linux , etc. ) .
So far , we - the - people - of - the - internet seem happy to have corralled ourselves into services like Twitter and Facebook , after having been faced with the web 's vast , open potential for setting up our own online identities .
It 's way easier to put yourself online than it was in the old Tripod self - publishing days , but the downside of entering these walled gardens is that when one of them crumbles , it crumbles completely .
Software developer Brian Hendrickson , who runs OpenMicroBlogger.org , a competitor to Laconi.ca , says Twitter represents a new , necessary protocol we did n't even know we needed , but that it 's too tied to a single company .
" [ User ] @danyork said ' the popularity of microblogging shows us that we were missing a medium , ' and a year ago , a lot of us fans of web standards and technology could sense that Twitter would do what it did this spring : explode in popularity .
As someone who has always self - hosted his own e-mail server , DNS server , web server , etc. , it was obviously untenable to have every single microblogger in the world using the same web site .
It 's unnatural . "
Other open , Twitter - like concepts are in the works : OpenMicroBlogger , Google 's pubsubhubbub , Dave Winer 's RSSCloud and Anil Dash 's " Pushbutton Web . "
If this trend towards open microblogging trend continues , in whatever form – and despite Twitter having seemingly every reason not to cooperate – it will no longer be possible to shut down micro- blogging with one or two concentrated attacks .
In a distributed micro-blogging world , last week 's attack would have taken down Cyxymu 's account — but not yours or mine , in other words .
" [ Open MicroBlogging ] can't be killed , " said software engineer Matt Katz , who uses Identi.ca through a FireFox add - on called Identifox , via e-mail .
" It is totally decentralized .
Imagine trying to take down all e-mail .
All you can do is remove nodes . "
Certainly , some readers of this article will conclude that it takes micro-blogging too seriously .
Why should it be considered worthwhile to shore up with open standards and distributed nodes a platform rife with messages like " OMG !
I ate the bestest bagel EVAR ! " ?
The answer is that Twitter continues to prove its usefulness for relaying key information quickly , as it did during last month 's Iranian protests , the Hudson River 's second - to - last aviation disaster , and any number of other major , minor and inconsequential events .
Something that powerful could — and , perhaps , should — be decentralized , as Prodromou and others suggest , because fun and jokes aside , losing access to our public short messaging networks is no laughing matter .

The Republican Party unveiled this " Seniors ' Bill of Rights " ad Tuesday .
It is being played heavily in northern Florida .
The group The Republican National Committee The title Seniors ' Bill of Rights Script " When you disagree with Washington , how come they act like it 's your problem ?
That 's what the Democrats have done with health care .
They say you 're the problem .
How about a different way ?
A focus on things we can all agree on ?
I 'm Michael Steele , chairman of the Republican Party .
Join us in supporting a new Seniors ' Bill of Rights .
Let 's agree in both parties that Congress should only consider health reform proposals that protect senior citizens .
For starters , no cuts to Medicare to pay for another program .
Zero .
Make it illegal to ration health care based on age .
Prevent any government role in end - of - life care .
And stop bureaucrats from getting between seniors and their doctors .
A few things we can all agree on .
The Seniors ' Bill of Rights .
Oh and President Obama , it 's not too late to change your mind .
Stand with us and stand with senior citizens .
After all they 've earned it . "
The images Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele walks into the camera 's view across a blue screen .
Big block letters spelling out " Health Care Debate " in the background initially , later replaced by a sepia - toned image with the headline " Seniors ' Bill of Rights . "
During the ad , headlines appear under Steele as he talks , echoing key points .
" Make it illegal to ration health care based on age , " reads one .
Another says : " Stop bureaucrats from getting between seniors and their doctors . "
Reality check
The ad has prompted a strong pushback from Democrats .
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz , D - Fla. , called it " lies " in a telephone conference Tuesday .
The non-partisan FactCheck.org says the Republicans ' latest attack on the Obama health care plan is largely based on previously debunked claims , such as the charges about rationing care and a government role in end - of - life decisions .
But FactCheck says the GOP has a point when it comes to the possibility of some seniors being pushed out of Medicare Advantage , a program that allows seniors to buy Medicare coverage through private insurers .
Obama has criticized the program as " wasteful . "
Where it 's playing
The ad began running on national cable channels Tuesday , and is getting wider play in Florida , according to RNC spokeswoman Gail Gitcho .
She said the RNC is targeting the northern Florida district of Rep. Allen Boyd , D - Fla .
He 's a member of the conservative Blue Dog Coalition and has expressed concern about the cost of the Obama health plan .

I cannot count the number of times I 've encountered Christians wearing t- shirts that could be described as offensive .
I remember the Campus Crusade for Christ shirts my fellow students used to wear during my college days and their bloody Jesus imagery .
I remember the " Nuke Iraq " shirts adorned with Christian bible verses when the U.S. attacked Iraq in the 1990s .
More recently , there are the shirts opposing reproductive rights that depict aborted fetuses , anti-gay bigotry , atheist bashing , anti-democracy , and the like .
And yet , no matter how much some of these shirts might irritate me , I am happy to defend the right of those wearing them to do so .
They are exercising their right to free expression , and I do not have to like the message in order to appreciate their right to express it .
Check out the t- shirts that were the subject of a recent post at Friendly Atheist .
I am not going to get into the subject of children wearing such shirts at school here because I want to focus on a more general issue .
Imagine an adult wearing one of these shirts in public .
I may not agree with their message ( i.e. , " Islam is of the devil " ) , but that is irrelevant .
I still support such an exercise of free expression .
Since many atheists have a rather low opinion of Islam , you may say that this particular shirt is an easy one to support .
Fine .
Imagine that the shirt instead said " Atheism is of the devil , " " Atheists are evil , " or even " Kill all atheists . "
I would still support the right of a Christian to wear such a shirt even though I certainly would n't like the message .
Here 's the catch - the right to free expression goes both ways .
I defend the right of the Christian to wear such a shirt , and I expect the Christian to defend my right to wear a " fuck the skull of Jesus " t- shirt ( I do n't actually have such a shirt ) .
The thing is , I would be surprised if more than a handful of Christians would actually defend my right to wear such a shirt .
At least in the U.S. , a Christian wearing a blatantly anti-atheist shirt is going to emerge unscathed .
On the other hand , I cannot imagine an atheist wearing a blatantly anti-Christian shirt surviving long here in Mississippi or many other places in the Bible Belt .
Even pro-atheist shirts are going to be perceived as vile assaults on Christianity !
This tells me that the playing field is far from level and that Christian privilege is pervasive .
Their cars will not be vandalized on account of their Jesus fish , but I cannot display a Darwin fish .
Disparaging comments about atheism are commonplace , while criticism of Christianity incurs wrath .
Christian billboards are all over the place , but atheist billboards are rarely tolerated .
I could go on and on , but I am confident that you get the idea .
By firing calcium isotopes into a plutonium target inside a particle accelerator , scientists at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory have finally confirmed the Russian discovery of the superheavy element 114 .
It was n't easy .
It took more than a week of running the experiment to generate a measly two atoms of the stuff , which they reported in Physical Review Letters last week .
It 's basic science at the outer limits of matter .
" We 're learning the limits of nuclei , " said Ken Gregorich , a nuclear physicist at LBL .
" How many protons can you pack into a nucleus before it falls apart ? "
Uranium , which has 92 protons in its nucleus , is the heaviest element found in substantial quantities in nature .
The first man-made " transuranic " elements like plutonium were discovered and synthesized during the 1940s in the run-up to the creation of nuclear weapons .
Since then , it 's gotten harder and harder to produce new elements , but scientists have kept at it .
One reason is they hypothesized that certain isotopes of very heavy particles might exist in an " island of stability " that would allow them to stick around longer than the fractions of a second most synthetic elements last .
So , it was with great excitement that scientists received the news in early 1999 that the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna appeared to have discovered Element 114 — and it lasted for whole seconds .
" It 's fantastically important work , " Neil Rowley of the Institute for Subatomic Research in Strasbourg , France told New Scientist in 1999 .
Glenn Seaborg , Nobel Prize winner , adviser to presidents , and a big advocate of the island theory of superheavy elements , was even delivered the news of the Russian discovery on his death bed by an old friend .
" The term ' magic ' was continually used — Seaborg and others spoke of a magic ridge , a magic mountain and a magic island of elements , " wrote Oliver Sachs of the search for the island .
" This vision came to haunt the imagination of physicists the world over .
Whether or not it was scientifically important , it became psychologically imperative to reach , or at least to sight , this magic territory . "
After decades of swimming through particle accelerator data , the island had been reached .
It was tremendously big news .
Or so they thought .
As the years went by , the Russian team published a series of papers about Element 114 , but other teams could n't confirm their initial discovery of the extraordinarily long - lived particle .
There were two reasons for this .
One , the experimental apparatus required to check the findings were only available in a small number of labs around the world .
Two , it appears the Russians were wrong .
" I think back in '99 they were learning how to do this and I think they had a random correlation of unrelated events that appeared to be Element 114 , " Gregorich said .
It 's not that they did n't eventually discover Element 114 .
They did .
It 's just that their first observation , the most exciting one , turned out to be incorrect .
In four separate publications from 2000 to 2004 , they came up with better data , and those are the observations that Gregorich said his lab has confirmed .
And the island of stability ?
It is actually there , Gregorich said , but its effects are less pronounced than ( at least ) Seaborg hoped .
The particular combinations of protons and neutrons do yield longer lasting elements , just not ... magic ones .
" Our results and the Dubna results show that there is some stability there , " Gregorich said .
" If we did n't have extra stability due to the shell effects , these things would decay faster than we could ever detect them with lifetimes on the order of 10 - 20 seconds rather than 10 - 1 seconds . "
The search , though , for a more perfect superheavy element does go on .
" There are still predictions that if you could use more neutron - rich projectiles , if you could produce these elements but with more neutrons , some of them would be pretty long lived , " he said .
Unfortunately , the particle accelerators in operation and currently planned wo n't reach the power necessary to get to create the theoretically most stable elements .
" The present and next generation of radioactive beam machines do n't have high enough beam intensities , " Gregorich said .
" The technology does n't exist today but it might in another 20 or 30 years . "

After leaving HM Prison Greenock after being released on compassionate grounds , Abdelbaset Ali al - Megrahi released the following statement : I am obviously very relieved to be leaving my prison cell at last and returning to Libya , my homeland .
I would like to first of all take the opportunity to extend my gratitude to the many people of Scotland , and elsewhere , who have sent me their good wishes .
I bear no ill will to the people of Scotland ; indeed , it is one of my regrets that I have been unable to experience any meaningful aspect of Scottish life , or to see your country .
To the staff in HM Prison Greenock , and before that at HM Prison Barlinnie , I wish to express thanks for the kindness that they were able to show me .
Megrahi said he bore no ill - will to the people of Scotland For those who assisted in my medical and nursing care ; who tried to make my time here as comfortable as possible , I am of course grateful .
My legal team has worked tirelessly on my behalf ; I wish to thank Advocates Margaret Scott QC , Jamie Gilchrist QC , Shelagh McCall and Martin Richardson together with the team at Taylor & Kelly , for all of their gallant efforts in my bid to clear my name .
I know they share , in no small measure , my disappointment about the abandonment of my appeal .
Many people , including the relatives of those who died in , and over , Lockerbie , are , I know , upset that my appeal has come to an end ; that nothing more can be done about the circumstances surrounding the Lockerbie bombing .
I share their frustration .
I had most to gain and nothing to lose about the whole truth coming out - until my diagnosis of cancer .
To those victims ' relatives who can bear to hear me say this : they continue to have my sincere sympathy for the unimaginable loss that they have suffered .
Profound dislocation
To those who bear me ill will , I do not return that to you .
And , lastly , I must turn to my conviction and imprisonment .
To be incarcerated in a far off land , completely alien to my way of life and culture has been not only been a shock but also a most profound dislocation for me personally and for my whole family .
I have had many burdens to overcome during my incarceration .
I had to sit through a trial which I had been persuaded to attend on the basis that it would have been scrupulously fair .
In my second , most recent , appeal I disputed such a description .
I had to endure a verdict being issued at the conclusion of that trial which is now characterised by my lawyers , and the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission , as unreasonable .
A Libyan aircraft leaves Glasgow Airport with Megrahi on board
To me , and to other right thinking people back at home in Libya , and in the international community , it is nothing short of a disgrace .
As a result of my surrender , and that judgment of the Court , I had to spend over 10 years in prison .
I cannot find words in my language or yours that give proper expression to the desolation I have felt .
This horrible ordeal is not ended by my return to Libya .
It may never end for me until I die .
Perhaps the only liberation for me will be death .
And I say in the clearest possible terms , which I hope every person in every land will hear : all of this I have had to endure for something that I did not do .
The remaining days of my life are being lived under the shadow of the wrongness of my conviction .
I have been faced with an appalling choice : to risk dying in prison in the hope that my name is cleared posthumously or to return home still carrying the weight of the guilty verdict , which will never now be lifted .
The choice which I made is a matter of sorrow , disappointment and anger , which I fear I will never overcome .
I say goodbye to Scotland and shall not return .
My time here has been very unhappy and I do not leave a piece of myself .
But to the country 's people I offer my gratitude and best wishes .

A few years back , David Shideler worked at a company that built car dealership systems and was a bit reluctant to jump on the new technology bandwagon .
In fact , to say that this company moved slowly is not just an understatement , it 's an affront to the word " slow " .
1200 baud : that 's slow .
Mail - in - rebates : really slow .
Glacier movement : really , really slow .
This company : about as fast as fossilization .
The company built the first version of their product in 1973 using COBOL and a specially - manufactured IBM System / 3 .
It was an overnight success : hundreds of dealerships across the country bought their product and tens of millions of dollars in sales poured into the company .
They discovered a formula that worked and did n't want to change it .
Despite numerous technological advancements over the following decade , they stayed the course and continued to improve and optimize their product for the System / 3 platform .
It got the point where buying an antiquated System / 3 was significantly more expensive than buying a brand - new , much - faster computer .
But that did n't matter ; their system worked and there was no need to change it .
And then it happened : IBM announced that the System / 3 would be discontinued .
The company was outraged and begged and pleaded for IBM to continue supporting it .
Being that they were one of the last System / 3 customers , IBM offered to send a team of consultants to help them transition and compile their code on the new x86 platform .
The company refused .
Instead , they hired a small team of computer - science whizzes to develop a low - level emulator that would allow them to run System / 3 binaries on the x86 .
After all , their application ran perfectly on the System / 3 and there was no need to change it .
The emulation worked fairly well for the next several years and they continued to develop their product in COBOL for the System / 3 and run it on an x86 .
That is , until the manufacturer of their COBOL compiler went out of business .
Now , some might have seen that as a sign to switch to a new language and a new hardware platform .
Not these guys .
Their solution was , again , to hire a small team of computer - science whizzes to develop a COBOL " compiler " that would translate all of their System / 3 COBOL code to C and then compile it as an x86 binary .
Their application ran perfectly in COBOL and there was no need to change it .
Of course , one of the big problems with their COBOL - to - C translation program was that it produced completely unreadable C code that none of the COBOL programmers could understand , let alone debug .
The computer - science whizzes were brought back in to create a COBOL development environment that allowed for the COBOL developers to step - through and debug their code .
Amazingly , it worked and they were able to continue developing in System / 3 COBOL for the next decade or so .
Fast forward to 2001 and the company is in need of yet another team of computer - science whizzes .
And this is where David comes into the story .
You see , the company wanted to extend their reach into Europe , but the European market was all into this fancy new technology called " Windows . "
Since the terminal emulator on top of Windows just would n't cut it , they brought in David and several others to help them embrace the " new " Windows technology .
Obviously , their advice to switch to C/C++ or an actual Windows development environment fell on deaf ears .
David and the rest of his team needed to figure out a way to bring their System / 3 - COBOL - translated - into - C application into the world of Windows .
One of David 's first challenges was COBOL 's event model , or , more accurately , its lack of one .
In standard Windows programming , when the user clicks on a button or does just about anything else , Windows raises an event to tell the application what happened .
In COBOL programming , the application periodically asks if the user did an action .
They were able to work around this by creating an " action queue " that allowed COBOL to see what happened and respond accordingly .
The next challenge was in creating the Windows Forms themselves , or , more accurately , creating a form generator that would translate the terminal screens into Windows forms that do n't look too " terminaly " but still maintained a terminal feel .
They actually managed to do this , too .
Amazingly , once the " Windows conversion " project was over , their software actually worked in Windows .
It looked terrible and ran incredibly slow , but it worked .
The company was able to keep its entire floor of COBOL programmers working on the System / 3 - COBOL - translated - to - C-rendered - in - Windows application and things have remained the same ever since .
After all , they found a formula that worked and there was no need to change it .
Crazy Machines for iPhone or iPod Touch is the latest in the franchise from German based developer Fakt Software .
The object is to use the provided items to make a contraption in the spirit of the old board game Mousetrap .
The player may be given items like a lighter , a candle , and a magnifying glass , and be expected to use all three items to light the fuse of a cannon , or to heat up a teapot , or activate a solar - powered electrical socket .
There is more than one way to solve each level , but time is limited .
Bonus points are awarded if the level objective can be completed without using all of the parts .
Tools in the game include lasers , mirrors , brick blocks , steam engines , conveyor belts , various forms of electrical sockets , ropes , weights , pulleys , toasters , and fans .
The game also features a construction mode , which allows you to build your own puzzles to stump your friends with .
Mission objectives for each level are clearly defined , so the only part of the game that might slow you down is figuring out how to accomplish the objective with the tools you are given , but that ’s the very point of the game .
Get ready for several hours of iPhone gaming goodness .
The graphics are average when measured against other iPhone games ( and especially as compared to Crazy Machines 2 for the PC ) , but the gameplay is highly engaging and will occupy your mind long after you put the game down .

Matt Wuerker Obama , the cable critic in chief
For someone who says he does n’t watch much cable news , President Barack Obama sounded pretty familiar with the standard talk show format of left vs. right when he was asked about it earlier this year .
“ It feels like WWF wrestling , ” Obama explained to NBC ’s Brian Williams in an interview .
“ You know , everybody ’s got their role to play . ”
Advertisement
The off - the - cuff characterization was in keeping with his newly emerging role , squeezed in between East Room ceremonies and pushing for health care reform : the commander in chief is becoming the nation ’s media critic in chief .
Obama is n’t just donning his Columbia Journalism Review hat to diagnose what ails the wheezing industry .
He ’s attempting to isolate one particular media irritant — cable news .
This president , it seems , has an obsession with it .
The big three cable networks —
Fox , MSNBC and CNN — have become a collective punching bag for Obama , usually referred to generically and always with derision .
“ I know it can be easy , especially in Washington , to get caught up in the day - to - day chatter of cable television , ” Obama said at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in March .
“ I want to make sure everyone catches this , because I think sometimes the chatter on the cable stations has n’t been clear about this , ” he said that month about his efforts to reduce government spending .
“ TV loves a ruckus , ” Obama lamented at a town hall in Montana in August .
His frequent displays of cable contempt can be traced back to the very first moments of challenge in his administration , when the stimulus package started to get beat up and the White House realized it was n’t going to win much Republican support for the initial priority of the Obama presidency .
It was then , as the president addressed a House Democratic retreat in Williamsburg , Va. , that Obama bemoaned the “ cable chatter ” he thought was distorting the stimulus .
Since then , the phrase has become a frequent shorthand used by Obama to complain about coverage he finds simplistic , process - obsessed and generally geared more toward creating heat than light .
Not surprisingly , he employs the term most often when he ’s frustrated that attention is being devoted to what he considers distractions to his agenda :
The Henry Gates police incident , rowdy town halls , South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson ’s outburst — all made - for - cable moments that Obama has come to dismiss as unworthy diversions .
“ There ’s always been frustration among presidents about what ’s happening in the media , ” said Frank Sesno , a former CNN Washington bureau chief turned George Washington University professor who said he still owns his “ Annoy the Media — Reelect Bush ” hat from the 1992 presidential race .
“ But cable has taken on this new tone — it ’s particularly personal , and it ’s particularly endless .
So there ’s some validity to what he says . ”
Yet Sesno noted that it ’s also cable that is more likely to air Obama ’s town halls or Rose Garden remarks — events that are sometimes overlooked by the traditional networks or major papers .
“ I doubt that he wants to unplug all the cable coverage because he ’d vastly diminish his own podium , ” the former newsman observed .
Administration aides say Obama does occasionally get glimpses of cable news from the many White House TVs that are always on and tuned in or when he ’s flying on Air Force One .
But usually , aides say , the president is told by staff what controversy , speculation or outrage is being chewed upon that day on cable .
Obama ’s private response matches his public disdain .
“ It ’s a lot of eye - rolling , ” said one West Wing aide when asked how the president usually responds to the hot topic du jour .
White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said the president ’s goal is not to bash cable but to keep supporters and those who might be swayed focused on long - range goals , rather than bogged down with less consequential issues or fleeting narratives .
“ I think a lot of this stems from the election , ” said Gibbs , who served as a top campaign official and frequent traveling companion with the then - candidate .
“ You had primarily donors but others , too , who would get fixated by cable and get freaked out and start calling . ”
Spooked by the latest poll showing Obama down , such individuals would buttonhole Obama and senior staff at all manner of events .
“ We ’d have to explain , ‘ Look , we ’re doing this differently , ’ ” Gibbs recalled .
Now , it often falls on Gibbs to duck into the Oval Office to tell the president what “ the cables , ” as White House aides often call the channels , are focused on .
The press secretary said that Obama ’s frustration is that they tend to focus on the extremes or try to make complex issues into either - or propositions .
“ They want to boil something like Afghanistan down to more troops or no more troops , ” he said .
“ Or make health care public option or no public option . ”
Obama ’s view is that most people approach issues in a far more nuanced fashion , Gibbs explained .
But the president , another aide suggests , is genuinely frustrated about how he thinks the cable coverage is giving short shrift to substance .
“ Sometimes the stuff he ’s trying to talk about gets bogged down in other , tangential meaningless [ stuff ] , ” said the aide , adding : “ If you look at any of the polls , one thing that they all say is that people do n’t have enough information about what he wants on health care . ”
Gibbs said cable news outlets had n’t complained about their whipping - boy status , quipping : “ They probably think it ’s pretty good advertising . ”
Perhaps so .
Asked for comment , Fox News and MSNBC declined to respond .
A CNN executive surmised that Obama was talking about the other two networks .
“ I get the sense , when you listen to what he ’s actually saying , that he ’s talking mostly about the ideological - leaning networks rather than CNN , ” said the executive .
“ He ’s talking about the back and forth and sometimes one - sidedness that you might get on other cable channels . ”
Dan Pfeiffer , Obama ’s deputy communications director and a student of the modern media , said the cable channels ought not to think the president is picking on them but noted they were part of a more malignant virus coursing through the body politic .
“ When he refers to cable chatter , it ’s a broader statement about the political media culture today , which is driven by cable but not limited to cable , ” Pfeiffer said .
“ The president ran on a mantle to change politics .
And there are a whole host of elements that make it hard to change politics in the country .
Those include special interest money , rank partisanship and a political media culture that celebrates all those things . ”
Channeling Obama ’s recent observation that cable rewards incivility — providing the rude with their 15 minutes of fame —
Pfeiffer likened the medium ’s impact on politics to what ESPN did to sports .
“ In the way that some people say SportsCenter has encouraged showboating in sports at times at the expense of solid , fundamental play , cable news encourages strident partisanship and vitriol , ” he observed .
And like Gibbs , Pfeiffer indicated that Obama ’s frustration with cable dates back to a campaign where the then - senator ’s tactics were often questioned by the pundits and commentators who frequently appear on the air .
“ In the cable media culture , every day is Election Day , ” Pfeiffer said .
“ You ’re judged if you won or you lost the day . ”
So while Republican presidents have carped about how liberal they perceive the media to be , Obama ’s gripe is less about slant than about presentation .
The professorial president seems to wish people got their information from high - fiber , low - volume outlets .
“ He may prefer to have an elite , thoughtful and even ponderous media culture that he thinks may have existed in some quarters in earlier times , ” said Sesno .
“ But we ’ve always had a raucous press at some level .
So I do n’t think that ’s realistic . ”

See shaky footage improved by the software
The kind of shaky handheld footage that is a hallmark of home movies has become popular with Hollywood directors in recent years .
But new software means that handheld cameras need no longer give wobbly results .
Computer scientists at the University of Wisconsin , Madison , and software giant Adobe have developed a technique that mixes 3D reconstruction with optical illusion to turn distinctive wobble of handheld camera footage into the smooth glide of a Hollywood tracking shot .
Warped thinking
The process starts using off - the - shelf software called Voodoo Camera Tracker that can reconstruct a camera ’s path through 3D space from a video sequence .
Using that as a reference , the software then tries to distort each frame to create the way things would have looked were the camera to have been on that perfect , smooth path .
Rather like a fun house mirror , different regions of each frame are warped by different amounts .
Advertisement
That distortion can be apparent when frames are examined individually , but when run in sequence , the brain thinks it is seeing footage taken from a camera moving on a steady path through space .
Optical illusion
“ It ’s impossible to translate the camera in a physically correct way , since there is just not enough information in the input video , ” Adobe senior research scientist Aseem Agarwala told New Scientist .
“ So we took a different approach and tried to trick the eye into seeing a stable video by carefully warping salient parts of the scene onto stable paths . ”
“ This is about the most modern work out there , ” says Richard Hartley a video and graphics expert at the Australian National University , Canberra , who was not involved in the research .
“ When you ’re moving , you need a way of smoothing the trajectory of the camera , ” he explains .
“ I had n’t seen it done quite like that before . ”
Ghosts in motion
Existing 2D stabilisation techniques , sometimes built into video cameras , can reduce the effects of camera shake , but are limited by having no way to read a camera ’s path through 3D space .
Attempts at 3D stabilisation have in turn been hindered by the fact they make each output by combining multiple output frames , resulting in “ ghosting ” of fast moving objects and people .
This is n’t a problem for the new technique because it distorts each frame in isolation , instead of combining multiple frames .
Wave goodbye
Although the results can be striking , the method does have limitations .
It ca n’t smooth out footage as it is shot , only once the whole movie has been captured .
The warping involved also leaves smoothed footage with stretched edges that need cropping to fit into a standard rectangle .
It also struggles to generate a 3D trajectory for scenes with a lot of motion or few features , such as a blank wall .
The researchers are working on these and other issues and declined to say specifically when such technology might hit the consumer market .
One of the researchers , Michael Gleicher of the University of Wisconsin , is optimistic that it , or a similar algorithm that does not rely on current 3D reconstruction technology , could be available in two to three years .
A paper on the new technique will be presented at the SIGGRAPH computer graphics conference in New Orleans next month .
A steamy new AIDS awareness advert showing an Adolf Hitler lookalike having sex is aimed at countering a fall in public awareness of the dangers of unprotected sex , its German makers say .
" We asked ourselves what face we could give to the virus , and it could n't be a pretty face , " Dirk Silz , creative director at the Das Commitee advertising agency behind the " AIDS is a mass murderer " campaign , told AFP on Sunday .
" The campaign is designed to shake people up , to bring the topic of AIDS back to centre stage , and to reverse the trend of unprotected sexual intercourse , " the agency said .
The ad , due to be screened in Germany on television and in cinemas and available at www.aids-is-a-mass-murderer.com, shows blurred clips of a couple having sex but it is only at the end that the man is revealed as Hitler .
A tag line then reads : " AIDS is a mass murderer . "
" Why Do You Hate Me ? "
What happens when a faggot asks people who gave time and money to support anti-gay Referendum 71 the most basic question ?
Mark Kaufman
* We have no idea what these people actually look like .
We talked to them over the phone .
On August 31 , the Washington Secretary of State 's office announced that Christian extremists had gathered enough signatures to put Referendum 71 on the November ballot .
Assuming a lawsuit does n't stop it , R - 71 allows the voting public to decide if the legislature was right in recently granting same - sex partners in this state the same rights as married couples .
( An " approve " vote on the referendum will put the law into effect ; a " reject " vote will nullify it . )
Conservatives have long held that they do n't have a problem with gay people — they just want to protect " marriage . "
But R - 71 only applies to domestic partnerships .
So why are those challenging this law fighting so hard to deny gay people equal rights ?
Since the state public disclosure commission recently ruled that the names of contributors to Referendum 71 must remain public , we called up four contributors to ask them .
These were the first four people we called .
James McFadden
Contribution to R - 71 : $ 100
Does James McFadden , a retired pharmacist now living on Mercer Island , just hate gay people ?
" No , I do n't feel that way , " he says , pointing out that he thinks gays " should have all the rights that married people have . "
When told that 's what this is about — the referendum is about domestic - partnership rights , not the word " marriage " — he goes on to say that if we were to grant gays equal rights , " gays would be back at the legislature pounding for the right to call it marriage .
I strongly believe that marriage is between a man and a woman . "
Adding to the puzzle of McFadden 's logic is his firm conviction that R - 71 is a lost cause .
" For one thing , Seattle is very pro-gay and very liberal . "
In fact , he thinks the entire movement is a bust : " Gay marriage is going to happen . "
Deciphering McFadden 's logic is like solving a Rubik 's Cube in the dark , but gay people clearly just creep him out .
" A penis does not belong in someone 's anus .
I have seen people with perforated anuses , and they end up with a colostomy bag , " he says .
Esther Mayoh
Contribution to R - 71 : Gathered petition signatures
An evangelical Christian in Olympia , Esther Mayoh circulated petitions at her home bible - study group and her church .
Each petition included the exact text of the domestic - partnership bill , which R - 71 puts up to a public vote .
But Mayoh still does n't know what it 's about .
" My main reason is that I do n't want our state to , well , to put it bluntly , I do n't want our state to legalize sodomy , " she says .
Asked about why same - sex couples should be denied , say , the right to share insurance coverage or use personal sick leave to care for an ill spouse , she says , " I have n't read that bill . "
Asked generally why they should be denied the same rights as married couples , she says , " It 's a very difficult question .
I do n't know how to answer it . "
So do you hate me ?
" I do n't hate you .
I love you , and I 'd like to help you to see what God really has planned for you .
Once you see that and once you know that , then you will have true happiness .
In fact , I have — I am sorry to say — I have a sister who is involved in that lifestyle , " she says .
" But deep down in her heart , she knows it is wrong . "
Mayoh also has a grown daughter who donated to R - 71 and volunteers for the anti-gay faction watchdogging elections workers .
" She was a gay person for a while , " Mayoh says .
" She knew it was wrong , and she suffered much because of what she was doing . "
Carrie Vasko
Contribution to R - 71 : $ 200
Carrie Vasko , a homemaker in Sammamish , is extremely Christian .
She supports R - 71 , she says , because " I do not believe that marriage — with its long history since the foundation of the world — is to be changed . "
So do you hate me ?
" I do n't hate homosexuals .
I am a person who respects people , " she says .
" That does n't mean I agree with other people 's actions .
I am unhappy with pornography , unhappy with murder , unhappy with drug abuse . "
Without prompt or transition , her moralizing segues into hypothetical disease scenarios .
" If a young person gets HIV early , that 's 20 years off their life , and you have to ask if that is the way they want to spend their life . "
She can't explain how her train of thought goes from marriage to disease , except to say that gays would " still be sexually active outside of marriage . "
Would she ever go see a lesbian doctor ?
Vasko is uncomfortable with that idea : " Does her lesbianism cause her to act differently for the patients she cares for ? "
And she 's uncomfortable with the idea of gay teachers in schools : " [ School ] is there to push math and science , not to push these personal agendas . "
Paul Henry
Contribution to R - 71 : $ 200
Paul Henry , an 84 - year - old Christian in Colville , believes gay people are dirty , violent sodomites .
Our crusade to achieve rights on parity with marriage is " a direct challenge to the survivability of society , " he says .
Why does he hate gay people so much ?
" I do n't hate 'em .
Actually , they are the ones overturning police cars .
When Harvey Milk was shot , the gay people in San Francisco just went crazy .
They smashed in store windows and turned over cars .
They tried to light fires , " he says .
" They are the ones doing the violence .
They are n't getting beat up .
If you want to look at haters , [ the gays ] are the haters , not the Christians . "
He adds , " All Referendum 71 is trying to do is defend ourselves against their political attack .
Society does n't need to give anything to them just because they demand it .
It is not a civil - rights issue ; it is a health issue . "
So does he think gay people are gross ?
" I would say even more than gross .
I think they are major incubators of a lot of the bacteria .
It is common for homosexuals to have hundreds of different sexual experiences with people — they do fisting , they do water sports , and on and on .
There are bacteria that are called ' gay - related syndrome ' or something , but it is not healthy .
And by using lots of antibiotics against them , the antibiotics are no longer usable because they do n't work . "
Ah , the college dating life is filled with various kinds of action - packed hookups it ’s hard to keep track .
Whether you ’ve yet to experience any of these or already crossed them all off of your list , rest assure they will inevitably happen throughout your early twenties .
Drunken Hookup :
Your drunk goggles are in full effect , and you ’re making the best , worst decision of the night .
All you need for this is the right level of intoxication , an attractive partner , and nearby hookup spot .
Realistically people will go into the evening ready to drink and dance with their buddies but before they know it the uber is being called to whisk away their sex buddy .
Not too sure what their name is or if they live in the area but who cares ?
You ’re supposed to be talking with your body , and that ’s exactly what you end up doing .
This hookup either ends the same night it started or if you ’re lucky it turns into a fuck buddy , sometimes even something more serious .
Whether it ’s your goal to take someone home or arbitrary , you will throw any rationalization out the window and give in to your urges and guess what ?
That ’s perfectly okay .
Spontaneous Hookup :
The right time to have a hookup is anytime .
These hookups are by far the most exciting because you think you have the rest of your day planned and then BAM !
You run into an old fling , receive a random sext or get out of your house long enough to make eye contact with a hottie .
Going into the night with no expectations leads to no disappointments and if having sex was n’t on the agenda what do you have to lose ?
Being prepared for something so natural takes the fun and excitement out of it so hook up on a whim , and you might be surprised how much more satisfied you are .
It can be nerve - racking , and you may end up shaving your entire body in 30 seconds or not at all but it ’s totally worth the rush of excitement .
FWB Hookup :
All of that friendly sexual tension you ’ve built will finally overflow to the point of intimacy .
Whether alcohol is involved or just a late game night , someone will gain enough courage to make a move .
This hookup is a little tricky because even though it takes two to tango there ’s no guarantee the friendship wo n’t get weird .
If you ’re a pro at making things awkward , then you just messed up the group dynamic but if you mutually agree to continue or never do that again then congrats !
There is a slim chance of making it out of the friend zone , but that does n’t mean a one - night hookup wo n’t end up happening at some point in time .
There is no right or wrong to a hookup experience as long as you have a good night or story to make out of it .
Do n’t fret because these hookups continue way to pass your horny , love - struck college years .

The creators of an Aids awareness advertisement that shows a woman having sex with a series of dictators [ Warning : video contains graphic sexual images ] , including Hitler and Stalin , defended it today , amid growing criticism .
The ad is due to run until World Aids Day on 1 December .
Photograph : Uwe Duettmann / AFP / Getty Images
Das Comitee , a Hamburg advertising agency , said the advert 's shock value was aimed at highlighting the dangers of unprotected sex at a time when public awareness about the risks was diminishing .
" We knew the face we gave to the illness could not be a pretty one , " said Dirk Silz , the creative director .
The advert was trying to " show the ugliness of the illness , not of aids victims " , he added .
But organisations representing people with Aids across Europe have condemned it , saying it only adds to the stigma they already suffer by appearing to put them on a par with mass murderers .
Others criticised the campaign for failing to offer any prevention advice , such as the use of condoms .
The 45 - second advert , which is being launched on German television and in cinemas this week but cannot be broadcast before the 9 pm watershed because of its content , shows a couple having sex .
Towards the end the man 's face turns into that of Adolf Hitler , along with the slogan " Aids is a mass murderer " .
In poster versions for the campaign the images of other dictators such as Joseph Stalin and Saddam Hussein have also been used .
The campaign was the brainchild of the German Aids awareness group , Regenbogen eV , and is due to run until World Aids day on December 1 .
Das Comitee said it had worked for nothing on the film , and had received a positive response so far .
" If it wakes people up to the dangers of unprotected sex , we 've been effective , " Silz said .
This is the breast story I 've written today .
Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 is coming soon to the PlayStation 3 on September 29 , and if you needed any convincing that it 'll be a good action title , allow me to jog your mammary so you do n't look like a tit in future .
NGS2 will feature SIXAXIS - controlled boobs .
That 's right , a jiggle of the PS3 controller will translate into a jiggle of the character 's bosom .
Just when you thought Tecmo could n't get any filthier .
For once , this is the kind of motion control I can get behind , and I feel that it more than makes up for the reduced amount of gore that Sigma 2 will be enjoying when compared to the Xbox 360 original .
Simply put , the 360 version did not have interactive jiggling nipplebombs , ergo it loses .
Just check out the above image , supplied by Kombo , for proof that technology really does make a difference .
This is seriously the greatest thing to have ever happened in the videogame industry .
INNOVATION !

This is the second article in a series examining the effects of the recession on budget and admissions policies in Cornell ’s graduate and professional schools .
Likely the result of the current economic downturn , the Cornell Law School has seen a surge in applicants this year .
Richard Geiger , associate dean for communications and enrollment , explained that the economy has a countercyclical effect on law school applications , meaning that when the economy is down , the number of law school applications goes up .
He anticipates that next year will be the time that applications increase most dramatically .
“ The application volume is up 7 or 8 perent compared to last year , ” Geiger said .
“ It could be that those who were laid off would take [ the ] opportunity to change their career paths or come to law school for a different trajectory when they return to the workplace . ”
He added that graduating seniors who test a job market and realize there are not any jobs for them , consider law school as an alternative .
Ghazal Tajmiri law ’09 said , “ As things get worse , you ca n’t help but worry and wonder if your firm will cancel your job , since some firms have folded .
The situation is market - and firm - specific , but it is a tough climate with so many layoffs . ”
The concern about securing and keeping a job is widespread among law students .
John DeRosa , assistant dean for student and career services , has noticed a rise in anxiety and uncertainty for students as they continue their job search .
DeRosa believes that the economy ’s impact on the Law School extends to both the students and alumni .
Accordingly , DeRosa said that the career services has oriented itself towards developing “ forward - looking approaches and strategies , rather than upon the placement of our current students . ”
“ Our Class of ’08 saw a 97 - percent employment rate at graduation and placement for the Class of ’09 will not differ materially from that level , ” DeRosa stated in an e-mail .
“ If the economy does not improve at least somewhat over the course of the next year or two , we certainly expect that to be reflected in our placement rates . ”
The Career Services office has placed emphasis on increasing the number of employment opportunities available .
One of their current efforts entails sending information about the Cornell Law Career Services to approximately 2,000 alumni both in and out of the country .
DeRosa stated that an increased number of alumni have contacted the office for assistance and advice .

Since students graduating this year began the recruiting process two years in advance , those who have jobs were able to acquire them before the economic decline .
However , since the process involving job fairs and on - campus recruiting is currently only in its early stages of registration , first year and second year law students have been more directly affected .
“ I did n’t even apply for a position over the summer , since the ones I wanted are usually reserved for second year law students , ” Nicolette Ward law ‘ 11 said .
“ Before , there used to be a handful of positions open , but now they are not hiring as many . ”
Richard Robinson , associate dean for administration and finance at the Law School , said that unlike some other schools at the University , the Law School is heavily tuition - dependent without grants and contracts .
The administration will utilize discretionary sources to strategically determine the allocation of funds , Robinson said .
It is aiming to create reductions with effects on the administration , not on service , he added .
The law school will freeze the salaries of professors and reduce the number of visiting faculty in addition to halting its planned building renovations that were subject to the University ’s construction pause , Robinson said .
“ We are looking for a cut in law school and operating budgets next year and to scale back a little bit , cutting back on administrative costs , ” he said , “ We will shift funding around to cover those programs that endowment did fund [ such as scholarships ] .
Overall , it is a belt - tightening process to reexamine our budgets without a direct effect on the basic delivery of education to the students .
We are being cautious on commitments for next year and we have to wait and see what ’s going to happen , ” Robinson said .
( CNN ) -- Garrison Keillor , author and host of the folksy radio show " A Prairie Home Companion , " was being treated Wednesday for a minor stroke he suffered over the weekend , a hospital spokesman said .
Author Garrison Keillor attends an event in New York on November 18 , 2008 .
Keillor , who turned 67 last month , was admitted to St. Mary 's Hospital at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , on Sunday night , spokesman Karl Oestreich said in a news release .
" He is up and moving around , speaking sensibly , working at a laptop , and it 's expected he 'll be released on Friday , " Oestreich said .
" He plans to resume a normal schedule next week . "
The live variety show " A Prairie Home Companion " is aired on Minnesota Public Radio .
Keillor launched the program on July 6 , 1974 , in a St. Paul , Minnesota , college theater before an audience of 12 people .
According to a " Backstage Chat " on the show , Keillor got the idea for it from watching the Grand Ole Opry .
Keillor , also a storyteller and satirist , has written 11 books , including three for children .
He was inducted into the Radio Hall of Fame in 1994 .

" Any real change requires the inclusion of a strong public option to promote competition and bring down costs .
If a vigorous public option is not included , it would be a major victory for the health insurance industry .
" President Obama has said that a public option will keep the insurance companies honest .
If someone has a better idea for promoting competition and reducing health care costs , they should put it on the table .
But for the past month , opponents of health insurance reform have demonstrated that they are afraid of the facts .
They have only offered distortions , distractions and misrepresentations to try to kill this historic legislation .
" A bill without a strong public option will not pass the House .
Eliminating the public option would be a major victory for the insurance companies who have rationed care , increased premiums and denied coverage . "
Go Nancy !
she has been a consistent Champion and a fighter for our center - left causes in this congress .
Especially the public option .
M.r. president at this point it will be both politically and substantively idiotic to back down on the public option ( both progressives , dems and the substantial majority of the American people support it .
Polls after August range from 52 % , 55 % , 66 % & 77 % support for it .
Even after all the negativity and the town hall disruptions clear majorities support it .
In the senate only 2 dems have come out and openly opposed it , that leaves clear margins for a reconciliation bill that passes the senate easily ) .
I hope for both your and our sakes you will draw a line in the sand on something you feverishly campaigned on next week in your state of the union address .
If the public option goes down because of the president being wishy washy on it ( or worse ) , he will have no defenders for the bill from left or the right and the negativity will creep over to independents as well .
In short he will have no allies .
I am wishing for the best next week , do not cross over to the dark side M.r. president .
That is a line too far for me to cross it over with you .
Update :
So much for the moderate Snow , she WANTS to stick with gang of six and wont cut a deal !
what kind of moderate is she if she wants to stick it with likes of Grassly and Enzi ?
( I commented 2 months ago there was no way in hell to get Enzi .
He is from Wyoming for fucks sake ) I look at this as good news as well .
Lets just go to reconciliation .
That is best chance for a good bill right now , in fact reconciliation will FORCE a better public option for it to pass the byrd rule .
http://www.rollcall.com/...
Sen. Olympia Snowe ( R - Maine ) appears unlikely to walk away from bipartisan health care reform talks in the Senate Finance Committee to cut a side deal with the White House , but her spokeswoman said Thursday that she continues to keep an " open line of communication " with President Barack Obama .
" The Senator ’s foremost goal is to achieve a bipartisan consensus among the six members of the group on a path forward for meaningful health care reform , " Snowe spokeswoman Julia Wanzco said .
UpdateX2 :
In my opinion for progressives to get the best bill out of this process they must mobilize RIGHT NOW to advocate strongly for reconciliation .
From what I understand ( and have researched ) of the process if the public option is strong enough it wont even have to be susnset , since sunset comes into play when the bill adds to long term deficits ( a point of order against a bill that adds more to the deficits up to 5 decades from now ) .
That is why bush tax cuts sunset after 5 years and needed to be renewed to get to 10 years .
If the public option is strong it wont add to the long term deficit ( hopefully , it is determined by CBO ) so therefore it wont need to be sunset to get around this point of order .
That is the best case scenario for this bill and it can only be achieved through reconciliation .
IMO we have to advocate for reconciliation non stop from now until oct 15 in diaries and in public / congressional outreaches .
P.S. Good to see this at the top of rec list :)
UpdateX3 :
Here is a link about reconciliation and how it will apply to strengthen the public option and removing the sunset provisions .

Can printing your own cash actually help revive a struggling economy ?
That 's just what traders in one London shopping district are hoping for , as they begin accepting a new local currency .
Short on cash ?
Then why not make your own .
There 's no law against it , so long as you do n't try to pass it off as sterling .
And you can use whatever you please to make your money , whether cigarettes , rabbit skins or paper notes .
That 's what 's happening in Brixton , a south London neighbourhood where shoppers , from Thursday , will be able to hand over 10 Brixton Pounds ( B£s ) in return for their groceries .
Proponents of local currencies say they boost the community 's economy by keeping money in the area , but critics dismiss them as fashionable gimmicks , tantamount to protectionism .
HOW TO USE B£s Exchange £ 20 for 20 Brixton Pounds ( B£s ) at Morleys department store or Opus Cafe Spend this in any of the 70 or so shops , clubs , pubs , cafes which have signed up
On another shopping trip , accept change in B£s from the shopkeeper Spend this change in another of the shops .
And so on B£s can be exchanged for legal tender at certain Brixton businesses 40,000 notes in 1 , 5 , 10 and 20 units , each featuring a revered local figure , are printed on watermarked paper with holograms and serial numbers B£s cannot leave the area nor be banked to earn interest
They may sound experimental but have in fact been used since the Middle Ages when local currencies were all there was - it was not until the 1700s that every European country had its own currency , says Tim Leunig , an economist at the LSE .
Research suggests that when the wider economy slumps , communities turn to barter systems .
In other words , when there 's little money around , people think about making their own .
The Great Depression of the 1930s saw a wide take - up in the US and much later , the Global Barter Club was born after the Argentine economy hit rock - bottom in 2001 .
At its height , the system was supporting three million people .
And today 's straitened times may well renew interest in complementary currencies but , as one unconvinced Brixton shopper , asks : " What 's the point ? "
" A local economy is like a leaky bucket .
Wealth is generated then spent in chain stores and businesses .
It disappears leaving an impoverished local economy , " explains Ben Brangwyn , part of the team behind the Totnes Pound , launched in south Devon in 2007 .
" Local money prevents that from happening and keeps the money bouncing around the bucket , building wealth and prosperity . "
Currently , 6,000
Totnes pounds are in circulation from an estimated local economy of £ 60 m .
It is , stresses Mr Brangwyn , a radical experiment , still in its very early stages , but he can see a day when England has 2,000 local currencies .
Other towns joining the experiment , started by environmental group Transition Network , are Lewes in East Sussex and Stroud in Gloucestershire which introduced the Stroud Pound this week .
Fake notes Brixton , with its reputation for bustling streets , a lively nightlife and a notoriety for street crime , is the first urban area to have its own currency .
Volunteers behind the project say it has not been an easy sell .
Some shopkeepers are concerned about counterfeiting and the build - up of Brixton pounds in their till .
Others see it as a novel advertising tool that could become gift vouchers , or even a collector 's item .
It relies on people 's sense of wanting to shape their own economic future
Susan Witts , BerkShare co-founder
So far , £ 10,000 has been pledged by businesses and local people to be converted into B£s , but on the streets there is still some convincing to be done .
Project manager Tim Nichols hopes people will be drawn by the notion of a kind of " secret club " for holders of the special notes and expects Brixton 's antiestablishment spirit to work to its advantage .
" We are in London , the financial hub of the world , and are trying to do something that goes against the grain of the big banking system that we are living on the edge of . "
He is also optimistic the recession can work in its favour .
That 's the view of Susan Witts who co-founded the BerkShare , a local currency launched in 2006 in Berkshire , Massachusetts .
She puts the growth of BerkShares ( from 1 million to 2.5 million in three years ) down , in part , to the recession and a lot of hard work .
Almost all collapse because they do n't achieve anything
Dr Tim Leunig , LSE economist " Introducing a new currency means more work .
You have to train staff to use it , adapt accounting processes .
When things are going well , it seems an unnecessary extra step .
" But in difficult times , businesses are looking at ways to make their business work .
It relies on people 's sense of wanting to shape their own economic future . "
But David Boyle , of the New Economics Foundation think - tank and a supporter of alternative currencies , believes efforts in Britain are hampered by its banking system .
Whereas the US has a major network of local banks willing to handle other kinds of money , banks in the UK are less willing to do that .
He suggests the answer could lie with local authorities playing a more controlling role .
The vital factor though , says Mr Boyle , is belief .
" If you can maintain that belief in the community , it can work , " he says .
Tax dodge
Other economists dismiss the whole concept as a gimmick .
" It might make people feel good , but it 's not achieving anything meaningful , " says Tim Leunig , of LSE .
There are 6,000 Totnes pounds in circulation " You 're saying you can't buy goods from Hackney , Southwark or China , even if they are cheaper .
It 's giving Brixton shops monopoly power and in the long - run destroys incentives .
Almost all collapse because they do n't achieve anything . "
The only use he can see for it is as a tax dodge , but the taxman says this is a red herring .
All businesses have to report all turnover and as every local currency is tacked to sterling , every sale , whether paid for in cream cakes , polar bears or carrots must be reported to its sterling value , the HM Revenue and Customs says .
And if you are not running a business , the HMRC has no interest because where there 's no profit motive , there 's no taxation consequence .
The Treasury , meanwhile , views them as little more than gift vouchers .
So , with the government unperturbed , perhaps we could yet see Mr Brangwyn's vision of 2,000 separate local currencies realised .
But would that be a brave leap into the future or a return to the Middle Ages ?
Below is a selection of your comments A local currency is a great idea if it can delay the passing of wealth from local communities straight into the stock exchanges of the world , where it is used for unethical and environmentally - harmful purposes .
The mainstream economy , as promoted by the LSE , is based on a pyramid selling scam , and is thus no good for anyone except the already wealthy .
Tom Barker , Chester , England I can only see this working as a kind of tourist attraction for people to go and use this " monopoly money " .
I can't see it helping their local economy much and I doubt I 'll be using Teesside Tenners any time soon .
David Cook , Billingham , England I think it would be better and more flexible to trade goods and services , e.g. a haircut for a meal .
this has worked well in communities in the past and will continue to do so .
arguably , it may not boost an area 's economy , but it will boost the feel good factor there instead .
Kim Shankar , London
This is wide - open to abuse - how do consumers know that the scheme wo n't collapse leaving them unable to trade their worthless " currency " back into sterling ?
Barter economies work because the items bartered have an intrinsic value ; if you swap pound coins for bits of paper with a hologram on , nowhere else will accept that as payment because they have next to no value .
Jenna , Bath
If the exchange rate is tied to the pound then the Brixton pound will not keep any money in the area .
Any holder of a Brixton pound could simply exchange it for sterling should they want to spend money somewhere else .
A fixed rate of exchange to sterling means that every Brixton pound has to be backed by a pound of sterling .
This means that no money has been created .
( In fact since a Brixton pound costs money to produce but is only exchangeable for exactly one pound of sterling , the total money supply in the area may in fact be reduced ) .
Samuel , London Surely this is a complete waste of time ?
Whilst shops in Brixton may recognise it as legal tender , elsewhere people wo n't have ever heard of it .
The fact that you have to purchase the Brixton Pound using Pounds Sterling sort of destroys the point of it ; you 're exchanging one currency for another , when you can use the first across the whole country and is worth more thanks to the gold standard .
They can't be banked , thus contributing to the economic slowdown more so , because the banks require our investment to keep loaning money to other people and businesses .
And surely it costs more to produce the Brixton Pound than you might save by using it ?
And what do you use to buy the materials required ?
Pound Sterling .
Paul , Swindon I think the HMRC has it wrong .
If you 're paid in Brixton £s for services and not goods , does n't this mean you not taxed .
Say for example , if I 'm an electrician and I fix the wiring in a persons house and I buy to parts in Brixton £s and I 'm paid in Brixton £s , I do n't have to declare the earnings .
Rob , Manchester , UK
Any scheme which protects local communities from the endemic greed of the global ' financial community ' has to be not only practical but also essential in nurturing self reliance .
Big brother has made big mistakes recently and will soon be losing control when half the world is on the move

09-09-2009 , 12:05 AM
It was the day after Thanksgiving , 2006 .
I was in a dive bar in Tucson , ca n't remember what time it was , but it was dark outside .
On the television above me was a Colorado Buffaloes game .
There were a few assorted degenerates and charlatans roaming around this dank room but I paid them no mind .
This is Tucson , Arizona , the place where the lost and the damned congregate in a hellish rondolet .
Behind me the door to the bar swung open and a figure , shrouded by darkness walked in .
I did n't turn my head .
The person sat down across the bar and ordered a drink , the sound of her voice resonated in the air for a few seconds , hanging there with the cheap cigarette smoke and jukebox music .
I looked up momentarily from my glass to see a so - so looking woman eying me from across the bar .
I 'd give her like a 5 1/2 out of 10 .
She noticed my gaze and called out to me but I did n't respond .
She scooted down several chairs to get closer to me and continued bothering me .
I just kept staring into the glass .
When I finished she offered to buy me another drink but I declined .
Women like this are trouble .
I did n't want to get mixed up with another dame like her .
There is n't enough cocaine on this planet to make her do - able , I thought to myself .
Unfortunately , I would come to discover , there is an amount of cocaine on this planet that would convince me to do her , and it was a surprisingly small amount .
She moved over another seat , now only one stool separated her and I .
I hope one of these Hell 's Angels comes over and sits between us , I thought to myself .
She tried making more small talk with me , talking about her husband and her kids , I knew the story ; bored wife , stuck at home all day with the kids , looking to get out and do something crazy .
I wrote and starred in 15 porno movies about that very plot .
But she kept at it .
There were 10 other guys in there with bad standards that would have mounted her on the bar in front of God and the rest of the drunkards , why was she only hounding me ?
She moves over another seat , now she 's right next to me .
She whispers something in my ear but I 'm only half - listening .
" Do you like to party ? "
She pulls a little bag out of her purse , my eyes widen .
There 's only a few things in this world that really catch my attention , and one of those things happens to be in that little bag .
I would recognize the contents of that bag in a white - out snowstorm from 500 yards away .
She licks my face .
I really wish she had n't done that .
I do n't remember what happened immediately after that but suddenly I 'm in the back of a car .
She 's in the back with me and her husband seems to be driving , turns out he was in the bar the entire time .
She 's taking off my shirt but I 'm really only thinking about the coke in the bag .
I go along with it .
The car pulls up outside of a seedy motel , The Lazy Eye Motel .
The sign outside has a pink neon eye with the cornea off - center , every few seconds it blinks .
Our room is situated right by the sign and even with the curtains drawn the room still fills with pink light every other second .
She enters the room , followed by me , followed by the husband .
He closes the door and the stands in front of it with a big smile on his face .
There are two beds in the room , one is made and vacant , the other has at least five children in it .
This does n't bother me because I 've both done it in front of , and with children before .
Stupid husband nudges me : " Are you in the pictures ? " he asks .
I 'm not sure what he means .
He leans in with a big grin on his stupid face : " Dirty movies . "
He winks at me like we 're both in the know and operating on the same wavelength or something .
I tell him that I 'm in porn and he tells me that he recognized me back in the bar .
He likes my work .
He tells me about his wife , he does n't know how to pleasure her anymore , they go from bar to bar in the seediest parts of America looking for men that can quench her sexual appetite .
When he saw me , a famous male pornstar , he knew he needed to bring me back here to give his wife some hot dickings .
While I 've been talking with the husband , the wife has been getting undressed and is now completely naked on the bed .
She calls out to me and I turn around .
Holy shit .
What have I gotten myself into ?
Her vagina , or what was left of it , was like a cave in the side of a mountain , all agape .
The husband nudges me on the shoulder " sometimes I stick my entire head in there . "
I 'm too shocked to say anything .
" Get over here and spelunk my cave ! " she shouts at me , she then picks up a flashlight and shines it in there , it 's pretty deep .
I 'm having second thoughts now .
" You 'd better do what she says " the husband tells me .
Noticing my reluctance to get undressed the wife grabs the bag of cocaine and empties it into her gaping vagina .
" Come and get it ! "
I comply and several minutes later I 'm trying to figure out how to have intercourse with this person .
I 'm a well - endowed man but this is like throwing a hot dog through a hula - hoop .
I can't generate any kind of friction what so ever .
The husband 's laughing at me .
" That shit 's been done , man .
It 's wrecked .
Try the ass . "
Her ass is n't much better , but it 's only as wide as two or three fists so I figure I have a better shot at it .
I go to work , in my cocaine - induced stupor , but nothing 's really happening .
The children are now awake and laughing at my incompetence .
" That 's not how you do it ! " the littlest one shouts .
The wife yawns .
" I grow weary of this , pleasure me ! " she shouts .
I study the situation .
I 've never experienced anything like this .
I look back at the husband and shrug .
He gives me a warm smile and offers to help .
Pretty soon the husband is naked and we 're both going at her , but not even two men can begin to fill this hole .
We begin shoving fists in there but it 's still very roomy .
Soon one of the sons joins in , then one of the daughters shoves a foot in there .
I black out .
When I come to The husband , one of the sons and myself are all having sex with the wife while a daughter shoves her leg in .
The youngest son has his head in her vagina , the husband and I are both fisting her and someone has jammed the television remote control and most of the bedside lamp in there as well .
There 's also the fat end of a Jack Daniels bottle rammed up her ass .
At one point one of her ovaries pops out and we take a quick pee break while she puts it back in .
Then we reassemble and start going at it again .
Meanwhile the remaining three or so children are having sex with each other on the bed .
But the wife was still bored .
" Cease this foolishness " she calls out , and slowly we all removed our appendages and body parts and heads and small electronics from her vagina .
The husband began weeping in the corner and the children got back in their bed .
" You 've tried your hardest , but obviously no man can ever satisfy me , you may help yourself to the cocaine mountain now . "
I look at the floor between the beds and notice a massive pile of cocaine about three and a half feet tall , how did I not see that before ?
I leap onto the pile and begin sucking as much up my nose as I can .
I momentarily look up at the ceiling and notice the wife now has a big burlap sack in her hands .
The bag is jerking around and moving like something is in it .
I sit up , covered in cocaine , and crawl back onto the bed to watch .
The wife reaches in to the bag , struggles momentarily , and pulls a full - grown badger out .
The badger claws at her arms , cutting them deep .
Blood sprays all over the bed .
The woman fights with the badger for several moments until she finally has it in the proper position .
She spreads her legs wide and shoves the badger head - first into her vagina .
She lets go and the badger , terrified , angry , and possibly high on cocaine , goes into a fit of rage .
It began clawing and shredding the inside of her vagina .
The wife , covered in deep wounds and spewing blood all over the bed cried in agonizing pleasure .
Blood drained from her vagina like a river and eventually the badger backed it 's way out all the way .
She then kicked it off the bed and it landed somewhere near the children .
She fell back into the mattress , drenched in blood , her loins looked like the mangled carcass of a zebra after a herd of lions had dismembered it , a pack of hyenas had scavenged it , and several vultures had picked it of its remains .
She breathed deeply , like she had just run a marathon , she had apparently climaxed five or six times .
I wanted more cocaine but the badger was under one of the beds and I was afraid to get off the bed .
Eventually we caught the badger and ate it for a late dinner .
The next morning I woke up before anyone else , got dressed and snuck out of the room before dawn .
What horrible people , I was glad to be out of their presence .
I caught a ride out of Tucson and never went back .
Soon after I found Jesus , quit the porn business and turned my life around completely .
No more promiscuous sex , no more drugs , no more anything !
I few months ago I was watching the television when I saw the husband , talking about this or that .
I recognized him instantly as the man from the motel .
I looked him up and sure enough it was the same man , still married to the same woman .
They apparently also found Jesus and started a church !
The man and woman that I had sex with in a motel room in Tucson , Arizona , was Steve and Zsuzsanna Anderson !
That 's right , the woman whose vagina was as big as a two car garage and used a badger to get off is the wife of Steve Anderson , a pastor in Phoenix , Arizona .
I would like to take a few moments of your time to praise God that Pastor Steve Anderson and his wife Zsuzsanna , as well as their children , have found the path to God .
Again , I would like to praise God for helping Steve Anderson , the man who sodomized me while I had sex with and fisted his wife , Zsuzsanna Anderson of Phoenix , Arizona 's , asshole .
Before I thought these people were incredibly sleazy degenerates , but now that I know that they are a Godly Christian family I feel that it is ok that Pastor Steve Anderson 's wife , Zsuzsanna Anderson of Phoenix , Arizona , had sexual intercourse with her 5 year old son while her husband and a complete stranger had sex with and fisted her , since they have repented and have sought forgiveness .
This is pastor Steve Anderson of Phoenix , Arizona .
His wife , Zsuzsanna Anderson , has a massive vagina that is really wide because she has had so many children .
In the past , pastor Steve Anderson of the Faithful Word Baptist Church would stick his entire head into his wife 's vagina in order to pleasure her .
He would also pick up strange men in dive bars and bring them to a motel room to have sex with her while he watched and joined in .
Pastor Steve Anderson of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Phoenix , Arizona , is a Christian now , and I doubt he does stuff like that anymore , so let 's not look down on him .
This is Zsuzsanna Anderson , wife of pastor Steve Anderson of Phoenix , Arizona .
She used to only be able to reach orgasm by shoving badgers into her vagina , but now she is a Christian and does n't do that anymore .
Here is a link to Zsuzsanna 's personal blog .
If you are looking for a blog about her crazy sexual habits , like how she has sex with her children and shoves badgers up her vagina you are out of luck because she is a Christian now and has n't done stuff like that in almost a year and a half , you sick bastards !
Hello friends .
As most of you know I was once a pornstar but now I am a True Christian™ .
My past life is full of disgusting stories of sexual perversion and immorality .
But I gave my life to Jesus and today I live a rich and fulfilling life with my devoted wife Olga , who I tragically struck blind with an errant cumshot .
My story is like that of most , if not all Born Again Christians : I was lost , I did some drugs , I had sex with a lot of women , then I had sex with a lot of men , then I did it with some children , then I did it with some animals , then I went back to women for a little bit but also did it with animals on the side , then I did it with men and some children , then I got a bunch of irreversible STDs and can no longer get an erection so I decided to give my life to Christ since I can't bone women or men or children or animals anymore .
I always take interest in stories like mine , and have worked tirelessly these last two years helping to bring lost people to Christ .
Today I was filled with joy as I found out that a couple of degenerates that I met a few years ago have found Christ and have been drenched in the blood of the Lord !
Below is the story of how I know these people , it is a bit graphic , so I suggest that women and children to not read it .
It was the day after Thanksgiving , 2006 .
I was in a dive bar in Tucson , can't remember what time it was , but it was dark outside .

This does n't bother me because I 've both done it in front of , and with children before .
Stupid husband nudges me : " Are you in the pictures ? " he asks .
I 'm not sure what he means .
He leans in with a big grin on his stupid face : " Dirty movies . "
He winks at me like we 're both in the know and operating on the same wavelength or something .
I tell him that I 'm in porn and he tells me that he recognized me back in the bar .
He likes my work .
He tells me about his wife , he does n't know how to pleasure her anymore , they go from bar to bar in the seediest parts of America looking for men that can quench her sexual appetite .
When he saw me , a famous male pornstar , he knew he needed to bring me back here to give his wife some hot dickings .
While I 've been talking with the husband , the wife has been getting undressed and is now completely naked on the bed .
She calls out to me and I turn around .
Holy shit .
What have I gotten myself into ?
Her vagina , or what was left of it , was like a cave in the side of a mountain , all agape .
The husband nudges me on the shoulder " sometimes I stick my entire head in there . "
I 'm too shocked to say anything .
" Get over here and spelunk my cave ! " she shouts at me , she then picks up a flashlight and shines it in there , it 's pretty deep .
I 'm having second thoughts now .
" You 'd better do what she says " the husband tells me .
Noticing my reluctance to get undressed the wife grabs the bag of cocaine and empties it into her gaping vagina .
" Come and get it !
" I comply and several minutes later I 'm trying to figure out how to have intercourse with this person .
I 'm a well - endowed man but this is like throwing a hot dog through a hula - hoop .
I can't generate any kind of friction what so ever .
The husband 's laughing at me .
" That shit 's been done , man .
It 's wrecked .
Try the ass . "
Her ass is n't much better , but it 's only as wide as two or three fists so I figure I have a better shot at it .
I go to work , in my cocaine - induced stupor , but nothing 's really happening .
The children are now awake and laughing at my incompetence .
" That 's not how you do it ! " the littlest one shouts .
The wife yawns .
" I grow weary of this , pleasure me ! " she shouts .
I study the situation .
I 've never experienced anything like this .
I look back at the husband and shrug .
He gives me a warm smile and offers to help .
Pretty soon the husband is naked and we 're both going at her , but not even two men can begin to fill this hole .
We begin shoving fists in there but it 's still very roomy .
Soon one of the sons joins in , then one of the daughters shoves a foot in there .
I black out .
When I come to The husband , one of the sons and myself are all having sex with the wife while a daughter shoves her leg in .
The youngest son has his head in her vagina , the husband and I are both fisting her and someone has jammed the television remote control and most of the bedside lamp in there as well .
There 's also the fat end of a Jack Daniels bottle rammed up her ass .
At one point one of her ovaries pops out and we take a quick pee break while she puts it back in .
Then we reassemble and start going at it again .
Meanwhile the remaining three or so children are having sex with each other on the bed .
But the wife was still bored .
" Cease this foolishness " she calls out , and slowly we all removed our appendages and body parts and heads and small electronics from her vagina .
The husband began weeping in the corner and the children got back in their bed .
" You 've tried your hardest , but obviously no man can ever satisfy me , you may help yourself to the cocaine mountain now . "
I look at the floor between the beds and notice a massive pile of cocaine about three and a half feet tall , how did I not see that before ?
I leap onto the pile and begin sucking as much up my nose as I can .
I momentarily look up at the ceiling and notice the wife now has a big burlap sack in her hands .
The bag is jerking around and moving like something is in it .
I sit up , covered in cocaine , and crawl back onto the bed to watch .
The wife reaches in to the bag , struggles momentarily , and pulls a full - grown badger out .
The badger claws at her arms , cutting them deep .
Blood sprays all over the bed .
The woman fights with the badger for several moments until she finally has it in the proper position .
She spreads her legs wide and shoves the badger head - first into her vagina .
She lets go and the badger , terrified , angry , and possibly high on cocaine , goes into a fit of rage .
It began clawing and shredding the inside of her vagina .
The wife , covered in deep wounds and spewing blood all over the bed cried in agonizing pleasure .
Blood drained from her vagina like a river and eventually the badger backed it 's way out all the way .
She then kicked it off the bed and it landed somewhere near the children .
She fell back into the mattress , drenched in blood , her loins looked like the mangled carcass of a zebra after a herd of lions had dismembered it , a pack of hyenas had scavenged it , and several vultures had picked it of its remains .
She breathed deeply , like she had just run a marathon , she had apparently climaxed five or six times .
I wanted more cocaine but the badger was under one of the beds and I was afraid to get off the bed .
Eventually we caught the badger and ate it for a late dinner .
The next morning I woke up before anyone else , got dressed and snuck out of the room before dawn .
What horrible people , I was glad to be out of their presence .
I caught a ride out of Tucson and never went back .
Soon after I found Jesus , quit the porn business and turned my life around completely .
No more promiscuous sex , no more drugs , no more anything !
I few months ago I was watching the television when I saw the husband , talking about this or that .
I recognized him instantly as the man from the motel .
I looked him up and sure enough it was the same man , still married to the same woman .
They apparently also found Jesus and started a church !
I would like to take a few moments of your time to praise God that Pastor Steve Anderson and his wife Zsuzsanna , as well as their children , have found the path to God .
Before I thought these people were incredibly sleazy degenerates , but now that I know that they are a Godly Christian family I feel that it is ok that , since they have repented and have sought forgiveness .
Pastor Steve Anderson of the Faithful Word Baptist Church in Phoenix , Arizona , is a Christian now , and I doubt he does stuff like that anymore , so let 's not look down on him .
Here is a link to Zsuzsanna 's personal blog .
http://stevenandersonfamily.blogspot.com/
It is mostly about Christianity and stuff like that .

A draft study by Amtrak of passenger rail service in the state includes an initial route with stops at downtown locations in Cleveland , Columbus , Dayton , Cincinnati and a couple of points in between .
Trains would stop six times a day in Cleveland and Cincinnati and eight times a day in Columbus .
Service could be up and running by 2011 .
SOURCE : Amtrak Passenger train service between Cleveland and Cincinnati would carry nearly half a million passengers a year , but cost more than $ 500 million to get under way , according to a study released Tuesday by Amtrak .
The initial proposal calls for six stations along the 255 - mile route -- two in Cleveland -- at the lakefront Amtrak station and at RTA 's transit station at West 150th Street and Puritas Avenue -- and in Columbus , Dayton , Sharonville , a northern Cincinnati suburb , and Cincinnati .
The service , which could start in two years , would leave Cleveland at 6:30 a.m. and arrive in Columbus at 9:53 a.m. , according to a proposed schedule .
The trains , run by Amtrak , would travel at 79 mph .
Ticket prices have not been determined .
But a one - way ticket from Cleveland to Cincinnati would cost $ 25.50 at the Amtrak average of 10 cents per mile , said Ken Prendergast , executive director of All Aboard Ohio , a nonprofit agency that promotes rail travel .
Four trains would cross the state daily on existing CSX and Norfolk Southern freight tracks , which would need to be improved , Amtrak said .
Two trains would be based in Columbus and one each in Cleveland and Cincinnati .
The state will use this feasibility study , along with public input and an environmental study , to apply to the Federal Railroad Administration for federal stimulus money to pay for the entire project .
Ohio cannot do the 3C project without that federal money .
But Ohio is not alone in seeking federal money .
Several hundred applications totaling more than $ 100 billion will compete for $ 8 billion in federal funds .
The application deadline is Oct. 2 .
The hope is that the 3C corridor would eventually fit into a larger national train network that would go west to Chicago and east to New York at a speed of 110 mph .
While the service is projected to generate $ 12 million annually in revenue , the state would need to provide $ 17 million yearly to subsidize operating costs , Amtrak said .
Ohio officials are optimistic and said the Amtrak study confirms the need for passenger rail .
" It shows that Ohioans really want this true travel choice , " said Scott Varner , spokesman for the Ohio Department of Transportation .
" With close to half a million potential riders it would make us the 12th largest passenger rail corridor in the country . "
Amtrak studied ridership , revenue and operating costs for the proposed 3C plan .
Varner said ODOT could help pay for the service with money from on - train advertising , franchise fees and from highway advertising .
Sen .
Tom Patton , a Strongsville Republican who heads the Senate 's Transportation Committee and has been critical of the 3C plan , questioned whether it's worth the state spending hundreds of millions on construction and tens of millions in annual subsidies for about 1,300 riders a day .
" We have a couple million people a day that ride commuter bus systems in this state , " Patton said .
" We need to address [ funding ] that because we have bus systems shutting down .
We should be taking a look at what 's in the best interests of the most amount of people . "
Varner said ODOT is studying ways to find more funds for bus service .
But the state has to invest in all modes of transportation .
The Amtrak report shows
Ohioans support passenger rail and nearly 6 million people live within 15 miles of the 3C route , he said .
" What we are seeing is the pent - up demand , " he said .

Plain Dealer reporter Aaron Marshall contributed to this story .
A host of evolutionary pressures at work that contributed to the development of lighter skin , but for now , scientists are n't sure exactly what produced white people .
Image
Humans come in a rainbow of hues , from dark chocolate browns to nearly translucent whites .
This full kaleidoscope of skin colors was a relatively recent evolutionary development , according to biologists , occuring alongside the migration of modern humans out of Africa between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago .
The consensus among scientists has always been that lower levels of vitamin D at higher latitudes — where the sun is less intense — caused the lightening effect when modern humans , who began darker - skinned , first migrated north .
But other factors might be at work , a new study suggests .
From the varying effects of frostbite to the sexual preferences of early men , a host of theories have been reviewed .
Vitamin iDea
Vitamin D plays an important role in bone growth and the body 's natural protection against certain diseases , and the inability to absorb enough in areas of less - powerful sunlight would have decreased life expectancies in our African ancestors .
The further north they trekked , the more vitamin D they needed and the lighter they got over the generations , due to natural selection .
This explanation accounts for the world 's gradients of skin color traveling south to north , the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency among African immigrants to higher latitudes , as well as the relatively darker skin of Canada 's Inuit peoples , who have good levels of vitamin D despite living in the Arctic , due to their diet rich in oily fish .
Sounds about right ... right ?
In fact , there might have been a number of concurrent evolutionary pressures at work that contributed to the development of lighter skin , according to a new study published in the August issue of the Journal of Photochemistry and Photobiology B : Biology .
“ In our opinion the vitamin D hypothesis is one of the most likely hypotheses responsible for skin lightening , although there still is no consensus about it , ” said study author Asta Juzeniene of the Oslo University Hospital in Oslo , Norway .
A number of competing theories were explained and evaluated by Juzeniene and her team , reopening a debate that remains one of the most interesting and controversial in biology .
Paling in comparison
Sexual selection may have played a role , for one , with males preferring paler skin in northern latitudes , the researchers surmised .
“ One of the hypotheses is that men seem to prefer women with a light skin color , which can be regarded as a sign of youth and fertility , ” Juzeniene told LiveScience .
“ Because light skin characterizes the early infant stage of primates , it may have become a visual cue that triggers appropriate adult behavior toward infants , i.e. decreased aggressiveness and increased desire to provide care and protection , ” she said .
As lighter skin became associated with increased health in northerly latitudes , men may have preferred mates with lighter skin and produced ever - paler generations .
Fertility and health statistics at different latitudes from a few thousand years ago are n't available , Juzeniene cautioned , however , so the theory is difficult to test .
Frostbite was another causal effect investigated by the researchers .
Some reports from American soldiers serving in the Korean War and elsewhere have indicated that dark skin is more prone to frostbite than white because it emits more heat .
In colder climates , evolution could have negatively selected for paler skin if frostbite was significant enough to perhaps kill darker - skinned children .
Despite the anecdotal evidence , there is not enough scientific data to support frostbite as a strong enough single factor to lighten skin in places such as Europe , the researchers said .
On the farm
Another possibility noted was the switch from subsistence - based economies to agriculture approximately 10,000 years ago , which eliminated vitamin D - rich food sources from the diet .
This would have had an especially potent effect in northern Europe , according to Juzeniene and her team .
“ Development of agriculture has occurred in several places , and did not necessarily lead to skin lightening if the ambient UVB [ ultraviolet light from the sun ] level was sufficiently high to allow adequate vitamin D synthesis .
Cold climates and high latitudes would speed up the need for skin lightening , ” however , if people were relying mainly on grains as a food source , the researchers wrote .
The main problem with this agriculture theory is that the switch from gathering to farming occurred relatively recently , and scientists question whether all of the evolutionary changes associated with skin color could have happened so quickly .
Skin lightening could also have been accelerated by something as simple as genetic drift , making it “ easier ” for a pale skin mutations to succeed in northern latitudes .
Though other elements may have come into play and need to be examined further , vitamin D remains the most likely explanation , Juzeniene stressed , especially given its role in overall health .
“ If we assume that vitamin D does not play any role in the development of human skin color , neither white nor dark , many people in the world would suffer from vitamin D deficiency , ” she said .
While people of all skin types have the ability to produce the same amount of vitamin D in their systems , “ highly pigmented people will need to stay in the sun around 6 times longer than light people in order to synthesize the same amount of vitamin D , ” Juzeniene said , and a lack of the vitamin — something occurring among many American children right now , partly because they do n't get out much — can make humans more susceptible to everything from heart disease to internal cancers .
Since the addition of i386 and x86_64 to the Mac OS ’s repertoire several years back , remembering which registers are used for what has become difficult , and this can complicate the debugging of code for which you have no symbols .
So here is my cheat - sheet ( posted here , mostly so that I can find it again without google - ing for old mailing list posts ; but , I figure someone else may find it useful as well ) :
arm ( before prolog )
$ r0 ➡ arg0 ( self )
➡ arg0 ( self ) $ r1 ➡ arg1 ( _cmd )
➡ arg1 ( _cmd ) $ r2 ➡ arg2
➡ arg2 $ r3 ➡ arg3
➡ arg3 *( $sp ) ➡ arg4

➡ arg5 *( $ sp+8 ) ➡ arg6

$ r3 ➡ arg0 ( self )
➡ arg0 ( self ) $ r4 ➡ arg1 ( _cmd )
➡ arg1 ( _cmd ) $ r5 ➡ arg2
➡ arg2 $ r6 ➡ arg3
➡ arg3 $ r7 ➡ arg4
➡ arg4 $ r8 ➡ arg5
i386 ( before prolog )
*( $esp+4n ) ➡ arg ( n )
➡ arg ( n ) *( $esp ) ➡ arg0 ( self )
➡ arg0 ( self ) *( $esp+4 ) ➡ arg1 ( _cmd )
➡ arg1 ( _cmd ) *( $esp+8 ) ➡ arg2
➡ arg2 *( $esp+12 ) ➡ arg3

➡ arg4 *( $esp+20 ) ➡ arg5
i386 ( after prolog )
*( $ebp+8+4n ) ➡ arg ( n )
➡ arg (n ) *( $ebp+4 ) ➡ Return addr
➡ Return addr *( $ebp+8 ) ➡ arg0 ( self )
➡ arg0 ( self ) *( $ebp+12 ) ➡ arg1 ( _cmd )
➡ arg1 ( _cmd ) *( $ebp+16 ) ➡ arg2
➡ arg2 *( $ebp+20 ) ➡ arg3
➡ arg3 *( $ebp+24 ) ➡ arg4

➡ arg1 ( _cmd ) $rdx ➡ arg2
➡ arg2 $rcx ➡ arg3
➡ arg3 $ r8 ➡ arg4
➡ arg4 $ r9 ➡ arg5
So , if you have a method defined as :
-( id ) method : ( id ) foo bar : ( id ) bar baz :( id) baz
you can print each of the parameters with :
arm ppc/ppc64 x86_64 i386 ( before prolog ) i386 ( after prolog ) self po $ r0 po $ r3 po $rdi po *( id * ) ( $esp ) po *( id * ) ( $ebp+8 ) _cmd p ( SEL ) $ r1 p ( SEL ) $ r4 p ( SEL ) $rsi p *( SEL * ) ( $esp+4 ) p *( SEL * ) ( $ebp+12 ) foo po $ r2 po $ r5 po $ rdx po *( id * ) ( $esp+8 ) po *( id * ) ( $ebp+16 ) bar po $ r3 po $ r6 po $rcx po *( id * ) ( $esp+12 ) po *( id * ) ( $ebp+20 ) baz po *( id * ) ( $ sp ) po $ r7 po $ r8 po *( id * ) ( $esp+16 ) po *( id * ) ( $ebp+24 )
As Blake mentioned in his comment , on i386 , if you ’re at the beginning of a function or method , before the prolog has executed ( i.e. the bit of code responsible for saving registers , adjusting the stack pointer , etc. ) , then ebp wo n’t have been set up for you yet .
So , I ’ve amended the above table .
That complexity is another reason I long for the simplicity of PowerPC asm , not to mention M68 k asm ; at least x86_64 has made the step towards using registers for parameters where possible .
Edited to add :
In case it is n’t obvious , these particular stack offsets and registers assignments only make sense when dealing with pointer and integer parameters and return values .
When structures and floating point values come into the mix , things can get more complicated .
Edited to add : I ’ve added registers / stack offsets for arm .
But note that these are for before the prolog has executed .
Arm code seems much looser about what happens in its function prologs , so there really is n’t a standard layout post - prolog

“ Memory disorders affect many people who never played football or other sports , ” Mr. Aiello said .
“ We are trying to understand it as it relates to our retired players . ”
As scrutiny of brain injuries in football players has escalated the past three years , with prominent professionals reporting cognitive problems and academic studies supporting a link more generally , the N.F.L. and its medical committee on concussions have steadfastly denied the existence of reliable data on the issue .
The league pledged to pursue its own studies , including the one at the University of Michigan .
Dr. Ira Casson , a co-chairman of the concussions committee who has been the league ’s primary voice denying any evidence connecting N.F.L. football and dementia , said : “ What I take from this report is there ’s a need for further studies to see whether or not this finding is going to pan out , if it ’s really there or not .
I can see that the respondents believe they have been diagnosed .
But the next step is to determine whether that is so . ”
The N.F.L. is conducting its own rigorous study of 120 retired players , with results expected within a few years .
All neurological examinations are being conducted by Dr. Casson .
According to a 37 - page synopsis of the study furnished to the league , the Michigan researchers conducted a phone survey in late 2008 in which 1,063 retired players  those who participated from an original random list of 1,625  were asked questions on a variety of health topics .
Players had to have played at least three or four seasons to qualify .
Questions were derived from the standard National Health Interview Survey so rates could be compared with those previously collected from the general population , the report said .
Some health issues were reported by N.F.L. retirees at normal rates ( kidney and prostate problems ) , while others were higher ( sleep apnea and elevated cholesterol ) and others lower ( heart attacks and ulcers ) , the summary said .
Previous chapter : ACTS / PPTS development during 2008
PPTS is the Russian abbreviation of " Perspektivnaya Pilotiruemaya Transportnaya Sistema " or " Prospective Piloted Transport System . "
The goal of the project was to develop a new - generation spacecraft to replace the venerable Soyuz .
By the beginning of 2009 , upon abandoning plans for cooperation on the project with Europe , Russia 's federal space agency , Roskosmos , ordered the industry to finalize proposals for the new manned spacecraft .
During the first quarter of 2009 , Roskosmos finalized its requirements for the next - generation manned spacecraft and the agency was ready to finally name the prime - developer of the vehicle .
Formally , only the two organizations that were capable of developing manned space vehicles competed in the government tender to build the new spacecraft -- RKK Energia in Korolev and Moscow - based GKNPTs Khrunichev .
Although the run up to the tender was conducted behind closed doors , a number of Russian officials made statements hinting about the various stages of the project .
On January 21 , 2009 , the head of Roskosmos , Anatoly Perminov , told Rossiyskaya Gazeta that Russia would likely proceed with the independent development of the next - generation manned spacecraft .
According to Perminov , the agency and its main research and certification center -- TsNIIMash -- had already conducted an expanded meeting of the Scientific and Technical Council , NTS , to examine follow - on transport systems , including the next - generation manned ship .
It would be followed by a government tender to select a developer for the new vehicle .
The new spacecraft would be expected to enter service within the same timeframe as the US Orion vehicle , however a more detailed development plan would be ready with the preliminary design of the vehicle in the middle of 2010 , Perminov said .
( 321 )
On January 29 , 2009 , Aleksei Krasnov , the head of manned space flight at Roskosmos , confirmed that a second government tender for the development of the next - generation spacecraft would be initiated in 2009 .
( In 2006 , three Russian companies competed in an aborted government tender . )
Agency requirements for PPTS spacecraft
In the first quarter of 2009 , Roskosmos released requirements , which were used in the development of the Technical Assignment ( TZ ) to the industry working on the PPTS project .
The document asked the industry to develop a vehicle matching similar " foreign " ( meaning American ) spacecraft in its technical capabilities and cost , while at the same time , using existing technologies as much as possible .
Spacecraft versions
Roskosmos envisioned several modifications of the spacecraft : an Earth - orbiting version that could fly 30 - day - long autonomous missions , or year - long missions while docked to the ISS in an orbit with an inclination 51.6 degrees or to the future Russian space station launched from Vostochny into a 51.8 - degree orbit .
A lunar version could fly 14 - days missions to orbit around the Moon , or stay docked to the lunar orbital station , LOS , for up to 200 days .
( This requirement hinted about the possible long - term plans of the Russian space agency for lunar exploration ) .
The spacecraft could serve as a manned transport vehicle , or as an unmanned cargo ship .
Earth orbit ( station ) Lunar orbit version Earth orbit ( autonomous mission ) Cargo version Crew size 6 4 4 0 Cargo ( delivery and return ) 500 kilograms 100 kilograms ?
2,000 kg up ; 500 kg down Autonomous flight duration 5 days 14 days 30 days - Flight duration , when docked to the station 365 days 200 days - - Mass 12 tons 16.5 tons - -
Roskosmos also requested the industry to evaluate the possibility of launching a baseline modification of the spacecraft into a near - polar orbit with an inclination 73.2 degrees toward the Equator .
The agency specified that a single cosmonaut had to be able to conduct all flight operations from a single work seat , while two equally equipped work stations would be available in the cockpit to control the vehicle .
The agency also specified that g-loads on the crew should not exceed the following parameters :
Nominal orbit insertion 4.0 Nominal reentry into the Earth atmosphere 3.0 During descent with maximum lateral maneuver 5.0 During the firing of the emergency escape system following a launch vehicle failure 7.0 During atmospheric reentry following the emergency escape system firing 12.0
The crew capsule had to have the capability to conduct an emergency return to Earth either from orbit , or during a powered flight to orbit , with the ability to touch down in any season on any unprepared piece of land or at sea .
As of March 2009 , the agency " relaxed " the accuracy of the crew capsule landing on the Russian territory to 10 kilometers from the previous two kilometers , while directing the industry to continue studying various modes of high - precision landing .
Emergency escape and landing capabilities were mandated for every phase of the mission and had to provide the survivability of the crew until the arrival of the rescue and recovery teams .
Like the Soyuz , the vehicle would have to be able to conduct fully automated and manual docking and have enough propulsion capabilities during transport missions to dock and re-dock with orbital stations , low - orbital platforms , unmanned spacecraft and modules and then to provide for the safe return of the reentry vehicle to Earth .
The reentry capsule could only employ environmentally safe propellants during the atmospheric phase of the flight .
Roskosmos said that " in case of reuse " of the reentry vehicle it had to be able to fly up to 10 missions during its 15 - year life span .
Autonomous missions
Roskosmos said that during its 30 - day autonomous mission , the spacecraft should have the capabilities to accomplish following tasks :
service unmanned spacecraft and platforms ;
remove failed spacecraft and " space junk " fragments from orbit ;
conduct experiments and research with various payloads ;
test technologies for remote sensing and early warning of large - scale emergency situations and natural disasters ;
conduct dual - purpose and military application missions ;
Lunar mission scenario
The ultimate purpose of the PPTS vehicle would remain the support of lunar expeditions .
As of the beginning of 2009 , planners saw the lunar mission scenario as following :
The launch of the manned spacecraft , PK , with a crew of four , along with the RB acceleration stage from Vostochny into low Earth orbit with an altitude of 200 kilometers ;
The acceleration stage fires its engine to add 3,220 meters per second to the velocity of the spacecraft to escape the Earth orbit and send the manned spacecraft toward the Moon ;
The acceleration stage fires its engine , delivering an impulse of around 1,300 meters per second to insert the manned spacecraft into lunar orbit with an altitude of 100 kilometers ;
The manned spacecraft separates from the acceleration stage in lunar orbit ;
The manned spacecraft docks to the unmanned lunar landing and takeoff craft , VPK ;
The crew transfers to VPK , undocks and conducts a lunar landing ;
The VPK takes off from the lunar surface ;
The manned transport ship docks to VPK
The crew transfers from VPK to PK ; VPK and PK separate ; ( the transport ship 's propulsion system is expected to deliver around 100 meters per second in total maneuvers in lunar orbit ) ;
The PK fires its engine delivering around 1,280 meters per second to leave lunar orbit and head toward Earth ;
PK conducts orbit correction to obtain the correct approach for reentry ;
The crew capsule and propulsion module separate and reenter the Earth atmosphere ;
The crew capsule conducts landing in southern Russia in the border region with Kazakhstan ;
Development of the PTK NP ( PPTS ) vehicle
The preliminary development of the PPTS spacecraft was expected to take place from March 2009 until June 2010 at an estimated cost of around 800 million rubles ( or around $ 24 million ) .
( Although a seemingly modest amount , it was a considerable progress in comparison to the 50 million rubles allocated to the previous tender , according to Russian space officials ) .
The work apparently covered only the Earth - orbiting version of the spacecraft , although laying the foundation for a lunar orbiting spacecraft , or even a Mars - bound crew vehicle to be developed later .
In April 2008 , Gazeta .ru quoted Valery Ryumin , deputy designer general at RKK Energia , as saying that available funding was 30 percent less than was required for the development .
During the Paris Air and Space Show in Le Bourget in June 2009 , the head of RKK Energia , Vitaly Lopota , echoed this statement in an interview with the editor of this web site .
" We only got half of what would be needed for a truly preliminary design , " Lopota said , " A preliminary design is more than a paper study , in fact , a great deal of experimentation should be done before the general architecture of the system can emerge , as we saw it with [ NASA 's ]
Orion spacecraft . "
Lopota said that federal government had so far provided little or no money for neccessary experimental work .
With the government tender completed on April 6 , 2009 , RKK Energia officially started the preliminary design of the vehicle .
At the time , the company 's representatives identified the new vehicle as Pilotiruemyi Transportny Korabl Novogo Pokoleniya , or PTK NP , or New Generation Piloted Transport Ship .
Around the same time , the head of RKK Energia Vitaly Lopota dubbed the vehicle Rus ( archaic name of Russia ) .
While he warned that the name was provisional , some Russian media outlets used it in their news stories .
If accepted , it would continue a confusing Russian tradition of giving the rocket and the spacecraft the same name .
To make matters worse , in the Russian language , the word " Rus " is feminine , while the word " spacecraft " is masculine .
Lopota promised to involve GKNPTs Khrunichev in the development of the future spacecraft , as well as other Russian companies which could offer the best cutting - edge technologies .
He also warned that until the completion of the preliminary design , RKK Energia would not release much details about the project .
Privately , RKK Energia officials said that their leadership 's reluctance to publicize the new spacecraft grew out of fiasco in the Kliper project , which was widely advertised in the press , only to be subsequently rejected by the Russian government .
Lopota did disclose , however , that despite a superficial resemblance to the US Orion spacecraft , the Russian vehicle would have distinct features , reflecting Russia 's particular geographic situation .
It was a clear hint about the rocket - powered landing system without the use of a parachute , which was considered for the new spacecraft .
In a previous interview to Rossiskaya Gazeta , Lopota had stressed that the provision of launching and landing the spacecraft on the Russian territory would be decisive in determining its design .

The rocket - powered landing was seen as the solution to the technical challenge of directing the vehicle into the narrow swaths of land in southern Russia which would be within reach of the vehicle when returning from orbits with an inclination of 51.7 degrees .
In turn , the orbital inclination was dictated by the geographical position of the launch site in Vostochny .
In all , RKK Energia was given around seven years to build the spacecraft and , just a few days after the April 6 announcement , the head of Roskosmos , Anatoly Perminov , was quoted as saying that the first mission of the new ship would take place in 2017 , or one year ahead of the previously quoted schedule .
This " advance " coincided with another quote attributed to Perminov that Russia and the US were going " nose to nose " in their lunar landing efforts .
To prepare for the new expanded manned space program , RKK Energia was conducting the construction of a new factory building and facilities for the manufacturing of reentry vehicles and other composite - made structures , unofficial reports said .
The company also purchased a 15 - meter high , six meters in diameter high - pressure steam oven known as an autoclave in Germany for coating reentry vehicles with thermal protection layers .
Added to the existing infrastructure , the new manufacturing facilities would enable RKK Energia to roll out up to 10 reentry vehicles per year , beginning in 2010 .
This new manufacturing infrastructure would help satisfy an increased demand for the Soyuz spacecraft in the ISS program , but also provide manufacturing capabilities for the future larger reentry vehicles and other components made of composite materials .
In the meantime , NITs RKP test center ( former NIIKhIMash ) said that its VK600/300 chamber in the town of Peresvet would be the only suitable facility for thermal and vacuum testing of a full - scale , next - generation spacecraft .
MAKS - 2009
By mid-summer 2009 , Russian space officials decided to break their silence on the PPTS project and unveil the future spacecraft at the Moscow air and space show , MAKS , in August 2009 , along with details of a grand 30 - year plan for space exploration developed by the TsNIIMash research institute .
A joint exhibit of companies subordinated to Roskosmos at MAKS - 2009 displayed scaled models of the PTK NP spacecraft and its launch vehicle .
The show coincided with several articles in Russian trade publications by key figures at RKK Energia .
The PTK model revealed reusable thermal protective tiles on the crew module , instead of a traditional ablative system which burns away in layers during reentry into the Earth atmosphere .
Ironically , the Russian decision to employ tile - based thermal protection was taking place at the time , when NASA was returning to the use of the Apollo - era ablative system on its next - generation Orion spacecraft , while the tile - covered Space Shuttle was heading to retirement in 2010 .
Six windows on either side of the crew module , which had been seen in earlier drawings , were either omitted from the model or , more likely , dropped from the design .
Otherwise , at least three of those windows would end up in the area of maximum heat loads during reentry .
The model also sported movable aerodynamic flaps at the top of the crew module , which could be used to steer the capsule as soon as it reached the discernable atmosphere on its way from orbit .
The crew capsule would still have thrusters burning environmentally neutral gaseous oxygen and ethyl alcohol to maneuver beyond the atmosphere .

The head of RKK Energia , Vitaly Lopota , also confirmed at MAKS - 2009 that rocket - assisted landing with solid - propellant engines was still considered as the prime mode of return to Earth for the PTK NP spacecraft , ( 351 ) although sources within the industry said that debate was raging on the validity of such an approach .
The PTK NP model at MAKS - 2009 also revealed that rotating solar arrays had replaced the fixed panels which had appeared in previous depictions of the vehicle .
Combined with the use of more efficient power - generating cells and new - generation lithium batteries , the ship 's power supply system would have greater capability than that of Soyuz . ( 357 )
Traditional orbital rendezvous antennas were nowhere to be seen on the model , giving way to compact sensors , likely employing lasers to guide the vehicle to docking .
( 356 )
The spacecraft would also use new high - performance flight control computers capable of receiving and processing navigational data from a GLONASS satellite network , along with information from high - precision gyroscopes and optical sensors .
A special movable antenna in the tail section of the service module would enable the spacecraft to maintain uninterrupted contact with ground control via special data - relay satellites .
Two - way communications between the spacecraft and Earth would be consolidated into a single secured digital data stream , adaptable for quick deciphering , distribution and storage .
The crew cabin would be equipped with liquid - crystal displays and customizable software .

Tory leader David Cameron said an online campaign defending the NHS from attacks in America showed how proud Britons were of the service .
Gordon and Sarah Brown were among thousands of people who posted messages of support on social networking site Twitter after the NHS was condemned by Republicans as " evil and Orwellian " .
Health Secretary Andy Burnham also offered support - although he risked embroiling himself in controversy by joking he was more interested in his football team than the NHS .

In an email to Conservative Party workers published on his blog , Mr Cameron said millions of people , including his own family , were grateful for care they had received from the NHS .
He wrote : " Just look at all the support which the NHS has received on Twitter over the last couple of days .
It is a reminder - if one were needed - of how proud we in Britain are of the NHS . "
President Barack Obama 's plans for reforming healthcare have sparked a furious row on the other side of the Atlantic .
Opponents have warned that the changes will " socialise " the system , and could even lead to panels deciding whether the elderly deserve life - saving treatment .
Tory MEP Daniel Hannan was slapped down by his party after joining the attacks on the NHS in a US television interview last week , where he said he " would n't wish it on anybody " .
Shadow Health Secretary Andrew Lansley said the MEP had done the NHS and Americans a disservice by presenting a " negative and partial view " .
The £ welovetheNHS campaign was launched by Britons keen to counter the allegations , and the sheer number of messages added apparently crashed the Twitter site on Wednesday .

UK politicians are generally wary of wading into domestic policy rows in the US .
But among the missives was one from Downing Street stating : " PM : NHS often makes the difference between pain and comfort , despair and hope , life and death .
Thanks for always being there . "
Mr Brown 's wife added her own comment , saying : " £welovetheNHS - more than words can say . "
A message posted on Mr Burnham 's behalf by Downing Street said : " Andy Burnham :
Over the moon about strong support for NHS - an institution I will defend to my dying day , 2nd only to Everton FC . "
Renowned physicist Stephen Hawking , who has motor neurone disease , rejected criticism of the NHS yesterday as he collected America 's highest civilian honour , the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
" I would n't be here today if it were not for the NHS , " Prof Hawking said .
Prof Hawking was commenting after one US commentator suggested he would be left to die under the UK system .
The claim , in an editorial on Wednesday for Investor 's Business Daily , was later corrected after the newspaper realised that the renowned scientist was born , lives and works in the UK .
Mr Burnham said later : " I am exceptionally proud that Britain has a world class National Health Service which treats people on the basis of clinical need - irrespective of their ability to pay .
" The global groundswell we have seen on Twitter about this and the pride and strength of feeling in some of the posts is testament to its remarkable achievements . "
Mr Lansley told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme that the NHS could set examples for America 's healthcare system .
But he also suggested that elements of the US model could be used to improve the NHS .
Stressing Conservative " support " for the NHS and its values , Mr Lansley said : " I think it 's very important for people in America to understand that the NHS has very powerful examples that they can look to .
" In this country we have a degree of equity of access to healthcare which many in America envy .
" What we need in this country , which I think Americans are very keen to retain in their healthcare system , is the ability of patients to exercise more control over their own healthcare and to make decisions about their healthcare , and to choose who provides their healthcare .
" In my view , there is no reason why the NHS in this country can't take that on board - that we can have a publicly - funded system that is true to its values but the service that 's provided is far more responsive to patients . "

AJAX applications are wonderful because they allow richer web applications with much of the data being brought down asynchronously .
The rich and responsive user interfaces of applications like Google Maps and Google Docs are excellent but JavaScript developers need to walk a fine line .
The more code they download , the richer the UI they can support and the less synchronous server interactions they need .
But , the more code they download , the slower the application can be to start .
This is particularly noticeable when the client cache is cold and in mobile applications with restricted bandwidth back to the server .
Years ago profile directed code reorganization ( a sub-class of Basic Block Transforms ) were implemented to solve what might appear to be an unrelated problem .
The problem tackled by these profile directed basic block reorganizations is decreasing the number of last level cache misses in a server .
They do this by organizing frequently accessed code segments together and moving rarely executed code segments .
The biggest gain is that seldom executed error handling code can be moved away from frequently executed application code .
I ’ve seen reports of error handling code making up more than 40 % of an application .
Moving this code away from the commonly executed mainline code allows fewer processor cache lines to support program execution which demands fewer memory faults .
Error handling code will execute more slowly but that is seldom an issue .
Profile directed basic block transforms need to be trained on “ typical ” applications workloads and code that typically executes together will be placed together .
Unfortunately , “ typical ” is often an important , industry standard benchmark like TPC-C so sometimes “ typical ” is replaced by “ important ” :-) .
Nonetheless , the tools are effective and greater than 20 % improvement is common and we often see much more .
All commercial database servers use or misuse profile directed basic block reorganizations .
The JavaScript download problem is actually very similar to the problem addressed by basic block transforms .
Getting code from the server takes relatively long time just as getting code from memory takes a long time relative to executing code already in the processor cache .
Much of the application does n’t execute in the common case so it makes little sense to download it all unless needed in this execution .
Most of the code is n’t needed to start the application so it ’s a big win to download the code , start the application , and then download what is needed in the background .
Last week Ben Livshits and Emre Kiciman of the Microsoft Research team released an interesting tool that does exactly this for JavaScript applications .
Doloto analyses client JavaScript systems and breaks them up into a series of independent modules .
The primary module is downloaded first and includes just stubs for the other modules .
This primary module is smaller , downloads faster , and dramatically improves time to live application .
In the Doloto team measurements , the size of the initial download was only between 20 % and 60 % of the size of the standard download .
In the case of Google docs , the initial download was less than 20 % of the original size .
Once the initial module is downloaded , the application is live and running and the rest of the modules are brought down asynchronously or faulted in as needed .
Many applications due these optimizations manually but this is a nice automated approach to the problem
I ’ve seen 80,000 line JavaScript programs and there are many out there far larger .
Getting the application running fast dramatically improves the user experience and this is a nice approach to achieving that goal .

The UK has the highest rate of teenage drunkenness
Young teenagers in the UK are more likely to get drunk than anywhere else in the industrial world , shows an international survey .
Girls in particular have pushed up this level of drunkenness in the UK , says a report from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
Among 15 - year - olds , girls are more likely to have been drunk than boys .
But the report also says young people in the UK are materially well - off and enjoy a " high quality of school life " .
The report , Doing Better for Children , compares the well - being of young people living in the leading industrial economies .
Growing up
This wide - ranging international study shows young people in the UK enjoying generous support as they grow up - with above - average state funding , a high quality of school life , below - average child poverty and low levels of bullying .
YOUNG PEOPLE'S WELL - BEING
Worst drunkenness : UK Highest rate of bullying : Turkey Most affluent : Norway Best education : Finland Best local environment : Australia Least exercise : Switzerland Best housing : Norway Least risk : Sweden Highest suicide rate : New Zealand Enjoy school most : Turkey Enjoy school least : Czech Republic
Most separated parents : United States Fewest separated parents : Italy
But in their personal lives , the UK youngsters are characterised by alcohol abuse and high rates of teenage pregnancy .
Parents in England , Scotland and Wales are also among the most likely to have separated - with the United States having the lowest proportion of children living with both parents .
Drunkenness in the UK is the highest among 24 OECD countries , measured in terms of the proportion of 13 and 15 - year - olds having been drunk at least twice .
The UK 's figure for these under - age drunks - 33 % - is more than double the rate for countries such as the United States , France and Italy .
Among girls the gap between the UK and other countries is even wider .
One in five 13 - year - olds in the UK reports having been drunk twice - four times higher than countries such as the United States , Sweden and the Netherlands .
Among 15 - year - old girls in the UK , 50 % reported getting drunk , almost three times higher than their counterparts in France .
The rate for boys in the UK in this age group getting drunk is 44 % .
Risk - taking
" The difference in the UK is the high level of risk taking , " says report co-author , Dominic Richardson .
As well as young people getting drunk more often there are also unusually high rates of teenage pregnancy , he says .
This is despite a background of increased spending on young people - and relatively strong educational performance .
" It shows that tackling child poverty is not a magic bullet .
Children who are from well - off homes can still have problems , " he says .
In terms of abusing alcohol , he says the difference might be the context in which young people first experiment with drink .
In France or Italy , youngsters might try drinks in a family environment - where they are less likely to get drunk .
In the UK , they might be drinking with other teenagers .
" It 's down to sensible teaching , " he says .
The figures on teenage drinking used by the OECD were gathered in 2005 - 06 .
More recent figures from the NHS , published in July , suggest that more 11 to 15 - year - olds are not drinking any alcohol - but those who do drink are consuming more .
' Responsible lives '
While the OECD highlights the problems with drinking and teenage pregnancy , it also presents a positive picture of the support available to people growing up in the UK .
It says that relative to other countries , children here are " materially fairly well - off " .
And that " average family income is higher and child poverty is lower than OECD averages " .
It says that children in the UK also enjoy a high quality of school life and enjoy school much more than many of their international counterparts .
Also bullying is less frequent and teenage suicides are less common in the UK than in most other industrialised countries .
England 's Children 's Minister Dawn Primarolo said it was " disappointing to see the UK rated so low for risky behaviours " .
But she said efforts to encourage more young people to lead " healthy , safe , fulfilled and responsible lives " were beginning to show results .
" Recent statistics have shown encouraging decreases in teenage conceptions during the first half of 2008 , that fewer teenagers than ever before are choosing to drink alcohol and we know that drug use among young people is falling . "
The minister also said she was " delighted to see that the record investment in education is paying off with the UK performing substantially better than the OECD average for quality of school life " .
Shadow Schools Minister Nick Gibb said : " The low levels of social mobility and high levels of inequality are a serious cause for concern . "

Dr. Lixia Yang ( above ) and her co-author , Ralf Krampe of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development , Germany , found that seniors were able to retain 50 per cent of concepts they learned almost a year before .
That old saying , “ your mind as is sharp as a steel trap ” , seems to hold true for seniors well into their 80s , according to a new study by led by a Ryerson University researcher .
In a study published in the August issue of the Journal of Gerontology : Psychological Sciences , Dr. Lixia Yang of Ryerson University and her co-author , Ralf Krampe of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development , Germany , found that seniors were able to retain 50 per cent of concepts they learned almost a year ago .
“ This finding was astonishing , ” says Dr. Yang , who is the study ’s lead author and heads up the Cognitive Aging Lab at Ryerson ’s Department of Psychology .
“ We always assumed that seniors would have great difficulty in grasping new concepts and maintaining what they ’ve learned .
But our research demonstrates this is not always the case . ”
Forty - seven seniors in their 70s and 80s completed a series of tests that measured three areas that normally decline with age : reasoning , processing speed and visual attention .
They then repeated the same tests eight months later in a follow - up study .
For example , to test the older adults ’ visual attention , one test involved finding “ target ” letters , like the letter “ D ” with dots above and below , among other letters with similar patterns as fast as possible .
“ This study suggests that seniors ’ minds are still sharp , and they can be productive members of the workplace , as long as they receive appropriate training , ” says Dr. Yang .

The scale of mankind 's impact on the globe is becoming more and more apparent :
We have achieved a species extinction rate to rival great extinction events of all geologic time as well as a rapidly acidifying ocean , dwindling ice caps , and even sinking river deltas , a new study from scientists at the University of Colorado at Boulder reveals .
No wonder then that some geologists and other scientists have dubbed the modern epoch the Anthropocene .
And now an international group of 28 scientists has taken a preliminary stab at setting some concrete environmental thresholds for the planet .
Johan Rockström of Stockholm University and his colleagues are proposing nine " planetary boundaries " in this week 's Nature .
( Scientific American is part of the Nature Publishing Group . )
Ranging from climate change to chemical pollution , the boundaries are meant to set thresholds , or safe limits , for natural systems with respect to human impact .
" We have reached the planetary stage of sustainability , where we are fiddling with hard - wired processes at the global Earth - system scale , " Rockström says .
" What are the Earth - system processes that determine the ability of the [ planet ] to remain in a stable state ? "
The research takes as its desired stable state the Holocene epoch , the 10,000 years since the last ice age during which human civilization has flourished , and attempts to identify the key variables that might push planetary cycles past safe thresholds .
So , for example , the key variable for climate change is atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration as well as its attendant rise in the amount of trapped heat .
At present , atmospheric CO 2 has reached more than 387 parts per million ( ppm ) , well above the preindustrial figure of 280 ppm .
So , the estimated safe threshold identified by the scientists , including NASA climatologist James Hansen , is 350 ppm , or a total increased warming of one watt per meter squared ( current warming is roughly 1.5 watts per meter squared ) .
" We begin to quantify , very roughly , where we think these thresholds might be .
All have huge error bars , " says ecologist Jonathan Foley director of the University of Minnesota 's Institute on the Environment , one of the authors .
" We do n't know exactly how many parts per million it would take to stop climate change , but we think it starts at about 350 ppm . "
Along with the climate change boundary , humanity has already pushed past the safe threshold in two more of the nine identified boundaries — biodiversity loss and available nitrogen ( thanks to modern fertilizers ) .
And , unfortunately , many of the processes impact each other , as well .
" Crossing one threshold makes the others more vulnerable , " Foley adds .
For example , " biodiversity [ loss ] on a really hot planet is accelerated . "
Earth System Threshold Measure Boundary Current Level Preindustrial

Biodiversity Loss Extinction Rate 10 pm > 100 pm * 0.1 - one pm

In associated commentaries published online this week in Nature Reports Climate Change , several scientists criticize the precise thresholds set , although they laud the effort .
Biogeochemist William Schlesinger of the Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies argues that the limits on phosphorus fertilizer are too lenient and can allow " pernicious , slow and diffuse degradation to persist nearly indefinitely . "
Allowing human water use , largely for agriculture , to expand from 2,600 cubic kilometers today to 4,000 cubic kilometers in the future will allow further degradation at such environmental disaster sites as the drying Aral Sea in Asia and seven major rivers , including the Colorado in the U.S. , that no longer reach the sea , notes David Molden , deputy director general for research at the International Water Management Institute in Sri Lanka .
Even the 350 - ppm limit for carbon dioxide is " questionable , " says physicist Myles Allen of the Climate Dynamics Group at the University of Oxford , and focusing instead on keeping cumulative emissions below one trillion metric tons might make more sense , which would mean humanity has already used up more than half of its overall emissions budget .
And such efforts to set thresholds have a mixed track record .
For instance , the " limits to growth " argument put forward by the Club of Rome in 1972 failed to materialize , thanks in part to some of the innovations listed here , such as increased nitrogen use in industrial agriculture .
" A big part of this is feeding 6.7 billion people , " Foley says .
" We are heading towards nine billion who are going to want to eat more like people in the developed world , and there 's the specter of biofuels .
Those boundaries look really fragile . "
Most importantly , however , regardless of impacts on the planet , the human condition has likely never been better in terms of material prosperity .
The question is : " How do you continue to improve the human condition ? "
Foley asks .
" How can we sustain a world that will reach nine billion people without destroying the planet ?
At least knowing a bit where the danger zones are is a really important first step . "
There are grounds for hope .
Humanity has crossed one of these thresholds before — diminishing levels of stratospheric ozone due to emissions of ozone - destroying chemicals ( the " ozone hole " ) — and pulled back through international cooperation and the 1989 Montreal Protocol .
" We did manage to move ourselves away from the ozone boundary and have made serious efforts at regional levels to protect biodiversity ; reduce agricultural pollution , aerosols and water demand ; and slow land conversion , " says environmental scientist Diana Liverman of the University of Arizona 's Institute for the Environment and Society , one of the new thresholds authors .
" This provides some hope that we can manage our planetary impact if we choose . "

" Maybe the ones who have said that I 'm done are right .
Obviously , I can't break my mental block in the Octagon .
Besides , I 've been training like a spartan for 20 years now -- my body is worn out .
The years caught up to me , I 've been worn out .... [ Junior dos Santos ] won that fight and would have won it by decision .
Simply put , he is younger , more hungry , more aggressive .
He wanted to win a lot more ....

I almost fell down trying to do the left high kick .
But I 'm not looking for an alibi .

Maybe I should 've quit after I won the open weight grand prix . "
Legendary mixed martial arts fighter , Mirko Cro Cop , reflects on his submission ( verbal ) loss to Junior dos Santos at UFC 103 : " Franklin vs. Belfort " from the American Airlines Center in Dallas , Texas , on Sept. 19 .
He was beaten to the punch , and pretty much beat up , in what essentially turned out to be a striking match for two - plus rounds .
The Croatian waved off the Brazilian in the third after eating a brutal knee to the face that wiped out his vision .
It marked his third loss inside the Octagon in five attempts -- a far cry from the world beater who was scalping his opponents just three years ago under the Pride FC banner .
In fact , he has not defeated a top - level fighter he made Josh Barnett quit at " Final Conflict Absolute , " which earned him the Pride FC 2006 Open Weight Grand Prix Championship .
Prior to the loss to dos Santos , Cro Cop signed a multi - fight deal with the UFC , saying he wanted to compete as often as possible and make one final run at heavyweight glory .
It 's too early to tell , but could these remarks signal the end of the road of Cro Cop 's long and distinguished professional career , which dates back to the mid 1990s ?

Closing Utah state offices on Fridays has resulted in a 13 percent reduction in energy use according to an internal analysis of the nation ’s most expansive four - day workweek program .
Since last August , about 17,000 of the state ’s 24,000 executive branch employees have been working 10 hours a day , four days a week in an effort to reduce energy consumption and cut utility costs ….
The state estimates that , collectively , employees will save between $ 5 million and $ 6 million annually by not commuting on Fridays and the initiative will cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 12,000 metric tons .
Even before we get desperate about reducing greenhouse gas emissions , even before the global Ponzi scheme collapses , gasoline prices are going to blow past $ 4 a gallon ( see World ’s top energy economist warns peak oil threatens recovery : “ We have to leave oil before oil leaves us ” ) .
So it seems inevitable that much of the nation will adopt the 4 - day work week sometime over the next two decades – especially if the results of Utah ’s program are replicated by others .
“ I ca n’t even name all the places that have called us , ” said John Harrington , state energy manager .
Aaron Newton in an Oil Drum post , estimates that a national 4 - day work week would save 5 % to 10 % of the more than 8 million barrels a day he calculates that U.S. commuters use .
And he notes there would be other environmental and health benefits
A recent study by the California EPA says “ 50 % of a person ’s daily exposure to ultra fine particles ( the particles linked to cardiovascular disease and respiratory illnesses ) can occur during a commute . ”
A report by the Clean Air Task Force in 2007 found diesel particle levels were between 4 to 8 times higher in commute vehicles than in the surrounding air .
It makes sense when you think about it .
The pollution coming from the tailpipe of a vehicle is mostly likely to affect you while you ’re sitting directly behind it , especially if you ’re stuck in slow moving traffic where the concentrations of such particles can build up .
Scientific American quotes John Langmaid , who is organizing an upcoming symposium on the issue for the Connecticut Law Review :
“ If employees are on the road 20 percent less , and office buildings are only powered four days a week , ” Langmaid says , “ the energy savings and congestion savings would be enormous . ”
Plus , the hour shift for the Monday through Thursday workers means fewer commuters during the traditional rush hours , speeding travel for all .
It also means less time spent idling in traffic and therefore less spewing of greenhouse gases and other pollutants .
The 9 - to - 5 crowd also gets the benefit of extended hours at the DMV and other state agencies that adopt the four - day schedule .
And outgoing Republican Gov. Jon Huntsman explains “ the cost savings will only grow if the four - day workweek is granted permanent status ” :
He says that ’s because the state could renegotiate its long - term leases , invest in equipment that would isolate cooling and heating to where its needed on nights and weekends and that utility costs will inevitably rise in future years , particularly if a proposed cap and trade system on carbon emissions is put in place .
And the folks in Utah seem to like it :
Employee surveys have also shown that most state workers like the new schedule – absenteeism and overtime are down and customer complaints have steadily dropped .
Even wait times at the Department of Motor Vehicles have decreased under extended hours Monday through Thursday … .
Some employees like the four - day workweek so much that they ’re using a voluntary peer pressure network to help the program meets its cost - saving , energy - cutting goals to help ensure the program – and employees ’ three - day weekends – survive .
Seems inevitable , no ?

WASHINGTON  Federal health officials banned the sale of flavored cigarettes on Tuesday in the first major crackdown since the Food and Drug Administration was given the authority to regulate tobacco .
The ban is intended to end the sale of tobacco products with chocolate , vanilla , clove and other flavorings that lure children and teenagers into smoking .
The agency will study regulating menthol products and hinted that it might soon take action against the far larger market of flavored small cigars and cigarillos .
“ These flavored cigarettes are a gateway for many children and young adults to become regular smokers , ” Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg , commissioner of food and drugs , said in announcing the ban .
In 2004 , 17 - year - old smokers were more than three times as likely as those over the age of 25 to smoke flavored cigarettes , and they viewed flavored cigarettes as safer .
Among the more famous flavored cigarette introductions was that of Camel Exotic Blends by R. J. Reynolds , which had flavors like Twista Lime , Kauai Kolada and Warm Winter Toffee .
Okay , I am going out on a limb here , so please understand that what I am saying is a bit of an experiment .�
When quantitative easing was originally done in Japan , it was after :
a credit - fueled expansion that pushed the stock and real estate markets to new heights , which have not been seen for 19 years .
productive capacity was built up that the rest of the world would not need .
anticipated returns on equity for investment projects were in the low single digits .
Now , during the time of quantitative easing , the following things happened :
money market rates were near zero .
relatively few private investors wanted to borrow money for investments to expand productive capacity .
government deficits expanded dramatically in a futile attempt to simulate an over - indebted economy .
Speculators borrowed money in yen in order to do carry trades .�
They borrowed the surplus yen from the quantitative easing , and used the leverage to speculate on higher - yielding debt . �
This had little benefit for the average person in Japan , though many played the carry trade game internally , buying investments denominated in Australian , New Zealand , or US Dollars .
Back to the present , and back to the US . �
Short - term borrowing rates have been falling , as there is a lack of demand to borrow short - term . �
Contrast that with one year ago , where there was no lack of demand to borrow short - term , but no willingness to lend .
An amazing change indeed , but much of it stems from a lack of demand for short - term borrowing .
Some attribute the low TED ( 3 - month Eurodollar less Treasury yield ) spread to risk - seeking , but I think that banks do n’t have many uses for surplus cash now .
As it is , with low US Dollar LIBOR lending rates , it makes the US Dollar a honeypot for speculators .�
Borrow in Dollars , invest in your favorite higher yielding currency , or in higher credit risk instruments .�
For the foreign currency trade , the added kick is that the US Dollar may decline in value . �
That said , many said the same would happen to the yen ; that it would decline in value , and it did not . �
I have many reasons to think why the Dollar will decline , but the carry trade argument goes the other way for me .
Now , maybe the excess liquidity is fostering day traders as well .�
We saw the same phenomenon in 1999 - 2000 .�
The liquidity should not have leaked out , but it did , and to those that would only speculate .
So what is the Fed doing ?�
Is it ending quantitative easing ?�
It seems not . �
They will buy mortgages until they reach their preannounced limit , most likely . �
That said , the Treasury might reduce funding to the Fed . �
They see less need to fund the Fed , though that will force the Fed to decide how large it wants its balance sheet to be in a time of crisis .
Here ’s my concern — having carry traders absorb excess liquidity that the Fed has put out is a waste of Fed resources , and indicates that Fed policy is too loose .�
Do n’t buy more mortgages and agencies , and consider selling bonds back in to the market .�
Let short - term rates rise to reflect the true scarcity of short - term ways to profit . �
Let savers earn some money — there is no benefit to having monetary policy so loose .
To summarize : Japan did not benefit from many years of quantitative easing , but it provided a lot of fuel for carry trades around the world until most of them blew up over the last two years . �
It seems to me that excess liquidity created by the Fed is going the same way now , because consumers and businesses do n’t want to borrow to the same degree as they did during the boom phase .
It will take a long time for balance sheets to heal .�
It depends upon the rates of debt forgiveness / compromise , and paying it down . �
During the Great Depression , Debt / GDP peaked several years after the Depression started , and after the peak it took about ten years for it to come down to a more normal level in 1941 . �
I suspect that we will go through this same process again , before the economy grows robustly as it did post - 1941 , regardless of what the Fed and Treasury do .

For educational purposes , the California Invasive Plants Council will sell you bouquets of plastic weeds , including yellow star thistle , tamarisk , leafy spurge and knapweed .
Some recent studies suggest that many gardeners need not invest in these because they can expect more of the real thing to arrive as climate change advances .
A warmer world will have more atmospheric carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide .
UC Irvine 's Diane Pataki says nitrous oxide has 300 times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide per molecule .
It 's released when soil bacteria covert ammonium to nitrite .
Pataki planted fescue test lawns , varying their temperatures and fertilizer .
She discovered that warmer plots with high soil moisture pumped out more nitrous oxide .
These plots also had the most weeds , with warm - season species like crabgrass and Bermuda grass dominating the fescue .
Fast - growing weedy plants will seize the resource bonanza created by climate change .
Dana Blumenthal , agricultural research service ecologist with the Department of Agriculture , has found that rapid growers adapted to nitrogen - rich soils tend to carry a heavy load of fungal and viral diseases in their native habitats .
In new areas , they leave their pathogens behind , giving them an advantage over even fast - growing native species .
They meet new predators and diseases but may be less susceptible to them than native plants are .
Dutch scientists looked at exotic plants from warmer climates that had become established in a nature preserve , comparing the newcomers with their closest native relatives .
They reported that the invasive species were less vulnerable to soilborne microbes than the natives .
Local aphids that fed on the native plants ignored the exotic ones , as did North African locusts .
Weeds from warm climates are poised to claim new turf as temperatures increase .
But other invasives may lose ground .
Princeton researchers Bethany Bradley , Michael Oppenheimer and David Wilcove used computer models of global climate change to predict the future ranges of weeds that are widespread in the West .
" Just as native species are expected to shift in range and relative competitiveness with climate change , " they wrote in a study published in the journal Global Change Biology , " the same should be expected of invasive species . "
Using each weed 's preferred habitat characteristics and a scenario in which fossil fuel emissions are not reduced , Bradley and her colleagues created an invasion risk map for each weed .
Their results were mixed .
The bad news for California : yellow star thistle will keep its current range and probably spread farther here and in Nevada .
Tamarisk , an exotic tree that sucks wildland creeks dry , will neither gain nor lose in a warmer West .
The largest effects the Princeton group predicted were for cheatgrass and leafy spurge , which will shift their ranges north , and spotted knapweed , which will move to higher elevations .
Gardeners may also have to cope with a new cast of characters .
Some researchers are trying to identify exotic species with weed potential before they jump the garden fence - plants with windblown or bird - dispersed seeds , species that reproduce vegetatively through runners , generalists that thrive in a variety of habitats - and working with growers and nursery folk to make sure new invasives do n't get into the horticultural trade .
Climate change is a moving target , and some effects could turn out to be stronger than the models account for .
There 's also no foolproof way to identify which plants will become invasives .
But with weeds moving both in from wildlands and out into them , it 's safe to say that weed control will still be on every thoughtful gardener 's agenda .
Media brands are jumping onto the iPhone .
USA Today ?
There ’s an app for that .
“ The Rachel Maddow Show ” ?
“ Entertainment Tonight ” ?
Public radio ?
Yes , yes and yes , there are apps for those .
Now , if only there were an app that showed media companies how to make money on the iPhone .
For them , the early days of iPhone applications resemble the early days of the Internet .
They know they need to have an app for the iPhone , and so they are creating appealing ones that are loaded with features .
“ The iPhone has really been a phenomenon , so I think most media brands , at least the national ones , are thinking it ’s a place they have to be , ” said Matt Jones , vice president for mobile strategy and operations at Gannett Digital - USA Today .
Yet , as with the Web , it is far from clear how much revenue media apps for the iPhone can produce .
“ We ’re all trying to figure out as we go : is there a subscription model here , is it an advertising model , is there a monthly recurring revenue stream , is it a one - time payment model ? ” Mr. Jones said .
“ It ’s a very fluid model . ”

It 's 12 months later and Warren Buffett 's Berkshire Hathaway is $ 3 billion richer .
One year ago today , on September 23 , 2008 , with the financial world still reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers just days before , Buffett stunned Wall Street with a massive vote of confidence for Goldman Sachs .
In a late - day news release , Goldman announced a private deal to sell Berkshire $ 5 billion of perpetual preferred stock .
In effect , Berkshire was giving Goldman a massive loan .
And you do n't loan that kind of money to a firm you think could follow Lehman down the drain .
In that release , Buffett called Goldman " an exceptional institution " with an " unrivaled global franchise , a proven and deep management team and the intellectual and financial capital to continue its track record of outperformance . "
The next day , in an interview on CNBC , Buffett said , " The price was right , the terms were right , and the people were right . "
Buffett 's money , and his endorsement of Goldman , did n't come cheap .
The annual free - agent scramble began for the Lakers when their most important player decided not to be part of it .
Kobe Bryant elected not to terminate the final two years of his contract and was expected to sign a three - year extension sometime this month .
Bryant would make a guaranteed $ 47.8 million over the next two years and could earn another $ 86 million to $ 91 million with the extension , depending on NBA salary - cap figures to be determined in 2011 .
There was optimism that the sides would reach agreement , one source familiar with the situation calling it “ a layup ” but declining to speak further about specifics .
Advertisement
Under terms of the extension , the earliest Bryant could opt out again would probably be June 2012 , three seasons from now .
To do that , however , would leave more than $ 60 million on the table over the last two years .
In other words , Bryant , who has spent his entire 13 - year career with the Lakers , might very well retire with them .
He will be 31 next month .
Tuesday was the last possible day for Bryant to become an unrestricted free agent , but he did not terminate his contract because he wanted to “ let Lamar [ Odom ] and Trevor [ Ariza ] have their day , ” according to a source who was not authorized to speak publicly about the decision .
Indeed , the Lakers , who won the NBA title 17 days ago , made preliminary contact Tuesday night with representatives for both of the unrestricted free - agent forwards , as General Manager Mitch Kupchak tried to live up to his recent promise to “ make quick decisions . . . and hopefully we can bring this team back intact . ”

Odom was on the Lakers ’ books for $ 14.1 million last season but will have to take a substantial pay cut .
Ariza , who turned 24 Tuesday , will get a solid pay raise from the $ 3.1 million he made last season .
No verbal agreements were struck with either player Tuesday night , though negotiations will continue throughout the week .
San Antonio and Phoenix are interested in trying to sign Odom .
Both teams are trying to clear salary - cap space to see if they can get a deal done with Odom , who is looking for at least a four - year deal worth an average of $ 10 million a year .
Suns Coach Alvin Gentry is familiar with Odom , having coached him when they were both with the Clippers from 2000 to 2003 .
San Antonio is looking for a versatile power forward to join perennial All - Star Tim Duncan after the Spurs traded Kurt Thomas and Fabricio Oberto to acquire small forward Richard Jefferson .
Advertisement
Only a handful of teams currently have enough salary - cap room to sign Odom or Ariza : Detroit , Oklahoma City , Memphis , Atlanta , Toronto , Portland and perhaps Sacramento .
“ There are not a lot of teams , ” Kupchak said .
“ There ’s a couple , but it only takes one team to make an offer . ”
Detroit appears to be the biggest free - agent buyer this summer with about $ 20 million to spend toward next season ’s payroll , though the Pistons were believed to be interested in Chicago guard Ben Gordon and Orlando forward Hedo Turkoglu .
If the Pistons signed both players , their spending spree would end and they would n’t have enough money to sign Ariza or Odom .
If the Lakers are unable to sign Odom or Ariza , they might pursue Houston forward Ron Artest , who made $ 7.4 million last season but became more attractive to the Rockets almost overnight amid reports that center Yao Ming might miss next season because of a broken foot .
Advertisement
Artest , 29 , sat courtside for some Lakers home playoff games but would probably have to take a pay cut to play for a team that is conscious of the luxury - tax penalties looming in the future .
The Lakers ’ third unrestricted free agent of note is reserve guard Shannon Brown .
The Lakers spoke with his agent Tuesday night , but it will be a slow - speed chase compared to their interest in Odom and Ariza .
Brown , 23 , enjoyed his time with the Lakers and wanted to return but would also look over the free - agent landscape , according to his agent , Mark Bartelstein .
Brown was basically a throw - in with Adam Morrison in the February trade that sent Vladimir Radmanovic to Charlotte .
The Lakers were his fourth NBA team in three NBA seasons .
Brown , 23 , made $ 796,000 last season , well below the NBA average of $ 5.6 million .
Advertisement
“ Shannon would love to be back with the Lakers , ” Bartelstein said .
“ He had a positive experience , a great experience with the Lakers .
He loved being there .
We ’ll talk to Mitch and see how things unfold . ”
There ’s still some minor unfolding to monitor in the Bryant situation .
If he unexpectedly can’t reach an agreement with the Lakers on an extension , he will play this season for $ 23 million and can opt out next June .
He could then sign a four - year deal for $ 112 million .
Bryant , however , wants to stay in Los Angeles , where the Lakers are coming off their first NBA championship since 2002 and are built to contend for years to come .

The scientific method is unarguably one of the most objective and rational methods that humans have found to discover the world around them .
It is also value - free , in the sense that it simply explains reality and has no normative propositions to make and thus it cannot be considered to put forth any bias .
But this does not mean that science cannot be used politically .
In fact , the findings of it are the primary method by which secular people can promote their agenda as Reality , when supporting one ’s position can be handily be used as a stronghold for one ’s political ideas .
And this actually makes the best kind of politics , ie ones based on reality .
This is in fact why religion is hostile to Science as a whole , as it gives too much power to secular arguments in the area of moderating human behaviour and as such promotes a liberal agenda .
However there is one nasty aspect when science and politics interact , and that is all too insidious confirmation bias .
It is the propensity of people , including scientists , to see only the facts that support their already held political opinion .
The easiest way is when science is not absolute on one particular issue which allows partisans on the minority to pick the arguments which fit their predisposition , expand them using exaggerations and political hacks and thus cloud and prevent a reality - based decision .
Such is the case in the Anthropogenic Global Warming debate and such was the case a few decades ago on the harmful effects of smoking .
Further than this though , science can be used as a political tool by simply avoiding or ignoring the actual facts .
This became clear to me through my discussions with secular statists and / or liberals who base their ideas on what they think scientific facts support .
In this particular case , that humans have evolved to be primarily competitive against each other and everyone else .
This argument can then be handily be used both for “ proving ” the naturalness of Capitalism and / or the necessity of the State .
But this creates a problem when one looks at scientific findings and discovers that they do not support this position of “ war against all ” in the least .
How can this be the dominant worldview ?
My personal theory is that people put far more weight to their political perspective than they do in science .
To the tune of ignoring or subconsciously avoiding learning about scientific facts that would put cracks in their position .
We know how much possible this is from the religious example , where people will outright deny evolution or geology when it threatens to challenge their currently held worldview .
I do not believe that this is so much because religion is so much of a stronger belief , as much as it is their current politics and lifestyle which would be threatened by changing their mind .
To put it more plainly , I see people having some particular ideas , such as hate of teh gay , patriarchy or authoritarian tendencies .
These are easily maintained by considering the Bible as a literal history and thus accepting its homosexual - hating , god - fearing ideas .
When science enters the picture and points out that homosexuality is genetic , humans are genetically equal and there ’s probably no higher authority to bow down to , it is the lifestyle and worldview that is threatened , not the religion itself which is simply the excuse to preserve said lifestyle .
Thus science will be denied , in order for the comfortable excuse ( religion ) to be preserved .
As such , those whose worldview is not threatened , such as say people growing up in more liberal areas are far more likely to accept science which is less threatening , while also keeping their religion ( in its non-fundamentalist form ) .
In a similar way , this applies to irreligious people as well .
While some particular worldviews ( usually the most intolerant ) require a religion in order to defend them , others can function with some other alternative such as nationalism .
Still other require none at all and in fact do beg legitimacy by wearing the cover of “ science ” .
This generally occurs in worldviews that are so popular and internalized that their dismissal seems unrealistic .
I ’m talking of course about Statism and Capitalism which are being taught as inescepable from the youngest possible age .
And what seems to happen then when these are challenged and there is no relevant religion or one espouses no appropriate ideology to defend them ?
( say : as Objectivism )
One can only then turn to scientific facts to support their worldview , and if the facts do not fit the picture , they may just as well be ignored .
This then explains the curious fact that while Mutual Aid is a very ( if not the most ) important factor of evolution , it is competition and “ war against all ” that is still being promoted as the generally accepted primary characteristic of life .
How else can one explain this .
other by assuming that scientists and secularists who ’s worldview embraces Statism and / or Capitalism have subconsciously avoided learning about it ?
I ca n’t in good conscience attribute this to any kind of malice or conspiracy .
And this is the unfortunate aspect of scientific facts .
They tend to raise uncomfortable questions for the status quo since they challenge the validity of the various defences such as religion and racism .
This by itself makes science a political tool , but one which always seems to support a libertarian socialism worldview .
And when all chips are on the table and one ’s worldview is on the line , it seems to be preferable – even for self - labelled supporters of rationalism and scientific method – to bury the truth in order to avoid an uncomfortable political realignment .

Age - Based Investment Strategy Can Hurt You
You have heard that you should invest more aggressively when you are young , and become gradually more conservative as you age .
Fund companies help with the conventional wisdom by creating target retirement date , or “ lifecycle ” funds .
These funds shift the asset allocation from almost all stocks for younger workers to mostly bonds for older employee portfolios with target retirement dates like 2015 .
Another investment rule of thumb for the same idea is to subtract your age from 100 , and that should be your percentage allocation to stocks in your portfolio .
The basis for this investment strategy is that bonds are a safe , secure investment during all time frames .
For instance , during the period from 1973 - 2008 , bonds returned almost 8 % per year , with less than half the volatility of stocks .
When you reach retirement age , it is believed that they will provide you with steady growth that , while less than stocks , the returns will keep your portfolio funds from running out .
This asset allocation strategy does not always work
There are some major problems with this belief .
The vast majority of workers today have experienced one of the largest bull markets for bonds in history .
In 1981 , interest rates reached 20 % and have gradually decreased ever since until they reached 0 % in 2008 .
Bonds are positively affected by decreases in interest rates , and negatively affected by interest rate increases and inflation .
The next 30 years will not be a repeat of the last 30 .
In fact , I believe that the next generation will see a bond bear market .
What has happened historically during bond bear markets ?
According to Global Financial Data , from 1940 to 1981 , investors in bonds lost money in real terms .
While the dollar value of their investments increased , the purchasing power declined .
This was caused by rising inflation and interest rates .
Another example outside of our own country is Britain .
After World War II , high sustained inflation hurt their consols ( perpetual war debt securities ) to the point where in 1979 , their was worth the same amount that they were in 1889 !
There is a solution to inflation and rising interest rates , though .
If you hold bonds and wish to keep them in your portfolio , reinvest them into funds with shorter maturities .
So if you hold long - term bonds to gain extra interest income , in funds like Vanguard Long - Term Investment Grade Bond ( VWESX ) , or in exchange traded funds such as TLT or BLV , you should move your funds to shorter maturities .
Shorter maturities are helpful because as interest rates rise , their yields rise more quickly with the market , and their prices are hurt less .
Examples of these would be Vanguard Short Term Investment Grade Bond ( VFSTX ) or the corresponding ETF with the ticker symbol BSV .
Another solution , though more volatile , is to increase your allocation to real assets .
For example , commodities and real estate prices rise with inflation .
Both generally have a modest correlation to stocks , though all have performed similarly since the beginning of the financial crisis .
You can easily add these to your portfolio through ETFs , with the commodity fund DBC , and the real estate fund RWR .
Remember , in these times , you need to take charge of your retirement investing and learn as much as you can about your options .
This means always questioning the conventional wisdom , because in the end your portfolio performance is up to you .
Last week saw more than its share of stories about miscarriages of justice .
But spare a thought this Christmas for the victim of the biggest miscarriage of justice in Scottish legal history , Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed al - Megrahi , the man convicted of blowing up Pan Am flight 103 en route from London to New York , 20 years ago today .
For many years , it looked as if there would be no trial over Lockerbie .
British and US governments believed Colonel Gaddafi would never hand over the two Libyan intelligence officers accused of the bombings , which some regarded as fortunate as they believed the evidence against Libya would not stand up in a court of law .
But thanks largely to the persistence of Nelson Mandela , 12 years after the bombing a trial did take place .
In exchange for the lifting of sanctions Gaddafi handed over the two accused and the Scottish court swallowed almost the whole improbable story .
On 31 January 2001 , Megrahi was convicted of the mass murder of 259 passengers and crew , as well as 11 people on the ground in the village of Lockerbie .
He is now serving a life sentence in a Scottish jail .
His co-accused , Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah , was acquitted .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Megrahi's conviction was a shocker .
No material evidence was presented linking him to the bombing , let alone any evidence that he put the bomb on the plane or that he handled any explosives .
Even the prosecution subsequently questioned the credibility of its star witness .
Nevertheless , keen to move on , Libya accepted responsibility for the bombing although it never accepted guilt .
Gaddafi paid $ 2.7bn ( £ 1.8 bn ) in compensation to the victims ' families – $ 10 m for every victim .
The final payment was made this year .
US lawyers took approximately a third of the final amount .
But the economic and humanitarian price for Libya was far higher : UN sanctions over an 11 - year period inflicted billions of dollars ' worth of economic damage on Libya and prevented thousands of Libyan citizens from travelling abroad .
The central pillar of the prosecution 's case was that Megrahi wrapped the bomb in clothes before checking it on to a plane in Malta without boarding it himself .
The bomb , the prosecution alleged , was subsequently transferred at Frankfurt on to the flight to London , and then loaded on to the flight to New York .
Two years after the bombing , Granada TV ran a programme about the bombing featuring a dramatic reconstruction , in which a bag containing a bomb was loaded on to an Air Malta flight by a sinister - looking Arab , who then sloped off without boarding .
Upset by the damage to its reputation , Air Malta sued Granada TV .
The airline 's solicitors compiled a dossier of evidence demonstrating that all the bags checked on to that flight were accompanied by passengers and none travelled on to London .
The evidence was so convincing that Granada settled out of court .
Since the Crown never had much of a case against Megrahi , it was no surprise when the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ( SCCRC ) found prima facie evidence in June 2007 that Megrahi had suffered a miscarriage of justice and recommended that he be granted a second appeal .
For 11 years , while legal proceedings were pending and throughout the trial , the British Government argued that a public inquiry into Lockerbie was not appropriate as it would prejudice legal proceedings .
After the conviction , it switched tack , arguing instead that no public inquiry was necessary .
But if the conviction were overturned , there would no longer be a reason to hold back .
For Megrahi , this can not come soon enough .
In September he was diagnosed with advanced terminal prostate cancer .
The British Government is preparing for Megrahi to be transferred to Libya for the rest of his sentence .
This would eliminate the risk of an acquittal and lessen the chance of a subsequent inquiry .
Applications for a transfer cannot be submitted while an appeal is pending , which for the Government raises the convenient prospect that Megrahi will abandon his appeal so he can die at home .
But letting Megrahi die a condemned man reduces the chance of Scottish prosecutors , the police , various UK intelligence services plus many American and other foreign bodies being asked a lot of difficult questions .
Last month , a general agreement on the exchange of prisoners was signed between Libya and Britain paving the way for such a transfer .
The agreement will be ratified in January .
" The Crown and the prosecution are using every delaying tactic in the book to close off every route available to Megrahi except prisoner transfer , as this means he has to abandon his appeal , " commented Professor Robert Black QC , the Scottish lawyer who was the architect of the original trial who feels partly responsible for the miscarriage that occurred .
" It is an absolute disgrace .
It was 27 June 2007 when the SCCRC released its report and sent its case back to the criminal appeal court , and here we are 18 months later and the Crown has still not handed over all of the material that the law requires it to hand over and it is still making every objection conceivable . "
There are , however , two obstacles to the British plan .
Firstly , the decision to transfer Megrahi lies with the Scottish First Minister , Alex Salmond .
Upset that the Government reached an agreement over Megrahi without consulting him first , Mr Salmond has ruled out any transfer .
Secondly , whether Megrahi dies in jail in Scotland or Libya , under Scottish law his appeal can still go ahead without him .
" Any interested person can continue the case .
In this case one of Megrahi 's children could continue with the appeal to clear their father 's name , " says Professor Black .
If Megrahi did n't do it , who did ?
Some time ago suspicion fell on a gang headed by a convicted Palestinian terrorist named Abu Talb and a Jordanian triple agent named Marwan Abdel Razzaq Khreesat .
Both were Iranian agents ; Khreesat was also on the CIA payroll .
Abu Talb was given lifelong immunity from prosecution in exchange for his evidence at the Lockerbie trial ; Marwan Khreesat was released for lack of evidence by German police even though a barometric timer of the type used to detonate the bomb on Pan Am Flight 103 was found in his car when he was arrested .
Three months after the bombing , Dumfries and Galloway police published a report on Lockerbie that concluded : " There can be little doubt that Khreesat is the bomb - maker for the [ Palestinian group ] PFLP -GC , and there is a possibility he prepared the explosive device which destroyed Pan Am Flight 103 .
As such he should not be at liberty . "
Not surprisingly , given the amount of skulduggery that has swirled around Lockerbie over the past 20 years , conspiracy theories related to the case have bloomed .
Some believe that the CIA deliberately framed Libya so Syria would fight in the first Gulf War .
Others suspect Lockerbie to be linked to drug smuggling , arms shipments and Iranian hostage negotiations .
Short of an unexpected confession , Lockerbie will likely remain one of those great , unsolved political whodunnits , like the assassination of JFK .
The fate of Abdelbaset al - Megrahi , however , and the tarnished reputation of the Scottish criminal justice system rest in the hand of the Scottish courts .
Megrahi's acquittal , posthumous or otherwise , will undo a heinous wrong and return us to where we were 20 years ago – searching for the truth behind the bombing of Pan Am flight 103 .

British troops are trying to shore up security ahead of this month 's elections
Two more British soldiers have been killed by explosions in Afghanistan , taking the number of personnel killed since operations began in 2001 to 201 .
One , from the 2nd Battalion the Royal Welsh , died in hospital from wounds .
The second , from 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Fusiliers , died after an explosion on Saturday while on foot patrol in Sangin , Helmand province .
Prime Minister Gordon Brown admitted it had been " a very difficult summer " , but said progress was being made .
Paying tribute to those who had been killed , Mr Brown said their efforts were helping to make the world safer and that progress had been made in allowing forthcoming Afghan elections to take place .

Town feels pain of troop deaths " We have created space in which we can have Afghan government , Afghan police and Afghan forces and that will make it very difficult for the Taliban and Al Qaeda to reassert themselves , " he said .
" Three quarters of the terrorist plots that hit Britain derive from the mountain areas of Pakistan and Afghanistan , " he said .
" And it is to make Britain safe and the rest of the world safe that we must make sure we honour our commitment to maintain and keep a stable Afghanistan . "
Mr Brown insisted " every effort " was being made to ensure troops had the best security and equipment .
" We have increased dramatically the resources we are spending in Afghanistan to deal with this new kind of threat which is the roadside bomb , the electronic devices , the guerrilla warfare . "
By Ian Pannell , BBC correspondent in Kabul " Every year the level of violence has increased and with it the casualty rate .
There are now growing criticisms about whether enough progress is being made , whether the strategy is right and whether or not British troops are protected enough in a conflict that still shows no signs of easing .
The latest deaths come just four days before presidential elections .
UK troops have been trying to make areas safe ahead of voting but that means more fighting and even more deaths as the insurgents try to disrupt the poll . "
PM sees Afghanistan progress
Toll ' will raise questions '
Where next for UK mission ?
The Royal Welsh soldier had been on vehicle patrol near Musa Qala in Helmand province on Thursday morning when he was hit by the explosion .
He died at a military hospital in Selly Oak , Birmingham , on Saturday .
Neither he nor the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers soldier has been named , but their next of kin have been informed .
A total of 10 UK personnel have died this month as troops attempt to shore up security ahead of August elections .
The latest deaths follow those of three soldiers killed by roadside bombs while on foot patrol in Helmand on Thursday .
Two had been attempting to help a comrade who had been wounded by an earlier blast .
Rifleman Daniel Wild , 19 , from Easington in County Durham , and Captain Mark Hale , both serving with the 2nd Battalion The Rifles , were carrying Lance Bombardier Matthew Hatton , 23 , of 40 Regiment Royal Artillery , from North Yorkshire , when they were hit by a second explosion .
Their patrol had been part of an operation intended to provide security for a pre-election Shura , or meeting of elders .
We must not fail in this task , and we will not
Defence secretary Bob Ainsworth
Send us your comments Colonel Richard Kemp was the commander of the British Army in Afghanistan when it went into Helmand .
He said : " The Taliban have learnt a very hard lesson for themselves .
They can't take us on head to head and toe to toe and have resorted more to this kind of device .
' Progress made ' " Although our death toll is bad , theirs is considerably worse and sometimes we are talking about a ratio of 100 to 1 against the Taliban . "
Defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said news of the latest deaths made it a " grim day " and said Britain mourned every loss of life in the conflict .

But he insisted UK troops had been making " good progress " in their mission .
He accepted the recent offensive against the Taliban - Operation Panther 's Claw - was a " tough fight " , but said it had brought nearly 80,000 Afghans out from under the " tyranny of the Taliban " .
Mr Ainsworth also said he believed the second Afghan presidential elections , to be held later this week , would offer more Afghans " a stake in their own emerging democracy " and provide greater security for the UK .
" It is only by supporting the Afghan government and its security forces to bring stability can we ensure that we prevent Afghanistan becoming the haven for terrorists it once was , protecting Britain from attack and promoting peace across the region .
" We must not fail in this task , and we will not . "
Shadow defence secretary Liam Fox said passing the 200th death mark served as a " stark reminder of the bravery and sacrifice of British troops in Helmand " .

My first novel , High Fidelity , was published in 1995 , and shortly afterwards , I embarked upon my first American book tour .
I took with me a Discman , and 15 or 20 carefully chosen CDs in a wallet , although I bought lots of others while I was there – CDs by bands I 'd never heard of , and would n't have been able to buy at home , recommended to me by people who came to readings , or by journalists at the end of interviews .
There was always a thriving , intimidating independent music store just a short walk from my hotel , in whichever city I was visiting .
At signings , people gave me lovingly made compilation tapes , occasionally demo tapes of their bands , or their friends ' bands , and sometimes bootleg tapes of shows by artists they thought I 'd like .
Towards the end of the tour I no longer had room for it all , and I had to leave little piles of cassette boxes next to the waste - bins in my hotel rooms .
( I could n't bear to put them in the bins .
I was n't throwing them away ; I was leaving them behind .
There was a difference . )
If you look at the above picture carefully , and compare it to your average 2009 book tour , you should be able to spot the differences .
Even spoken - word recommendations look quaint now .
Back then , the future of music did n't look particularly interesting to me .
I do n't mean that music itself seemed boring , although I was 38 years old , and I felt like I 'd heard a lot of the mid-90s before .
I mean that neither I nor anybody else I knew spent any time thinking about how our consumption of music might change .
How could it ?
There was n't much to it , surely ?
OK , someone might come up with another format , something that might sweep away the compact disc just as the CD had replaced vinyl .
But whatever it was , all you could do was buy it – which meant walking down to Our Price , or a local independent store staffed by people who looked as though they 'd rather have their heads stuck inside Thurston Moore 's amp than speak to you .
I certainly could n't have imagined writing a novel which is in part about how we relate to music in the 21st century .
Like most of us , I believed that this relationship would be a version of the relationship we all knew and loved , with a couple of extra volume knobs on .
In the year that High Fidelity was published , a new CD shop opened in my neighbourhood and rejuvenated my listening habits .
The shop did well , initially , and I spent a lot of time in there , buying pretty much whatever the owners told me to buy ; they were very clever , it seemed to me , in targeting the ageing ( or perhaps , more precisely , ex - ) hipsters of north London , people who were growing sick of their REM albums but did n't know what else to buy .
They sold hundreds of copies of Buena Vista Social Club , and a lot of tasteful trip - hop – which , as Simon Reynolds pointed out , was " merely a form of gentrification " .
But then , what are you supposed to do if you 're becoming gentrified ?
Pretend it is n't happening ?
Yes , Portishead sold a lot of albums to people who wanted to listen to music that meant something without waking up their children , but that 's not necessarily a desire that deserves a sneer .
Keeping in touch with the things that help us feel alive – music , books , movies , even the theatre , if , mysteriously , you are that way inclined – becomes a battle , and one that many of us lose , as we get older ; I do n't think enough of our cultural pundits , people who write about that stuff for a living , fully understand this .
It 's one thing to have an opinion on Little Boots remixes if you earn your living hanging about in cyberspace ; quite another if you 're a full - time teacher with three kids .
My friend 's CD shop performed a valuable service to those whose shopping and browsing and listening time was rationed by circumstance , people who had the occasional five minutes on a Saturday morning to check out , and sometimes even buy , what everyone else was listening to .
You 'll know what happened to the shop , because it happened to everyone else 's shop , too .
Illegal downloading would n't have been a factor here – the punters were too old and , for the most part , too well - heeled for all that .
But Amazon started selling CDs for less than my friends could buy them for , and eventually even north London 's late adopters worked out that one - clicking did n't take much effort .
The trouble with this , of course , is that you 're shopping in a vacuum , however many times you 're told by some robot you do n't know that if you like this then you 'll love that .
You 're feeding off nothing , apart from recommendations in broadsheet newspapers and magazines such as this one – and we 've all been burned like that .
After my local CD shop closed down , I was getting ready for a musical life that turned in on itself , before dying slowly from malnutrition .
Any piece of music becomes drained of meaning and excitement if you listen too much to it , but a three - minute pop song is n't going to last you a lifetime .
Popular music needs to keep flowing .
If the fresh supplies stop , it 's you that becomes stagnant .
It took me longer than it should have done to work out that the internet is one giant independent record shop – thousands and thousands of cute little independent record shops , anyway – and they do n't actually charge you for the music they stock .
The MP3 blogs that stretch for miles and miles , as far as the eye can see , down that stretch of the net that is n't reserved for pornography , are staffed by enthusiastic and likable young men and women who absolutely do n't want to rip the artists off : they are always careful to post links to iTunes and Amazon , and the songs they put on their sites are for sampling purposes only .
( For the most part , they are encouraged to do so by the artists and their labels , who take out adverts on the more popular sites , and are clearly sending advance copies of albums to the bloggers . )
It works for me .
I listen , and then I buy what I like , because owning music is still important to me .
If the music I like stays out there in cyberspace , as it does on Spotify , then somehow it cannot indicate character and taste in the same way , although I doubt that younger generations will feel like this , and good luck to them .
But it 's easy .
Look at Hype Machine ( hypem.com ) to begin with : in the top right - hand corner of the site , you 'll see a list of the top five most - blogged artists , so you will get a sense of what 's going on out there ( or in there , if you are a literal - minded soul ) .
The search engine will offer you a chance to listen to these artists , and , in the process , you 'll get the chance to discover your favourite virtual record store , because every single one of those links you see will take you to a different MP3 blog .
My favourites are I Am Fuel , You Are Friends , Largehearted Boy , Aquarium Drunkard , When You Awake , and Funky16 Corners .
( Some of those names are indicative of a generosity of spirit that one does n't always associate with the internet . )
And some of these post songs from new bands , and some post scratched old vinyl funk records , and if you spend an hour messing about you 'll find 20 or 30 great songs you never knew before .
In other words : there 's no excuse .
Juliet , Naked is in part about how a middle - aged man devotes a large chunk of his life to keeping alive the work of a long - forgotten 80s singer - songwriter ; he runs a messageboard , posts essays online , and virtually lives in a virtual world , talking to people he would n't ever have met 10 years ago .
Perhaps one of the paradoxes of music on the internet is that it 's perfect for the old folks .
If you need to find set lists for every show Rory Gallagher ever played , I 'm sure there 's some chap with nothing better to do who is taking care of it right now .
But more importantly , you need never again feel as though the pop life is drifting away from you – indeed , the anonymity and user - friendliness of the MP3 blogs mean that one feels emboldened to walk into even the scariest - looking website in the full confidence that nobody will laugh at you .
I 'll be off on a US book tour again soon , to promote a novel that is , in part , about how the world has changed since 1995 .
I 'll be taking with me a small black box , no bigger than a packet of cigarettes , containing every piece of music I 've ever loved .
And a lot of that music – more than I could possibly have imagined five years ago , when I was prepared , reluctantly , to pull up the drawbridge – was made very recently .
And no , I do n't know how it will all pan out , who will pay the artists to make their lovely or ugly or scary music in a world that 's increasingly beginning to expect everything for free .
( My best guess is that being in a band will become a version of national service or the Peace Corps ; something you do for a couple of years before knuckling down to a proper job .
And the London Symphony Orchestra wo n't appear on as many rock albums as they used to . )
All I know is that if you love music , and you have a curious mind , there has never been a better time to be alive .
• Juliet , Naked ( Viking ) is out now .
By George Washington of Washington ’s Blog .
Unemployment is disastrous on both the individual and societal level .
Individuals who look for work but ca n’t find it are miserable .
Indeed , most people who lose their job are unprepared for their circumstances . [ 1 ]
On the national level , high unemployment is both cause and effect concerning other problems with the economy .
As we ’ll see below , high unemployment results from a weak economy and – in turn – weakens the economy .
Until the causes of , and solutions to , high levels of unemployment are understood , we will not be able to solve the problem .
How High is Unemployment ?
Before we can even start looking at causes or solutions , we have to understand what the current level of unemployment really is , and what the trends portend for the future .
Let ’s use America as an example .
With the largest economy in the world , it has often been said that “ when America sneezes , the rest of the world catches cold ” .
And much of the rest of the world has adopted the “ Washington Consensus ” – America ’s neoliberal view of economics .
[ 2 ]
Moreover , the rest of the world has been infected by many types of “ toxic assets ” invented in America , such as credit default swap derivatives [ 3 ] , as well as Wall Street style banking strategies .
So I will use the United States has a case example , but will also touch on global trends .
Official figures put unemployment in the United States somewhere between 9 and 10 percent .
But the official figures use a very different measure for unemployment than was used during the Great Depression and for many decades afterwards .
Specifically , the official unemployment reports of the Department of Labor ’s Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) provide conventional “ U - 3 ” figures and various alternative measures including “ U - 6 ” . [ 4 ]
For example , as of December 2008 , U - 3 unemployment was 7.2 percent , while U - 6 was 13.5 percent . [ 5 ]
U - 6 is actually more accurate , because it includes those who would like full - time work , but can only find part - time work , or have given up looking for work altogether .
As can be seen by the December 2008 figures , U - 6 unemployment rate can almost double the more commonly - cited U - 3 figures .
But those in the know argue that the real rate is actually even higher than the U - 6 figures .
For example , Paul Craig Roberts [ 6 ] – former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury and former editor of the Wall Street Journal – and economist John Williams both said in December 2008 that – if the unemployment rate was calculated as it was during the Great Depression – the December 2008 unemployment figure would actually have been 17.5 % .
Williams says [ 7 ] that unemployment figures for July 2009 rose to 20.6 % [ 8 ] .
According to an article [ 9 ] summarizing the projections of former International Monetary Fund Chief Economist and Harvard University Economics Professor Kenneth Rogoff and University of Maryland Economics Professor Carmen Reinhart , U - 6 unemployment could rise to 22 % within the next 4 years or so .
As the New York Times pointed out in July [ 10 ] :
Include [ those who have given up looking for a job and those part - time workers who want to be working full time ] — as the Labor Department does when calculating its broadest measure of the job market — and the rate reached 23.5 percent in Oregon this spring , according to a New York Times analysis of state - by - state data .
It was 21.5 percent in both Michigan and Rhode Island and 20.3 percent in California .
In Tennessee , Nevada and several other states that have relied heavily on manufacturing or housing , the rate was just under 20 percent this spring and may have since surpassed it .
Indeed , the chief of the Atlanta Federal Reserve Bank - Dennis Lockhart – said in August 2009 :
If one considers the people who would like a job but have stopped looking — so - called discouraged workers — and those who are working fewer hours than they want , the unemployment rate would move from the official 9.4 percent to 16 percent . [ 11 ]
Former Labor Secretary Robert Rubin notes :
Over the past three months annual wage growth has plummeted to just 0.7 % .
At the same time , furloughs — requiring workers to take unpaid vacations — are on the rise : recent surveys show 17 % of companies imposing them . [ 12 ]
Temporary employment is still falling as well . [ 13 ]
And economist David Rosenberg points out :
65 % of companies are still in the process of cutting their staff loads …
The Bureau of Labor Statistics also publishes a number from the Household survey that is comparable to the nonfarm survey ( dubbed the population and payroll - adjusted Household number ) , and on this basis , employment sank — brace yourself — by over 1 million , which is unprecedented … [ 14 ]
In addition to the failure of official BLS unemployment figures to take into account discouraged and underemployed workers , many analysts argue that BLS ’ “ Birth - Death Model ” severely understates unemployment during recessions . [ 15 ]
Many people – including economists and financial reporters – say that unemployment is much lower than it was during the Great Depression .
What they mean when they say that is that current U - 3 figures in America are under 10 % , while unemployment hit 25 % during the Great Depression .
But most people forget that the worst unemployment numbers during the Great Depression did not occur until years after the initial 1929 crash .
Specifically , unemployment did not hit 25 % until at least 3 years after the start of the Depression . [ 16 ]
As of this writing ( 2009 ) , we are only a year into the current economic crisis .
Therefore , we have at least 2 more years to go until we hit the same period that unemployment peaked during the Great Depression .
Indeed , former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich wrote in April that the unemployment figures show that we are already in a depression . [ 17 ]
And Chris Tilly – director of the Institute for Research on Labor and Employment at UCLA – points out that some populations , such as African - Americans and high school dropouts , have been hit much harder than other populations , and that these groups are already experiencing depression - level unemployment . [ 18 ]
Assuming that Williams , Roberts or Lockhart ’s calculations of unemployment are correct ( using the same methods of measuring unemployment as were used during the Great Depression ) , and depending on when we deem the current crisis to have commenced , then – as shown by the following charts – unemployment percentages may actually be worse than they were during a comparable period in the Great Depression :
[ 19 and 20 ]
[ 21 ]
We also know that , in terms of total numbers of unemployment people ( as opposed to percentages ) , more people will be unemployed than during the Great Depression . [ 22 ]
What Are the Unemployment Trends ?
If unemployment is anywhere near as bad as during a comparable period during the Great Depression , the obvious question is where the trends are heading .
It is well known among economists that unemployment is a “ lagging ” indicator . [ 23 ]
In other words , there is a lag time .
When the economy hits a rough patch , the economic weakness will not show up in the unemployment numbers until several months or years later .
For example , as Europe ’s largest bank – RBS – warns :
Even if the economy starts to turn up the headwinds will be formidable , ” [ the company ’s CEO ] warned .
“ The green shoots are short in duration and you need to be cautious about interpreting them .
Even if growth returns , unemployment will rise for some time afterwards … [ 24 ]
Because of the lag time between conditions in the economy and unemployment , we have to ask the following two questions in order to forecast future unemployment trends :
1 ) How bad were conditions in 2008 and early 2009 ?
and
2 ) What will economic conditions be like in the future ?
How Bad Did It Get ?
Unfortunately , many experts – including the following people – have said that the economic crisis which started in 2008 could be worse than the Great Depression :
Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke said on July 26 , 2009 :
A lot of things happened , a lot came together , [ and ] created probably the worst financial crisis , certainly since the Great Depression and possibly even including the Great Depression . [ 25 ]
Economics professors Barry Eichengreen and and Kevin H. O’Rourke said that world - wide conditions are worse than during a comparable period during the Great Depression [ 26 ] ( updated in June 2009 [ 27 ] )
Investment advisor , risk expert and bestselling author Nassim Nicholas Taleb said that the current crisis could be “ vastly worse ” than the Great Depression [ 28 ]
Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker believes the current crisis may be even worse than the Depression [ 29 ]
Nobel prize winning economist Joseph Stiglitz said “ this is worse than the Great Depression ” [ 30 ]
Economics scholar and former Federal Reserve Governor Frederick Mishkin said that conditions were worse than during the Depression [ 31 ]
Well - known PhD economist PhD Economist Marc Faber believes this could be far worse than the Great Depression [ 32 ]
Former Goldman Sachs chairman John Whitehead thinks that the current slump is worse than the Depression [ 33 ]
Morgan Stanley ’s UK equity strategist Graham Secker predicts economic collapse worse than the Great Depression [ 34 ]
Former chief credit officer at Fannie Mae Edward J. Pinto said in January 2009 that the current housing crisis was worse than the Depression , and that current efforts to rescue the mortgage industry are less successful than those used during the 1930s . [ 35 ]
Billionaire investor George Soros said in February 2009 that the current economic turbulence is actually more severe than during the Great Depression , comparing the current situation to the demise of the Soviet Union . [ 36 ]
What Will Economic Conditions Be Like
In the Future ?
As of this writing , the fact that unemployment will substantially increase is quite controversial .
Most people still assume that the benefits of the government ’s policies will soon kick in , the economy will recover , and then jobs will recover soon afterwards .
In order to accurately determine how bad general economic conditions – and thus unemployment – might be in the future , it is necessary to look at a variety of trends , including residential real estate , commercial real estate , toxic assets held by banks , loan loss rates , consumer spending , age demographics , the decline in manufacturing , and destruction of credit .
Residential Real Estate
Citigroup is projecting that unemployment in Spain will rise from its current 17.9 % to 22 % next year . [ 37 ]
Spain ’s unemployment is largely driven by the bursting of its housing bubble . [ 38 ]
Housing bubbles are now bursting in China [ 39 ] , France [ 40 ] , Spain [ 41 ] , Ireland [ 42 ] , the United Kingdom [ 43 ] , Eastern Europe [ 44 ] , and many other regions . [ 45 ]
( And unemployment in Japan is apparently at the highest level since the government began collecting the data in 1953 , a year after the U.S. military occupation ended . ) [ 46 ]
Unfortunately , while the peak in subprime mortgages is behind us , many analysts say that Alt - A mortgage defaults have not yet occurred ( as of this writing ) , but will not peak until 2010 . [ 47 ]
Indeed , the crash in real estate and rising unemployment together form a negative feedback loop .
As McClatchy notes , foreclosures rise as jobs and income drop . [ 48 ]
Former chief IMF economist Simon Johnson notes that a vicious cycle also exists between unemployment and property foreclosures :
Unemployment is always a lagging indicator , and given the record low number of average hours worked , it will turn around especially slowly this time .
Until then , people will continue to lose their jobs and wages will remain flat , and any small rebound in housing prices is unlikely to help more than a few people refinance their way out of unaffordable mortgages .
So unless the other part of the equation – monthly payments – changes , the number of foreclosures should just continue to rise . [ 49 ]
Indeed , the Washington Post notes :
The country ’s growing unemployment is overtaking subprime mortgages as the main driver of foreclosures , according to bankers and economists , threatening to send even higher the number of borrowers who will lose their homes and making the foreclosure crisis far more complicated to unwind . [ 50 ]
Commercial Real Estate
Moreover , a crash in commercial real estate is now picking up speed .
Unlike the subprime mortgage meltdown – which affected mainly the biggest banks – the commercial meltdown will apparently affect a huge number of small to medium - sized banks . [ 51 ]
On August 11 , 2009 , the Congressional Oversight Panel on the bailouts issued a report saying that small and medium sized banks are especially vulnerable , the report will say , in part they hold greater numbers of commercial real estate loans , “ which pose a potential threat of high defaults . ” [ 52 ]
That could spell real trouble for employment by small businesses since ( 1 ) smaller institutions are disproportionately responsible for providing credit to small businesses [ 53 ] , ( 2 ) credit is essential for many small businesses , ( 3 ) commercial real estate is crashing even faster than residential [ 54 ] , and ( 4 ) industry experts forecast that the commercial real estate market wo n’t bottom out for three more years . [ 55 ]
Indeed , largely because of the commercial real estate crash , the FDIC expects 500 banks to fail in the coming months . [ 56 ]
Unfortunately , the crash in commercial real estate is occurring world - wide . [ 57 ]
Toxic Assets
The Congressional Oversight Panel report also says that banks remain threatened by billions of dollars of bad loans on their balance sheets , more could fail if the economy worsens , and that – if unemployment rises sharply or the commercial real estate market collapses – the banking system could again crash :
The financial system [ still remains ] vulnerable to the crisis conditions that [ the bailout ] was meant to fix …
Financial stability remains at risk if the underlying problem of toxic assets remains unresolved . [ 58 ]
As Reuters notes :
The chairman of the congressional oversight panel , Elizabeth Warren , said no one even knows the value of the toxic assets still on banks ’ books …
” No one has a good handle how much is out there , ” Warren said .
“ Here we are 10 months into this crisis … and we ca n’t tell you what the dollar value is . ” [ 59 ]
Loan Loss Rates
Loan loss rates in could also be worse than the Great Depression , at least in the United States .
Specifically , during the depths of the Great Depression , the loss rate which banks suffered on their loans climbed as high as 3.4 % ( it is normally well under 2.0 % ) . [ 60 ]
Last month , banking analyst Mike Mayo predicted that loan loss rates could go as high as 5.5 % , which is substantially higher than during the 1930s . [ 61 ]
But the Federal Reserve ’s more adverse scenario for the stress tests – which everyone knows is too rosy concerning most of its assumptions – predicts a loan loss rate of 9.1 % , nearly three times higher than during the 1930s . [ 62 ]
As US News and World Report wrote in May 2009 :
For most of the past 50 years , the loss rate on all bank loans has stayed well under 2 percent .
The Fed estimates that over the next two years the loss rate could reach 9.1 percent .
You know all those historical comparisons that end with “ the worst since the Great Depression ” ?
Well , 9.1 percent would be EVEN WORSE than during the 1930s .
Still looking forward to a soft landing or a quick recovery ? [ 63 ]
Consumer Spending
Consumer spending accounts for the vast majority of the economy in the United States .
The figure commonly cited is that consumer spending accounts for 70 % of U.S. Gross Domestic Product . [ 64 ] .
( Consumer spending has been a lower percentage of GDP in most other countries . [ 65 ] )
But the economic crisis is driving consumer spending downward .
Economist David Rosenberg [ 66 ] says that consumers have undergone a generational shift in spending habits , and will be frugal for a long time to come . [ 67 ]
The head of Collective Brands , Matthew Rubel , states :
Consumer spending as a percentage of GDP has moved down , will probably continue to move down through the end of year , and then normalize as we get into somewhere in early - to - mid next year , from our point of view . [ 68 ]
The chief economist of IHS Global Insight , Nariman Behravesh , says consumer spending will decline to 65 percent of GDP :
With individuals more focused on saving than spending , Behravesh said retail consumer spending as a percentage of GDP is likely to fall from 70 percent to 65 percent .
“ It will take a while , maybe 10 years , ” he said .
“ Correspondingly other countries are going to have to shift in the opposite direction to rely more on their own consumers rather than the U.S. consumers . ” [ 69 ]
Jason DeSena Trennert , Chief Investment Strategist for Strategas Research Partners , says :
Consumer spending as a percentage of GDP is going to go in one direction for a long time — lower . [ 70 ]
Time points out :
Economist Stephen Roach , chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia , says that “ there is good reason to believe the capitulation of the American consumer has only just begun . ”
U.S. consumer spending as a percentage of GDP reached 72 % in 2007 , well above the pre-bubble norm of 67 % .
Using that as a gauge , Roach says that only 20 % of the potential retrenchment of spending has taken place , even after the dramatic decline at the end of 2008 .
“ The imbalance that contributed to the crisis — overconsumption and excessive savings — cannot continue , ” says Ajay Chhibber , director of the Asia bureau at the United Nations Development Program in New York City .
“ The model where you stimulate and [ then ] go back to the old days is gone . ” [ 71 ]
The Wall Street Journal notes :
“ Economists also see an upturn in U.S. household saving as the beginning of a prolonged period of thrift ….. ” [ 72 ]
Demographics
Financial analysts who have studied U.S. demographics – like Harry Dent and Claus Vogt – point out that the U.S. population is aging :
United States Population Pyramid for 2010
Predicted age and sex distribution for the year 2010 :
United States Population Pyramid for 2020
Predicted age and sex distribution for the year 2020 :
United States Population Pyramid for 2050
Predicted age and sex distribution for the year 2050 :
[ 73 ]
Vogt argues that an aging population within a given nation is correlated with a decline in that country ’s economy . [ 74 ] .
Certainly , a population with less working - age people and more dependent elderly people will experience a drag on its economy .
Dent argues that one of the main drivers of a country ’s economic growth is the number of people in the country who are in their peak spending years .
For example , Dent says that in the U.S. , 45 - 54 year olds are the biggest spenders , because that is when – on average – they are paying for their kids ’ college , paying mortgage on the biggest house they will own during their life , etc .
Dent argues that the American economy will tend to grow when the number of 45 - 54 year olds grows , and to shrink when it shrinks .
As the charts above show , the number of 45 - 54 year olds in the U.S. will shrink considerably in the year ahead .
Decline in Manufacturing
As everyone knows , the manufacturing has shrunk in the United States and the service sector has grown .
Even in a manufacturing center such as Detroit , manufacturing jobs have been declining for decades :
[ 75 ]
Indeed , according to professor of economics Dr. Mark J. Perry , manufacturing jobs have dropped to their lowest level since 1941 , and are now below 9 % of the workforce for the first time . [ 76 ]
Wayne State University ’s Center for Urban Studies argues :
For each job lost in the manufacturing industry , more spinoff jobs are lost than would be in other sectors .
Each manufacturing job helps support a larger number of other jobs than do most other sectors . [ 77 ]
That means that the ongoing reduction in manufacturing jobs will adversely affect unemployment for the foreseeable future .
Destruction of Credit
The amount of credit outstanding has been reduced by trillions of dollars in the past year .
For example , the amount of consumer credit outstanding has plummeted :
Banks have become tight - fisted about lending , and this will probably not change any time soon .
As the New York Times wrote in an article from October 2008 entitled “ Banks Are Likely to Hold Tight to Bailout Money ” :
“ Will lenders deploy their new - found capital quickly , as the Treasury hopes , and unlock the flow of credit through the economy ?
Or will they hoard the money to protect themselves ?
John A . Thain , the chief executive of Merrill Lynch , said on Thursday that banks were unlikely to act swiftly .
Executives at other banks privately expressed a similar view .
‘ We will have the opportunity to redeploy that , ’ Mr. Thain said of the new capital on a telephone call with analysts .
‘ But at least for the next quarter , it ’s just going to be a cushion . ’
***
Lenders have been pulling back on credit lines for businesses , mortgages , home equity loans and credit card offers , and analysts said that trend was unlikely to be reversed by the government ’s money .
Roger Freeman , an analyst at Barclays Capital , which acquired parts of the now - bankrupt Lehman Brothers last month [ said ]
‘ My expectation is it ’s quarters off , not months off , before you see that capital being put to work . ’ ” [ 78 ]
And another New York Times article included the following quote :
“ It does n’t matter how much Hank Paulson gives us , ” said an influential senior official at a big bank that received money from the government , “ no one is going to lend a nickel until the economy turns . ”
The official added : “ Who are we going to lend money to ? ” before repeating an old saw about banking : “ Only people who do n’t need it . ” [ 79 ]
Reading between the lines , the bank officials are saying that they will not lend freely until the economic crisis is over .
As WLMLab Bank Loan Performance points out , outstanding loans in the United States have dropped $ 110 billion dollars quarter - over - quarter . [ 80 ]
McClatchy notes :
Over the course of 2008 , the nation ’s five largest banks reduced their consumer loans by 79 percent , real estate loans by 66 percent and commercial loans by 19 percent , according to FDIC data .
A wide range of credit measures , including recent FDIC data , show that lending remains depressed . [ 81 ]
Indeed , total seasonally adjusted consumer debt fell $ 21.55 billion , or at a 10.4 % annual rate , in July 2009 alone .
credit - card debt fell $ 6.11 billion , or 8.5 % , to $ 905.58 billion .
This is the record 11th straight monthly drop in credit card debt .
Non-revolving credit , such as auto loans , personal loans and student loans fell a record $ 15.44 billion or 11.7 % to $ 1.57 trillion [ 82 ]
In addition , the securitization market has largely collapsed , which in turn has destroyed a large proportion of the world ’s credit .
As noted in an article in the Washington Times :
“ Before last fall ’s financial crisis , banks provided only $ 8 trillion of the roughly $ 25 trillion in loans outstanding in the United States , while traditional bond markets provided another $ 7 trillion , according to the Federal Reserve .
The largest share of the borrowed funds – $ 10 trillion – came from securitized loan markets that barely existed two decades ago .
. . . Mr. Regalia [ chief economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce ] said … 70 percent of the system is n’t there anymore , ’ he said . ” [ 83 ]
The reason that seventy percent of the system “ is n’t there anymore ” is because the traditional bond markets and securitized loan markets ( part of the “ shadow banking system ” ) have dried up .
As the Washington Times article notes :
“ Congress ’ demand that banks fill in for collapsed securities markets poses a dilemma for the banks , not only because most do not have the capacity to ramp up to such large - scale lending quickly .
The securitized loan markets provided an essential part of the machinery that enabled banks to lend in the first place .
By selling most of their portfolios of mortgages , business and consumer loans to investors , banks in the past freed up money to make new loans .
. . .
“ The market for pooled subprime loans , known as collateralized debt obligations ( CDOs ) , collapsed at the end of 2007 and , by most accounts , will never come back .
Because of the surging defaults on subprime and other exotic mortgages , investors have shied away from buying the loans , forcing banks and Wall Street firms to hold them on their books and take the losses . ”
Senior economic adviser for UBS Investment Bank , George Magnus , confirms :
The restoration of normal credit creation should not be expected , until the economy has adjusted to the disappearance of shadow bank credit , and until banks have created the capacity to resume lending to creditworthy borrowers .
This is still about capital adequacy , where better signs of organic capital creation are welcome .
More importantly now though , it is about poor asset quality , especially as defaults and loan losses rise into 2010 from already elevated levels . [ 84 ]
And McClatchy writes :
The foundation of U.S. credit expansion for the past 20 years is in ruin .
Since the 1980s , banks have n’t kept loans on their balance sheets ; instead , they sold them into a secondary market , where they were pooled for sale to investors as securities .
The process , called securitization , fueled a rapid expansion of credit to consumers and businesses .
By passing their loans on to investors , banks were freed to lend more .
Today , securitization is all but dead .
Investors have little appetite for risky securities .
Few buyers want a security based on pools of mortgages , car loans , student loans and the like .
“ The basis of revival of the system along the line of what previously existed does n’t exist .
The foundation that was supposed to be there for the revival ( of the economy ) . . . got washed away , ” [ economist James K. ]
Galbraith said .
Unless and until securitization rebounds , it will be hard for banks to resume robust lending because they ’re stuck with loans on their books . [ 85 ]
Not only has the supply of credit been destroyed , but the demand for many types of loans – such as commercial real estate loans – is also drying up . [ 86 ]
So there is simply much less credit flowing through the economic system than there was prior to 2007 .
The New Normal – Lower Economic Activity
As chief economist for the International Monetary Fund , Olivier Blanchard , said :
This recession has been so destructive that “ we may not go back to the old growth path … potential output may be lower than it was before the crisis . ” [ 87 ]
All of the above trends force many economists to conclude that economic activity as a whole will be lower for many , many years .
In other words , they say that “ The New Normal ” will be a much lower level for the economy .
Pimco CEO
Mohamed El - Erian says elevated unemployment and record wealth destruction will keep growth at 2 percent or less for years . [ 88 ]
As Bloomberg writes :
The New Normal theory predicts that the recession will leave unemployment , forecast to reach 10 percent for the first time since 1983 early next year , higher for years . [ 89 ]
Indeed , the “ overhang ” of inventory [ 90 ] - that is , the inventory of unsold goods – in everything from housing [ 91 and 92 ] to cars [ 93 ] to consumer electronics [ 94 ] means that the newly reduced consumer demand is meeting up with very high levels of supply .
This is a recipe for unemployment .
Many economists also point out that the length of time people are remaining unemployed is skyrocketing .
As the Washington Post notes :
Another disturbing development was that the number of people out of work for 27 weeks or longer reached a record 5 million , accounting for a third of the unemployed .
That suggests to some economists that those job losses were caused by structural changes in the economy and that many of those people wo n’t be called back to work once the economy picks up .
The longer people are out of work , the harder it becomes for them to find jobs and the more likely they are to exhaust savings or lose their homes to foreclosure . [ 95 ]
The following chart from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank shows that people are staying unemployed much longer than they have in any previous economic downturn since 1950 :
[ 96 ]
As David Rosenberg writes :
The number of people not on temporary layoff surged 220,000 in August and the level continues to reach new highs , now at 8.1 million .
This accounts for 53.9 % of the unemployed — again a record high — and this is a proxy for permanent job loss , in other words , these jobs are not coming back .
Against that backdrop , the number of people who have been looking for a job for at least six months with no success rose a further half - percent in August , to stand at 5 million — the long - term unemployed now represent a record 33 % of the total pool of joblessness . [ 97 ]
[ 98 : for graphical updates on the state of the economy , see charts from the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank posted at http://www.clevelandfed.org/research/data/updates/index.cfm?DCS.nav=Local]
Another Trend : Increased Productivity Means Less Jobs
All of the aforementioned economic trends point to lower levels of job creation , and thus higher unemployment .
In addition , the chief economist for MarketWatch , Distinguished Scholar of Economics at Dowling College ( Irwin Kellner ) points out that worker productivity is rising , and that increased worker productivity means less new people will be hired . [ 99 ]
Other Theories Regarding the Causes of Unemployment
The main cause of unemployment today is the economic crisis .
For example , a report from the the National Industrial Conference Board pointed out in 1922 stated the obvious : depressions increase unemployment . [ 100 ]
The report also points out that seasonal variations , “ immigration and tariff policies and international relationship ” can affect unemployment figures . [ 101 ]
In fact , economists from different schools of thought ascribe different causes to unemployment .
For example :
Keynesian economics emphasizes unemployment resulting from insufficient effective demand for goods and services in the economy ( cyclical unemployment ) .
Others point to structural problems , inefficiencies , inherent in labour markets ( structural unemployment ) .
Classical or neoclassical economics tends to reject these explanations , and focuses more on rigidities imposed on the labor market from the outside , such as minimum wage laws , taxes , and other regulations that may discourage the hiring of workers ( classical unemployment ) .
Yet others see unemployment as largely due to voluntary choices by the unemployed ( frictional unemployment ) .
Alternatively , some blame unemployment on disruptive technologies or Globalisation .
[ 102 and 103 ]
For example , many Americans believe that globalization has increased unemployment because “ American jobs ” have moved abroad .
Certainly , the American government has encouraged multinational corporations based in the U.S. to move jobs overseas .
But quick fixes may lead to new problems .
For example , a new American protectionism could stifle trade , further weakening the American economy .
Similarly , some economists believe that inflation decreases unemployment .
However , that is only true where the workers drastically underestimate the extent to which higher prices are decreasing the real value of their wages .
Indeed , as the Cato Institute notes :
This reduction in unemployment cannot occur unless workers systematically underestimate the inflation rate .
When workers are aware of the inflation rate and , for example , have their pay adjusted according to the cost of living , they will interpret wages properly and not be misled into thinking that a normal wage offer is a relatively high wage offer .
Rather than merely failing to decrease unemployment , inflation may actually increase the unemployment rate .
Frequent concomitants of inflation , such as high interest rates and volatility and uncertainty in the financial and product markets , increase the risks inherent in business operations and thereby discourage the expansion of firms and the creation of jobs . [ 104 ]
Therefore , many “ quick fixes ” for unemployment may actually do more harm than good .
Is n’t the Government Helping to Reduce Unemployment ?
The government has committed to give trillions to the financial industry .
President Obama ’s stimulus bill was $ 787 billion , which is less than a tenth of the money pledged to the banks and the financial system . [ 105 ]
Of the $ 787 billion , little more than perhaps 10 % has been spent as of this writing . [ 106 ]
The Government Accountability Office says that the $ 787 billion stimulus package is not being used for stimulus . [ 107 ]
Instead , the states are in such dire financial straights that the stimulus money is instead being used to “ cushion ” state budgets , prevent teacher layoffs , make more Medicaid payments and head off other fiscal problems .
So even the money which is actually earmarked to help the states stimulate their economies is not being used for that purpose .
Indeed , much of the $ 787 billion was earmarked pork [ 108 ] , not for anything which could actually stimulate the economy . [ 109 ]
Mark Zandi – chief economist for Moody ’s – has calculated which stimulus programs give the most bang for the buck in terms of the economy :
[ 110 ]
But very little of the stimulus funds are actually going to high - value stimulus projects .
Indeed , as the Los Angeles Times points out :
Critics say the [ stimulus money reaching California ] is being used for projects that would have been built anyway , instead of on ways to change how Californians live .
Case in point :
Army latrines , not high - speed rail .
***
Critics say those are n’t the types of projects with lasting effects on the economy .
“ Whether it ’s talking about building a new [ military ] hospital or bachelor ’s quarters , there is n’t that return on investment that you ’d find on something that increases efficiency like a road or transit project , ” said Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense .
Job creation is another question .
A recent survey by the Associated General Contractors of America found that slightly more than one - third of the companies awarded stimulus projects planned to hire new employees .
But about one - third of the companies that were n’t awarded stimulus projects also planned to hire new employees .
“ While the construction portion of the stimulus is having an impact , it is far from delivering its full promise and potential , ” said Stephen E. Sandherr , chief executive of the contractors group .
It ’s unclear how many jobs will be created through the Defense Department projects .
Most of the construction jobs are awarded through multiple award contracts , in which the department guarantees a minimum amount of business to certain contractors , and lets only those contractors bid on projects .
That means many of the contractors working on stimulus projects already have been busy at work on government projects .
even the stimulus money which is being spent [ 111 ]
David Rosenberg writes :
Our advice to the Obama team would be to create and nurture a fiscal backdrop that tackles this jobs crisis with some permanent solutions rather than recurring populist short - term fiscal goodies that are only inducing households to add to their burdensome debt loads with no long - term multiplier impacts .
The problem is not that we have an insufficient number of vehicles on the road or homes on the market ; the problem is that we have insufficient labour demand . [ 112 ]
Donald W. Riegle Jr. – former chair of the Senate Banking Committee from 1989 to 1994 – wrote ( along with the former CEO of AT&T Broadband and the international president of the United Steelworkers union ) :
It ’s almost as if the administration is opting for a rose - colored - glasses PR strategy rather than taking a hard - nose look at actual consumer and employment figures and their trends , and modifying its economic policies accordingly . [ 113 ]
How Much Unemployment Do We Want ?
On the one end of the spectrum , Article 23 of the United Nations ’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights declares :
Everyone has the right to work , to free choice of employment , to just and favourable conditions of work and to protection against unemployment . [ 114 ]
In other words , the U.N. says that there should be essentially no unemployment for those who wish to work .
On the other end of the spectrum , some people – who make a lot of money during periods where the condition lead to high levels of unemployment – are comfortable with unemployment percentages reaching those in the Great Depression .
Societies should decide for themselves what level of unemployment they consider acceptable , and then demand policies which will accomplish that goal to the greatest extent possible .
As discussed above , there are many factors which affect employment levels , and so solutions are complicated .
However , without an open and visible public policy debate about the issue , unemployment levels will either remain second order affects of policy choices concerning other elements of the economy , or will be decided behind closed doors by decision - makers who may or may not have the best public interest in mind .
Public Funding
As the above facts show , unemployment is a very serious problem in the United states , and world - wide .
The policy responses of the U.S. and other Western governments has not been working .
As discussed above , there is no simple solution .
Senator Riegle recommends a 4 - part prescription , including :
Ensure that loans and credit facilities are readily available to the nation ’s small and medium size businesses and manufacturers .
Many of the top economists argue that we need to break up the giant banks which are insolvent in order to save the economy .
[ 115 ] Fortune [ 116 ] , BusinessWeek [ 117 ] and Federal Reserve governor Daniel K. Tarullo [ 118 ] have pointed out that breaking up the largest , insolvent banks would allow more competition from small to mid-size banks , and that such banks may actually make more loans to small businesses .
More loans to small businesses would lead to more employment by those many small businesses .
In addition , the U.S. has largely been financing job creation for ten years .
Specifically , as the chief economist for BusinessWeek , Michael Mandel , points out , public spending has accounted for virtually all new job creation in the past 1o years :
Private sector job growth was almost non-existent over the past ten years .
Take a look at this horrifying chart : Between May 1999 and May 2009 , employment in the private sector sector only rose by 1.1 % , by far the lowest 10 - year increase in the post - depression period .
It ’s impossible to overstate how bad this is .
Basically speaking , the private sector job machine has almost completely stalled over the past ten years .
Take a look at this chart :
Over the past 10 years , the private sector has generated roughly 1.1 million additional jobs , or about 100 K per year .
The public sector created about 2.4 million jobs .
But even that gives the private sector too much credit .
Remember that the private sector includes health care , social assistance , and education , all areas which receive a lot of government support .
***
Most of the industries which had positive job growth over the past ten years were in the HealthEdGov sector .
In fact , financial job growth was nearly nonexistent once we take out the health insurers .
Let me finish with a final chart .
Without a decade of growing government support from rising health and education spending and soaring budget deficits , the labor market would have been flat on its back . [ 119 ]
Raw Story argues that the U.S. is building a largely military economy :
The use of the military - industrial complex as a quick , if dubious , way of jump - starting the economy is nothing new , but what is amazing is the divergence between the military economy and the civilian economy , as shown by this New York Times chart .
In the past nine years , non-industrial production in the US has declined by some 19 percent .
It took about four years for manufacturing to return to levels seen before the 2001 recession — and all those gains were wiped out in the current recession .
By contrast , military manufacturing is now 123 percent greater than it was in 2000 — it has more than doubled while the rest of the manufacturing sector has been shrinking …
It ’s important to note the trajectory — the military economy is nearly three times as large , proportionally to the rest of the economy , as it was at the beginning of the Bush administration .
And it is the only manufacturing sector showing any growth .
Extrapolate that trend , and what do you get ?
The change in leadership in Washington does not appear to be abating that trend … [ 120 ]
So most of the job creation has been by the public sector .
But because the job creation has been financed with loans from China and private banks , trillions in unnecessary interest charges have been incurred by the U.S .
Former Washington
Post editor and author of one of the leading books on the Federal Reserve , William Greider , points out that governments actually have the power to create money and credit themselves , instead of borrowing it at interest from private banks :
If Congress chooses to take charge of its constitutional duty , it could similarly use greenback currency created by the Federal Reserve as a legitimate channel for financing important public projects –like sorely needed improvements to the nation ’s infrastructure .
Obviously , this has to be done carefully and responsibly , limited to normal expansion of the money supply and used only for projects that truly benefit the entire nation ( lest it lead to inflation ) …
This approach speaks to the contradiction House Speaker Pelosi pointed out when she asked why the Fed has limitless money to spend however it sees fit .
Instead of borrowing the money to pay for the new rail system , the government financing would draw on the public ’s money - creation process–just as Lincoln did and Bernanke is now doing . [ 121 ]
By creating the credit itself – instead of borrowing from private banks and foreign nations – the American government could finance the creation of new jobs without incurring huge interest charges owed to the private banks and foreign countries which lent America the money .
In other words , the U.S. government would itself create the new credit , just as Lincoln did to finance the civil war .
By financing new projects with credit created by the government itself , America might be able to pick itself up by its bootstraps and put its people back to work .
The same may be true for other countries as well .

In Afghanistan last November , the Northern Alliance , supported by American Special Forces troops and emboldened by the highly accurate American bombing , forced thousands of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters to retreat inside the northern hill town of Kunduz .
Trapped with them were Pakistani Army officers , intelligence advisers , and volunteers who were fighting alongside the Taliban .
( Pakistan had been the Taliban ’s staunchest military and economic supporter in its long - running war against the Northern Alliance . )
Many of the fighters had fled earlier defeats at Mazar - i- Sharif , to the west ; Taloqan , to the east ; and Pul - i - Khumri , to the south .
The road to Kabul , a potential point of retreat , was blocked and was targeted by American bombers .
Kunduz offered safety from the bombs and a chance to negotiate painless surrender terms , as Afghan tribes often do .
Surrender negotiations began immediately , but the Bush Administration heatedly — and successfully — opposed them .
On November 25th , the Northern Alliance took Kunduz , capturing some four thousand of the Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters .
The next day , President Bush said , “ We ’re smoking them out .
They ’re running , and now we ’re going to bring them to justice . ”
Even before the siege ended , however , a puzzling series of reports appeared in the Times and in other publications , quoting Northern Alliance officials who claimed that Pakistani airplanes had flown into Kunduz to evacuate the Pakistanis there .
American and Pakistani officials refused to confirm the reports .
On November 16th , when journalists asked Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld about the reports of rescue aircraft , he was dismissive .
“ Well , if we see them , we shoot them down , ” he said .
Five days later , Rumsfeld declared , “ Any idea that those people should be let loose on any basis at all to leave that country and to go bring terror to other countries and destabilize other countries is unacceptable . ”
At a Pentagon news conference on Monday , November 26th , the day after Kunduz fell , General Richard B. Myers , of the Air Force , who is the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , was asked about the reports .
The General did not directly answer the question but stated , “ The runway there is not usable .
I mean , there are segments of it that are usable .
They ’re too short for your standard transport aircraft .
So we ’re not sure where the reports are coming from . ”
Pakistani officials also debunked the rescue reports , and continued to insist , as they had throughout the Afghanistan war , that no Pakistani military personnel were in the country .
Anwar Mehmood , the government spokesman , told newsmen at the time that reports of a Pakistani airlift were “ total rubbish .
Hogwash . ”
In interviews , however , American intelligence officials and high - ranking military officers said that Pakistanis were indeed flown to safety , in a series of nighttime airlifts that were approved by the Bush Administration .
The Americans also said that what was supposed to be a limited evacuation apparently slipped out of control , and , as an unintended consequence , an unknown number of Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters managed to join in the exodus .
“ Dirt got through the screen , ” a senior intelligence official told me .
Last week , Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld did not respond to a request for comment .
Pakistan ’s leader , General Pervez Musharraf , who seized power in a 1999 coup , had risked his standing with the religious fundamentalists — and perhaps his life — by endorsing the American attack on Afghanistan and the American support of the Northern Alliance .
At the time of Kunduz , his decision looked like an especially dangerous one .
The initial American aim in Afghanistan had been not to eliminate the Taliban ’s presence there entirely but to undermine the regime and Al Qaeda while leaving intact so - called moderate Taliban elements that would play a role in a new postwar government .
This would insure that Pakistan would not end up with a regime on its border dominated by the Northern Alliance .
By mid-November , it was clear that the Northern Alliance would quickly sweep through Afghanistan .
There were fears that once the Northern Alliance took Kunduz , there would be wholesale killings of the defeated fighters , especially the foreigners .
Musharraf won American support for the airlift by warning that the humiliation of losing hundreds — and perhaps thousands — of Pakistani Army men and intelligence operatives would jeopardize his political survival .
“ Clearly , there is a great willingness to help Musharraf , ” an American intelligence official told me .
A C.I.A. analyst said that it was his understanding that the decision to permit the airlift was made by the White House and was indeed driven by a desire to protect the Pakistani leader .
The airlift “ made sense at the time , ” the C.I.A. analyst said .
“ Many of the people they spirited away were the Taliban leadership ” — who Pakistan hoped could play a role in a postwar Afghan government .
According to this person , “ Musharraf wanted to have these people to put another card on the table ” in future political negotiations .
“ We were supposed to have access to them , ” he said , but “ it did n’t happen , ” and the rescued Taliban remain unavailable to American intelligence .
According to a former high - level American defense official , the airlift was approved because of representations by the Pakistanis that “ there were guys — intelligence agents and underground guys — who needed to get out . ”
Once under way , a senior American defense adviser said , the airlift became chaotic .
“ Everyone brought their friends with them , ” he said , referring to the Afghans with whom the Pakistanis had worked , and whom they had trained or had used to run intelligence operations .
“ You ’re not going to leave them behind to get their throats cut . ”
Recalling the last - minute American evacuation at the end of the Vietnam War , in 1975 , the adviser added , “ When we came out of Saigon , we brought our boys with us . ”
He meant South Vietnamese nationals .
“ ‘ How many does that helicopter hold ?
Ten ?
We ’re bringing fourteen . ’ ”
The Bush Administration may have done more than simply acquiesce in the rescue effort : at the height of the standoff , according to both a C.I.A. official and a military analyst who has worked with the Delta Force , the American commando unit that was destroying Taliban units on the ground , the Administration ordered the United States Central Command to set up a special air corridor to help insure the safety of the Pakistani rescue flights from Kunduz to the northwest corner of Pakistan , about two hundred miles away .
The order left some members of the Delta Force deeply frustrated .
“ These guys did Desert Storm and Mogadishu , ” the military analyst said .
“ They see things in black - and - white .
‘ Unhappy ’ is not the word .
They ’re supposed to be killing people . ”
The airlift also angered the Northern Alliance , whose leadership , according to Reuel Gerecht , a former Near East operative for the C.I.A. , had sought unsuccessfully for years to “ get people to pay attention to the Pakistani element ” among the Taliban .
The Northern Alliance was eager to capture “ mainline Pakistani military and intelligence officers ” at Kunduz , Gerecht said .
“ When the rescue flights started , it touched a raw nerve . ”
Just as Pakistan has supported the Taliban in Afghanistan , Pakistan ’s arch-rival India has supported the Northern Alliance .
Operatives in India ’s main external intelligence unit — known as RAW , for Research and Analysis Wing — reported extensively on the Pakistani airlift out of Kunduz .
( The Taliban and Al Qaeda have declared the elimination of India ’s presence in the contested territory of Kashmir as a major goal . )
RAW has excellent access to the Northern Alliance and a highly sophisticated ability to intercept electronic communications .
An Indian military adviser boasted that when the airlift began “ we knew within minutes . ”
In interviews in New Delhi , Indian national - security and intelligence officials repeatedly declared that the airlift had rescued not only members of the Pakistani military but Pakistani citizens who had volunteered to fight against the Northern Alliance , as well as non-Pakistani Taliban and Al Qaeda .
Brajesh Mishra , India ’s national - security adviser , said his government had concluded that five thousand Pakistanis and Taliban — he called it “ a ballpark figure ” — had been rescued .
According to RAW ’s senior analyst for Pakistani and Afghan issues , the most extensive rescue efforts took place on three nights at the time of the fall of Kunduz .
Indian intelligence had concluded that eight thousand or more men were trapped inside the city in the last days of the siege , roughly half of whom were Pakistanis .
( Afghans , Uzbeks , Chechens , and various Arab mercenaries accounted for the rest . )
At least five flights were specifically “ confirmed ” by India ’s informants , the RAW analyst told me , and many more were believed to have taken place .
In the Indian assessment , thirtythree hundred prisoners surrendered to a Northern Alliance tribal faction headed by General Abdul Rashid Dostum .
A few hundred Taliban were also turned over to other tribal leaders .
That left between four and five thousand men unaccounted for .
“ Where are the balance ? ” the intelligence officer asked .
According to him , two Pakistani Army generals were on the flights .
None of the American intelligence officials I spoke with were able to say with certainty how many Taliban and Al Qaeda fighters were flown to safety , or may have escaped from Kunduz by other means .
India , wary of antagonizing the Bush Administration , chose not to denounce the airlift at the time .
But there was a great deal of anger within the Indian government .
“ We had all the information , but we did not go public , ” the Indian military adviser told me .
“ Why should we embarrass you ?
We should be sensible . ”
A RAW official said that India had intelligence that Musharraf ’s message to the Americans had been that he did n’t want to see body bags coming back to Pakistan .
Brajesh Mishra told me that diplomatic notes protesting the airlift were sent to Britain and the United States .
Neither responded , he said .
Mishra also said that Indian intelligence was convinced that many of the airlifted fighters would soon be infiltrated into Kashmir .
There was a precedent for this .
In the past , the Pakistani Army ’s Inter - Services Intelligence agency ( I.S.I. ) had trained fighters in Afghanistan and then funnelled them into Kashmir .
One of India ’s most senior intelligence officials also told me , “ Musharraf ca n’t afford to keep the Taliban in Pakistan .
They ’re dangerous to his own regime .
Our reading is that the fighters can go only to Kashmir . ”
Kashmir , on India ’s northern border , is a predominantly Muslim territory that has been fiercely disputed since Partition , in 1947 .
Both India and Pakistan have waged war to support their claim .
Pakistanis believe that Kashmir should have become part of their country in the first place , and that India reneged on the promise of a plebiscite to determine its future .
India argues that a claim to the territory on religious grounds is a threat to India ’s status as a secular , multi-ethnic nation .
Kashmir is now divided along a carefully drawn line of control , but cross - border incursions — many of them bloody — occur daily .
Three weeks after the airlift , on December 13th , a suicide squad of five heavily armed Muslim terrorists drove past a barrier at the Indian Parliament , in New Delhi , and rushed the main building .
At one point , the terrorists were only a few feet from the steps to the office of India ’s Vice - President , Krishan Kant .
Nine people were killed in the shoot - out , in addition to the terrorists , and many others were injured .
The country ’s politicians and the press felt that a far greater tragedy had only narrowly been averted .
In India , the Parliament assault was regarded as comparable to September 11th .
Indian intelligence quickly concluded that the attack had been organized by operatives from two long - standing Kashmiri terrorist organizations that were believed to be heavily supported by the I.S.I .
Brajesh Mishra told me that if the attack on the Parliament had resulted in a more significant number of casualties “ there would have been mayhem . ”
India deployed hundreds of thousands of troops along its border with Pakistan , and publicly demanded that Musharraf take steps to cut off Pakistani support for the groups said to be involved .
“ Nobody in India wants war , but other options are not ruled out , ” Mishra said .
The crisis escalated , with military men on both sides declaring that they were prepared to face nuclear war , if necessary .
Last week , Colin Powell , the Secretary of State , travelled to the region and urged both sides to withdraw their troops , cool the rhetoric , and begin constructive talks about Kashmir .
Under prodding from the Bush Administration , Musharraf has taken action against his country ’s fundamentalist terror organizations .
In the last month , the government has made more than a thousand arrests , seized bank accounts , and ordered the I.S.I. to stop all support for terrorist groups operating inside Kashmir .
In a televised address to the nation on January 12th , Musharraf called for an end to terrorism , but he also went beyond the most recent dispute with India and outlined a far - reaching vision of Pakistan as a modern state .
“ The day of reckoning has come , ” he said .
“ Do we want Pakistan to become a theocratic state ?
Do we believe that religious education alone is enough for governance ?
Or do we want Pakistan to emerge as a progressive and dynamic Islamic welfare state ? ”
The fundamentalists , he added , “ did nothing except contribute to bloodshed in Afghanistan .
I ask of them whether they know anything other than disruption and sowing seeds of hatred .
Does Islam preach this ? ”
“ Musharraf has not done as much as the Indians want , ” a Bush Administration official who is deeply involved in South Asian issues said .
“ But he ’s done more than I ’d thought he ’d do .
He had to do something , because the Indians are so wound up . ”
The official also said , however , that Musharraf could not last in office if he conceded the issue of Kashmir to India , and would not want to do so in any case .
“ He is not a fundamentalist but a Pakistani nationalist — he genuinely believes that Kashmir ‘ should be ours . ’
At the end of the day , Musharraf would come out ahead if he could get rid of the Pakistani and Kashmiri terrorists — if he can survive it .
They have eaten the vitals out of Pakistan . ”
In his address , Musharraf was unyielding on that subject .
“ Kashmir runs in our blood , ” he said .
“ No Pakistani can afford to sever links with Kashmir . . . .
We will never budge an inch from our principled stand on Kashmir . ”
Milton Bearden , a former C.I.A. station chief in Pakistan who helped run the Afghan war against the Soviet Union in the late nineteen - eighties and worked closely with the I.S.I. , believes that the Indian government is cynically using the Parliament bombing to rally public support for the conflict with Pakistan .
“ The Indians are just playing brinkmanship now — moving troops up to the border , ” he said .
“ Until September 11th , they thought they ’d won this thing — they had Pakistan on the ropes . ”
Because of its nuclear program , he said , “ Pakistan was isolated and sanctioned by the United States , with only China left as an ally .
Never mind that the only country in South Asia that always did what we asked was Pakistan . ”
As for Musharraf , Bearden said , “ What can he do ?
Does he really have the Army behind him ?
Yes , but maybe by only forty - eight to fifty - two per cent . ”
Bearden went on , “ Musharraf is not going to be a Kemal Atatürk ” — the founder of the secular Turkish state — “ but as long as he can look over his shoulder and see that Rich Armitage ” — the United States Deputy Secretary of State — “ and Don Rumsfeld are with him he might be able to stop the extremism . ”
A senior Pakistani diplomat depicted India as suffering from “ jilted - lover syndrome ” — referring to the enormous amount of American attention and financial aid that the Musharraf government has received since September 11th .
“ The situation is bloody explosive , ” the diplomat said , and argued that Musharraf has not been given enough credit from the Indian leadership for the “ sweeping changes ” that have taken place in Pakistan .
“ Short of saying it is now a secular Pakistan , he ’s redefined and changed the politics of the regime , ” the diplomat said .
“ He has de-legitimized religious fundamentalism . ”
The diplomat told me that the critical question for Pakistan , India , and the rest of South Asia is “ Will the Americans stay involved for the long haul , or will attention shift to Somalia or Iraq ?
I do n’t know . ”
Inevitably , any conversation about tension between India and Pakistan turns to the issue of nuclear weapons .
Both countries have warheads and the means to deliver them .
( India ’s capabilities , conventional and nuclear , are far greater — between sixty and ninety warheads — while Pakistan is thought to have between thirty and fifty . )
A retired C.I.A. officer who served as station chief in South Asia told me that what he found disturbing was the “ imperfect intelligence ” each country has as to what the other side ’s intentions are .
“ Couple that with the fact that these guys have a propensity to believe the worst of each other , and have nuclear weapons , and you end up saying , ‘ My God , get me the hell out of here . ’ ” Milton Bearden agreed that the I.S.I. and RAW are “ equally bad ” at assessing each other .
In New Delhi , I got a sense of how dangerous the situation is , in a conversation with an Indian diplomat who has worked at the highest levels of his country ’s government .
He told me that he believes India could begin a war with Pakistan and not face a possible nuclear retaliation .
He explained , “ When Pakistan went nuclear , we called their bluff . ”
He was referring to a tense moment in 1990 , when India moved its Army en masse along the Pakistani border and then sat back while the United States mediated a withdrawal .
“ We found , through intelligence , that there was a lot of bluster . ”
He and others in India concluded that Pakistan was not willing to begin a nuclear confrontation .
“ We ’ve found there is a lot of strategic space between a low - intensity war waged with Pakistan and the nuclear threshold , ” the diplomat said .
“ Therefore , we are utilizing military options without worrying about the nuclear threshold . ”
If that turned out to be a miscalculation and Pakistan initiated the use of nuclear weapons , he said , then India would respond in force .
“ And Pakistan would cease to exist . ”
The Bush Administration official involved in South Asian issues acknowledged that there are some people in India who seem willing to gamble that “ you can have war but not use nuclear weapons . ”
He added , “ Both nations need to sit down and work out the red lines ” — the points of no return .
“ They ’ve never done that . ”
An American intelligence official told me that the Musharraf regime had added to the precariousness of the military standoff with India by reducing the amount of time it would take for Pakistan to execute a nuclear strike .
Pakistan keeps control over its nuclear arsenal in part by storing its warheads separately from its missile - and aircraft - delivery systems .
In recent weeks , he said , the time it takes to get the warheads in the air has been cut to just three hours — “ and that ’s too close .
Both sides have their nukes in place and ready to roll . ”
Even before the airlift from Kunduz , the Indians were enraged by the Bush Administration ’s decision to make Pakistan its chief ally in the Afghanistan war .
“ Musharraf has two - timed you , ” a recently retired senior member of India ’s diplomatic service told me in New Delhi earlier this month .
“ What have you gained ?
Have you captured Osama bin Laden ? ”
He said that although India would do nothing to upset the American campaign in Afghanistan , “ We will turn the heat on Musharraf .
He ’ll go back to terrorism as long as the heat is off . ”
( Milt Bearden scoffed at that characterization .
“ Musharraf does n’t have time to two - time anybody , ” he said .
“ He wakes up every morning and has to head out with his bayonet , trying to find the land mines . ” )
Some C.I.A. analysts believe that bin Laden eluded American capture inside Afghanistan with help from elements of the Pakistani intelligence service .
“ The game against bin Laden is not over , ” one analyst told me in early January .
He speculated that bin Laden could be on his way to Somalia , “ his best single place to hide . ”
Al Qaeda is known to have an extensive infrastructure there .
The analyst said that he had concluded that “ he ’s out .
We ’ve been looking for bombing targets for weeks and weeks there but ca n’t identify them . ”
Last week , Donald Rumsfeld told journalists that he believed bin Laden was still in Afghanistan .
Two days later , in Pakistan , Musharraf announced that he thought bin Laden was probably dead — of kidney disease .
A senior C.I.A. official , when asked for comment , cautioned that there were a variety of competing assessments inside the agency as to bin Laden ’s whereabouts .
“ We really do n’t know , ” he said .
“ We ’ll get him , but anybody who tells you we know where he is is full of it . ”
India ’s grievances — over the Pakistani airlift , the continuing terrorism in Kashmir , and Musharraf ’s new status with Washington — however heartfelt , may mean little when it comes to effecting a dramatic change of American policy in South Asia .
India ’s democracy and its tradition of civilian control over the military make it less of a foreign - policy priority than Pakistan .
The Bush Administration has put its prestige , and American aid money , behind Musharraf , in the gamble — thus far successful — that he will continue to move Pakistan , and its nuclear arsenal , away from fundamentalism .
The goal is to stop nuclear terrorism as well as political terrorism .
It ’s a tall order , and missteps are inevitable .
Nonetheless , the White House remains optimistic .
An Administration official told me that , given the complications of today ’s politics , he still believed that Musharraf was the best Pakistani leader the Indians could hope for , whether they recognize it or not .
“ After him , they could only get something worse . ” ♦

MOSCOW 
Just a few years after compelling foreign oil companies to renegotiate their contracts in Russia , Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin has invited executives from some of the largest such companies to discuss new work on Siberian natural gas fields .
Executives from Shell , Exxon Mobil , Total and other companies met with Mr. Putin in Salekhard , a city in the Yamal - Nenets district that is rich in large deposits of untapped natural gas .
Mr. Putin said he called the meeting to discuss strategies to develop the Yamal Peninsula , a treeless realm jutting into the Arctic Ocean that is so dense in gas fields it is sometimes called the Saudi Arabia of gas .
Mr. Putin did not make any specific offers to the gathered energy executives but said instead that he wanted to open a dialogue about the region ’s future .

Content Aware Image Resizing is a way to re-target an image size without modifying its content ratio , in other words : non-linear image resizing .
The algorithm was first explained by Shai Avidan and Ariel Shamir and published in 2007 ( “ Seam Carving for Content - Aware Image Resizing . ” )
Since then several excellent Open Source implementations have been released .
For example , there is a plugin for The Gimp and CAIR a standalone application in C ++.
But thanks to Canvas and JavaScript it ’s now possible to do this in the browser without a plugin .
Since version 1.5 , Firefox offers bitmap manipulation through the Canvas API .
Version 3.5 introduced not only the fastest Firefox JavaScript engine ever , but also a new Canvas method – createImageData – providing a much more powerful environment .
For this demo , a sub part of the Content Aware Image Resizing algorithm has been implemented .
The width of the image can be reduced interactively without modifying its height .
This implementation uses seam carving to re-size the image , subtracting the less visible vertical lines .
It is a four step iterative algorithm .
One iteration is one pixel width re-size .
First an image is loaded into the Canvas context and then the iteration starts :
A grayscale version of the image has to be calculated
The edges of the image ( Sobel convolution is used in our case ) and its energy matrix is computed
The seam of least energy ( 1 pixel vertical line from the bottom to the top of the energy matrix ) is detected Then the pixel of the detected seam is removed from the original image and the result is re-injected as a source image to step 1
Each of the previous steps stores a whole matrix of data at the source image size .
While these matrices are not all images but actually artifacts of the algorithm , storing them in an ImageData object is more convenient than using simple Arrays .
This is why the createImageData method of the Canvas context is used .
One of the benefits of this process is to allow showing the intermediate computations made under the hood .
This demo shows that ’s possible to do more intelligent image resizing than just flattening an image ’s pixels with CSS .
Having computational and image manipulation capabilities directly in the browser opens up a new range of possibilities of how image data can be displayed to users .
This is only one small demonstration of that .
Much of Jammie Thomas - Rasset 's legal arguments following this summer 's $ 1.92 million Recording Industry Association of America file sharing jury verdict against her do n't have much weight or precedent .
Clearly , that a jury in June ordered her to pay $ 80,000 for each of the 24 music tracks she infringed on Kazaa is outrageous and shocks the conscience – and there 's no rational relationship between the amount of harm suffered by the recording industry and the award granted .
Thomas - Rasset was the nation 's first sharing defendant to go before a jury .
The RIAA has filed more than 30,000 lawsuits targeting individuals , and most have settled out of court .
That said , in their latest court papers , ( .pdf ) Thomas - Rasset 's legal team again is sticking to the argument that the whopping jury award is a due process violation – all in a bid perhaps to secure a third trial .
( The first ended in a $ 222,000 judgment against the Minnesota woman , but a mistrial was declared after the judge conceded he gave faulty jury instructions )
Still , it is true that the U.S. Supreme Court and the lower courts have repeatedly reduced lofty jury awards based on so - called due process breaches .
But those were punitive damages awards , not statutory damages awards .
Those punitive damage reductions , including the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster , do not apply to Thomas - Rasset 's case – although Thomas - Rasset 's defense team suggests there 's always a first .
Punitive damages are the amount a jury awards to punish conduct of an offender .
Up until recently , there generally has been no limit .
But the Supreme Court has suggested that punitive damages should be limited to about no more than 10 times the amount of actual damages a jury awards .
Higher ratios , the courts have said , are due process breaches because defendants have no notice ahead of time about the lofty financial consequences of their actions .
But the law is crystal clear when it comes to the Copyright Act , the law under which the RIAA sued Thomas - Rasset .
Juries can award up to $ 150,000 per violation .
Punitive damages do not fall under the Copyright Act .
One of the only points in Thomas - Rasset 's brief that makes a compelling argument is that the Copyright Act , when amended in 1999 , did n't conceive of non-commercial cases the RIAA has been bringing the past six years .
" The notion that Congress decided that the award of statutory damages in this case was somehow appropriate or tailored to ensure deterrence is a fiction that the plaintiffs would have this court adopt .
The Congress that enacted the statutory - damages provision of the Copyright Act could not have had the kinds of illegal but non-commercial music downloading here at issue in mind , " defense attorney K.A.D. Camara argues in recent briefs .
It 's true :
There ’s no doubt that a $ 1.92 million judgment over $ 24 worth of music provides the clearest example yet of the abuses made possible by the 1976 Copyright Act , which Congress modified in 1999 , at the behest of Hollywood and the recording industry , to carry a maximum penalty for a single infringement of up to $ 150,000 .
That statutory penalty was intended to bankrupt large - scale commercial pirating operations , like organized DVD and CD bootleggers – not to put individuals like Thomas - Rasset in debt for the rest of their lives .
Still , the RIAA is crying foul .
After Thomas - Rasset refused to settle out of court , the industry is now demanding that Thomas - Rasset pay up .
The RIAA is also seeking U.S. District Judge Michael Davis to issue an injunction barring her from future file sharing .
" Plaintiffs ’ evidence showed that defendant knew what she was doing was wrong , that she did it anyway , and then lied about it for years .
Through two trials , defendant still shows no remorse whatsoever for her actions and has made it clear that she has no intention of ever satisfying any portion of the judgment against her , " Timothy Reynolds , the RIAA 's attorney , wrote ( .pdf ) Davis .
Judge Davis of Minnesota could rule on the retrial and injunction issue any time .

( CNN ) -- Scientists have discovered the first confirmed Earthlike planet outside our solar system , they announced Wednesday .
An artist 's impression shows what the planet may look like in close orbit with its sun .
" This is the first confirmed rocky planet in another system , " astronomer Artie Hatzes told CNN , contrasting the solid planet with gaseous ones like Jupiter and Saturn .
But " Earthlike " is a relative term .
The planet 's composition may be similar to that of Earth , but its environment is more like a vision of hell , the project 's lead astronomer said .
It is so close to the star it orbits " that the place may well look like Dante 's Inferno , with a probable temperature on its ' day face ' above 3,600 degrees Fahrenheit ( 2,000 degrees Celsius ) and minus - 328 degrees Fahrenheit ( minus 200 degrees Celsius ) on its night face , " said Didier Queloz of Geneva Observatory in Switzerland , the project leader .
Hatzes , explaining that one side of the body is always facing the star and the other side always faces away , said the side " facing the sun is probably molten .
The other side could actually have ice " if there is water on the planet .
" We think it has no atmosphere to redistribute the heat , " Hatzes told CNN from Barcelona , Spain , where he is attending the " Pathways Towards Habitable Planets " conference .
The astronomers were stunned to find a rocky planet so near a star , he said .
" We would have never dreamed you would find a rocky planet so close , " he said .
" Its year is less than one of our days . "
The planet , known as CoRoT - 7b , was detected early last year , but it took months of observation to determine that it had a composition roughly similar to Earth's , the European Southern Observatory said in a statement .
Astronomers were able to measure the dimensions of the planet by watching as it passed in front of the star it orbits , then carried out 70 hours of study of the planet 's effect on its star to infer its weight .
With that information in hand , they were able to calculate its density -- and were thrilled with what they found , Hatzes said .
" What makes this exciting is you compare the density of this planet to the planets in our solar system , it 's only Mercury , Venus and Earth that are similar , " Hatzes , of the Thuringer observatory in Germany , told CNN .
They were helped by the fact that CoRoT - 7b is relatively close to Earth -- about 500 light years away , in the constellation of Monoceros , the Unicorn .
" It 's in our solar neighborhood , " Hatzes said .
" The thing that made it easier is it 's relatively close , so it 's relatively bright .
If this star was much much farther away , we would n't have been able to do these measurements . "
At about five times Earth 's mass ( though not quite twice as large in circumference ) , it is the smallest planet ever spotted outside our solar system .
It also has the fastest orbit .
The planet whizzes around its star more than seven times faster than Earth moves , and is 23 times closer to the star than Mercury is to our sun .
The planet was first detected early in 2008 by the CoRoT satellite , a 30 - centimeter space telescope launched by the European Space Agency in December 2006 , specifically with the mission of detecting rocky planets outside the solar system .
At least 42 scientists at 17 institutions on three continents worked on the project .
They are publishing their findings in a special issue of the Astronomy and Astrophysics journal on October 22 as " The CoRoT - 7 Planetary System : Two Orbiting Super - Earths . "

Federal Labor backbencher Kelvin Thomson says Australia 's projected population explosion will have a " catastrophic " effect on the environment and he has called for immigration levels to be cut .
The latest Intergenerational Report predicts Australia 's population will rise to 35 million in 40 years ' time , up from about 21.5 million people at present .
Higher migration and women having more children will account for the boost in numbers .
Federal Treasurer Wayne Swan says the forecast population growth presents as great a challenge as climate change .
And Mr Thomson says now is the time for population reform .
" We are sleepwalking into an environmental disaster , " he said .
" There will be impact on the availability of food , water , energy and land .
These things are already stretched and a 60 per cent population increase will only drive up the cost of these essentials and lower our living standards .
" And what about the impact on our major cities ?
Declining housing affordability , traffic congestion , over - crowded concrete jungles .
" Australia is blessed in the quality of life that we have and I believe that we have an obligation to pass onto our children an environment and a country in as good a condition as the one our parents left to us . "
Mr Thomson wants Australia 's immigration rate cut .
" I think what we need to do is to go back to the sorts of levels that prevailed in the early to mid-1990s and indeed for many years prior to that ; that will produce better outcomes than the ones we 're getting now , " he said .
Aging population
This projection of 35 million people is significantly higher than those that were produced in the second intergenerational report .
The projection there was 28.5 million in 2047 .
Speaking at the launch of the new Australian Institute For Population Ageing Research , Mr Swan said that over the next 40 years , the number of people aged 65 to 84 would more than double and there would be four - and - a - half times the number of people over 85 .
" I think along with climate change , this is the most substantial challenge we face , " Mr Swan said .
" It 's an intergenerational challenge , it 's an economic challenge , it 's a social challenge and it goes to the core in the end of the type of country we want to be . "
The Government has already pushed up the retirement age but Mr Swan says more will need to be done .
" The Government needs to facilitate the significant contribution that older people can make to the economy and the community , and that also means an unparalleled degree of social engagement and changes of approach in that area , " he said .
There is good news in the figures : there will be more younger people than predicted in previous intergenerational reports .
A demographer at the Australian National University , Peter McDonald , says the younger people will help pay for the costs of a rising population and a growing number of older Australians .
" The demographic changes we 've seen are making us relatively younger than we would have been otherwise , " he said .
" And the effects there are quite substantial on budget because a lot of the costs associated with ageing are health costs and the income support costs .
" They wo n't be quite as big as , relatively , compared to the size of the labour force , as we 'd predicated in the past .
" As we 've gone through these intergenerational reports the first one was very pessimistic , the second one was a bit more optimistic and now this one is even more optimistic again in respect to the costs of ageing . "
Infrastructure and environment
But Mr McDonald says the increase in population will provide some challenges , particularly for cities .
" Cities will be bigger than we 'd projected in the past and ... we already have problems in our cities , " he said .
" So urban infrastructure is going to be very , very important .
" We have to be considering the potential environmental effects of a bigger population but I think we can deal with those .
" What we 're talking about here is a bigger labour force and that labour force will be generating wealth , and so Australia is liable to be quite a wealthy country .
" I think that 's going to give us the income to make all the environmental changes that we have to make . "
SANTA BARBARA , California ( Reuters ) - Some 30,000 marijuana plants were seized from a pot farm run for a Mexican drug cartel in a remote corner of a national forest charred by an 88,000 - acre ( 35,600 - hectare ) wildfire , California officials said on Tuesday .
Authorities have said the blaze was sparked August 8 by a cooking fire lit by marijuana growers camped out in the mountains of Los Padres National Forest , about 150 miles ( 240 km ) northwest of Los Angeles .
The suspects , believed to number between two and six , fled the immediate area and remain at large , officials said .
Investigators discovered the site days later while seeking the origin of the fire .
The marijuana was linked to Mexican drug traffickers in part because of the size and sophistication of the cultivation , Santa Barbara County sheriff ’s officials said .
“ There ’s other evidence there that suggests that as well , and some of this is evidence we just ca n’t talk about , ” sheriff ’s spokesman Drew Sugars told Reuters .
A crop of 30,000 cannabis plants , some 6 feet ( two metres ) tall , were found growing on the side of a mountain , where the pot farmers had diverted a nearby stream to provide irrigation , Sugars said .
Most of the plants survived the fire , he said .
Also found at the site were stacks of propane tanks , irrigation tubing , empty containers of fertilizer , a charred cooking stove , mounds of trash and a semiautomatic rifle .
The fire ultimately charred more than 88,000 acres , making it by far the largest ever started in the forest by suspected drug traffickers , U.S. Forest Service special agent Russ Arthur told a news conference .
Authorities said 2009 has so far been a banner year for pot eradication by the Forest Service and the sheriff ’s department in Santa Barbara County , where more than 250,000 plants with a street value of about $ 675 million ( 407.9 million pounds ) have been seized .
In late July , authorities ripped up 113,000 plants near the area where the latest fire began , Sugars said .
The model is to take pride of place in a glass case at the station Firefighters at a North Yorkshire fire station are trying to trace a mystery man who presented them with a gift and left without giving his name .
The man walked into Tadcaster fire station on 16 September with a hand - crafted matchstick model of a vintage fire engine .
Station manager Cecil Pugh said : " He told us he would like to give us this in appreciation of the work we do .
" We tried to get his name but he said ' Just call me Mr X ' and walked out . "
Mr Pugh said : " We were amazed by the quality of his work .
He must have spent many hours on it .
" We were really touched and would love to be able to thank him properly for it .
" We do get letters of appreciation from time to time but this is the first time we have ever had anything like this . "
The model has a brass plate inscribed with the words : " To Tadcaster Fire Service .
Times change - the dedication endures . "
Staff now plan to put the model in a glass case to be displayed at the station .

For our latest mission , we installed a photography studio on a random subway car .
We claimed that the MTA had hired us to take photos of every single person who rides the subway and that we’d be producing a yearbook at the end of the year .
Most people were happy to pose for us , and the resulting photos show just how diverse New York subway riders can be .
Enjoy the video first and then check out the mission report and photos below .
6 Train , Car 9 — September 6 , 2009 — 3:30 PM
This mission was tons of fun for me personally , because it really reminded me of the early days of Improv Everywhere .
Those first couple of years we did so many simple ideas on the subway all with the simple goal of making people laugh and smile .
It ’s great to work on projects with thousands of people , but it ’s also fun to see what you can do with just a couple of folks and a few props .
Agents Nicholson , Duarte , Martini
We collaborated with local production company Hello World on this mission .
They wanted to film us for a Brazillian TV show , so we invited them to be a part of team .
The show ’s hosts , Agents Duarte and Martini , played the role of the “ ringers ” – they ’d blend in with the crowd on the train and hop up to get their photo taken to encourage others to do the same .
One nice thing about working with Hello World is that they specialize in shooting video with the fancy new Canon DSLR cameras .
Since the Canons looked like still cameras , no one would know they were filming .
Filming my intro
For our roles as the photographer and the photographer ’s assistant , Agent Nicholson and I wanted to try to dress on the cheesy side , to emulate the yearbook photographers we remembered from high school .
I shaved my beard and left a ridiculous mustache and paired it with a $ 7.99 short sleeve dress shirt I found on the K - Mart clearance rack .
Agent Nicholson wore a matching blue shirt , matching khakis , and a sport coat .
Setting up
After getting organized we took to the 6 Train ( clearly by now Improv Everywhere ’s favorite train ) and set up our studio .
We clamped a blue backdrop sheet to the poles , and set up our stool , tripod , and flashes .
We set up at the end of the car and did our best to not make things too cramped .
Still , it was a comically small space for a photo studio .
Riders gawk as we set up
People enter at the first stop
Things got crowded pretty quickly
My main job as the photographer ’s assistant was to inform everyone who entered the car about our project .
We claimed that we had been hired by the MTA to make a 2009 / 2010 yearbook of the entire subway system .
“ Today we ’re on car number 9 of the 6 train , ” I said , “ We ’ll here all day , and we ’ll move to car number 8 tomorrow .
Then on to the next line .
It ’s a long process . ”
Making a complete yearbook is a pretty absurd idea if you really think about it– over 4.3 million people ride the subway each day in New York .
Laughing
We were n’t sure how easy it would be to get people to sit for a photo .
We were pleasantly surprised by how willing most people were to be a part of it .
We ended up not really needing our “ ringer ” agents more than once or twice – the stool was almost always occupied .
Signing our bogus MTA form
We took down everyone ’s email addresses after their photo and , as promised , emailed them a link to download their portrait .
You ca n’t beat that free service !
As you would expect , the train ride was pretty bumpy .
A few riders opted to hold Agent Nicholson ’s hand as they walked over to the stool .
Some held on to the nearby pole during their shot .
We had to work hard to keep our umbrella flash stands and the tripod from falling over at every twist and turn , but it added to the absurdity of our studio .
Agent Nicholson snaps a photo of Agent Sokoler snapping a photo
I had a mirror on hand in case anyone needed it before posing .
Agent Nicholson ended up gaff - taping his tripod to the pole .
It was fun watching people make the decision to participate .
The guy above was amused by what we were doing but told me he definitely did n’t want to pose .
After watching a few others do it , he changed his mind .
A more serious pose
While Agent Nicholson snapped away , I continued my job of recruiting new subjects .
I could n’t talk everyone into it but most everyone was polite and fun to talk to .
This woman was nice , but told me she was sure she did n’t want her photo taken .
A moment later she was smiling as someone else posed , and then looked at me , shrugged , and sat down herself .
Checking the mirror
Once we reached 125th Street , we got out and rode the train back down town , repeating the mission a second time .
This woman ’s reaction was great .
She was definitely taken off guard by our studio .
But just a few minutes later , she came over and posed .
I noticed a woman on the other side of the car who was putting a little bit of makeup on .
She had n’t volunteered yet , but I could tell she was quietly preparing .
I called her out on it , and she laughed and walked over to the stool .
Almost all of the people who did not want to participate were still able to let their guard down and listen to our pitch with a smile .
The woman facing the door in the photo above was probably the only person we really failed to reach in any way .
She walked directly to the door and faced away from us for several stops , doing her best to completely ignore us .
Oh well .
Towards the end of our second ride , there was a family of five who posed for us .
It was exciting to get an infant in our yearbook !
As the train approached the last stop , Agent Nicholson and I posed for a few photos in our studio before taking it down .
It was a super fun afternoon .
While conventional wisdom would have you believe that New Yorkers are cynical and gruff – we had no trouble finding lots of fun people willing to get on board with two lame looking dudes in cheap blue dress shirts .

I remember when I first moved to the city eight years ago , I was blown away by the diversity on the subway .
You can be on a train car in Queens and look around to realize that every single rider has a unique ethnicity .
It was fun to capture that diversity with these photos , and to also show how much in common we all have .
We may have different backgrounds , but we ’re all in the same damn yearbook !
Mission Accomplished .

THERE may be no better way to bait a baby boomer than to be anything less than totally reverential about the Beatles .
So the news that the lads from Liverpool were taking fresh form in a video game ( a video game ! ) called The Beatles : Rock Band struck some of the band ’s acolytes as nothing less than heresy .
Luckily , Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr , along with the widows of George Harrison and John Lennon , seem to understand that the Beatles are not a museum piece , that the band and its message ought never be encased in amber .
The Beatles : Rock Band is nothing less than a cultural watershed , one that may prove only slightly less influential than the band ’s famous appearance on “ The Ed Sullivan Show ” in 1964 .
By reinterpreting an essential symbol of one generation in the medium and technology of another , The Beatles : Rock Band provides a transformative entertainment experience .
In that sense it may be the most important video game yet made .
Never before has a video game had such intergenerational cultural resonance .
The weakness of most games is that they are usually devoid of any connection to our actual life and times .
There is usually no broader meaning , no greater message , in defeating aliens or zombies , or even in the cognitive gameplay of determining strategy or solving puzzles .

Games
Previous titles in the Rock Band and Guitar Hero series have already done more in recent years to introduce young people to classic rock than all the radio stations in the country .
But this new game is special because it so lovingly , meticulously , gloriously showcases the relatively brief career of the most important rock band of all time .
The music and lyrics of the Beatles are no less relevant today than they were all those decades ago , and by reimagining the Beatles ’ message in the unabashedly modern , interactive , digital form of now , the new game ties together almost 50 years of modern entertainment .
Freedom’s on the March ???
On the birthday of the Bill of Rights , Thursday , December 15th , 2006 I attempted to enter the Arizona State Capitol Building as I have at least a few times a year for the past 17 years .
While I am not known to carry a visible firearm on a regular basis I always make a point of “ strapping on ” when I go visit the capitol .
For the first time I was told that the Capital Police will no longer check my firearm .
This is of particular interest to me since it was the fact that the Capital Police ‘ did ’ check firearms that all other near by state buildings did n’t have to provide that service to be in compliance with the law ( In their opinion of course ) .
Arizona law requires that “ when asked ” you must allow your firearm to be checked .
Now while you can not be charged with a gun crime when willing to have your firearm checked by the local 7 Eleven , you can be charged with trespassing .
Legislators tried to get Concealed Carry Legislation amended to force private store owners to allow guns on their property , like it or not .
Libertarians came to the defense of private property owners and argued that no right can trump another .
The right to voluntary association and property rights can not be trumped by someone claiming the right to carry a firearm on your private property .
But public / government property is a whole other matter .
In the late 90 ’s the State of Arizona made the claim , “ just like private property owners ” they had the right to restrict the carrying of firearms at highway rest stops .
If you were a woman in need of a rest break at 1 am on the lone desert highway you were at the mercy of the thugs hanging out at the rest stops .
Signs declared ( in error ) that you had to keep your firearms in your car .
This only disarmed the law abiding .
In a restroom stall with your panties around your ankles you were nothing more than prey .
As the stats built up in Arizona we made a stand and challenged the law by openly carrying in front of Law Enforcement and the press at parks and rest stops until the signs were corrected .
But with 9/11 came the race to fortify every government building in the country so we looked like a Central American dictatorship .
Every month for over 5 years my wife would drive down to the State Department of Revenue to pay our State Sales Tax collected by our Family Restaurant .
She would go in person because the deadline was later than mailing it in and she would take the time as a break and do other things with her day downtown .
Post 9/11 the Director of the Department of Revenue saw fit to install medal detectors .
AzDOR Director Mark Killian was a former Speaker of the House in Arizona and knew how the system worked .
In fact it was Mr. Killian that informed me in the mid 90’s that nothing gets done in government without the insistence of the public .
If the public does n’t care , then neither does he .
Very good advice I took seriously .
Since then I have always directed my activism towards getting and maintaining the public ’s attention on what is really important around an issue and wasted no time on the opinions of legislators and judges .
So my wife Donna would be required to check her firearm for the 5 minutes that she spent at the DOR ( Department of Revenue ) .
This she tolerated , and made quick friends with the security guard that worked for a private contractor .
Donna learned that he was constantly having problems getting to work with his firearm when using the bus system ( another story ) .
It was exactly at this time that I and other activist friends were asked to help a young woman that worked at the AZDOR that was trained and had a CCW permit that could no longer bring her firearm with her .
Shannon Flynn had been molested by her father since a young girl and constantly had her life threatened if she ever turned him in .
In her mid teens she did have him arrested .
Years later her father was scheduled for release and she feared for her life .
Shannon Flynn Background Story Shannon had grown into a strong woman that realized she was responsible for her own life .
Her government employer also made it clear that even having the firearm in her car at work would result in her termination .
This made her a disarmed victim from the front door of her home to work and back and that was totally unacceptable to her and her husband Steve .
Arizona
Gun activists are a very effective bunch Remnant of that campaign Years of honing their skills and networking with all sort of freedom activists have provided them with talents available at a moments notice from at least dozens of sources in many fields of expertise .
I was able to talk with Mark Killian and warn him of what was to come but as is usually the case they only know that they are on the side of the government and that we are defenseless against them , … in their opinion .
The first mission was to get this story out into the public .
Media was easy considering the material and the ability of Shannon to make her case clear and unwavering .
The government ’s position was in a constant state of flux with constant pressure being put on the director Mark Killian and those above him .
Every day at lunch little signs would be placed around the DOR building with various messages .
One of the most effective was a cartoon of the director standing in front of the building with a sign in the grass that said , “ The Killian Fields ” ( The old web address is no longer in use but the files are ready for reuse www.unarmedvictimzone.com)
The next step by the government was to no longer allow the public to check firearms at the guard station and require that they travel a ¼ mile away to have their firearms checked at the state capitol building by the Capitol Police .
It was their argument that this would put them in compliance with the law .
Now that my family was directly involved it was “ Game On ” .
The New York Times article , “ Gun Owners Take Their Concerns to Court ” and my guest column in the Arizona Republic , Why trust the politicians who take your guns ?
( heavily plagiarized from L. Neil Smith with his permission ) was just part of the benefit of the legal challenge .
A great deal of effort went into the legal arguments over a weekend of pizza and beer .
We knew the work would benefit us and others in the years to come .
There was the Original Filing and the following argument in the form of a Response where the meat was served Core of Legal Arguments for Future Use .
One clear point of the whole exercise was to point out how the government here in Arizona has no respect for the State or the US Constitutions and the clear wording of the law is interpreted easy enough by simply refusing to rule on the case , … dismissed .
But the main point made well before the beginning of the effort was how the media really works .
In anticipation of my being arrested for attempting to check my firearm , fearing I would rush the check point ???? , the TV press , the print media , some legislators and about 60 activist with signs , guns and guitars were present .
Once refused entry I addressed the crowd with Attorney Marc J. Victor at my side I made it clear that the spectacle would not see a single bit of news coverage due to the fact that there was no “ Government Number ” .
Six days later when the civil suit was filed I was all over the press internationally .
Without an arrest number , court filing number , campaign filing number , initiative / referendum / recall number or any piece of paper with a government seal on it the press will not address any situation where the individual is having their rights violated by the government .
The government number gives the media “ permission ” in their minds to cover the issue .
This brings me to the reason I was at the State Capitol .
The host of the morning show that I produce on Air America here in Phoenix is Charles Goyette .
He came to the nation ’s attention a few years ago when he was fired by the ClearChannel talk radio station here in Phoenix because he refused to support the war in Iraq .
Months before his contract was up he wrote a column in the American Conservative entitled , “ How to Loose Your Job in Talk Radio ” .
Charles and I were on the same station where I hosted a daily radio program “ Declare Your Independence with Ernest Hancock ” I later became Charles ’ producer and we were hired away by Air America to do the morning program Charles Goyette Archive .
Charles and I are both libertarians now spreading the word to the left .
A good friend of Charles ’ is a well known comedian ( Tonight Show appearances ) Chris Bliss .
While Chris leans more Democrat than libertarian he understands the philosophy and recognizes general hypocrisy when he witnesses it .
During the national debate on Ten Commandment monuments being on public land he did n’t feel the need to be too concerned until he learned on his own that there was n’t a single monument to the Bill of Rights in America .
Even though he had some catching up to do ( as do most of us ) on the history and intent of the document , he was concerned that the document was becoming irrelevant in the minds of the American people .
He commented on the fact that the Bush Administration feared a religious fundamentalist government in the Middle East but that it was becoming a requirement here in America .
Self motivated to do something about it he created The Foundation Foundation MyBillofRights.org with the goal of privately funding the production of monuments to the Bill of Rights to be placed on public land where ever there were monuments to the Ten Commandments .
Many had been placed as a promotional tool for the movie The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston back in the 50’s .
With only a few conversations with interested people while creating the web site , arranging for fund raising events and creating a marketing campaign , legislators and activists across the country are jumping at the chance to introduce legislation providing a few square feet of space to allow the placement of a privately funded monument to the Bill of Rights .
In fact Chris has limited donations to no more than $ 100 per person so that it is truly from “ The People ” as a clear message to government on their limitations .
I was at the Arizona Capitol delivering postcards to the mail room for the legislators and press room promoting the Arizona Breakfast Club that has meet each Saturday for 37 years The Saturday Morning Arizona Breakfast Club .
The postcard also promoted the Benefit for The Bill of Rights Comedy Concert at the Improv in Tempe , Arizona January 24th , 2006 where Tonight Show regular Chris Bliss and Letterman favorite Wayne Cotter will perform .
Air America Phoenix is promoting it and Charles Goyette will be part of the program .
Here in Arizona there is already a bill drafted to provide the location for the monument .
Kyrsten Sinema is a freshman state representative , Democrat that Co-Hosts a 2 hour show on the radio station Air America Phoenix / www.1010KXXT.com and has agreed to sponsor the bill .
While Arizona has a Democratic Governor , Janet Napolitano , both legislative houses are Republican .
Leaders in the Republican Party have been very vocal in their support of the idea and secretly hope to turn it into a Republican bill .
However any attempt to make it a “ partisan ” issue will do them more harm than good so the race might be about who can be the most gracious .
While Kyrsten is proudly the most socialist legislator , the most Conservative in the minds of many is the champion of Immigration Reform here in Arizona , Russell Pearce .
Russell is the Appropriations Chairman in the House of Representatives and is a very powerful legislator on several fronts .
Of great interest to me is if the Bill of Rights can bring these two legislators together in cooperation over promoting the rights of individuals and the limits of government .
Personal conversations with both leave me wondering .
Personally I see them both willing to sacrifice the rights of the individual if it empowers the state to accomplish their goals to socially or economically engineer the people .
Both understand my views and reasoning but are willing to take on this issue for at least the political gain .
The postcard also gave the schedule for the Arizona Breakfast Club that included this Saturday ’s meeting that features the nephew of the late Barry Goldwater .
Don Goldwater is seeking the Republican nomination for Arizona Governor but will face a Primary Opponent with the Christian Right in his hip pocket .
Len Munsil is the Chairman of the Center for Arizona Policy and is making certain that the issue of “ Gay Marriage ” is front and center in Arizona .
A ballot initiative is being circulated to ban Gay Marriage in Arizona .
Weeks after the 2004 election , Libertarian candidate for Governor Barry Hess , myself , my wife Donna and Arizona School Choice Trust founder Jack McVaugh met with Len Muncil and the Arizona Policy Center staff .
( Arizona School Choice Trust donate to the School Choice Trust before the end of the year and direct your taxes to a great cause – very libertarian – at no cost )
The purpose of the meeting was , … well , it ’s a Christian thing .
All of us are Christians ( I just ca n’t put myself in the same category as many ) and the ‘ Christian ’ thing to do is to confront your brothers and sisters and discuss where you think they are going down the dark path etc .
The attempt to beg ‘ Caesar ’ to define the intimate and personal relationship called marriage and still consider it “ Holy Matrimony ” is wrong on many levels .
The whole idea that special rights and / or privileges are granted certain individuals based on their living arrangements is social and economic engineering at its worst and can not be supported by the Constitution .
While Christian teachings define marriage , I can’t find where Caesar is asked to sanction the rite of the church .
When the Priest at my wedding said , “ By the power vested in me by the state of , … ” I remember thinking , ‘ that was n’t in the rehearsal ’ Published Issue Articles by Ernest Hancock
… I just got back from the Arizona Breakfast Club where the featured speaker was Don Goldwater .
The conversation was lively but the responses were typical .
“ reality dictates that we must accept … ”
The status Quo was defended except where point could be made like on things like the building of border fences using the labor of illegal immigrants that had been caught .
This will get support from some and begin an interesting discussion .
But the vigorous defense of individual rights was n’t going to be a part of the Goldwater administration .
He stated that he was Pro-Life except in the case of incest , rape or the mother ’s life ( which is n’t good enough for some – here comes Len Munsil ) .
Don Goldwater ’s last 7 years were spend as the Director of Special Events for the Arizona State Department of Administration ( never did get a clear explanation of what that job was ) .
So , Don was in the middle of the battle over gun rights of the people vs. the desire of the government not having to be bothered with armed citizens using the public buildings .
He sided with the government ’s position .
Don Goldwater is a politician .
‘ What is practical , doable , prudent at this juncture , politically viable ’ etc .
Total elimination of any program or tax is n’t on the table , not even the State Income Tax .
I do n’t expect any fire in this campaign .
There was a student that was a leader in the Young Republicans at ASU that came .
At 19 he was well versed in the textbook mechanics of what government was suppose to be about but the real life politics has yet to slap him in the face and he was surprised at some of the comments and positions of the people at the breakfast club .
I think I scared him a bit with things like the history and news on Vote Fraud , Barry Hess gave him a dose on the issue of voting in general and a couple of others shared their thoughts on several “ conspiracies ” .
So he ’s never going to be the same .
How and why the best of the Republicans went libertarian or even anarchist might be best explained by the 1980 Oscar Winning Short Documentary , “ Karl Hess - Toward Liberty ” .
Karl was Barry Goldwater ’s friend and speech writer and this 26 minute documentary tells a tale the right does n’t want told View film online here )
Another factor an my motivation for writing this “ day in the life of ” , is that in the 3rd hour of Charles ’ show on Friday Cory Maye is a man on Death Row show another story of what happens when we allow special treatment given government agents .
Radley Balko www.theagitator.com
Cory Maye is a man on Death Row for killing a policeman that busted into his house by mistake .
While researching a paper for Cato on the issue of No Knock Warrents Radley Balko came across case after case where a law enforcement officer was not charged or was found innocent for killing an innocent person during no knock warrent raids .
Cory 's case is about a man at home defending his family and finding himself on death row ( BTW - the policeman was the son of the retired Cheif of Police in that small Mississippi town - found guilty , Cory was immediately sentenced to Death ) .

[ Editor ’s note : see also rounds 1 - 3 of our debate on originalism , interpretation , and whether the Constitution actually means anything .
Austin Bramwell , “ Original Sins ” ; Kevin R. C. Gutzman , “ The Genuine Article ” ; and Bramwell , “ Best of Intentions . ” ]
Austin Bramwell began his first attack on me by saying that he had read my books .
In his second , he quotes at length from Lysander Spooner , as if I were unaware of his argument .
Yet , Tom Woods and I quote Spooner in the conclusion to Who Killed the Constitution ?
right before we observe that perhaps the history of America ’s experiment with written constitutions proves that the idea is a failure .
It may be that to expect government officials to exercise only limited powers simply because they have taken an oath to abide by written constitutions is unrealistic .
Perhaps once the government has a monopoly of force , inherent human selfishness and self - regard will lead ineluctably to unlimited government .
Bramwell does not care about that .
Not only does he boast of having invented a novel argument for unlimited congressional power under the Fourteenth Amendment , but he argues the irrelevance of the consent of the governed .
What matters , according to Bramwell , is that the people be governed well .
In other words , do the trains run on time ?
I have little to say about constitutions to someone who cares neither about the consent of the governed nor about limitations on government authority .
Those are the only two principles underlying the American experiment in written constitutions .
If you are uninterested in either idea , you may as well join Bramwell in saying that the Fourteenth Amendment has no meaning , and so Gutzman is wrong to insist that it ( or , apparently , any other constitutional provision ) does .
Laurence Tribe and William Brennan could not have said it any better .
This is what I meant when I said that Bramwell was merely parroting what he learned at an elite American law school .
He thinks I slighted his signal contribution to untethered judging , his universally unheeded theory about the Fourteenth Amendment .
He asks me to help him locate others who have agreed with him , even offers to pay me to do so , and I respectfully decline .
I tell him here and now , however , that I am certain without even reading it that it is no worse an argument than anything Justice Brennan deigned to emit .
I do not waste my time scouting out all of the idiosyncratic justifications for unlimited power , from Caligula to the present .
They have contributed nothing to civilization .
On the other hand , Bramwell seemingly considers the many different iterations of Brennan ’s “ Rule of Five ”  
( With five votes , I can do whatever I want ) offered up by Supreme Court justices from time to time to be worthy of serious attention .
He can go on Westlaw and count the number of times that Supreme Court opinions have included the phrase “ evolving standards of decency , ”  and then return to tell us it is only three score .
Wow !
Gutzman is wrong : Brennan and Company have not been guided solely by that slogan .
But , of course , I never said that they had been .
I pointed out that they have in many areas been guided only by their whims ; “ evolving standards of decency ”  is but one pithy way they justified themselves .
Who cares that they cloak it in different garb in non-Eight Amendment contexts ?
I never denied it .
I don” t care .
It doesn ” t matter .
One reason why I consider it unlikely that the U.S. Constitution can be resuscitated is that legal training is so unlike education .
People like Bramwell , having paid good money for their JDs , consider themselves expert in constitutional history ” even when , as in his case , they are not .
Consider the first - semester undergraduate or law school course in constitutional law .
In the first session , students typically learn the meaning of Marbury v. Madison ( 1803 ) , the Supreme Court decision laying claim to the power of judicial review .
In the typical second session , students meet McCulloch v. Maryland ( 1819 ) , in which Chief Justice John Marshall adopted Alexander Hamilton ’s argument for nearly unlimited congressional power under the Necessary and Proper Clause .
Bramwell tells us that I am wrong to say that McCulloch held that the Necessary and Proper Clause empowered Congress to charter a bank .
He tells us that the holding was based on the Tax and Spending Clause .
His first error lies in thinking that Marshall says that that clause ( along with the several others to which Marshall refers ) empowers Congress to spend without reference to the objects of the spending , when Marshall ’s opinion first takes great pains to say that the object of the spending is appropriate under the Necessary and Proper Clause .
R. Kent Newmyer , in the leading scholarly Marshall biography , says that “  the question at hand ”  in McCulloch was “  What , in short , was the meaning of “ necessary and proper ? ”  ”  
In a different work , his classic account of the Supreme Court under Marshall and his successor , Roger B . Taney , Newmyer says of McCulloch that , “   The scope of congressional power , then , came to hang on the meaning of “ necessary . ”  ” 
The editor of Marshall ’s papers , Charles Hobson , in his Marshall biography notes James Madison ’s objection that McCulloch broke down the Constitution ’s intended link between the Necessary and Proper Clause and the enumeration of congressional powers in Article I , Section 8 .
Marshall ’s opinion in the case is very complex , but Hobson summarizes the key section by saying that Marshall first enunciated a rule for applying the Necessary and Proper Clause , and then applied that rule to the facts at hand to arrive at his holding .
You can believe Bramwell , or you can believe Newmyer and Hobson .
Or , if you don ” t have time to read Newmyer and Hobson , you can sit in on the second session of an introductory course in constitutional law .
I cannot believe that I am debating this .
Bramwell notes that I insist on Jefferson ’s standard of constitutionalism : that a constitution be interpreted “ according to the true sense in which it was adopted by the States , that in which it was advocated by its friends . ” 
He then provides extensive quotations from Alexander Hamilton and James Madison to the effect that one must not , as Bramwell puts it , “ look into the intention of those who wrote it . ” 
Apparently Bramwell does not know the difference between the Philadelphia Convention that wrote the Constitution and the state conventions that ratified it .
I agree with Hamilton and Madison that one should not ask what the Philadelphia Convention intended , even as I agree with Madison and Jefferson that one should ask what the ratification conventions understood .
The ratification conventions did not write the Constitution , but they were the ones who gave it effect .
They were , in a constitutional sense , the legislators whose understanding counts .
Their understanding was shaped by what the Constitution ’s friends said of it while it was being considered for ratification , as Jefferson said .
If , as Bramwell implied in his first piece , he had read my books , he would know that .
If , as Bramwell implied in his first piece , he had read my on - line articles , he would know that .
If he had simply read the Constitution itself , he would know that .
He makes the same mistake when , under “   It is unclear whose expectations one should consult , ”  he says , “  We can start with the handful of men who actually drafted the Constitution ’s provisions . ” 
Why would we do that ?
Not for any reason I know .
They had no power to make law .
One might as well interpret my will by asking not what I meant , but what my lawyer meant .
Perhaps Bramwell sets up this straw man simply so that he can knock it down , but it seems more likely that he has confused the men who wrote the Constitution ( whose opinions Hamilton and Madison called irrelevant ) with those who ratified it ( to whose understanding Madison , Jefferson , and I said one must look ) .
I realize that taking up all of Bramwell ’s Brennan -/ Tribe -/ Douglas - like excuses for rejecting originalism in sequence is more than a typical reader will have patience to bear .
I don” t have patience for it either .
What it comes down to is that Bramwell believes ”  indeed , has said in his two Takimag pieces asserting that I don ” t understand the Constitution ” that the Constitution ’s text has no meaning , that the consent of the governed is a non-issue , and that arguments for unlimited government power are worth inventing .
If he feels bound to cloak that position in a lot of mistaken assertions about my having erred , one should not lose sight of the forest for the trees .

Bramwell says that Alexander Hamilton ranks with James Madison as one of the two greatest Framers .
He is right only in the sense that Madison was among the five greatest presidents : Madison was a great man , but a sub -par president .
So great was his non-presidential career overall that he was among the greatest of presidents .
Similarly , Hamilton was a very significant man ( largely in a negative sense ) , but a virtually insignificant Framer .
His contribution to the Philadelphia Convention lay mainly in spelling out what kind of elected monarchy he preferred , leaving the Convention for several weeks , returning to see , and to say , that the draft Constitution was unlike what he wanted , and signing it anyway .
Yet , so significant was Hamilton overall that he was among the most significant of the Framers .
One doubts that this is what Bramwell means in calling Hamilton a “ great Framer . ” 
Bramwell refers to various tendentious “ scholars ”  and judges whose “ theories ”  of and “ approaches ”  to the Constitution always lead them to the desired outcomes .
( Bramwell admires them . )
Here , one is reminded of the meaning of the phrase “ law office history . ” 
I explained in The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Constitution that lawyers ”  education about the Constitution consists almost exclusively of reading judicial opinions and , perhaps , some bits of The Federalist , and that this was inadequate .
It can leave one thinking that McCulloch is unquestionable , say , or that Alexander Hamilton ’s was among the most significant contributions to the Philadelphia Convention .
It can leave one unaware of the difference between the convention that wrote the Constitution and the ones that enacted ( ratified ) it .
It can leave one certain that the Constitution has no meaning .
And , in the process , it can make one certain that he knows all there is to know about the subject .

That is why I have often told people that given a choice between studying “ constitutional law ”  and just reading the Constitution , they will have a better idea what the Founders established if they take the latter option .
I doubt that many people outside the population of other alumni of elite law schools share Bramwell ’s view that the Constitution is meaningless and that arguments need to be devised for Congress to exercise more power .
The chief point of my popular - audience books is to call the politicians ”  and judges ”  adherence to the Bramwell / Brennan view to people ’s attention , and to distinguish between their view and the one to which the people actually assented .
Bramwell says that few people share my criticism of the current state of “ constitutional law . ” 
To judge by the response to my books , that number is growing .
Yet , even if I were alone , the Jeffersonian approach to the Constitution would still be right .
Binmen refused to empty fortnightly recycling box containing a maggot ' because it is livestock '
Council binmen refused to empty a recycling box containing a maggot - claiming it amounted to livestock .
Homeowner John Harlow , 60 , was told it was against council rules for contractors to handle ' live animals ' .
Officials said the box 's contents would only be collected if it was placed in his domestic waste bin .
Shocked : John Harlow with his recycling box and the dog food tin , which contained a maggot
John , a parish councillor , blasted ' jobsworth ' staff at Warwick District Council for their ' overzealous ' attitude .
The father of two , from Leek Wootton near Warwick , said : ' I live in the country and see livestock like sheep , pigs and cattle regularly but there were none in my box .
' It 's ridiculous .
I pay nearly £ 2,500 per annum to the council for services .
When am I going to get any ?
' It is hardly surprising the odd maggot gets into the rubbish when they only collect the bins every two weeks . '
The saga began on August 23 when John left his red recycling bin outside his home for the usual fortnightly collection .
But he was shocked when the bin was left unemptied .
He claims contractors SITA refused to empty it because it contained a live maggot , which had crawled into a rinsed - out dog food tin .
John said : ' I was shocked to be told the only way they would take my recycling away was if I put it in with the rest of my un-recyclable rubbish .
' The contractors seem more interested in leaving early than actually doing their job .
' It 's a disgrace when homeowners have gone to the trouble of separating their waste for recycling . '
Warwick District Council yesterday apologised for the blunder .
Contract services manager Rob Hoof said : ' We are sorry Mr Harlow has experienced problems with the service .
' Contractors are expected to be practical about what they leave and what they take .
' Where they do not take a reasonable approach , that can be justified by the customer , we will always send them back to collect the items . '
A spokesman for the council added : ' The call centre officer who took Mr Harlow 's call was incorrect in stating that " maggots were classed as livestock " .
' We have spoken with Mr Harlow and have offered to have the contractors return to his address to make the collection for him .
' We have also reminded our Contact Centre staff and contractors of the correct course of action .
' We collect refuse and recycling from in excess of 60,000 homes each week and mistakes do sometimes occur . '

Toronto police were faced with an unusual case of mischief when animals from a High Park zoo were let loose overnight .
An officer patrolling the park around 1 a.m. noticed the animal pens were n't secure and immediately called for backup , police said .
When they arrived at the Animal Paddocks in High Park , at Bloor St. W. and Parkside Dr. around 1 a.m. they found several locks and chains were broken and a fence cut and pried open , letting several animals out to roam the park , said Sgt. John Thibodeau .
A yak stayed close to its pen and was easily ushered back inside , but police had to use crime scene tape to round up several llamas .
A wallaby was also safely corralled in the pre-dawn roundup .
The animals grazed on nearby trees until the zookeeper arrived at about 5 a.m. and herded the animals back into their pens , Thibodeau said .
Zookeepers report all the animals are safe and happy .
Parkgoers sidled up to the llama pens this afternoon , while others glanced over from the walking trail .
" If you were here today you 'd never know what happened last night , " said Park Manager Kevin Bowser .
High Park 's zoo has been around since the early 1900s when deer were kept in the park .
Bowser has a photo of bison in the park 's pens from 1905 .
Currently there are nine species of animals at the zoo , including half a dozen llamas and as well as wallabys , deer , yak , cattle and sheep .
Bowser said the zoo , which is free to visit , is a popular attraction and is rarely the target of mischief .
Police have no descriptions of the suspects or any motive , but Sgt. Bruce Morrison said overnight police officers will have some good stories .
" It 's not something the officers are trained to do , so you kind of make it up as you go along , " said Morrison .
Police officers did whatever they could to get the animals back into their pens including luring them with food .
Sgt. Morrison is urging anyone who was in the park last night , or anyone with information to contact 11 Division at 416-808- 1100 , Crime Stoppers anonymously at 416-222-TIPS ( 8477 ) , online at www.222tips.com {lt}http://www.222tips.com{gt}, or text TOR and your message to CRIMES ( 274637 ) .

Brain imaging shows playing Tetris leads to a thicker cortex and may also increase brain efficiency , according to research published in the open access journal BMC Research Notes .
A research team based in New Mexico is one of the first to investigate the effects of practice in the brain using two image techniques .
Researchers from Mind Research Network in Albuquerque used brain imaging and Tetris to investigate whether practice makes the brain efficient because it increases gray matter .
For 30 minutes a day over a three - month period , 26 adolescent girls played Tetris , a computer game requiring a combination of cognitive skills .
The girls completed both structural and functional MRI scans before and after the three - month practice period , as did girls in the control group who did not play Tetris .
A structural MRI was used to assess cortical thickness , and a functional MRI was used to assess efficient activity .
The girls who practiced showed greater brain efficiency , consistent with earlier studies .
Compared to controls , the girls that practiced also had a thicker cortex , but not in the same brain areas where efficiency occurred [ see image : http://www.biomedcentral.com/graphics/email/images/tetris_brain.jpg].
The areas of the brain that showed relatively thicker cortex were the Brodmann Area ( BA ) 6 in the left frontal lobe and BA 22 and BA 38 in the left temporal lobe .
Scientists believe BA 6 plays a role in the planning of complex , coordinated movements .
BA 22 and BA 38 are believed to be the part of the brain active in multisensory integration — or our brain ’s coordination of visual , tactile , auditory , and internal physiological information .
Functional MRI ( fMRI ) showed greater efficiency after practice mostly in the right frontal and parietal lobes including BAs 32 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 46 and BA 40 .
These areas are associated with critical thinking , reasoning , and language and processing .
“ One of the most surprising findings of brain research in the last five years was that juggling practice increased gray matter in the motor areas of the brain , ” said Dr. Rex Jung , a co-investigator on the Tetris study and a clinical neuropsychologist .
“ We did our Tetris study to see if mental practice increased cortical thickness , a sign of more gray matter .
If it did , it could be an explanation for why previous studies have shown that mental practice increases brain efficiency .
More gray matter in an area could mean that the area would not need to work as hard during Tetris play . ”
“ We were excited to see cortical thickness differences between the girls that practiced Tetris and those that did not , ” said Dr. Richard Haier , a co-investigator in the study and lead author of a 1992 study that found practicing Tetris led to greater brain efficiency .
“ But , it was surprising that these changes were not where we saw more efficiency .
How a thicker cortex and increased brain efficiency are related remains a mystery . ”
The researchers hope to continue this work with larger , more diverse samples to investigate whether the brain changes we measured revert back when subjects stop playing Tetris .
Similarly , they are interested if the skills learned in Tetris , and the associated brain changes , transfer to other cognitive areas such as working memory , processing speed , or spatial reasoning .

AS someone who makes his living delivering important envelopes -- many of which contain sensitive financial information -- to businesses , Matt Magura can empathize with whoever forgot nearly $ 20,000 in bank deposits on top of an automated teller machine in downtown Winnipeg last Tuesday .
Lucky for him or her -- and for the Assiniboine Credit Union -- the 29 - year - old bicycle courier took a detour from his route around 11 a.m. that morning to deposit his GST cheque at the ATM in the lobby of the Medical Arts Building on Kennedy Street .
BORIS.MINKEVICH@FREEPRESS.MB.CA
A $ 50 gift certificate to Boston Pizza was Matt Magura 's reward for returning money to Assiniboine Credit Union .
While looking for a deposit envelope , Magura noticed a bundled stack of them sitting on top of the machine .
" I saw a $ 100 bill through one of the peep holes , " he said during an interview Sunday .
Turns out the envelopes contained around $ 8,000 in cash and at least that much in cheques .
" They came out of the back of the machine and were obviously supposed to go into the bank .
It was probably the day's , or maybe even the long weekend 's , worth of deposits , " said Magura , adding that there were at least four people behind him in line .
Since he was en route to a delivery , the First Choice Courier & Messenger rider said he took care of business first , then personally delivered the misplaced loot right to the Assiniboine Credit Union 's head office on Main Street .
" They were completely surprised , " he recalled .
But grateful , too .
The credit union rewarded the honest messenger with a $ 50 gift certificate to Boston Pizza .
" I was happy to get anything , really , " he said .
Magura , who has been making his living as a messenger for about eight years , said he hopes the fallout is n't too harsh for the bank employee who emptied the ATM but left its contents behind .
" I hope they 're not in s and did n't lose their job , " he said .
" This stuff happens . "

Patients in vegetative or minimally conscious states may not be able to speak for themselves or report that they are aware of their surroundings , but some can learn , according to a new study .
The results suggest that certain learning tests may help doctors to diagnosis patients with these conditions and may indicate how much the patients are likely to recover .
The study was the first to test learning in patients with certain disorders of consciousness .
In this case , patients were either in a vegetative state , a condition in which people are awake but apparently not aware and do not have voluntary responses , or a minimally conscious state , in which patients start to show voluntary behavior and occasionally respond to commands .
The researchers tested a type of learning known as classical , or Pavlovian , conditioning , which is thought to require consciousness , in 22 patients .
They looked at whether or not the patients could learn to associate a beeping sound with a puff of air blown into the eye , which causes blinking .
The researchers played the sound , and then half a second later , administered the air puff and monitored the muscle activity around the eye .
If a person is learning , he or she will blink upon hearing the sound , before the air puff is given , exhibiting an anticipation of the annoying sensation about to occur .
Some of the patients did indeed show learning .
Three patients performed almost as well as a control group of normal subjects that also underwent the test , said Tristan Bekinschtein , the lead author and researcher from the University of Cambridge 's Wolfson Brain Imaging Unit in the U.K .
Another seven patients showed some signs of learning , and the other 12 patients showed almost no learning , he said .
In contrast , a second control group of anesthetized patients that showed no signs of consciousness did not learn , which was expected .
Interestingly , the researchers did not find any difference in learning between those in a vegetative state and those in a minimally conscious state .
" What [ this ] tells us is that there might be a fair amount of misdiagnosis , or that some of the vegetative subjects were in fact minimally conscious , " Bekinschtein told LiveScience .
They also found that the amount of learning was a good predictor of how much the patients were able to recover , or improve in their condition .
" [ In ] most of the patients that showed learning , six months or a year later , they showed some degree of recovery ; and all of the patients that showed no learning showed no change – they did not get better , some of them they got worse , " Bekinschtein said .
However , the patient 's learning may not be fully related to their consciousness , said Bekinschtein , who also pointed out that their assessment did not directly test consciousness .
" It could be that they are not conscious exactly at the time we tested , but our results suggest that at least the network that supports conscious processing was in some way functioning , " he said .
It is possible that these networks are very close to working at the time of the test , and they get better when the patient recovers consciousness , he added .
The study was a collaboration between researchers at the University of Buenos Aires , the University of Cambridge and the Institute of Cognitive Neurology in Argentina .
The results were published in the Sept. 20 online edition of the journal Nature Neuroscience .
McShane appeared before Londonderry Magistrates Court on Thursday
A 22 - year - old Londonderry man who snorted a white powder he believed to be a Class A drug has been found guilty of attempted possession .
Judge James McFarland , who had never come across the charge before , jailed Bryan McShane , of Strand Foyer , Derry , for one month .
McShane also admitted assaulting a police officer and another man in Strand Foyer , a hostel , on 5 May .
He was sentenced to another month for these offences .
Forensics tests confirmed the white powder in McShane 's possession was not a drug .
McShane , who appeared before Londonderry Magistrates Court , was released on Thursday because of time already served .
ATLANTA , Georgia ( CNN ) -- Former President Jimmy Carter took a swipe at rapper Kanye West 's behavior at Sunday 's MTV Video Music Awards , saying it was " completely uncalled for " and his punishment was to appear on the new Jay Leno show . "
The hip - hop artist jumped onstage and took the microphone from country singer Taylor Swift during her would - be acceptance speech for Best Female Video .
West declared that singer Beyonce Knowles should have won .
On Monday , West appeared on the debut of Leno 's prime - time show and said he knew his actions were wrong .
Swift said on Tuesday that West had called her directly and apologized .
Carter 's comments came during his 28th annual town hall meeting at Emory University , where he has been a professor since 1982 .

ISLAMABAD , Pakistan ( CNN ) --
Six years ago an ad in the Sunday paper changed a young Pakistani woman 's life and made aviation history .
Seven Pakistani women are trained to fly the country 's F - 7 fighter jets -- though none have seen combat so far .
The ad read : " Pakistan Air Force recruiting females cadets . "
Back then Ambreen Gul was 20 - years old and living in Karachi .
Her mother wanted her to be a doctor .
She remembers her reaction when she told her she wants to fly .
" She was like : ' You 're a girl , ' " says Gul .
" How will you do it ?
How will you fly ? "
The following day Gul took the first step in proving her mother wrong .
She was among the first in line at the recruitment center .
For nearly six decades it was only men who had flown Pakistan 's fighter jets .
Today
Gul is one of seven women who are trained and ready to fly Pakistan 's F - 7 supersonic fighter jets .
" This is a feeling that makes you proud and makes you humble also , " says Gul .
Humility does n't mean lack of confidence .
" We can do everything better than the men , " explains cadet Nida Tariq .
" We 're more hardworking , more consistent and more patient , " adds cadet Anam Faiq .

To become a fighter pilot takes three years of training at the Air Force Academy in Risalpur , Pakistan , where the halls are lined with grainy black - and - white pictures of nearly six decades of male graduates who went on to fly for the Pakistan Air Force .
The training is often intensely physical .
Here , equal opportunity means equal treatment .
If they are not good enough as per their male counterparts , we do n't let them fly , " says commanding officer Tanvir Piracha .
Some of Pakistan 's female pilots wear hijabs .
Others prefer to go without the Muslim headdress .
Most say changing the misconception of Muslim women is just as important as serving their country .
" Islam gives equal opportunity to females .
Whatever we want to do we can , " says pilot Nadia Gul .
" To tell you the truth I 've been given equal opportunity or I suppose more than men have been given , " says Air Force cadet Sharista Beg .
Air Force officials say fighter pilots are playing a vital role in the fight against the Taliban .
They 're training in counterinsurgency , collecting aerial intelligence and targeting militant strongholds in the treacherous mountains of Pakistan 's tribal region along the Afghan border .
Ambreen
Gul says her goal now is to fly in combat .
" I would give my life for my country , " she says .
But women rarely fly in combat anywhere in the world and it's never been done in Pakistan .
It 's another barrier Gul plans to break .
A Scottish teenager cycled 3,850 miles across Canada to raise money for starving children in one of the world ’s poorest countries .

Euan Hunter , a former pupil at Currie High School in Edinburgh , celebrated his 18th birthday during the trek from Vancouver to Halifax , which took him 37 days .
As well as fulfilling a personal challenge , Euan was raising money and awareness for Mary ’s Meals , a Scottish charity that runs school feeding projects in 14 of the world ’s poorest countries , including Malawi , Haiti and Liberia .
The charity can provide school meals for a child in Malawi for a year for just £ 6.15 , and Euan has raised over £ 1,000 already – enough to feed 162 children .
“ Lots of people have asked me why I wanted to cycle across Canada and to be honest , I ’m not too sure myself , ” said Euan .
“ It was a bit of an impulse decision and I just went for it .
“ I think it appealed to me because of the adventure , physical challenge and its potential to raise money and awareness for charity .
Canada looked like an amazing place too !
“ It feels great to be finished , finally allowing the legs to rest a bit , and to know that I was able to raise so much money for Mary ’s Meals . ”
As well as cycling a gruelling average of 105 miles a day on his flat - barred Specialized Sirrus , Euan found time to publish regular updates for his supporters on Twitter and through his blog at www.euanhunter.co.uk.
Messages of encouragement from friends and family were posted there , alongside a note from world record - holding cyclist Mark Beaumont , which came as a welcome boost , as it arrived just as Euan recovered from a fall .
“ Congratulations on a great ride , ” Mark said : “ Keep taking on your dreams . ”
Euan is due to start studying mechanical engineering at Edinburgh University next month .
Has he thought about his next challenge ?
“ I love pushing my body to its limits so I will find something , ” he said .
“ For now though , I ’m not to sure , although I do have a 24 - hour mountain bike race later this year . ”

Yet again , Wikipedia is about to break new ground .
The website that has become one of the biggest open repositories of knowledge is due – within the next week or so – to hit the mark of 3 m articles in English .
It 's all a very long way from January 2001 , when Wikipedia launched .
Its first million articles took five years to put together , but the second was achieved by 2007 .
It was not just the number of articles that grew , but also the number of people involved in creating them .
During Wikipedia 's first burst of activity between 2004 and 2007 , the number of active users on the site rocketed from just a few thousand to more than 300,000 .
Learning curve
However , statistics released by the site 's analytics team suggest Wikipedia 's explosive growth is all but finished .
The quickening pace that helped the site reach the 2 m article milestone just 17 months after breaking the 1 m barrier suddenly evaporated : adding the next million has taken nearly two years .
While the encyclopedia is still growing overall , the number of articles being added has reduced from an average of 2,200 a day in July 2007 to around 1,300 today .
Elsewhere , the number of active Wikipedians ( those contributing to the site in some way ) now comes in at just under 500,000 .
That is a 61 % increase in the past two years ; hardly shabby , but nowhere near the increases seen in the past .
At the same time , however , the base of highly active editors ( who contribute new words to the project and marshall the billions of pieces of information the site contains ) has remained more or less static .
From the numbers , it looks as though Wikipedia is stagnating .
Why ?
One of those who has spent his time studying what happens on Wikipedia is Ed H Chi , a scientist who works at the Palo Alto Research Center ( Parc ) in California .
His team , the Augmented Social Cognition group , wanted to understand what was happening on the website in order to build better collaborative software .
" For a long time , the understood model for all kinds of large knowledge systems on the web was that they grow exponentially , " he says .
" The accepted explanation was that the rich get richer – things that receive a lot of attention end up getting a lot more attention . "
Wikipedia fitted that model perfectly in its early days .
However , when Chi and his colleagues looked at the recent data , they realised this approach did not fit any more .
But with a site as complex and sprawling as Wikipedia , simply crunching the numbers proved a major task in itself .
First they spent a significant amount of time downloading a carbon copy of Wikipedia : every article , every edit and every piece of information ever to cross the site 's servers .
Even when compressed , the files stretched to an enormous 8 terabytes – the equivalent of more than 1,200 DVDs stuffed with information .
Decompressing in preparation for analysis took almost a week .
But when the group fed the data into their 60 - machine computing cluster , they got some surprising results .
Chi's team discovered that the way the site operated had changed significantly from the early days , when it ran an open - door policy that allowed in anyone with the time and energy to dedicate to the project .
Today , they discovered , a stable group of high - level editors has become increasingly responsible for controlling the encyclopedia , while casual contributors and editors are falling away .
Wikipedia – often touted as the bastion of open knowledge online – has become , in Chi 's words , " a more exclusive place " .
One of the measures the Parc team looked at was how often a user 's edit succeeds in sticking .
" We found that if you were an elite editor , the chance of your edit being reverted was something in the order of 1 % – and that 's been very consistent over time from around 2003 or 2004 , " he says .
Meanwhile , for those who did not invest vast amounts of time in editing , the experience was very different .
" For editors that make between two and nine edits a month , the percentage of their edits being reverted had gone from 5 % in 2004 all the way up to about 15 % by October 2008 .
And the ' onesies ' – people who only make one edit a month – their edits are now being reverted at a 25 % rate , " Chi explains .
In other words , a change by a casual editor is more likely than ever to be overturned , while changes by the elite are rarely questioned .
" To power users it feels like Wikipedia operates in the way it always has – but for the newcomers or the occasional users , they feel like the resistance in the community has definitely changed . "
While Chi points out that this does not necessarily imply causation , he suggests it is concrete evidence to back up what many people have been saying : that it is increasingly difficult to enjoy contributing to Wikipedia unless you are part of the site 's inner core of editors .
Include me out
One person who typifies that feeling is Aaron Swartz , a 22 - year - old programmer who lives in Cambridge , Massachusetts .
Something of a wunderkind in the software development world , Swartz used to spend a lot of time working on Wikipedia – in 2006 he even stood for election to the Wikimedia Foundation , the organisation behind the site ( his bid failed ) .
These days , however , he rarely checks in .
" I used to be one of the top editors … now I contribute things here and there where I see something wrong . "
The reason , he explains , is that the site feels more insular and exclusive than in the past .
" In general , the biggest problem I have with the editors is their attitude , " he says .
" They say : ' We 're not going to explain how we make decisions , we basically talk amongst ourselves . '
" There 's no place on Wikipedia that says : ' Want to become a Wikipedia editor ?
Here 's how you do it . '
Instead , you basically have to really become part of that community and pick it up through osmosis and have the tradition passed down to you . "
Swartz 's experience certainly correlates with the figures unearthed by Parc , even if his attitude is not shared by everyone .
Given the history of the online world – where escalating growth can continue for years – it seems unlikely that this gradual slowdown was inevitable .
Instead , it could be the end result of a battle between two competing factions of Wikipedia editors .
On one side stand the deletionists , whose motto is " Wikipedia is not a junkyard " ; on the other , the inclusionists , who argue that " Wikipedia is not paper " .
Deletionists argue for a tightly controlled and well - written encyclopedia that provides valuable information on topics of widespread interest .
Why should editors waste time on articles about fly - by - night celebrities or wilfully obscure topics ?
Inclusionists , on the other hand , believe that the more articles the site has , the better : if they are poorly referenced or badly written , they can be improved – and any article is better than nothing .
After all , they say , there is no limit to the size of the site , and no limit to the information that people may want .
Less is more ?
The two groups had been vying for control from early on in the site 's life , but the numbers suggest that the deletionists may have won .
The increasing difficulty of making a successful edit ; the exclusion of casual users ; slower growth – all are hallmarks of the deletionist approach .
Swartz , an avowed inclusionist , says the deletionists have won – but says he understands their motivation .
" When Wikipedia is in the news , it 's always because someone found this inaccuracy , or somebody 's suing Wikipedia …
It 's always about how Wikipedia screwed up .
So of course what they 're going to be worried about is not how to make Wikipedia grow and have more content , it 's about how we keep Wikipedia out of trouble and how we stop people from messing it up . "
Still , there remain unanswered questions .
Could its growth ever halt completely ?
How big will the site be when the editors decide that the sum of human knowledge is catalogued ?
Could a new website take Wikipedia 's place by toeing an inclusionist line ?
Parc 's research does n't give any answers , but Chi has identified one model that Wikipedia 's growth pattern matches .
" In my experience , the only thing we 've seen these growth patterns [ in ] before is in population growth studies – where there 's some sort of resource constraint that results in this model . "
The site , he suggests , is becoming like a community where resources have started to run out .
" As you run out of food , people start competing for that food , and that results in a slowdown in population growth and means that the stronger , more well - adapted part of the population starts to have more power . "
After Rep. Joe Wilson ’s ( R - S.C. ) famous outburst against President Obama , he apologized to the president and watched his little - known Democratic opponent raise over $ 750,000 .
But Wilson is now fighting back , replacing his campaign website with a defiant , videotaped appeal that he “ will not be muzzled ” – all while asking for money to help him win re-election .
“ Please go to JoeWilsonforCongress.com , and contribute to my effort to defeat the proponents of government - run health care , ” Wilson said in a videotaped statement .
“ Health care is a matter of life and death for so many , and I choose life with health insurance reform . ”
Wilson also hit the conservative talk show circuit yesterday , including appearances on Sean Hannity ’s radio and television shows .
Wilson 's efforts to become a conservative cause celebre have netted his campaign over $ 200,000 so far – not nearly in the ballpark of his Democratic challenger Rob Miller -- but enough to nearly double his campaign coffers .
He ended June with just $ 211,000 in his campaign account .

WASHINGTON , July 12 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Attorney General Eric
Holder is considering whether to appoint a criminal prosecutor to investigate the Bush administration 's interrogation practices involving the CIA , and is expected to make a decision in a few weeks , a Justice Department official said on Sunday .
The official , who declined to be identified , said any investigation would only cover those who went beyond the Justice Department 's legal advice at the time that authorized various harsh interrogation techniques .
Those CIA employees who acted in accordance with the Justice Department 's approved methods at the time would not be investigated , the source said on condition of anonymity .
This was the position the Obama administration announced in April when it released the Justice Department memos during the Bush era that had authorized waterboarding and other coercive methods of interrogation of terrorism suspects .
The official described Holder as " very reluctant " to open the investigation , but said the attorney general could be forced to do it because of the " nature of the conduct " at issue .
Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Holder will " follow the facts and the law . "
" We have made no decisions on investigations or prosecutions , including whether to appoint a prosecutor to conduct further inquiry , " Miller said .
" As the attorney general has made clear , it would be unfair to prosecute any official who acted in good faith based on legal guidance from the Justice Department . "
Twenty - five million more children will go hungry by the middle of this century as climate change leads to food shortages and soaring prices for staples such as rice , wheat , maize and soya beans , a report says today .
If global warming goes unchecked , all regions of the world will be affected , but the most vulnerable – south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa – will be hit hardest by failing crop yields , according to the report , prepared by the International Food Policy Research Institute ( IFPRI ) for the World Bank and Asian Development Bank .
The children of 2050 will have fewer calories to eat than those in 2000 , the report says , and the effect would be to wipe out decades of progress in reducing child malnutrition .
The grim scenario is the first to gauge the effects of climate change on the world 's food supply by combining climate and agricultural models .
Spikes in grain prices last year led to rioting and unrest across the developing world , from Haiti to Thailand .
Leaders at the G20 summit in Pittsburgh last week committed $ 2bn ( £ 1.25 bn ) to food security , and the United Nations is set to hold a summit on food security in November , its second since last year 's riots .
But the UN secretary general , Ban Ki-moon , is pressing the World Bank and other institutions to do more .
He said the industrialised world needs to step up investment in seed research and to offer more affordable crop insurance to the small farmers in developing countries .
Though prices have stabilised , the world 's food system is still in crisis , he said at the weekend .
" Ever more people are denied food because prices are stubbornly high , because purchasing power has fallen due to the economic crisis , or because rains have failed and reserve stocks of grain have been eaten , " he said .
Even without global warming , rising populations meant the world was headed for food shortages and food price rises .
" The food price crisis of last year really was a wake - up call to a lot of people that we are going to have 50 % more people on the surface of the Earth by 2050 , " said Gerald Nelson , the lead author of the report .
" Meeting those demands for food coming out of population growth is going to be a huge challenge – even without climate change . "
After several years in which development aid has been diverted away from rural areas , the report called for $ 7bn a year for crop research , and investment in irrigation and rural infrastructure to help farmers adjust to a warming climate .
" Continuing the business - as - usual approach will almost certainly guarantee disastrous consequences , " said Nelson .
The G20 industrialised nations last week began discussing how to invest some $ 20 bn pledged for food security earlier this year .
Some regions of the world outlined in the report are already showing signs of vulnerability because of changing rainfall patterns and drought linked to climate change .
Oxfam yesterday launched a $ 152 m appeal on behalf of 23 million people hit by a severe drought and spiralling food prices in Kenya , Ethiopia , Somalia and Uganda .
The charity called it the worst humanitarian crisis in Africa for a decade , and said many people in the region were suffering from malnutrition .
But southern Asia , which made great advances in agricultural production during the 20th century , was also singled out in the IFPRI report for being particularly at risk of food shortages .
Some countries , such as Canada and Russia , will experience longer growing seasons because of climate change , but other factors – such as poor soil – mean that will not necessarily be translated into higher food production .
The report was prepared for negotiators currently trying to reach a global deal to fight climate change at the latest round of UN talks in Bangkok .
It used climate models prepared by the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in Australia to arrive at estimates of how changes in growing seasons and rainfall patterns would affect farming in the developing world and elsewhere .
Without an ambitious injection of funds and new technology , wheat yields could fall by more than 30 % in developing countries , setting off a catastrophic rise in prices .
Wheat prices , with unmitigated climate change , could rise by 170% - 194 % by the middle of this century , the report said .
Rice prices are projected to rise by 121 % – and almost all of the increase will have to be passed on to the consumer , Nelson said .
The report did not take into account all the expected impacts of climate change – such as the loss of farmland due to rising sea levels , a rise in the number of insects and in plant disease , or changes in glacial melt .
All these factors could increase the damage of climate change to agriculture .
Others who have examined the effects of climate change on agriculture have warned of the potential for conflict .
In a new book , Plan B 4.0 : Mobilising to Save Civilisation , published today , Lester Brown , founder of the Earth Policy Institute , warns that sharp declines in world harvests due to climate change could threaten the world order .
" I am convinced that food is indeed the weak link , " he said .
Brown saw Asia as the epicentre of the crisis , with the latest science warning of a sea level rise of up to six feet by 2100 .
With even a 3ft rise , Bangladesh could lose half of its rice land to rising seas ; Vietnam , the world 's second largest producer of rice , could also see much of the Mekong Delta under water .
Wheat and rice production would also fall because of acute water shortages , caused by past over - pumping and the melting of the Himalayan glaciers , which currently store water that supplies the region 's main rivers : the Indus , Ganges , and Yangtse .
Brown said : " The potential loss of these mountain glaciers in the Himalayas is the most massive projected threat to food security ever seen " .
Global shortfall
People in both the developing and developed worlds will have less to eat by 2050 if climate change is not seriously addressed , though the shortfall will be relatively slight in richer countries .
Prices rises and shortages of food will drive down the average calories available :
• The calories available for each person in industrialised nations will fall from 3,450 in 2000 to about 3,200 .
• In developing countries overall , the average will fall from 2,696 to 2,410 calories .
• In sub -Saharan Africa , people will on average have only 1,924 calories a day , compared with 2,316 in 2000 .

A variety of iPhone users are are reporting that new MMS features have been enabled on their handsets in advance of AT&T 's official start date of September 25 .
Apple added new MMS support to iPhone 3.0 to allow users to send pictures , video and audio recordings , contacts , or locations from Maps via 3G - capable iPhones .
However , use of the new feature requires operator support .
AT&T , apparently afraid that millions of new iPhone 3.0 users would completely ransack its existing MMS service , reportedly decided to put opt - out service codes on all of its i Phone users ' accounts until the company could beef up its network to accommodate the new demand .
In announcing its plans to enable the feature for iPhone users , AT&T explained , " It was important to give our customers a positive experience from day one .
We support more iPhone customers than any other carrier in the world so we took the time necessary to make sure our network is ready to handle what we expect will be a record volume of MMS traffic .
We truly appreciate our customersâ patience and hope they 'll understand our desire to get it right from the start . "
Rather than turning on MMS service for millions of American iPhone users all at once , AT&T has been selectively activating users across the country .
Once activated , iPhone 3G and 3GS users should see a new " Cellular Data Network " menu item within the General / Network page of the Settings app and a new camera icon within the Messages app for sending photos .
It 's possible to install a modified carrier bundle for AT&T to activate MMS software features , but this does not necessarily result in functioning MMS .
Without AT&T removing your opt out , MMS messages will queue up with a red exclamation icon as they fail to actually send .
Britain's food giants have privately warned that they are struggling to maintain their decade - long ban on genetic modification and called for the public to be educated about the increasing cost of avoiding GM , The Independent reveals today .
As major producers such as the US and Brazil switch to GM , supermarkets are now paying 10 to 20 per cent more for the dwindling supplies of conventional soya and maize , according to a report by the Food Standards Agency ( FSA ) and the Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) .
Tesco , Sainsbury's , Morrisons , Marks & Spencer , Somerfield , Aldi and Co-op met civil servants to explain their problems in finding non-GM supplies .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Warning of the price hikes , the report – quietly published online last month – said : " Retailers were concerned that they may not be able to maintain their current non-GM sources of supply as producers increasingly adopt GM technology around the world . "
Despite legislation requiring GM food to be labelled in the UK 's cafes , restaurants and takeaways , customers were already eating food saturated with GM fat without knowing , added the report .
Although fierce public opposition to so - called " Frankenstein foods " has fallen from its peak at the end of the 1990s and early 2000s , when retailers vowed not to stock anything with GM ingredients , changing genes in human food remains highly controversial .
Campaigners such as Friends of the Earth fear GM crops could damage human health and the environment and place control of the food supply in the hands of a few multinational chemical companies , warning of a " corporate takeover of agriculture " .
Despite the potential public backlash , ministers believe it may now be the right time to consider its introduction as a way of meeting a UN target to raise global food production by 2050 .
Asked whether GM was the answer to his call last month for a new green revolution , Hilary Benn , the Environment Secretary , whose new food security strategy this autumn is expected to move closer to backing GM , praised " science " .
Supermarkets and manufacturers can sell food made from GM ingredients grown elsewhere , but must state that products contain GM ingredients .
After meeting industry stakeholders , the joint FSA and Defra document – GM Crops and Foods : Follow - up to the Food Matters Report – reported that there " is some use of GM food ingredients in the UK , particularly in the catering sector where oil from GM crops is often supplied to customers who are working to lower prices , and bulk packs are suitably labelled .
It was considered unlikely that relevant information regarding food produced using such oils is provided to the final consumer , as required in EC legislation . "
The FSA noted that spontaneous concern about GM voiced by consumers had fallen steadily from a peak in December 2003 , when 20 per cent of shoppers were worried , to 6 per cent last September .
Supermarket bosses are rethinking their approach .
After delivering the City Food Lecture in February , Sir Terry Leahy , chief executive of Tesco , said that giving in to concern about GM could have been a mistake : " It may have been a failure of us all to stand by the science .
" Maybe there is an opportunity to discuss again these issues and a growing appreciation by people that GM could play a vital role in feeding the world 's growing population . "
At the time , International Supermarket News quoted an industry source as saying : " I am pretty certain that several parties involved are actively looking for the way out of their Canute - like positions .
Maybe the reality of the costs of GM - avoidance is finally striking home . "
The FSA / Defra document reported that many stakeholders noted " it may be timely to inform consumers of the issues surrounding GM and non-GM supply chains so that they have a clear understanding of current science , the status of non-GM market being reliant on only a few exporting countries , and the steady increase in GM production " .
Tesco was unavailable for comment yesterday , but the British Retail Consortium , which speaks for the major grocery retailers , denied British shops would change their approach .
" Retailers are not stocking GM products and there are no plans to change that – it's a response to customers ' views , " said spokesman Richard Dodd .
Pete Riley , director of GM Freeze , the anti-GM campaign , accused the Government of being " desperate " to back GM , adding that it had pressurised Defra and the FSA into producing a " scaremongering " report .
Supermarkets could work with growers to produce a long - term , non-GM supply , he said , adding any store that broke ranks by introducing GM would be " brave " .
Gretel Bergmann , now Margaret Bergmann Lambert , never got to the bottom of why Horst Ratjen became Dora
A new film tells the remarkable story of a female Jewish high jumper banned by the Nazis from the 1936 Olympics in Berlin - and whose team mate , it later turned out , was a man in disguise .
Berlin 36 , due out this week , recounts how Gretel Bergmann was tipped for Olympic glory but was bumped off the German team at the last minute for fear that a gold - medal winning Jewish athlete would embarrass Hitler .
Instead , her " weird " room - mate Dora Ratjen competed .
Dora gained only fourth place , but caused controversy two years later when a doctor discovered " she " was actually a he .
Gretel Bergmann emigrated to the US in 1937 and married a doctor , Bruno Lambert .
Now aged 95 , she still lives in New York , as Margaret Bergmann Lambert .
She described to the BBC's World Today the events of the 1930s , her reaction to finding out the truth about " Dora " and her anger at being unable to compete .
" I would have liked to compete , definitely , " she said , " just to show what a Jewish girl can do .
" It was n't for my own glory .
It was just something that I needed to do because things were so horrible over there .
We were shown as the worst people in the whole world and I just wanted to show that was a lie . "
' Very scared '
In the early 1930s , the teenage Bergmann was one of Germany 's most promising female track and field athletes .
But in 1933 , after the Nazis came to power , she was kicked out of her sports club and told she was no longer allowed to compete .
She never came in the shower with us , so we thought she was a little weird , but I had absolutely no idea she was actually a man
Margaret Lambert , describing " Dora " Ratjen ( pictured )
Aged 19 , she left her family behind in Germany and went to Britain - quickly becoming the British national high jump champion .
But in 1934 , she was pressured into returning to Germany , after the International Olympic Committee made Jewish participation a condition of Berlin hosting the 1936 Games .
" They forced me to .
Somebody came to my father 's house and was told by the Nazis that I must return to Germany and be a member of the Nazi Olympic team , " she said .
" If I refused there would be trouble for my family living in Germany , so I packed my things and went home . "
She was " very scared " at the prospect of having to compete in the Nazi team , she remembered .
" In the beginning I thought I am going to get myself out of it by competing really badly , but then I thought it would be a much better thing if a Jewish girl can show she can compete with anybody in the world . "
But her participation in the 1936 Olympics was not to be .
She was told at the last minute by the Nazi authorities she would not be competing because of " under performance " .
" It was a very smart move [ by the Germans ] " , she told the BBC , explaining that she only received the letter once the American team were on their flight to Germany - too late to boycott the Games .
" I was very angry that I could not do this for everybody who had peace in mind , " she said .
' Most dull '
But here the story takes a strange twist .
Mrs Lambert says she never suspected her team - mate Dora Ratjen was not who she appeared to be .

More from BBC World Service " She was part of the Olympic team .
We all trained together and she was my roommate , " she remembered .
" She never came in the shower with us , so we thought she was a little weird , but I had absolutely no idea she was actually a man . "
Dora Ratjen - whose real name was Horst Ratjen - continued to compete in the high jump for another two years .
Ratjen set a new world high jump record for women in 1938 but was disqualified after a doctor discovered he had strapped up his genitals .
Mrs Lambert only learned the truth about Dora in 1968 , when she read a magazine article about her former team - mate .
" When I read it I laughed like crazy .
I could n't help myself . "
She says she does not know why Horst Ratjen would have carried out such an elaborate deception .
" I wrote to him some years ago , but I never got an answer .
Why he did this I do not know .
Maybe he was forced by the Nazis , maybe it was for his own self - esteem , I have no idea , " she said .
Horst Ratjen himself said he was forced into it by the Nazis " for the sake of the honour and glory of Germany " .
" For three years I lived the life of a girl .
It was most dull , " he is reported as saying in 1957 .
He is said to have been conscripted into the army in 1938 , and later worked as a waiter in Hamburg and Bremen before his death last year .
The story of Dora Ratjen has been retold recently because of the recent controversy over South African runner Caster Semenya - whose own gender has been the subject of much speculation since winning gold in the women 's 800 metres at last month 's World Athletics Championship .
Berlin 36 is opening at cinemas in Germany from this week .

FML
OXFORD , England ( Reuters ) - A rise of at least two meters in the world ’s sea levels is now almost unstoppable , experts told a climate conference at Oxford University on Tuesday .

“ The crux of the sea level issue is that it starts very slowly but once it gets going it is practically unstoppable , ” said Stefan Rahmstorf , a scientist at Germany ’s Potsdam Institute and a widely recognized sea level expert .
“ There is no way I can see to stop this rise , even if we have gone to zero emissions . ”
Rahmstorf said the best outcome was that after temperatures stabilized , sea levels would only rise at a steady rate “ for centuries to come , ” and not accelerate .
Most scientists expect at least 2 degrees Celsius warming as a result of man-made greenhouse gas emissions , and probably more .
The world warmed 0.7 -0.8 degrees last century .
Rahmstorf estimated that if the world limited warming to 1.5 degrees then it would still see two meters sea level rise over centuries , which would see some island nations disappear .
His best guess was a one meter rise this century , assuming three degrees warming , and up to five meters over the next 300 years .
“ There is nothing we can do to stop this unless we manage to cool the planet .
That would require extracting the carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
There is no way of doing this on the sufficient scale known today , ” he said .
Scientists say that ice melt acquires a momentum of its own - for example warming the air as less ice reflects less heat , warming the local area .
“ Once the ice is on the move , it ’s like a tipping point which reinforces itself , ” said Wageningen University ’s Pier Vellinga , citing various research .
“ Even if you reduce all the emissions in the world once this has started it may be unstoppable .
I conclude that beyond 2 degrees global average temperature rise the probability of the Greenland ice sheet disintegrating is 50 percent or more . ”
“ ( That ) will result in about 7 meters sea level rise , and the time frame is about 300 - 1,000 years . ”
STORM
Delegates from about 190 nations are meeting in Bangkok to try to speed up U.N. - led negotiations to replace the Kyoto Protocol with a tougher climate pact .
Speakers in Oxford used history to back up their arguments on rising seas .
Three million years ago the planet was 2 - 3 degrees warmer and the sea 25 - 35 meters higher , and 122,000 years ago 2 degrees warmer and 10 meters higher , they said .
“ What we now see in Greenland , Antarctica could be a temporary phenomena but it could also be the start of what we saw 122,000 years ago , ” said Vellinga .
Sea levels have risen about 20 centimeters in the past century and that effect was accelerating , speakers said .
That rise was adding to storms such as that in the Philippines , although that single event could n’t be attributed to climate change , said Rahmstorf .
“ Of course the flooding from a given storm event would be less severe if we had n’t added those extra centimeters . ”
About 40 million people worldwide live in flood plains , said Southampton University ’s Robert Nicholls .
That is 0.6 percent of the global population and 5 percent of global wealth , because of valuable assets such as airports and power plants .
He was confident that coastal protection could hugely reduce lost land and assets .
The cost of that speakers put at anywhere from 50 billion euros ( $ 72.85 billion ) a year by 2020 to up to $ 215 billion a year by 2100 .
Sept. 6 , 2006  --
Mike Ciarciello has been blind since birth but says that in his dreams he can actually see .
" I have had dreams where I have been flying , you know , like in the air .
I am not even bumping into any obstacles whatsoever .
I am actually free , in my dreams , " he said .
His dreams are closer to reality than you might imagine .
He is about to participate in an experiment in which he will " see " by using his tongue .
At the University of Montreal , researcher Daniel Chabat prepared Ciarciello to walk for the first time through an obstacle course without his cane .
Chabat began by mounting a small camera on Ciarciello 's forehead .
The camera sends electrical impulses about what it sees to a small grid placed on his tongue .
" It 's a concept in which you replace a sense that was lost by another one that is there , " said Maurice Ptito , the neuropsychologist supervising the study .
" They sense the world through their tongue , and that gives them the feeling of seeing .
You do n't see with your eyes .
You see with your brain . "
When ABC News correspondent Bob Brown tried The BrainPort vision device in an informal experiment , his challenge was to identify black shapes placed on a wall in front of him .
As the camera scanned the shapes Brown described the feeling on his tongue as a tingling sensation .
" It 's a pulsing sensation that imprints in a crude way the shape of the object , " he said .
" The closer I move to the object , the more the feeling intensifies . "
The tongue is used as the source of input because it is the first organ that we use , Ptito said .
" We 've been using the tongue since we were born , " he said .
" It 's easily accessible ; it 's a wet milieu , so it 's a nice conductor .
So it 's a really fine tuned machine , so to speak . "
Once Ciarciello had the camera mounted and connected to the grid on his tongue , he was ready to head into what for him was completely uncharted territory : the obstacle course .
" I hope it 's going to be a great experience in the sense that I 'm able to actually walk around an object without bumping into it and at my own will , " Ciarciello said .
As he walked through the obstacle course for the first time , he bumped into objects .
It takes training to learn to interpret the signals on the tongue , to sense the distance of objects and whether they 're on the floor or in front of him , Ptito said .
" It took some getting used to , because I had to basically look up and down , left and right , " Ciarciello said .
" I am not used to doing that in an everyday world - type situation . "
But after just two hours of training he was walking through the maze , hitting fewer and fewer obstacles .
For the first time , Ciarciello was able to sense objects in the distance , too far away to touch .
His tongue , in a sense , was substituting for his sight .
" They believe that they can see .
In the sense that they appreciate the visual world , they can see things moving around , they can see things coming to them , " Ptito said .
It may be more than just a belief , because when researchers scan the brains of sightless people who have used the device the scan shows activity in both the visual and motion areas of the brain , showing that one sense is being substituted for another .
The BrainPort™ vision device was developed by Dr. Paul Bach -y - Rita of the University of Wisconsin .
WASHINGTON  The Federal Reserve and the Treasury are preparing broad new rules that would force banks to rein in practices that made multimillionaires out of many financial executives during the housing bubble , officials said .
The rules depart from the hands - off approach that dominated bank regulation for the last three decades , but are not as strict as proposals from some European leaders and suggestions from some members of Congress angered by the financial troubles of the last year .
Fed officials would give banks wide leeway in how they structure their rewards .
They would not prohibit million - dollar pay packages or address issues of fairness .
Rather , the rules are intended to restrict pay plans that encourage reckless behavior by rewarding only short - term gains .
And because the rules would be applied through the confidential bank examination process , it would be hard for consumers and investors to judge how strictly the rules were being applied .
Their million - dollar smiles are frozen on a stage in New York City , awash in San Francisco 49ers gear .
There 's little brother Cornelius , sheepishly grinning in a red- and - black cap .
Cornelius is the young man who -- in the frenzy after the greatest catch of the 2008 college football season -- Michael Crabtree grabbed and hugged while the citizens of Lubbock , Texas , danced and celebrated .
There 's his dad , Michael Sr. , grinning and looking proud on draft day .
Heck , even Michael is smiling .
He 's about to become a multi-millionaire , about to take the first step toward doing what he confided only to the closest of his friends : that someday , he wants to be the Michael Jordan of football .
The picture does n't tell everything , that Crabtree is none too pleased about being the second receiver picked .
He holds up his 49ers jersey and mugs for the cameras .
And the summer of discontent begins .
The first thing to know about holdout negotiations is that it 's generally taboo to say anything .
Agents go underground , mothers and cousins and childhood chums rehearse their " no comments , " and the two sides hunker down because one little slip of the tongue could be interpreted as a sign of one camp 's flinching .
So for the better part of 57 days since Crabtree 's holdout began , one of the NFL 's biggest mystery men has remained unknown .
Maybe Crabtree prefers it this way , because he never quite got used to all the attention and the way it happened so fast .
Maybe he 's blocked out all the critics who have called him a diva and are dumbfounded by his refusal to take the $ 20 million on the table .

But Dennis Simmons can't keep quiet anymore .
He 's on the phone in the football offices at Texas Tech , angry about a reputation gone sour .
The receivers coach wants to tell a story .
It 's about Crabtree 's freshman year , and the young receiver was so smooth , so perfect , that the Red Raiders drew up plans for him to figure heavily in their offense .
Simmons called Crabtree into his office one day with some bad news :
A transcript glitch meant he'd have to sit out the season .
Crabtree broke down and cried .
He wants to be out there today , Simmons says , just like that freshman year .
He 's no doubt watching every minute of the 49ers ' surprise 2 - 0 start .
" I know he 's watching it , " says Simmons .
" Do I think it hurts him ?
That he feels bad that he 's not there ?
Yeah .
He left here with the intentions of playing in the league this year .
" Do I think he 's a person who is easily influenced ?
No .
He 's his own person . "
The Crabtree advisers
So what is going on in Michael Crabtree 's head these days , as he has become the second - longest NFL rookie holdout in two decades ?
The answer , some say , lies in his inner circle .
Crabtree 's posse is n't the typical one filled with high school chums , siblings and a sampling of hangers - on .
His circle consists of at least three men over the age of 40 : former NFL superstar Deion Sanders , Texas state Sen.
Royce West and Crabtree 's cousin , bail bondsman David Wells .
Sanders ' comments about Crabtree reportedly touched off tampering charges against the New York Jets , but we 'll get to him later .
Aside from Crabtree 's father , Wells could possibly be the biggest influence in Crabtree 's life .
He trained the youngster from Dallas at a boxing gym with no air conditioning and surrounded him with powerful men by the time he hit high school .
Wells says he 's made millions in the bail - bonds business , and does n't need to ride his cousin 's coattails for money or access .
He 's gotten past the ropes and seen the NFL high life as a bodyguard for former Dallas Cowboys players Michael Irvin and Adam " Pacman " Jones , and is widely known in the Cowboys organization .
Wells says it takes a village to raise a young African - American man , and that he always wanted to make sure the young Crabtree had someone strong to lean on .
Crabtree plays dominoes with West , who now serves as one of his lawyers .
" The Michael Crabtree that I know is a genuine person , " West says .
" Well - thought - of in the community . "
Back in Dallas , Wells has taken somewhat of a beating in recent days .
In early August , he was quoted as saying Crabtree was willing to sit out the season and re-enter the draft in 2010 , a statement that angered 49ers fans and drudged up media reports of Wells ' legal problems from the past .
Contacted this week , Wells said his comments were misconstrued , but would n't elaborate .
" I have not told Michael Crabtree to hold out , " Wells says .
" Write that .
The San Francisco 49ers drafted Michael Crabtree with the 10th overall pick .

" I care about my cousin .
I love him very much .
My business is to make sure my cousin makes the right decisions .
I 'm not talking about football .
I 'm talking about his life . "
Wells is quick to defend Sanders , whom he calls a " close friend and a mentor " to Crabtree .
He is adamant in saying Sanders has n't influenced the negotiations .
A couple of weeks ago , Sanders became involved in the story when he said two teams were interested in a trade for Crabtree , and that they would pay him handsomely .
Despite the rumblings , Texas Tech coach Mike Leach says he'd be surprised if anyone other than Crabtree 's agent was advising him .
" They say he 's an entourage guy , but that 's not true , " Leach says .
" Michael 's kind of a loner who keeps to himself .
He 's just a nice , polite guy who goes about his business .
I know that sounds a little Frank Capra , but it 's true .
" I know [ Wells ] a little bit .
I think he 's a good guy .
I 've always known him to have Michael 's best interests at heart .
That 's his priority , really .
I mean , heck , that guy could 've made himself agent if he wanted to , but he did n't . "
Handling the holdout
As the Crabtree story twists and churns on , his agent , Eugene Parker , has stayed mum .
Parker , Crabtree and the 49ers all declined to comment .
This is n't Parker 's first major contract negotiation .
He represents Hines Ward , Richard Seymour and Larry Fitzgerald .
And he once helped Sanders get a $ 35 million deal with the Cowboys .
Parker no doubt knows about the probability that rookies who hold out are far more likely to get injured and have inconsequential first seasons .

Six weeks ago , Parker helped Tyson Jackson , the No. 3 overall pick for the Chiefs , arrive at camp in River Falls , Wis. , albeit a few days late .
It 's no secret that holdouts miss out .
In 2007 , Raiders quarterback JaMarcus Russell , the No. 1 overall pick , skipped all of training camp and held out until Sept. 12 .
Russell completed just 36 passes for 373 yards as a rookie , and , two years later , is still struggling in his role as a starter .
Two first - round quarterbacks in 2008 -- Atlanta 's Matt Ryan and Baltimore 's Joe Flacco -- were in camp on time and thrived on playoff teams as rookies .
" It 's just a situation that physically , as well as mentally , they have no idea what they 're missing , " says former Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson .
" Now it 's the regular season , and [ Crabtree ] has already missed two games .
He 's basically just taking his rookie year and throwing it away from a career standpoint and a financial standpoint .
" I do n't think there 's any way he 'll ever recover the experience he 's losing this year in the National Football League , and I do n't think he 'll ever recover the financial loss . "
Peterson knows all about the perils of rookie holdouts .
In 2002 , he drafted defensive tackle Ryan Sims with the No. 6 overall pick , then watched Sims go through a long contract dispute .
When he finally arrived on the team , out of shape , Sims lasted just a couple of weeks .
He dislocated his elbow , was out for the season and spent the next year playing catch - up .
By the time his five - year run was over in Kansas City , he had amassed just 54 tackles and five sacks .
Though rookies are drafted in late April , the negotiations , Peterson says , do n't start in earnest until about two weeks before training camp .
Agents want to wait and see where the numbers and the market are .
The NFL has a slotting system that , in most scenarios , decreases compensation according to draft order .
So general managers put up a firm stand with rookie pools and slotting , and agents fight to get more guaranteed money .
The phone calls increase as the days creep closer to camp .
When a player holds out , Peterson says , front - office personnel go through various stages of emotions .
" After the frustration and the maddening anger , " he says , " then it goes to disappointment .
" The one thing we know for sure , and that players eventually figure out , is that the National Football League moves on .
Players
They 're always replaced .
The league goes on , players continue to play , coaches continue to coach , and the game goes on . "
Holdouts of the past
No , the games did n't stop without Crabtree .
In the opening week of the season , the 49ers shocked Arizona , the defending NFC champ , on the Cardinals ' home field .
Like most days , coach Mike Singletary steered the postgame commentary away from Crabtree , choosing to focus on the 53 guys who were there .
But eventually , the 49ers will have to talk about Crabtree .
They have until Nov. 17 to sign him if he 's going to play this season .
After Aug. 14 , the club was no longer permitted to trade Crabtree 's rights .
The next point he can be traded is at the start of the 2010 trading period on March 5 .
If Crabtree is not signed and he is not traded , he would go back into the April draft .
If Crabtree does n't flinch and sits out the whole season , it wo n't be unprecedented .
Kelly Stouffer was picked by the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round of the ' 87 draft , could n't agree to a contract , and had his rights traded to the Seahawks the following year .
Stouffer never became a franchise quarterback , and drifted away after his second stint in the league ended in 1996 .

And then there was Tom Cousineau , the No. 1 overall pick of the 1979 draft who never played a down for the Bills .
Cousineau , initially miffed by what he perceived as shoddy treatment by Buffalo , was ultimately lured away by bigger money in the CFL .
He played in Canada for three years , made twice as much as he would have in the NFL , and one day out of the blue received a six - figure bonus from a generous front - office person to help cure his homesickness .
Cousineau eventually found his way back to the NFL , and had a good career .
But to this day , he still has regrets .
His heart told him to play in Buffalo , to take what the Bills offered .
His head said to go where the money took him .
" Negotiating protocol and all that goes with that it was so foreign to me , " Cousineau says .
" You have to believe in people .
I thought I 'd made a good choice with [ agent ] Jimmy Walsh , and I believe that to this day .
He was looking out for my best interests .
" Who out there , all things being equal , would prefer to work for less money than more money ?
Who makes that choice ? "
One thing people close to Crabtree know is that he 's stubborn .
When an opposing defensive back would mouth off in the media and challenge him , Crabtree generally had his most productive games .
He always believed , every Saturday , that he was the best receiver on the field .
He was confident , going into the 2009 draft , that he was the best receiver in the rookie class .
And when the Raiders stunned the Radio City Music Hall crowd by picking Darrius Heyward - Bey , not Crabtree , at No. 7 , the trouble , apparently , began .
" I know he has the inner confidence in him that he was the best receiver last year , " Simmons says .
" When he does get on the field , a lot of people are going to be eating their words .
He 's going to be a phenomenal player .
That 's his passion . "
Preparing to play
On a late - summer day in the Bay Area recently , Crabtree resurfaced .
He ran and jumped and caught roughly 70 footballs from former NFL quarterback Trent Dilfer .
They talked for more than an hour about what Crabtree can expect when he finally gets into a league that he is seemingly so determined to impress , yet so adamantly avoids .
A mutual acquaintance of Crabtree and Dilfer set up the workout , and the pair has met three times in the past month or so to talk about everything but contract negotiations .
Tom Cousineau , who would n't initially sign with the Buffalo Bills , instead went to the CFL's Montreal Alouettes .
He later went to the NFL and ended up with the Cleveland Browns .

" I told him early on that I would n't go there , " says Dilfer , who also serves as an ESPN analyst .
" He 's a very focused kid .
Far more focused than kids his age , " Dilfer says .
" He compartmentalizes things .
My impression is that in his mind , he 's compartmentalized this as saying , ' Hey , my job is to be ready to play when my people put me in position to play . '
He does n't think he 's part of that .
He 's just focused on getting himself physically and mentally ready for the NFL .
And he thinks the business side of it -- of signing or not -- is a whole separate issue , and he 's not concerning himself with it . "
How long can he go ?
Crabtree wo n't be hurting for money any time soon .
He has endorsement deals with Subway , EA Sports and Nike Jordan Brand sneakers .
Trading cards could possibly net him another six figures .
Last weekend , a few folks from Texas Tech wondered if Crabtree might show up on the sideline for the annual rivalry game with Texas .
Just a year ago , Crabtree delivered his iconic moment against the Longhorns , catching the game - winning touchdown pass in the final seconds , doing it in double coverage .
That night , he went home with his family and did push - ups during the commercials of a TV movie .
He did n't need a party , or an entourage .
Crabtree was just preparing for what was ahead .
" The 49ers desperately need to sign their first pick , " Leach says , " and Crabtree desperately needs to play football this season .
Where the dust all settles , I do n't know .
But you wonder if both sides will feel like it was worth it , you know ? "

MILLVILLE --
A hanging flower pot in the city 's downtown arts district temporarily served as a hanging pot pot .
Police pulled two marijuana plants from the hanging flower basket located in front of 112 N. High St. Tuesday afternoon after receiving a report of the cannabis growing there .
Police believe the illicit plants began growing after someone hurled marijuana seeds into the flower basket from an overhead apartment .
It was a passerby who spotted the marijuana plants growing in the basket , according to police .
The basket is filled with pink flowers and hangs about 12 feet off the ground .
Flower baskets line North High Street in the Glasstown Arts District .
They are owned by the city and maintained by the recreation and parks department .
Noam Chomsky talks about Marijuana July 27 , 2008
IF you want an interesting historical breakdown of why marijuana is illegal this is a great piece of audio .
Chomsky explains that it has nothing to do with the herb ’s effects or danger but really was made illegal so the police could go after , harass and basically outlaw citizens or groups of people they did n’t like .
For example in England at one point Gin was outlawed but not whiskey , poor people drank gin …
Marijuana prohibition was created just to target an ethnic group , it ’s roots are extremely racist and have nothing to do with science or medicine , everyone thats ever wondered why the useful mj plant is illegal should check this out !
Taleb , principal at Universa Investments and coiner of the " Black Swan " term to explain drastic , unpredictable events , said in a live interview that choking debt , continued high unemployment and a system that rewards bad behavior will hamstring an economic recovery .
" It is a matter of risk and responsibility , and I think the risks that were there before , these problems are still there , " he said .
" We still have a very high level of debt , we still have leadership that 's literally incompetent ... "
" They did not see the problem , the do n't look at the core of problem .
There 's an elephant in the room and they did not identify it . "
Pointing his finger directly at Fed Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and President Obama , Taleb said policymakers need to begin converting debt into equity but instead are continuing the programs that created the financial crisis .
" I do n't think that structural changes have been addressed , " he said .
" It does n't look like they 're fully aware of the problem , or they 're overlooking it because they do n't want to take hard medicine . "
With Bernanke 's term running out , Taleb said Obama would be making a mistake by reappointing the Fed chairman .

A US lawyer has claimed that copyright is violated when courts pass legal submissions on to a commercial publisher .
The lawyer claims that the US courts ' behaviour undermines the hundreds of hours of work put into submissions .
An intellectual property law expert at Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM , said that an exemption in UK copyright law would be likely to protect such publication of writs over here .
Edmond Connor of California law firm Connor , Fletcher and Williams has written to California 's Chief Justice Ronald George and its administrative director of courts , William Vickrey , to demand that they stop passing submissions to legal publishers LexisNexis and Westlaw .
" I am not exaggerating when I say that I was shocked to learn … that copies of all appellate briefs served on the Supreme Court were being routinely handed over to Westlaw and Lexis , " he wrote in his letter .
" Our firm was surprised to learn that a 143 - page brief that had taken us hundreds of hours to prepare in an employment discrimination case that we were handling on behalf of an indigent client was being marketed and sold to other attorneys . "
" To my knowledge the Supreme Court 's practice of turning all appellate briefs over to Westlaw and Lexis has never been publicly disclosed and I believe that few , if any , attorneys in California know anything about this arrangement , " wrote Connor .
" The unrestricted distribution of briefs to Westlaw and Lexis directly aids them in infringing the copyrights held by the attorneys who authored those briefs . "
Connor proposed a system which would allow lawyers to control whether or not their briefs were sent to the publishing companies and would enable them to share in earnings for those that were .
" If there are profits to be made in making appellate briefs available online , then the vendors of those briefs should share those profits with the authors of the briefs , " he said .
Connor said that one of the lawyers at his firm researched whether or not copyright was infringed by the legal publishers and concluded that it was .
" The authors of briefs filed with the California Courts hold valid , enforceable copyrights in their briefs , and ...
Lexis and Westlaw have engaged in massive copyright infringement by copying and distributing those briefs for profit without seeking the copyright holders ' consent , " he wrote .
Iain Connor , an intellectual property specialist at Pinsent Masons , the law firm behind OUT - LAW .
COM , said that publishers would be likely to be allowed to make such material available in the UK .
" Copyright exists in a writ or a court filing in the usual way because they are original works .
However , the legislation contains a ' fair use ' exemption for work done both for the purposes of judicial or parliamentary proceedings and the reporting of them , " he said .
The exemption , at section 45 of the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act , is for " anything done for the purposes of parliamentary or judicial proceedings " .
It also says that copyright is not infringed by anything done for the purposes of reporting proceedings , but that this does not authorise the copying of a work which is itself a published report of the proceedings .
" If a publisher like LexisNexis publishes a detailed analysis of a writ , it can argue that it is reporting the proceedings , but it will enjoy copyright protection in its own analysis , " he said .
" Further , the fair use exemption specifically says that it does not allow people to copy someone 's report of the proceedings . "
" So another person wo n't infringe copyright if their work is either for a court case or reporting on it but the writ and court filings retain their copyright protection in other contexts , " he said .
Though it is most likely lawful for publications to publish filings as part of their reporting of judicial proceedings , then , it is less clear whether another lawyer 's use of those filings for their own purposes would be lawful or not , he said .
" The law is ambiguous on whether someone else would infringe copyright if they copied your writ as a precedent for their own lawsuit , " said Pinsent Masons ' Connor .
" The answer depends on whether or not the courts would see that as fair use being for the purpose of judicial proceedings and therefore exempt from copyright law or not . "
The copyright in court judgments , as opposed to filings , is widely believed to belong to the Crown .
The terms of Crown copyright notices generally state that judgments can be reproduced provided they are reproduced accurately and not used in a misleading context and provided the source is identified and the copyright status acknowledged .
Some judges have disputed the Crown 's ownership of copyright in their judgments , though .
A group of judges have claimed that they are not servants of the Crown and that their judgments are in the public domain .

When playing long simulation / strategy games like SimCity , Roller Coaster Tycoon , or Civilization , I often have “ what if ” questions : what if I built an airport there ?
what if I invaded Albania ?
what if I switched to solar power ?
what if I built extra police stations ?
My usual answer is to just keep wondering .
However if I 'm very motivated I can save the game , try something , save it again , go back to the first save game , try the other option , and then compare the results .
It 's rather tedious , so I do n't do it much .
It might be interesting to bring the “ what if ” gameplay into the game itself , instead of being outside of it , as save games .
Games like Chronotron and Braid allow you to go back and try something else , and even see past paths while you 're playing through again .
Halo 3 heatmaps aggregate information from a huge number of games .
I think these ideas apply to simulation / strategy games too .
Imagine if you could “ split ” the timeline into two and watch parallel worlds evolve simultaneously :
If it 's just a matter of running parallel worlds , I could do this by running the game twice , in two side by side windows .
However if it was integrated into the game there 's some potential for interesting gameplay :
The game could run two worlds all the time .
Every 5 minutes the game could ask you which world is better , and then copy that world to both windows .
You could run experiments but they 're all limited to 5 minutes .
You'd be able to learn by experimentation and then use that knowledge in the future .
The game could run one world most of the time , but then in a world - splitting event , split into two .
In one world you'd be asked to destroy ; in the other , to build .
You 'd gain bonus points for maximizing the difference between the worlds .
The game could let you play in one window and show in the other window the accumulated plays from your previous games on the same map , or perhaps from other people 's games .
Differences in play would be highlighted , and you 'd gain points for novel play styles .
In Halo , you might get a bonus for a sniper shot from a location where few people succeed making a sniper shot .
In a multiplayer setting , each player could play in her own world for a few minutes , and then the game would ask everyone to vote for their favorite world other than their own , and then that world would become the baseline for the next round of play .
It might be possible to integrate this into a Facebook game that you play asynchronously with your friends .
If playing against a computer AI , it might be fair to let the computer player occasionally choose which world it prefers .
The strategy would then be to set up a world that appears to give you a disadvantage without actually doing so .
The Chess equivalent would be to intentionally sacrifice a rook in order to set up a winning move .
I 'd love to see games explictly tackle parallel worlds , individually and in aggregate .

I recently interviewed for a job in Boston , in which I would get to work with Shae Erisson ( shapr ) and Edward Kmett , which would be a wonderful treat , of course .
But I turned it down after it was described to me .
My reasoning at the time was that it was too formal and there were not enough hard problems for my taste .
But after a little reflecting , I realize that that ’s not the reason at all :
I believe now that I am deeply and fundamentally an artist .
At a job like that , I ’m just an engineer building products for customers .
I am not cut out for engineering as an industry .
I ’m currently making a game with my friend Max about gravity and the universe , which we plan to enter into the independent games festival at GDC .
In the process of making this game , we written and scrapped three large - scale gravitational simulation algorithms , and are developing our fourth .
We have learned and are simulating a fair amount of cosmology .
We even tried to use some general relativity to solve the simulation problems .
Our gameplay will probably not be intuitive to the naive player , but that ’s because the naive player does n’t really understand gravity , and we believe that showing the true nature of the universe trumps pandering to ignorance to flatten the learning curve .
Clearly , our hearts are in this : this is n’t just a game to take to the bank .
We ’re trying to show people something about the beauty of the universe .
Dana is also a work of art .
That ’s why I ’m having trouble understanding what it is as a clearly - stated engineering goal .
It is evading the usual engineering practices , because it ’s not trying to solve a specific problem .
Really what Dana is trying to be is advanced technology .
I want it to do whatever it does , and when the code pop culture sees it they have the sense that they are looking at alien technology : it is compact , unfamiliar , but obviously very elegant , whatever it is .
When you dig into its subproblems and put in the effort understand them , the response will be “ Oh !
Of course that ’s how you do that ! ”
The realization that Dana is art has convinced me to try to reduce it ’s scope .
It is more important that it do one thing in the most beautiful way , than for it to be a complete foundation for arbitrary software .
And I have always been an artist with my music .
My friend Eric Shapiro bought a piano for me to play on the Pearl Street mall , in exchange for 25 % of my earnings .
It is going great : I often attract crowds of 20 or more watching me improvise and make about $ 40 / hr doing it .
Eric helped me see that my music can be valued .
So I ’ve decided to be more industrious about it — after all , the music industry is about supporting artists ( even if it is mostly corrupt ) ; in contrast , I do n’t know anyone who would pay for something like Dana .
I ’m developing a solo album to sell on the mall and approach record companies with .
I ’m trying to think of a pseudonym ( my name is pretty lame ) .
During the winter I ’ll make my money with teaching and shows .
Essentially , my plan is curiously “ I ’ll use music to support myself , so I have time for my art . ”
It ’s harder to make good money with music than with engineering .
But I think this plan will lead me to a happier lifestyle than wasting my half my life on an engineering project that I could n’t give a rats ass about , just so I can have a surplus of money in the other half .

Daniel Dennett : Autobiography ( Part 1 )
What makes a philosopher ?
In the first of a two - part mini-epic , Daniel C. Dennett contemplates a life of the mind – his own .
Part 1 : The pre-professional years .
It came as a pleasant surprise to me when I learned – around age twelve or thirteen – that not all the delicious and unspeakable thoughts of my childhood had to be kept private .
Some of them were called ‘ philosophy ’ , and there were legitimate , smart people who discussed these fascinating topics in public .
While less immediately exciting than some of the other , still unspeakable , topics of my private musings , they were attention - riveting , and they had an aura of secret knowledge .
Maybe I was a philosopher .
That ’s what the counselors at Camp Mowglis in New Hampshire suggested , and it seemed that I might be good at it .
My family did n’t discourage the idea .
My mother and father were both the children of doctors , and both had chosen the humanities .
My mother , an English major at Carleton College in Minnesota , went on for a Masters in English from the University of Minnesota , before deciding that she simply had to get out of Minnesota and see the world .
Never having been out the Midwest , and bereft of any foreign languages , she took a job teaching English at the American Community School in Beirut .
There she met my father , Daniel C. Dennett Jr , working on his PhD in Islamic history at Harvard while teaching at the American University of Beirut .
His father , the first Daniel C. Dennett , was a classic small town general practitioner in Winchester , Massachusetts , the suburb of Boston where I spent most of my childhood .
So yes , I am Daniel C. Dennett III ; but since childhood I ’ve disliked the Roman numerals , and so I chose to court confusion among librarians ( how can DCD Jr be the father of DCD ? ) instead of acquiescing in my qualifier .
My father ’s academic career got off to a fine start , with an oft - reprinted essay , ‘ Pirenne and Muhammed ’ , which I was thrilled to find on the syllabus of a history course I took as an undergraduate .
His first job was at Clark University .
When World War II came along , he put his intimate knowledge of the Middle East to use as a secret agent in the OSS , stationed in Beirut .
He was killed on a mission , in an airplane crash in Ethiopia in 1947 , when I was five .
So my mother and two sisters and I moved from Beirut to Winchester , where I grew up in the shadow of everybody ’s memories of a quite legendary father .
In my youth some of my friends were the sons of eminent or even famous professors at Harvard or MIT , and I saw the toll it took on them as they strove to be worthy of their fathers ’ attention .
I shudder to think of what would have become of me if I had had to live up to my own father ’s actual , living expectations and not just to those extrapolated in absentia by his friends and family .
As it was , I was blessed with the bracing presumption that I would excel , and few serious benchmarks against which to test it .
It was assumed by all that I would eventually go to Harvard and become a professor – of one humanities discipline or another .
The fact that from about the age of five I was fascinated with building things , taking things apart , repairing things , never even prompted the question of whether I might want to become an engineer – a prospect in our circle about as remote as becoming a lion tamer .
I might become an artist – a painter , sculptor or musician – but not an engineer .
In my first year in Winchester High School I had two wonderful semesters of ancient history , taught by lively , inspiring interns from the Harvard School of Education .
I poured my heart into a term paper on Plato , with a drawing of Rodin ’s Thinker on the cover .
Deep stuff , I thought ; but the fact was that I hardly understood a word of what I read for it .
More important , really , was that I knew then – thank you , Catherine Laguardia and Michael Greenebaum wherever you are – that I was going to be a teacher .
The only question was , what subject ?
I spent my last two years of high school at Phillips Exeter Academy , largely because my father ’s old friends persuaded my mother that this was obligatory for the son of DCD Jr. Thank you , long - departed friends .
There I was immersed in a wonderfully intense intellectual stew , where the editor of the literary magazine had more cachet than the captain of the football team ; where boys read books that were n’t on the assigned reading ; where I learned to write ( and write , and write , and write ) .
My Olivetti Lettera portable typewriter ( just like Michael Greenebaum ’s – cool ! ) churned out hundreds of pages over two years , but none of it was philosophy yet .
As much to upset the family ’s expectations as for any other reason , I eschewed Harvard for Wesleyan University , and arrived with advanced placement in math and English , having had excellent teachers in both areas at Exeter .
I did n’t want to go on in calculus , but they twisted my arm to take an advanced math course , under the mistaken idea that I was some sort of mathematical prodigy .
I acquiesced , signing up for something called ‘ Topics in Modern Mathematics ’ , taught by a young lecturer from Princeton , the logician Henry Kyburg in his first job .
Since I and a grad student in the math department were the only two students enrolled in the course , Henry asked and got our permission to make it a course in mathematical logic .
He promptly immersed us in Quine ’s Mathematical Logic , followed by Kleene , Ramsey , and even Wittgenstein ’s Tractatus , among other texts .
Quite a first course in logic for a seventeen year - old !
If I had been a mathematical prodigy , as advertised , this would no doubt have made pedagogical sense ; but I was soon gasping for air and in danger of drowning .
Freshman year was turning out to be more challenging than I had expected .
One night as I crammed in the math library , I took a breather and scouted out the shelves .
Quine ’s From a Logical Point of View caught my eye , and I sat down to sample it .
By breakfast I had finished my first of several readings of it , and made up my mind to transfer to Harvard .
This Quine person was very , very interesting – but wrong .
I could n’t yet say exactly how or why , but I was quite sure .
So I decided , as only a freshman could , that I had to confront him directly and see what I could learn from him – and teach him !
A reading of Descartes ’ Meditations in my first philosophy course , with Louis Mink , not only confirmed my conviction that I had discovered what it was I was going to teach , but narrowed the field considerably : philosophy of mind and language transfixed my curiosity .
When I showed up at Harvard in the fall of 1960 , the first course I signed up for was Quine ’s philosophy of language course , and the main text was his brand new book , Word and Object .
Perfect timing .
I devoured the course , and was delighted to find that the other students in the class were really quite as good as I had hoped Harvard students would be .
Most were grad students ; among them ( if memory serves ) were David Lewis , Tom Nagel , Saul Kripke , Gil Harman , Margaret Wilson , Michael Slote , David Lyons .
A fast class .
When it came to the final exam I had never been so well prepared , with As on both early papers , and every reading chewed over and over .
But I froze .
I knew too much , had thought too much about the problems and could see , I thought , way beyond the questions posed – too far beyond to enable any answer at all .
Quine ’s teaching assistant , Dagfinn Follesdal , must have taken pity on me , for I received a B- in the course .
Follesdal also agreed to be my supervisor when two years later I told him that I ’d been working on my senior thesis , ‘ Quine and Ordinary Language ’ ever since I ’d taken the course .
I did n’t want Quine to supervise me , since he ’d probably show me I was wrong before I got a chance to write it out , and then where would I be ?
I had sought Quine out , however , for bibliographical help , asking him to direct me to the best anti-Quinians .
I needed all the allies I could find .
He directed me to Chomsky ’s Syntactic Structures , the first of Lotfi Zadeh ’s papers on fuzzy logic , and Wittgenstein ’s Philosophical Investigations , which I devoured in the summer of 1962 , while on my honeymoon job as a sailing and tennis instructor at Salter ’s Point , a family summer community in Buzzards Bay ( my bride , Susan , was the swimming instructor ) .
1962 - 3 , my senior year at Harvard , was exciting but far from carefree – I was now a married man at the age of 20 , and I had to complete my four - year project to Refute Quine , who was very , very interesting but wrong .
Freed from the diversions and distractions of student life , I worked with an intensity I have seldom experienced .
I can recall several times reflecting that it really did n’t matter in the larger scheme of things whether I was right or wrong : I was engulfed in doing exactly what I wanted to be doing , pursuing a valuable quarry through daunting complexities , and figuring out for myself answers to some of the most perplexing questions I ’d ever encountered .
Dagfinn , bless his heart , knew enough not to try to do more than gently steer me away from the most dubious overreachings in my grand scheme .
I was not strictly out of control , but I was beyond turning back .
The thesis was duly typed up in triplicate and handed in ( by a professional typist , back in those days before word - processing ) .
I anxiously awaited the day when Quine and young Charles Parsons , my examiners , would let me know what they made of it .
Quine showed up with maybe half a dozen single - spaced pages of comments .
I knew at that moment that I was going to be a philosopher .
( I was also an aspiring sculptor , and had shown some of my pieces in exhibits and competitions in Boston and Cambridge .
Quine had taken a fancy to some of my pieces and always remarked positively on them whenever we met , so I had been getting equivocal signals from my hero – was he really telling me to concentrate on sculpture ? )
On this occasion Quine responded to my arguments with the seriousness of a colleague , conceding a few crucial points ( hurrah ! ) and offering counter - arguments to others ( just as good , really ) .
Parsons sided with me on a point of contention .
I ca n’t remember what it was , but I was mightily impressed that he would join David against Goliath .
The affirmation was exhilarating .
Maybe I really was going to be a philosopher .
But if so , I was going to be a rather different philosopher from those around me .
I had no taste for much that delighted my Harvard classmates or the graduate students .
Ryle ’s Concept of Mind was one of the few contemporary books in philosophy that I actually liked .
( Another was Stephen Toulmin ’s The Place of Reason in Ethics , which seems to have vanished without a trace , whereas I thought it was clearly superior to the other readings in my ethics courses . )
I could n’t see why others found Ryle so unpersuasive .
To me , he was obviously and refreshingly right about something deep , in spite of various overstatements and baffling bits .
I decided that Ryle would make a logical next step in my education , so I applied to Oxford , to read for the notoriously difficult B. Phil degree .
Burton Dreben tried to dissuade me – now that Austin had died , he assured me , there was nobody , really , in Oxford with whom to study .
I also applied to Berkeley , though I can’t remember why .
And I applied to Harvard , but Harvard wisely had a policy of not admitting their own graduates , and I treasured the letter of rejection I got from the then Dean of Graduate Admissions , Nina Dennett : she signed it ‘ Aunt Nina ’ , although she was a somewhat more distant relative .
I also got rejected by all three Oxford colleges to which I had applied .
Back then , they had no university - wide admissions system , and I had applied , as it turned out , to three of the most popular colleges among Rhodes and Marshall scholars : Balliol , Magdalen and University .
They were oversubscribed with Americans with scholarships and had no room for me , even though I would be paying for myself with a modest legacy from DCD the first , who had died a few years earlier .
But just as I was about to send Berkeley my downpayment to reserve a married student apartment for the fall term , out of the blue I received a letter from the Principal of Hertford College , Oxford , telling me that they were prepared to admit me to read for the B.
Phil in philosophy .
I had not applied to Hertford , and in fact had never even heard of it , and at first I suspected that somebody who knew of my disappointment was playing an evil prank on me .
I looked up Hertford College in the Oxford University Bulletin , confirmed its reality , and accepted .
It did n’t matter which college I was in , reading for the B.
Phil : my supervisor would be one of the professors – Ryle , Ayer or Kneale – and I figured that I would almost certainly be able to work with Ryle , although his name had n’t come up in my correspondence with Hertford .
Years later , Ryle told me that he ’d been on the admissions committee at Magdalen and read Quine ’s letter of recommendation .
Magdalen could n’t fit me in , so he ’d sent the application with a little note to a friend in Hertford , where they were eager to get a few American grad students .
So I owed more than I guessed to both my mentors .
My wife and I sailed to England in the summer of 1963 .
I carried with me an idea I had had about qualia , as philosophers call the phenomenal qualities of experiences , such as the smell of coffee or the ‘ redness ’ of red .
In my epistemology course at Harvard with Roderick Firth , I had had what struck me as an important insight – obvious to me but strangely repugnant to those I had tried it out on .
I claimed that what was caused to happen in you when you looked at something red only seemed to be a quale – a homogeneous , unanalyzable , self - intimating ‘ intrinsic ’ property .
Subjective experiences of color , for instance , could n’t actually owe the way they seemed to their intrinsic properties ; their intrinsic properties could in principle change without any subjective change ; what mattered for subjectivity were properties that were – I did n’t have a word for it then– functional , relational .
The same was going to be true of [ mental ] content properties in general , I thought .
The meaning of an idea , or a thought , just could n’t be a self - contained , isolated patch of psychic paint ( what I later jocularly called ‘ figment ’ ) ; it had to be a complex dispositional property – a set of behavior - guiding , action - prompting triggers .
This idea struck me as congenial with , if not implied by , what Ryle was saying .
But when I got to Oxford , I found that these ideas seemed even stranger to my fellow graduate students at Oxford than at Harvard .
This was already beyond the heyday and into the decline of ‘ ordinary language philosophy ’ , but thanks to the lamentable phenomenon of philosophical hysteresis ( graduate students tend to crowd onto bandwagons just as they grind to a halt ) , Oxford was enjoying total domination of Anglophone philosophy .
It was a swarming Mecca for dozens – maybe hundreds – of pilgrims from the colonies who wanted to take the cloth and learn the moves .
There was the Voltaire Society and the Ockham Society , just for graduate students .
At one of their meetings in my first term , in the midst of a discussion of Anscombe ’s Intention , as I recall , the issue came up of what to say about one ’s attempts to raise one ’s arm when it had gone ‘ asleep ’ from lying on it .
At the time I knew nothing about the nervous system , but it seemed obvious to me that something must be going on in one ’s brain that somehow amounted to trying to raise one ’s arm , and it might be illuminating to learn what science knew about this .
My suggestion was met with incredulous stares .
What on earth did science have to teach philosophy ?
This was a philosophical puzzle about ‘ what we would say ’ , not a scientific puzzle about nerves and the like .
This was the first of many encounters in which I found my fellow philosophers of mind weirdly complacent in their ignorance of brains and psychology , and I began to define my project as figuring out as a philosopher how brains could be , or support , or explain , or cause , minds .
I asked a friend studying medicine at Oxford what brains were made of , and vividly remember him drawing simplified diagrams of neurons , dendrites , axons – all new terms to me .
It immediately occurred to me that a neuron , with multiple inputs and a modifiable branching output , would be just the thing that could compose into networks which could learn by a sort of evolutionary process .
Many others have had the same idea , of course , before and since .
Once you get your head around it , you see that this really is the way – probably , in the end , the only way – to eliminate the middleman , the all - too - knowing librarian or clerk or homunculus who manipulates the ideas or mental representations , sorting them by content .
With this insight driving me , I began to see how to concoct something of a ‘ centralist ’ theory of intentionality .
( This largely unexamined alternative was suggested by Charles Taylor in his pioneering book , The Explanation of Behaviour in 1964 . )
The failure of Skinnerian and Pavlovian ‘ black box ’ behaviorism to account for human and animal behavior purely in the ‘ extensional ’ terms of histories of stimulus and response suggested that we needed to justify a non-extensional , ‘ intensional ’ ( with an ‘ s ’ ) theory of intentionality ( with a ‘ t ’ ) : a theory that looked inside at the machinery of mind and explained how internal states and events could be about things , and thereby motivate the mental system of which they were a part to decide on courses of action .
[ see box on p.24 ]
The result would be what would later be called a functionalist , and then teleofunctionalist , theory of content , in which Brentano and Husserl ( thank you , Dagfinn ) and Quine could all be put together , but at the subpersonal level .
The personal / subpersonal distinction was my own innovation , driven by my attempts to figure out what on earth Ryle was doing and how he could get away with it .
It is clear that my brain does n’t understand English – I do – and my hand does n’t sign a contract – I do .
But it is also clear that I do n’t interpret the images on my retinas , and I do n’t figure out how to make my fingers grasp the pen .
We need the subpersonal level of explanation to account for the remarkably intelligent components of me that do the cognitive work that makes it possible for me to do clever things .
In order to understand this subpersonal level of explanation , I needed to learn about the brain ; so I spent probably five times as much energy educating myself in Oxford ’s Radcliffe Science Library as I did reading philosophy articles and books .
I went to Ryle , my supervisor , to tell him that I could n’t possibly succeed in the B.
Phil , which required one to submit a ( modest ) thesis and take three very tough examinations in the space of a few weeks at the end of one ’s second year .
As I have already mentioned , I was an erratic examination - taker under the best of conditions , and I was consumed with passion to write my thesis .
I knew to a moral certainty that I would fail at least one of the examinations simply because I could n’t make myself prepare for it while working white hot on the thesis .
I proposed to switch to the B. Litt ; a thesis - only degree that would let me concentrate on the thesis and then go off to Berkeley for a proper PhD .
To my delight and surprise , Ryle said that I might have to settle for a B.
Litt as a consolation prize of sorts , but that he was prepared to recommend me for the D.
Phil , which also required just a thesis .
With that green light , I was off and running , but the days of inspiration were balanced by weeks and months of confusion , desperation and uncertainty .
A tantalizing source of alternating inspiration and frustration was Hilary Putnam , whose ‘ Minds and Machines ’ ( 1960 ) I had found positively earthshaking .
I set to work feverishly to build on it in my own work , only to receive an advance copy of Putnam ’s second paper on the topic , ‘ Robots : Machines or Artificially Created Life ? ’ from my mole back at Harvard ( it was not published until 1967 ) .
This scooped my own efforts and then some .
No sooner had I recovered and started building my own edifice on Putnam paper number two than I was spirited a copy of Putnam paper number three , ‘ The Mental Life of Some Machines ’ ( eventually published in 1967 ) and found myself left behind yet again .
So it went .
I think I understood Putnam ’s papers almost as well as he did – which was not quite well enough to see farther than he could what step to take next .
Besides , I was trying to put a rather different slant on the whole topic , and it was not at all clear to me that , or how , I could make it work .
Whenever I got totally stumped , I would go for a long , depressed walk in the glorious Parks along the River Cherwell .
Marvelous to say , after a few hours of tramping back and forth with my umbrella , muttering to myself and wondering if I should go back to sculpture , a breakthrough would strike me and I ’d dash happily back to our flat and my trusty Olivetti for another whack at it .
This was such a reliable source of breakthroughs that it became a dangerous crutch ; when the going got tough , I ’d just pick up my umbrella and head out to the Parks , counting on salvation before suppertime .
Gilbert Ryle himself was the other pillar of support I needed .
In many regards he ruled Oxford philosophy at the time , as editor of Mind and informal clearing - house for jobs throughout the Anglophone world , but at the same time he stood somewhat outside the cliques and coteries , the hotbeds of philosophical fashion .
He disliked and disapproved of the reigning Oxford fashion of clever , supercilious philosophical one - upmanship , and disrupted it when he could .
He never ‘ fought back ’ .
In fact , I tried to provoke him , with elaborately - prepared and heavily - armed criticisms of his own ideas , but he would genially agree with all my good points as if I were talking about somebody else , and get us thinking what repairs and improvements we could together make of what remained .
It was disorienting , and my opinion of him then – often expressed to my fellow graduate students , I am sad to say – was that while he was wonderful at cheering me up and encouraging me to stay the course , I had n’t learned any philosophy from him .
I finished a presentable draft of my dissertation in the minimum time ( six terms or two years ) and submitted it with scant expectation that it would be accepted on first go .
On the eve of submitting it , I came across an early draft of it , and compared the final product with its ancestor .
To my astonishment , I could see Ryle ’s influence on every page .
How had he done it ?
Osmosis ?
Hypnotism ?
This gave me an early appreciation of the power of indirect methods in philosophy .
You seldom talk anybody out of a position by arguing directly with their premises and inferences .
Sometimes it is more effective to nudge them sideways with images , examples , helpful formulations that stick to their habits of thought .
My examiners were A.J. Ayer and the great neuroanatomist J.Z. Young from London – an unprecedented alien presence at a philosophy viva , occasioned by my insistence on packing my thesis with speculations on brain science .
He too had been struck by the idea of learning as evolution in the brain , and was writing a book on it , so we were kindred spirits on that topic , if not on the philosophy , which he found intriguing but impenetrable .
Ayer was reserved .
I feared he had not read much of the thesis , but I later found out he was simply made uncomfortable by his friend Young ’s too - enthusiastic forays into philosophy , and he found silence more useful than intervention .
I waited in agony for more than a week before I learned via a cheery postcard from Ryle that the examiners had voted me the degree .
Since I had the degree , I would n’t need to go to U.C. [ University of California ]
Berkeley after all .
So on a wonderful day in May 1965 , a few weeks after my 23rd birthday , I sent off two letters to California : I accepted an Assistant Professorship at U.C. Irvine , where A.I. Melden was setting up a philosophy department in a brand new campus of the university ; and I declined a Teaching Assistantship at U.C. Berkeley , saying only that I had found another position .
I did n’t dare say that it was a tenure track position at a sister campus !
I was a little worried that there might be some regulations of the University of California prohibiting this sort of thing , whatever sort of thing it was .
Ah , those were the glorious expansionist days in American academia , when it was a seller ’s market in jobs , and I had garnered two solid offers and a few feelers without so much as an interview , let alone a campus visit and job talk .
For formality ’s sake , Melden asked me to send a curriculum vitae along with my official acceptance letter , and I had to ask around Oxford to find out what such an obscure document might be .

Intentional with a ‘ t ’ and Intensional with an ‘s ’
These are two specialist philosophical terms which are used in similar contexts , which are pronounced identically , which are spelt the same way apart from one letter , and yet which mean totally different things !
Confused ?
Do n’t be !
Intentionality
‘ Intentionality ’ is the property of being about or being directed towards something else .
Consciousness is always consciousness of something and thoughts , dreams etc are always about something .
Therefore the mind has intentionality , and one of the puzzles about consciousness is to explain how this comes about .
Intensionality / Extensionality
‘ Intension ’ and ‘ extension ’ are concepts to do with the meaning of words or phrases .
The extension of a term is the class of objects it describes ( for example , the extension of ‘ tiger ’ is the class containing all the tigers in existence , and only these ) .
The intension of the same predicate is the condition which objects must satisfy for it to pick them out .
In the case of ‘ tiger ’ , the intension might be ‘ carniverous quadruped with black and orange stripes and a tail . ’
A woman breaks up with her boyfriend , he thinks it 's because he 's fat .
A man is unable to tell her next door neighbor he finds her sexually attractive .
An old couple wants to split up , but they do n't want to get a divorce .
A therapist masturbates to teen magazines .
An 11 year old kid is insecure about the fact that he has n't cum yet .
Office workers try to recall the face of a coworker who recently died .
A woman is sure she has everything she could ever want .
The lives of these individuals intertwine as they go about their lives in their own unique ways , engaging in acts society as a whole might find disturbing in a desperate search for human connection .

A 12 - year - old schoolboy has admitted a charge that he raped a nine - year - old boy .
The defendant , who can not be named for legal reasons , was 11 at the time of the attack in June .
The hearing , at Newcastle Crown Court , which was sitting as a youth court , was adjourned to allow reports to be prepared .
He was remanded in custody and will next appear before the court for sentencing on 23 October .
It ’s the natural extension of the death panel , and every other political statement that comes out of conservatives ’ mouths nowadays .
Lies , lies , lies , and then you hope they catch on so that no one can debunk them .
Except ABC just has .
ABC never said there were 1.5 million people at the march , which is what the protesters are now claiming ABC said .
In fact , ABC only said that the DC fire dept .
claimed there were 60 k to 70 k protesters .
It ’s funny , protest organizers always inflate the numbers by a factor of two or three .
But a factor of 25 is definitely a new record .
Nate Silver has more :
But yesterday , someone told a real whopper .
ABC News , citing the DC fire department , reported that between 60,000 and 70,000 people had attended the tea party rally at the Capitol .
By the time this figure reached Michelle Malkin , however , it had been blown up to 2,000,000 .
There is a big difference , obviously , between 70,000 and 2,000,000 .
That ’s not a twofold or threefold exaggeration — it ’s roughly a thirtyfold exaggeration .
The way this false estimate came into being is relatively simple : Matt Kibbe , the president of FreedomWorks , lied , claiming that ABC News had reported numbers of between 1.0 and 1.5 million when they never did anything of the sort .
A few tweets later , the numbers had been exaggerated still further to 2 million .
Kibbe was n’t “ in error ” , as Malkin gently puts it .
He lied .
He did the equivalent of telling people that his penis is 53 inches long .
Malkin , who to her credit later corrected the error , frets that it might be used to by liberals to “ discredit the undeniably massive turnout ” .
She ’s right to be worried — it absolutely will be used that way .
If you do n’t want to be discredited , then do n’t , as Kibbe did , tell a ridiculous ( and easily disprovable ) lie .
The Office has an amazing ability to toe the line between reality and total absurdity .
Since Community is made much in the same mold , I think making a comparison here is fair .
The opening with the study group with exception of Britta giving total devotion to Jeff left me confused and wondering what happened .
The pilot showed the formation of the study group and while they liked Jeff , now they are bowing down at his feet ?
Other than that , it was a fine episode .
Ken Jeong 's first appearance as Señor Chang was beyond brilliant .
The homework assignment is to do a simple conversation in Spanish .
Jeff is pared with Pierce who complicates things a whole lot .
Pierce is a crazy old guy with crazy ideas and Jeff sees that , but Pierce wants to be accepted by Jeff .
So Jeff goes along with Pierce to prove to Britta he can be nice .
This culminates into one the funniest scenes I 've seen in a while .
Their presentation turns into a montage with gentle pop music playing in the background .
Jeff and Pierce keep switching into outlandish costumes in outlandish situations ( Pierce and Jeff rowing a " boat " while the Indian Annie is tied up between them ) .
They get F's , but I guess Jeff made an impression on Britta .
The other story was parody on humanitarian protests with Shirley and Annie learning that there are actual atrocities in the world after Britta brings it up .
The protest turns into a joke as they plan more protests in the future for other misdeeds around the world .
I liked how it showed the ignorance of many people and the silliness of some of these protests .
While many are worthwhile causes , sometimes you have to wonder what they are thinking .
Score : 8.7/10
It took five years for Harry Potter and the Philosopher 's Stone to go from idea to finished manuscript , but the results have very clearly been nothing short of spectacular .
Perhaps you also have an idea for a novel kicking around in your head .
Maybe it came to you in the shower one morning before work , or maybe it came to you one evening on the commute home .
Maybe you 're planning to participate in National Novel Writing Month in November .
Whatever the case , writing a novel is an ambitious endeavor , but one that the web is making a lot easier to accomplish .
Though you 'll still have to do your writing using the old fashioned method — one word at a time — web applications and social media have made the process of writing a novel considerably easier and arguably more enjoyable .
Here is a toolkit for using the web to write a book .
If you know of any other great applications useful to aspiring writers , please leave them in the comments .
1. Organize
One of the most important and perhaps most often overlooked aspects of writing a novel is staying organized .
Without organization , it can make the already daunting task of putting your ideas down on paper even more difficult .
Characters and places can become confused and the timeline of events in your novel can get mixed up in a hurry .
While your idea is still in the brainstorming phase , many people find it helpful to create a mind map as a way to figure out how all the events and characters in your story tie together .
One of the best mind mapping applications on the web is Mindmeister , which gives users a way to create , edit , and collaborate on mind maps in an intuitive and visual manner .
Once you know who your characters are and how they interact , you can start laying out the progression of your novel and keep track of what you still need to write by using an outline created using Loosestitch , and a timeline created using Timeglider .
Both tools will help you visualize your novel while you put it down on paper so you always know what comes next and how the pieces that you 're writing will fit together .
If your story is very character heavy , keeping track of all the people in your novel , who they are , and how they interact will be vital to making sure the continuity is n't interrupted .
It may seem silly to treat your fictional characters as real people , but using an online CRM application like Highrise ( which offers a free account good for 250 characters ) , can be a great way to keep track of the people in your book .
Create an entry for each character and treat them like real people , attaching notes about their interactions , histories , and characteristics as you write .
To make sure you never forget an idea , check out Evernote , which is one of the web 's best note taking apps .
It allows you to sync together text , audio , video , and images and offers mobile applications so you can be sure you 'll have a record of your thoughts any time inspiration strikes .
2. Research
Even if your novel takes place in a completely imagined fantasy world , research into the real world may be necessary to make sure your book has the level of realism necessary to allow readers to suspend belief and really identify with your story and characters .
Research used to mean hours in the library pouring over dusty tomes , but the web is changing that .
Online resources like Wikipedia and Google Books give you access to thousands of articles and volumes on a wide range of subjects .
If you need to know , for example , about popular ladies clothing in Victorian France , there is no reason that information can't be found online ( or at the very least , web research can provide you with a comfortable foundation on which to build with more in depth library research ) .
Though it costs $ 19.95 / month , another good resource is Questia , which offers full text , searchable access to over 1.5 million books , journal and magazine articles , and newspapers .
Be sure to also check out The Free Library , which has a library of over 5.7 million articles and books available , and the Smithsonian : Research page , on which writers can find materials from many of the institution 's museum collections .
If you 're suffering from a case of writer 's block , a trip over to the Project Gutenberg page may prove fruitful .
Gutenberg lets anyone read — for free — from a library of nearly 30,000 classic books .
What better way to unstick your writing muscle than by revisiting the classics ?
3. Write
Once you actually get down to the business of writing , the web can make that easier as well .
If you need a full - featured word processor , the leader of the pack in terms of price ( free ) , feature set , ease of use , and reliability might be Google Docs .
One great thing about using an online word processing environment is that your work is stored online and can be accessed from anywhere .
You can also collaborate on writing projects with fellow authors .
One of my favorite books , Good Omens , by Terry Pratchett and Neil Gaiman , was written in the late 1980s by mailing floppy disks back and forth between authors — imagine how much easier it would have been for the two writers had they had access to a web app like Google Docs !
For those who need a more distraction - free writing environment , check out the recently launched MyWritingNook , a full - browser - screen writing application that is great for just getting your ideas down without worrying about formatting or anything else .
MyWritingNook auto - saves as your work , provides sidebar access to a dictionary and thesaurus ( the sidebar can be turned off , though ) , and lets you easily create and switch between multiple documents , so you can separate chapters as you write .
It 's an ideal tool for your first draft , when the focus should be about the big picture and just getting your ideas out of your head and onto the page .
If you 're a Mac user and a fan of the popular WriteRoom software , another distraction - free , full - screen writing environment , check out their new iPhone application .
It automatically syncs with your WriteRoom files , and lets you read and edit on the go , including in landscape mode .
Of course , the web is a social medium , so if you crave a more collaborative writing environment , look no further than Protagonize .
Protagonize is a collaborative writing community on which writers share , develop , discuss , and refine works of creative writing with one another .
In the nearly two years since opening , authors on Protagonize have shared over 25,000 pages of writing with one another .
4. Connect
Writing can be a very solitary task .
The image we have of writers is often that of a lonely person , sitting in their attic or locked in a hotel room typing away until they go mad ( like Johnny Depp 's character in " Secret Window " ) .
Social media has brought us all closer , including those of use for whom putting words down on paper is a trade .
One of the most established social networks for writers is Red Room , on which wordsmiths — including a large number of well - known published authors — connect and discuss their craft .
Of course , the most well - known social resource for writers is probably Writing.com .
Though it 's a little old school , the site has over 650,000 members and thriving forums for writers .
If you 're looking for feedback on your work , check out WritingRoom and 1000 Keyboards.com , social networks targeted at authors that both offer peer review functions .
Or visit The Book Oven , a new site on which users can upload stories and then invite friends , colleagues , or perfect strangers to help polish and edit their work .
5. Publish
It could take years to write your manuscript , or it could take a few weeks .
But whenever you 're done , once you have your book in a publishable form , the web can also help you get it onto bookstore shelves .
Print - on - demand publishing services like Lulu and Amazon 's CreateSpace can not only publish your book in a number and variety of great looking formats , they can also help you with the details , like securing an ISBN , getting your book listed in the Bowker 's Books in Print catalog , and helping make your book available in store shelves — both real and virtual .
If writing is more of a personal hobby and not a vocation for you , then Blurb might be a good choice for printing your book up in a very beautiful and readable format that you can share with family and friends .
Whichever service you choose , if you go the self - publishing route , you can make your book even more professional looking and make it stand out more on store shelves by having a cover designed by the crowd using a service like 99designs or crowdSPRING .
Before you turn to self - publishing , though , it can't hurt to at least try to find a traditional publisher .
In that case , you 'll probably need an agent , in which case AgentQuery is an excellent service .
The site 's free , searchable database of literary agents has gotten it recognition as one of the best web sites for writers by Writer 's Digest magazine five years in a row .
So , now you have the web - based tools that can help you go from idea to book — the rest is up to you .
Stop procrastinating and start writing .
Good luck !

Studies from an environmental watchdog group find some cellphones emit several times more radiation than others .
HOW CELLPHONES COMPARE HOW CELLPHONES COMPARE
The Federal Communications Commission requires that all cellphones be rated at 1.6 watts per kilogram or lower -- a measure of how much radio frequency energy is absorbed by the body when using the device .
Best and worst cellphones by energy emitted , in watts per kilogram : BEST Samsung Impression SGH - a877 0.35 Motorola Razr V8 0.36 Samsung Impression SGH - t229 0.38 Samsung Rugby SGH - a837 0.46 Samsung Propel Pro SGH -i627 0.47 Samsung Gravity SGH - t459 0.49 T- Mobile Sidekick 0.50 LG Xenon GR500 0.52 Motorola Karma QA1 0.55 Sanyo Katana II 0.55 WORST Motorola Moto VU204 1.55 T - Mobile MyTouch 3G 1.55 Kyocera Jax S1300 1.55 BlackBerry Curve 8330 1.54 Motorola W385 1.54 T - Mobile Shadow 1.53 Motorola C290 1.53 Motorola i335 1.53 Motorola Moto VE240 1.52 BlackBerry Bold 9000 1.51 Source : Environmental Working Group
Some cellphones emit several times more radiation than others , the Environmental Working Group found in one of the most exhaustive studies of its kind .
The government watchdog group on Wednesday releases a list ranking cellphones in terms of radiation .
The free listing of more than 1,000 devices can be viewed here .
NEW PHONE : Palm 's Pixi smartphone flies into youth market Concerns about radiation and cellphones have swirled for years .
Scientific evidence to date has not been able to make a hard link between cancer and cellphones .
But recent studies " are showing increased risk for brain and mouth tumors for people who have used cellphones for at least 10 years , " says Jane Houlihan , senior vice president of research at the Washington - based group .
CTIA , the wireless industry lobbying association , disagrees .
In a statement it noted that " scientific evidence has overwhelmingly indicated that wireless devices do not pose " a health hazard .
That 's why the American Cancer Society , World Health Organization and Food and Drug Administration , among others , " all have concurred that wireless devices are not a public health risk , " the CTIA statement says .
Houlihan acknowledges that " the verdict is still out " on whether cellphones can be linked directly to cancer .
" But there 's enough concern that the governments of six countries " — including France , Germany and Israel — " have issued limits of usage of cellphones , particularly for children . "
Houlihan says her group is " advising people to choose a phone that falls on the lower end of the ( radiation ) spectrum " to minimize potential health problems .
The Samsung Impression has the lowest : 0.35 watts per kilogram , a measure of how much radiation is absorbed into the brain when the phone is held to the ear .
The highest : T - Mobile 's MyTouch 3G , Motorola Moto VU204 and Kyocera Jax S1300 , all at 1.55 W/kg .
The Apple iPhone , sold exclusively by AT&T in the USA , is in the middle of the pack at 1.19 W/kg .
The Federal Communications Commission , which sets standards for cellphone radiation , requires that all devices be rated at 1.6 W/kg or lower .
The Environmental Working Group says the FCC 's standard is outmoded , noting that it was established 17 years ago , when cellphones and wireless usage patterns were much different .
The group wants the government to take a " fresh look " at radiation standards .
The FCC currently does n't require handset makers to divulge radiation levels .
As a result , radiation rankings for dozens of devices , including the BlackBerry Pearl Flip 8230 and Motorola KRZR , are n't on the group 's list .

Advertisement Bend , Oregon was a 21st century American boomtown .
It is a beautiful place , in the high desert of central Oregon , amid mountains .
The sunshine is warm , the air crisp and filled with the scent of bitterbrush and pine .
Its people are gracious , their gorgeous surroundings imbuing them with a certain American languidness .
All these attributes were - in the minds of the city 's ambitious planners and businessmen - what would bring the retirees and tourists flocking to Bend .
To accommodate them , a boom in housing began .
Boom and bust
The population of Bend quadrupled in under 20 years - from 20,000 to 80,000 .
Between 2001 and 2005 , the median value of a home in Bend rose by 80 % .
By 2005 , work was getting underway on 700 new homes each month .
Some of the developments are stunning : houses filled with mountain light clinging to craggy hillsides .
When the building stopped , the lifestyle went very fast .
It 's a lifestyle I do n't see coming back
Dan Hardt
Former building contractor
More than 17 % of the workforce was employed in construction - far higher than the national average .
In what had once been an isolated lumber and mill town , high - end restaurants and brewhouses opened .
Shops selling expensive bric - a - brac bloomed .
Massage therapists and hairdressers proliferated .
Downtown
Bend looks like a shrine to post - millenial bijou : pricey shoes , scented candles , fancy coffee .
There is even a shop specialising in beachwear - despite Bend 's location in the high desert .
But when the US slumped , Bend crashed .
The value of a home fell 40 % in under two years .
And unemployment nearly quadrupled from around 4 % two years ago to 15 % in the summer of 2009 .
" Everything that Bend produced relied on the credit market " , says Carolyn Eagan , an economist with the Oregon Department of Employment .
" Construction materials , doors and fittings , recreational vehicles : everything depended on people being able to consume more than they could use . "
Now the credit has dried up , and the building of Bend has stopped .
The town is dotted with developments that got underway , and then ground to a halt .
They are desolate expanses of weeds , dust and discarded construction materials .
Homeless shelter
In downtown Bend , we met Dan Hardt .
Mr Hardt used to employ 20 people hanging drywall in Bend 's new homes .
He owned three houses of his own , and a boat .
He used to go on elk - hunting trips .
Now it is gone - all of it .
" When the building stopped , the lifestyle went very fast , " he told us .
" It 's a lifestyle I do n't see coming back . "
Dan now lives at the Bethlehem Inn , a motel converted to an emergency homeless shelter .
" Those who were living at the at the top of the heap and who have fallen to the bottom , they do n't know where to go for help , they do n't know how to get that help .
There 's anger and frustration and a sense of entitlement , " says Corky Senecal , who heads emergency housing services for Neighbor Impact , and has 30 years experience of providing services for the poor .
" The middle class is where it 's really been decimated , " she says .
When you lose your job in America , you will receive financial aid from the government .
But it is limited .
Typically , an unemployed worker in Bend will get state benefits for a period of six months to a year .
After that , as many in Bend are discovering , you are on your own .
In addition , the loss of a job frequently means the loss of health insurance and payments into retirement funds .
This limited social safety net means unemployment in America can be devastating .
" It 's not just the job that stops , " says Dan Hardt .
" Everything else stops with it . "
Ms Senecal introduced us to to Randy Worrell and his 11 - year - old daughter , Patty .
Mr Worrell , a burly 42 - year - old former firefighter , was laid off from a variety of jobs .
He has not worked since the end of last year - and his unemployment benefits have run out .
" I do n't know what I will do from one day to the next , " he says .
Lesson learned Neighbor Impact has put him and Patty in temporary accommodation .
He will look for work , he says , for six hours a day .
And he is deeply sceptical of pronouncements emanating from Washington DC that the US economy is showing signs of recovery .
" Lately it 's all , ' the economy is turning around ' .
No , it 's not .
At least it 's not for us , " he says .
" I do n't think we 've even hit rock bottom yet .
I think we have some way to go . "
Bend , Oregon has a great deal going for it , and will , no doubt , experience some sort of recovery .
The population of the city has not noticeably shrunk , which is a good sign .
But no - one expects the housing market ever to revert to its previous , ferocious levels of activity .
And many will tell you they have no desire for it to do so , that Bend has learned a lesson about bubbles .
But in the US , joblessness can alter a life trajectory for ever .
Seven and a half million Americans have lost their job since the start of the recession .
And unemployment 's clawmarks will be visible on the face of Bend , and of the US , for a long while to come .

Time to make it honest ?
IN JANUARY the city council in El Paso , Texas , decided to pass a resolution expressing support for its neighbour on the Mexican side of the border .
In recent years Ciudad Juárez has become one of the bloodiest cities in the world , wracked by turf wars between Mexico 's vicious drug cartels .
Beto O'Rourke , a young city representative , thought the resolution could say a bit more about America 's role in the violence .
He added an amendment : the city of El Paso was calling for an “ honest , open national debate on ending the prohibition of narcotics . ”
The city council approved , on an 8 - 0 vote .
That was unusual , says Mr O'Rourke , because normally they bicker over where to put a speed bump .
But the resolution hit a speed bump of its own .
The mayor vetoed it , saying that El Paso would be a laughing - stock .
Silvestre Reyes , the city 's powerful representative in Congress , warned that if the council tried to override the veto it might be hard for the city to get its fair share of federal funding .
The mayor 's veto was sustained .
But if the goal was to stimulate debate , the effort has not been wasted .
This week the University of Texas at El Paso held a conference on the costs and consequences of America 's drug policy .
Speakers pointed to the carnage in Mexico and the corruption and graft funded by a huge black market .
They mentioned the hundreds of thousands of Americans in jail on minor drug offences , and the millions of children with at least one parent somehow yoked to the criminal - justice system .
They spoke of the cost of enforcement , and the courts gummed up with trivial possession cases .
“ To just deny that and say it 's all working — it 's morally wrong , it 's politically wrong , and some day it 's going to come back to haunt us , ” said Howard Campbell , an anthropologist at the university .
On the first day of the conference there were eight murders across the bridge in Juárez , including one beheading .
Around the country , various noises are suggesting that Americans are tiring of their 40 - year war on drugs .
In particular , people are becoming more critical of marijuana prohibition .
A Zogby poll found in May that a narrow majority of Americans agreed it would be sensible to legalise marijuana so that it can be taxed and regulated .
That is not a surprising result .
The drug is widely available and mostly benign .
Yet it is a highly profitable crop for the cartels , and in 2008 there were more than 750,000 arrests for simple possession .
Continuing the discussion will require political will , which is in short supply .
Advocates of reform were heartened by Barack Obama 's choice for the head of the Office of National Drug Control Policy .
Gil Kerlikowske was formerly the police chief in Seattle , where marijuana is officially low on the list of priorities , and he announced that he would stop talking about a “ war ” on drugs .
But soon after that he announced that “ legalisation ” was neither in his vocabulary nor that of the president .
A handful of national figures have called for a debate on legalisation , including Arnold Schwarzenegger in California and Terry Goddard , the attorney - general of Arizona .
Reform advocates pin their hopes on Jim Webb , a Democratic senator from Virginia , who has called for a commission on prison reform .
But compared to debating the legalisation of drugs , that was a doddle .
After our coverage from yesterday regarding Microsoft training material for Best Buy employees that not only makes Linux look bad , but is also full of inaccuracies , one of our faithful readers wrote in and said he could show us that Redmond was doing the same thing for Apple .
" My account says I work at Best Buy , but the site is available for any retail employee whose company sells Microsoft products , " he told us .
The format is the same : Redmond is n't just saying that Windows has more software or games available than Mac does , but the software giant is actually going as far as teaching employees that there are certain statements about Macs that need to be labeled as myths .
There was an amusing and ironic twist , though .
He was using a Mac , and the Microsoft - created website he was accessing was n't playing so nice with Firefox .
Nevertheless , despite a lot of random whitespace , the message is quite clear : a Windows 7 PC beats a Mac just as badly as a Windows 7 netbook beats a Linux netbook .
Again , we have 11 screenshots to show you , and again you have to wonder how Microsoft can get away with these types of " training materials . "
Just like last time , the introduction does n't look fishy .
Microsoft is simply going to explain the pros of using a Windows 7 PC over a Mac .
This one is an obvious stab at the Mac , Laptop Hunters style .
The $ 300 is an interesting number though .
We ''d love to see how Microsoft came up with the figure .
Just like with the Linux slides , Microsoft is touting Windows Live Essentials .
Yes , MobileMe costs $ 69 for the first year , but iChat is free and iLife '09 ( including iPhoto and iMovie HD ) is included with every Mac .
No doubt about it : there are more configuration options for Windows hardware .
The " thousands of software options " carries a lot less weight these days .
Snow Leopard may not offer as many themes as Windows 7 does , but it can still be customized just fine .
Believe it or not , you can change the screensaver !
We 're not arguing this one : there are definitely more applications available for Windows than for Mac OS X .
True , although the hardware is equivalent — and you can boot Windows 7 on a Mac if you want a Mac OS X plus the gaming experience , some Mac users will argue .
Others will counter that this defeats the purpose of running a Mac , but nevertheless the option is still there .
This slide is also perfectly fine , though it 's worth noting that it's the first time Microsoft is comparing the Windows 7 taskbar to the OS X dock .
Sure , unless they are already Mac users .
This one gets a passing mark , although you can run all 25 games on a Mac too — with Windows .
" Many Mac software titles are not ... as available as the Windows versions ? "
That 's an odd one .
This Microsoft training material for Best Buy retail staff is deliberately attacking Apple .
Just like last time , there are correct assertions in the slides , but the majority of the statements are inaccurate or are only accurate in the specific way they are worded ( though compared to the Linux slides , Apple got off easy ) .
At publishing time , Microsoft did not yet respond to an inquiry about commenting on either the Linux story or this one .
Neighbor Lady : How 's it going ?
Me : Oh , OK .
I work nights so I 'm just getting myself up now .
NL : Well it 's nice that your son lets you sleep in .
M : Yeah , he 's a good boy , I am lucky .
NL : I wanted to ask you about him , we 're going to this thing tomorrow and I wanted to know if he could come ?
M : Oh yeah , what kind of thing ?
What time ?
He 's going to hang out with his grandmother sometime tomorrow so it might not work out .
NL : It 's in the morning .
NL : It 's a church thing , but the kids do n't really do a lot of the church stuff they just play .
I thought he might like it .
M : Well what kind of church thing is it ?
NL : Well , it 's church .
We go to a really nice church down the street and I have heard you and your boyfriend talking about being atheists , but I figure your son might still want to see what it 's all about .
M : My 6 year old son ?
NL : Well , yeah .
M : You 're asking to take my 6 year old kid to a church , knowing that I 'm an atheist ?
NL : Well , I know you rejected god , but that does n't mean your boy has to grow up without knowing all his options , right ?
I 'm not trying to offend you ...
M : You have the little blond girl , right ?
The nice girl my son plays with ?
NL : Yeah , she 's my daughter and she LOVES the church we go to .
M : I want you to consider something and I 'm not trying to be mean , I 'm trying to prove a point .
Were I to come up to you and ask you if I could take your daughter with me and my son to an activity where all of the people there besides your daughter would be atheists ' just to give her another perspective ' , would you be comfortable with that ?
NL : ( immediately blurts out )
Well of course not !
M : Well then you completely understand why I would rather not have my son go to church with you tomorrow .
And for the record , I would never suggest that myself - not for my son or your daughter .
Our kids are 6 - I feel like they need to figure out for themselves what they believe and right now , they 're still taking in all the possible explanations .
NL : Well , if you want your son to make up his own mind , why would you be opposed to him coming to church with us and checking it out ?
M : For one , I think he 's too young .
More important than that , he's not the one who asked me if he could go to church , you are .
He 's not yet interested in your faith and I 'm not going to push the exposure on him .
When he 's ready , he 'll look into it and if you guys are still living next to us , I 'll let him know then that you 'll be happy to take him to church with you .
I was standing outside this morning and my son was playing with his transformer toys in the yard .
As I stood there , dazed still from having just woken up , one of my neighbors walked up to me , all smiles and shiny cheeks .
I said good morning in my polite but reserved way and she said good morning back but it was obvious she had meandered over to me with a purpose and I waited patently for that purpose to be revealed .
The conversation we had was a bit shocking , but also a bit satisfying .
This is when I began to get uncomfortable .
Tomorrow is Sunday .
Sunday morning .
She wants to take my son to a ' thing ' on Sunday morning .
I must have paused for a little too long or was wearing my concern plainly on my face because my neighbor continued - It was at this point that I took a long pause .
I told the neighbor , a very nice lady who I honestly feel was n't trying to be insulting and who has genuine concerns regarding god , judgment , and hell , that I needed a minute to think about things .
She seemed to misinterpret my pause as if I were considering for even a moment allowing my son to go with her but that was fine as she patiently waited while I considered my response .
This was the end of the conversation .
I do n't know if the interaction offended the woman or not , but it should n't have .
I remember being a kid and being present during similar conversations between my parents and friends and neighbors of theirs .
When I was in 5th grade my parents decided I was old enough to go to church with people if I wanted to and I remember going to a Carman concert with some neighbors of mine and feeling like I had stepped into the twilight zone .
The religious practice of ' get 'em while they 're young ' seems unsavory to me because it takes the minds of people just as willing to accept the existence of Santa Clause or Optimus Prime on faith as anything else , and produces for them a creator god who they are to take on faith is real as well .
Then , they take away Santa and Optimus as fanciful , childish things , yet they maintain that god is the real deal ?
How can you willingly do that to a kid and not consider than you might be messing them up ?
James
May plans to live in the Lego house for a weekend Top Gear presenter James May is looking for volunteers to help him build a new house in Surrey - made entirely out of Lego bricks .
As part of his BBC series James May 's Toy Stories , he plans to build a two - storey house in the middle of the Denbies Wine Estate , in Dorking .
More than three million Lego bricks have been delivered to the site .
May will host a building day next Saturday , when members of the public can help him with the project .
The house will be life - size with a staircase , toilet and shower , and May said once it was completed he intended to live in it for a few days .
Appeal for bricks
He said although the house would be temporary , there had still been various " planning hoops " to leap through .
Two months ago James May built a garden out of plasticine " I 've got a man working on a flushing Lego lavatory .
We think it 's possible .
" Things like power supply , sanitation and plumbing coming into the house are as they could be for a real building ... everything within my Lego house must as far as possible be Lego , " he said .
May said although he already had thousands of Lego bricks , he could not be sure there would be enough .
" So if people do have bricks that are n't being used that they would be happy to donate to a very worthy pioneering Lego cause , then we 'll be happy to take them off your hands . "
The event follows two other successful toy challenges which saw May build what was said to be the world 's first Plasticine garden , which won the People 's Choice Award at the Chelsea Flower Show , and also the world 's largest model plane .
Anyone interested in taking part in the Lego house build , or who has Lego bricks to donate , should e-mail lego@plumpictures.co.uk .

Scientists have identified a new source of chemical pollution released by the huge amounts of plastic rubbish found floating in the oceans of the world .
A study has found that as plastics break down in the sea they release potentially toxic substances not found in nature and which could affect the growth and development of marine organisms .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Until now it was thought that plastic rubbish is relatively stable chemically and , apart from being unsightly , its principle threat to living creatures came from its ability to choke or strangle any animals that either got caught in it or ingested it thinking it was food .
But the latest research suggests that plastic is also a source of dissolved substances that can easily become widely dispersed in the marine environment .
Many of these chemicals are believed to toxic to humans and animals , the scientists said .
The scale of plastic pollution in the sea has only been widely recognised in recent years when sailing yachts reported vast areas of ocean , such as an area estimated to be twice the size of Texas in the North Pacific , that seem to be permanently covered in a layer of floating marine litter caught up in swirling ocean currents or gyres .
Some of the items were found to be many decades old , suggesting that the plastic took a long time to degrade .
However , a study by Katsuhiko Saido at Nihon University in Chiba , Japan , has found that plastics degrade relatively quickly in the conditions and temperatures that were designed to simulate the environment of the open ocean .
“ Plastics in daily use are generally assumed to be quite stable .
We found that plastic in the ocean actually decomposes as it is exposed to the rain and sun and other environmental conditions , giving rise to yet another source of global contamination that will continue into the future , ” Dr Saido said .
“ To date , no studies have been conducted on plastic decomposition at low temperature in the environment owing to the mistaken conception that plastic does not decompose .
The present study was conducted to clarify that drift plastic does indeed decompose to give rise to hazardous chemicals in the ocean , ” he said .
The scientists found that when plastics decompose in the ocean they release a range of chemicals , such as bisphenol A and substances known as polystyrene - based ( PS ) oligomers , which are not found naturally .
Bisphenol A has been implicated in disrupting the hormonal system of animals .
A common form of plastic rubbish is styrofoam , which soon gets crushed into small pieces in the sea .
However , it also releases substantial quantities of a toxic substances called styrene monomer , which is known to cause cancer , as well as styrene dimers and trimer , which are suspected of being carcinogenic .
The trimer also breaks down into the toxic monomer form .
Findings from the study were released yesterday at the American Chemical Society meeting in Washington .
Dr Saido said that samples of seawater collected from the Pacific Ocean were found to be contaminated with up to 150 parts per million of some of these components of plastic decomposition .

“ This study clearly shows new micro-pollution by compounds generated by plastic decomposition to be taking place out of sight in the ocean .
Thus , marine debris plastics in the ocean will certainly give rise to new sources of global contamination that will persist long into the future , ” he said .
It is estimated that there could be hundreds of millions of tons of plastic rubbish floating in the world ’s oceans .
In Japan alone , it is calculated that 150,000 tons of plastic is washed up on its shores each year .

Scheme Steering Committee Position Statement
Draft - 20 August 2009
Programming languages are like sharks .
When they stop moving forward , they die .
Scheme has never stopped moving — not completely .
It 's been more of a moving target than a fixed language .
Scheme is a " dynamic language " in more ways than one .
The purpose of this article is to explain the position of the Scheme Language Steering Committee :
how we see the state of the Scheme programming language today ;
where we believe Scheme is going , and should go ;
what we believe our role to be , in serving the Scheme community .
A programming language stays healthy and vibrant by virtue of being used .
When it comes to using Scheme , however , the Scheme community has rarely missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity .
The diversity of Scheme 's constituencies has been a problem , but has also been one of Scheme 's greatest strengths :
educators
language designers
programmers
implementors
hobbyists ( who write Scheme implementations just for fun )
The danger
While the Scheme community has many constituencies , we believe that one primary purpose of a programming language is to program .
A programming language is a notation that 's supposed to help programmers to construct better programs in better ways :
quickly
easily
robustly
scalably
correctly
A language that does n't enable programmers to program is , in the end , doomed to irrelevance .
Alas : Scheme has the unhappy distinction of being the world 's most unportable programming language .
It is almost misleading to call Scheme a " programming language ; " it would be more accurate to characterise Scheme as a family of dialects , all loosely related by the common features of lexical scope , dynamic typing , list structure , higher - order functions , proper tail - recursion , garbage collection , macros , and ( some form of ) s-expression based lexical syntax .
Note that this list of features does not include exceptions , modules , concurrency , unicode text , or mechanisms for defining union types , record types , or abstract data types – yet these too are often important .
As things stand now , a programmer who wishes to write a significant program in " Scheme " must immediately commit to some specific implementation of Scheme : Bigloo , say ( and its module language , exception system , s- expression grammar , etc. ) , or perhaps PLT Scheme ( and its module language , etc. , etc. ) , or perhaps one of the other competently engineered Scheme implementations .
But this , in turn , means that applications cannot be executed across multiple implementations .
More importantly , libraries or modules of code , such as URL parsers , network - protocol stacks , regular - expression implementations , and so forth , wind up stranded within the realm of a specific implementation – which , in turn , means that Scheme programmers are constantly building " from scratch , " rather than being able to benefit from the fruits of each others labors .
This has led to a great deal of unnecessary fragmentation and duplication of effort : instead of standing on the shoulders of previous programmers , Schemers step on each others ' toes .
To name names , compare this state of affairs to languages such as Perl , Python , C , or Ruby .
To Scheme programmers , these languages are technically inferior – nonetheless , literally billions of dollars of software and IT services have been and are being constructed with these tools .
Real - world success matters : it is the means by which vibrant user communities grow ; it is the social context that generates the resources that keep languages alive and thriving : money , people , " how to " books , implementations , software libraries , and so on and so on .
The IEEE , R5RS , and R6RS Standards
We have a history of progress on which to build .
IEEE Standard 1178 was approved by about 95 % of 59 voters .
The R5RS extended the IEEE standard in several ways :
high - level hygienic macros
multiple return values
load
eval
The R6RS was approved by about 66 % of 102 voters .
It introduced a more static language organized around libraries , along with too many other new features to list here .
Two languages
We believe the diversity of constituencies justifies the design of two separate but compatible languages , which we will ( for now ) call " small " and " large " Scheme .
Small Scheme
Constituencies : educators , casual implementors , researchers , embedded languages , " 50 - page " purists
Think " IEEE / R5RS brought up to the current date . "
~ 90 % supermajority to be required for final ratification
Large Scheme
Constituencies : programmers , implementors
Think " R6RS with a happier outcome . "
~ 75 % supermajority to be required for final ratification
The goals of the steering committee :
we do n't standardise or otherwise define the language ;
rather , we oversee the process of its definition .
… and , when necessary , we may steer the effort a bit .
That is , we enable the Scheme community to prosecute the development of the language – its definition , growth , extension , standardisation and implementation .
Our chief mechanism is by granting charters to various committees that will carry out the actual tasks , and stamping the results of these efforts with our imprimatur .
An irony is that research by the Scheme community has led to the development of two key technologies that should enable great portability : hygienic macros and module systems that include macro definitions in their managed namespaces .
We aim to realize that promise .

Motorists in Samoa have switched the side of the road they drive on , overnight .
It 's a move that Britain has considered - but how would it work ?
It 's the kind of interview question that has reduced confident job seekers to quivering wrecks .
Imagine you are the minister in charge of the UK 's roads and you have to switch the country to driving on the right - hand side .
How would you do it ?
A study of Samoa , in the South Pacific , this week might offer some clues .
The country is experiencing its first day of driving on the left on Monday , the start of a special two - day bank holiday to ease Samoans into the new regime .
WHY THE RIGHT / LEFT SPLIT ?
In the pre-industrial era , horses kept to the left so riders could draw their sword Napoleon changed Europe to the right The US followed France But British influenced India , Pakistan , Australia and the Republic of Ireland
See which countries drive where What if the UK were to follow ?
Driving on the right would make trips to the European mainland easier , when taking or hiring a car .
And cars with steering wheels on the left could be cheaper .
The idea is not as fanciful as it sounds .
Although the Department for Transport says it has no plans to change , it did examine such a plan in the late 1960s , two years after Sweden successfully switched to driving on the right .
Its report rejected the idea on grounds of safety and costs .
But that was before Britain 's entry into the European Union and the opening of the Channel Tunnel , which for the first time established a land link between Britain and the Continent .
So , if the UK was to think again about a switch , what would be the key issues ?
SIGNS & JUNCTIONS
Road markings and roadside signs would have to be switched to the other side of the road , but ready in advance of the day of change , in a huge logistical exercise .
One - way streets would have to be reconfigured and traffic lights with filters changed , says Paul Watters of the AA .
To get an idea of the cost , changing signs from miles to kilometres alone was estimated at £ 750 m , he adds .
Japan is also left - hand side
The biggest engineering issue would be highway building , says Benjamin Heydecker of the Centre for Transport Studies at University College London .
About one in 10 motorway junctions is asymmetric or incomplete , so would need to be dug up and rebuilt .
" Motorway signs would have to be turned round and repositioned , so approaches to junctions would not be in the same place . "
Accident blackspots would all need looking at too , because the signs there are site - specific and so would need to change .
ADJUSTING SLIP ROADS " Entrance and exits to motorways are not symmetrical either , so there would be consequences there too , " says Mr Heydecker .
Slip roads that were deceleration lanes would suddenly be used for accelerating , so their lengths would need to be extended ; and vice versa .
EDUCATING DRIVERS
Although many motorists would be used to driving on the right - thanks to trips abroad - a comprehensive retraining programme would be needed , according to Mr Heydecker .
Particular emphasis would be put on negotiating roundabouts ( which would run anti-clockwise ) and left - hand turns , which would require cutting across oncoming traffic .
After years of driving , habits are well entrenched and it might take more than a few lessons to get used to the new arrangements .
But where could " learners " practise , before the switch ?
CAR STEERING WHEELS & BUS DOORS
Making life even harder for motorists is the fixed right - hand driver 's position of cars sold in the UK - suddenly drivers would find themselves further away from the centre of the road .
Over time British drivers would buy cars with left - hand steering , so they would be changing gears with their right hands .
The global manufacturing of cars would be simplified if all countries were to opt for left - hand steering , says Mr Heydecker .
" If cars were all manufactured the same way , it would reduce the cost of design and improve the quality of vehicles . "
Public service vehicles like buses would also have to undergo a massive overhaul so that their doors were on the right - hand - side of the vehicle .
LEARN FROM SWEDEN
Preparations were made long in advance , says Niklas Stavegard of Motormannen , which is the Swedish Automobile Association .
WHY DID SWEDEN DO IT ?
Sweden 's neighbours drive on right
It already had left - hand steering In 1955 , 83 % voted against change
But the parliament voted in favour in 1963
Samoa braced for change " All road signs were doubled , new signs on the right - hand side , which were covered until the day of the change .
On the particular day , the left - hand side signs were covered and right hand side signs were used . "
The change was made at 0500 on Sunday 3 September 1967 .
All private traffic was banned between 0100 and 0600 and there was a total stop on all traffic at 0450 , with a countdown on the radio to 0500 .
The speed limit in urban areas was lowered from 50 km / h to 40 km / h for a period of time after the change .
A majority of all cars already had the steering wheel on the left side , so no change was made to cars .
COST
In 1969 , the financial burden of making the switch was calculated by the government to be £ 264 m - about £ 3.4bn today .
But that would now be seen as a ridiculously conservative estimate .
" Since that time , the road network and the level of sophistication of the network and its controlling infrastructure has grown enormously , " says a spokeswoman for the Department for Transport .
Additional costs would include all buses being changed , alteration to motorway entrances and exits , and traffic control systems .
" Casualties would also be likely to rise , and the current cost of a fatality is £ 608,580 , " she says .
" This could be particularly true for elderly road users who are less able to adapt to changed conditions . "
THE VERDICT
The Republic of Ireland , which has already changed its road signs from miles to kilometres , briefly considered this move to greater European integration last year , when a pro-Brussels political party suggested it .
But it was swiftly rejected .
" When the question came up , it was followed by the question ' Is it needed ? ' and the answer to that was ' No ' , says Sean O'Neill of the Irish National Roads Authority .
Look left , no right , no wait !
" If it was needed or if the UK did it , and left us as one of the last European countries driving on the left - hand side , then we would think differently . "
For a significantly bigger country , like the UK , with a relatively more developed road network , the challenge would be even greater .
The immediate fear would be of road chaos and mass casualties , says Philip Gomm of the RAC Foundation .
" Given that any change would have to be instantaneous , and the nation 's roads are never quiet , only less busy - indeed Britain has some of the most congested roads in Europe - how do you seamlessly get everyone onto the other side of the carriageway ?
" The whole concept is mindboggling .
It would be a logistical nightmare involving huge public education , vast sums of money and a massive amount of staff - and all so we can be like the French .
" So probably the best advice to anyone even contemplating such a scheme is ; do n't bother .
If it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . "

You have to drive on the right when using the the short stretch of ( public ) road leading from the Strand up to the front of the Savoy hotel in central London .
I was once told it was the only such road in Britain , and was something to do with taxi turning circles .
Chris H , London
The concern would be how it is funded .
The driver is already heavily taxed and no doubt the taxes would be increased to fund this , even if the decision is not their own .
However , car manufacturers continually state the cost of UK cars is because of making right - hand drive versions ( even those , strangely , designed and made here ) so we may be able to get cheaper cars here , or if not the penalty for buying abroad and bringing back here will no longer be that the steering wheel is on the wrong side .
Neil Hamshaw , Norwich Rather than thrown £ billions at changing sides , please can we throw £ billions at vastly improving public transport , so that the roads are less congested ?
Then , in years to come , perhaps it wo n't be such a big deal .
Jerry Cullum , Alton , UK
To get the UK to drive on the right would be expensive , disruptive , unpopular and dangerous .
So , it 's quite surprising that the government has n't tried to enforce this already .
ID cards anyone ?
Chris , Cambridge Several road sections that come to mind that would be difficult to re-engineer are Spaghetti Junction , parts of the M2 which have extremely small acceleration / deceleration zones for slip roads and of course all of the variable speed limits on the M42 , M6 and M25 .
Those would definitely not be cheap to sort out .
The rest of it should n't be too hard I 'd have thought .
Alex , Birmingham , UK As usual , moving to the right seems to have high costs and few benefits .
But for much less investment we could sort out our ridiculously muddled measurements .
We buy petrol in litres but quote MPG to advertise cars !
We buy UHT milk in litres , but fresh in pints !
Completing the botched metrication programme would deliver real , affordable benefits .

As in so many things , Britain remains a floating heritage museum of the absurd , forever trapped in a pre-industrial era of quaint practices and bizarre traditions .
Will we ever drag ourselves into the 21st century ?
Steve , Suffolk , UK
When we drive from the UK to Europe the changeover occurs when we leave the ferry / train terminal .
Would it be reasonable to suggest that we move the changeover point further and further inland starting at ports where you can drive into , to get to Europe or away from out of Europe .
The transition then could be staged over a period of , say , three years .
Paul Gibbons , Milton Keynes
My brother lives near Germany and had noticed that there seems to incidents almost every month of Germans driving down the wrong side of the Autobahns .
He now reckons that it 's more natural to drive on the left .
The rest of Europe should join the majority ( of population ) who drive on the left .
Peter S , Sandy GB
What would be gained from a switch ?
The traffic congestion would be just as bad , just on the other side of the street .
Although it would be enormously amusing if Ireland made the switch and we did n't .
The cross-over at the roads bordering Ulster would be the most chaotic places in the world .
I 'd be quite happy with metric distances and speed limits .
Let 's make the speed limit on motorways 80 mph so we'd be ready for the ( almost ) European wide 130 kmh limits .
Dougie Lawson , Basingstoke , UK Having driven overseas on the ' other ' side of the road , I will only do so in a left hand drive car - sightlines are wrong if you try to drive on the right in a right hand drive car .
Megan , Cheshire UK Great idea which is well overdue .
With increased international travel over the last few years many people will be quite experienced at driving on the right - Europe and USA being the 2 main overseas holiday destinations .
I have driven on the right overseas for almost 30 years and have no problems whatsoever with adjusting the mindset to being on the " wrong " side of the road .
In the long term the roads would become safer for both people in the UK ( overseas lorries are a current problem ) and for other countries ( UK citizens more used to driving on the right ) .
This is a task which is crying out for the EU to get to grips with - perhaps they could assist with both financing road changes and with subsidising people switching to left hand drive vehicles .
Simon in Leigh , Leigh on Sea , Essex , England Everyone drove / rode on the left until the left - handed Napoleon Bonaparte changed it throughout his domain .
Therefore , historically speaking , it is the rest of the world that has got it wrong !
Changing now would be a huge waste of public money , be almost impossible to implement and cause many extra fatalities , for little gain in practical terms .
Now Samoa has changed to the left , there are 75 countries who drive on the same side as us , so we are hardly on our own .
Common sense dictates we should leave well alone !
Simon , Shropshire , UK
All sounds a bit pointless and expensive ... but if we were given two extra bank holidays to get used to it like the Samoans ( possibly continued every year to mark the momentous change ) then it would certainly get my vote .
Pamela , London , UK Driving on the left hand side is an anomaly that has become more significant now Britain is no longer an island , but the expense and expected high accident rate that can be expected if there is to be a change , would surely mitigate against it .
For Ireland , and Malta who also drive on the left , there is no real incentive to change , as they are still islands with no direct connection to the rest of Europe .
However , considering that all public service vehicles and many road layouts would need reconstruction , and the number of drivers who would need retraining , it is almost uncontemplatable .
It really cannot be compared with the almost painless way it was done in Sweden , as the UK has a far greater road mileage and a considerably higher number of vehicles than Sweden in the 1960's .

New research from the US suggests that wearing shoes such as high heels , pumps and sandals was strongly linked in women ’s later life with heel and ankle pain .
The researchers found nearly 64 per cent of older women who reported hind - foot pain regularly wore such shoes at some point in their lives whereas no link was found between foot pain and the types of shoes men wore .
The study was the work of lead author Alyssa B. Dufour from the Institute for Aging Research of Hebrew SeniorLife in Boston , Massachusetts , and colleagues , and is published in the October issue of the journal Arthritis Care & Research .
Dufour , a graduate student in the Institute ’s Musculoskeletal Research Program , told the press that :
“ We found an increased risk of hind - foot pain among women who wore shoes , such as high - heels or pumps , that lack support and sound structure . ”
The study is the first to look in detail at types of footwear use and foot pain .
Other studies have looked at high heels but not at different types of shoes at the same time .
Foot pain is a common complaint among adult Americans , and foot and toe symptoms count among the top 20 reasons that older people aged from 65 to 74 visit their doctor in the US .
However , we know very little about the causes of foot pain among older adults , although we know women are more likely to report it than men , we do n’t know if this is because of lifestyle choices like shoe wear , or a higher prevalence of underlying disease or deformity .
For the study , Dufour and colleagues analyzed data from more than 3,300 men and women in the the Framingham Study .
The participants were given a selection of 11 different styles of shoe and asked to pick the one that most closely resembled the type they currently wore regularly and had regularly worn during five different age periods in the past .
The participants were also asked if they felt pain , aching or stiffness in either foot on most days .
The shoe styles were classed as “ poor ” ( eg high heels , pumps , sandals and slippers ) , “ average ” ( hard or rubber soled shoes and work boots ) and “ good ” ( athletic and casual sneakers ) .
The results showed :
More than 60 per cent of women reported wearing “ poor ” shoes in the past .
Only 2 per cent of men reported wearing “ poor ” shoes in the past .
13 per cent of women reported wearing “ poor ” shoes currently .
Nearly 30 per cent of women and 20 per cent of men reported experiencing generalized foot pain ( this is line with previous studies ) .
There was a significant link between between women reporting hind - foot pain and previous wearing of styles that included high heels and pumps .
After adjusting for age and weight , compared with women who reported wearing “ average ” shoes , those who reported wearing “ good ” shoes in the past were 67 per cent less likely to report hind - foot pain .
In men there was no link between foot pain , at any location , and shoewear .
However , the lack of a significant link for men could be due to the fact less than 2 per cent of them reported wearing bad shoes ( such a low percentage makes it difficult for the statistics to detect a relationship ) .
Dufour and colleagues concluded that :
“ Even after taking age and weight into account , past shoewear use in women remained associated with hindfoot pain . ”
“ Future studies should address specific support and structural features of shoewear , ” they added .
Dufour said :
“ Young women should make careful choices regarding their shoe types in order to potentially avoid hind - foot pain later in life . ”
Each time our heel hits the ground when we walk , a significant biomechanical shock enters the foot , and is absorbed mostly in the heel and ankle .
“ Good ” shoes like sneakers , trainers , and other athletic footwear often have soles and other design features that absorb this shock and protect the foot .
Poor fitting shoes cause many problems , not just pain , some of which can be disabling .
More than 43 million Americans have foot problems , many of them serious enough to need medical attention .
Follow this guide to make sure you choose shoes that fit you properly , said Dufour :
Choose comfort over style .
Judge size by how they fit your feet rather than the number on the box as sizes vary by brand .
You feet get bigger as you age , so measure them regularly .
Fit shoes to your longest foot ( most of us have one foot bigger than the other ) .
Avoid high heels and shoes that taper or end in a point at the toes .
Try on shoes at the end of the day when your feet are at their largest .
Put both shoes on and walk around to make sure they are comfortable .
Make sure you can wiggle your toes inside the shoes when you try them on .
Bear in mind this simple rule : your shoes should conform to the shape of your feet , and not the other way around .
“ Foot pain : Is current or past shoewear a factor ? ”

" Your gran 's going to be fine , " I repeat as we get to the airport .
But I 'm soon having second thoughts .
Our flight is delayed by an hour - and - a - half and the terminal is hot , crowded and airless .
By the time we are boarding Mrs Walsh has started to turn pale .
Just before take - off she begins to look clammy .
It 's the last chance to take her off the flight to get her back to hospital .
About 150 passengers will be very angry if I get the plane sent back to the gate now .
But if my patient is in trouble it has to be done .
Jesse Brown , a BoingBoing guest blogger , is the host of TVO 's Search Engine podcast .
Michael Massing of the Columbia Journalism Review digs up some startling info that helps explain why network TV news is knee - deep in FAIL while National Public Radio thrives :
Katie Couric 's annual salary is more than the entire annual budgets of NPR's Morning Edition and All Things Considered combined .
Couric 's salary comes to an estimated $ 15 million a year ; NPR spends $ 6 million a year on its morning show and $ 5 million on its afternoon one .
NPR has seventeen foreign bureaus ( which costs it another $ 9.4 million a year ) ; CBS has twelve .
Few figures , I think , better capture the absurd financial structure of the network news .
( link )
It also captures a hard reality that news folk should keep in mind as they protest the collapse of their industry : most money in journalism , is n't spent on journalism .

NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Epic swindler Bernard Madoff ’s two sons , his brother and a niece will be sued this week for $ 198 million , the trustee winding down the Madoff firm told CBS News ’ “ 60 Minutes ” broadcast on Sunday .
Bernard Madoff walks back to his apartment in New York in this December 17 , 2008 file photo .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton / Files
Sons Mark and Andrew , brother Peter and niece Shana all held executive positions with the firm and should have known about the multibillion - dollar , worldwide 20 - year - long Ponzi scheme , trustee Irving Picard and his chief counsel David Sheehan , told the program .
Wall Street ’s biggest investment fraud , a Ponzi scheme in which early investors are paid with the money of new clients , collapsed in the declining economy last December .
Madoff confessed to the fraud of as much as $ 64.8 billion and is serving a 150 - year prison sentence .
Asked by “ 60 Minutes ” whether investigators were working under the assumption that there was money still hidden , Sheehan said : “ Yes , we are ” and Picard said , “ We ’d assume it ’s millions and millions of dollars . ”
Sheehan told “ 60 Minutes ” he estimated about $ 36 billion went into the whole scheme .
“ About $ 18 ( billion ) of it went out before the collapse .
And $ 18 ( billion ) of it is just missing .
And that $ 18 billion is what we ’re trying to get back . ”
New York lawyers Picard and Sheehan said the latest lawsuit to recover money for defrauded investors under the Securities Investor Protection
Act would accuse the family members of negligence and breach of fiduciary duty .
The lawsuits to be filed in U.S. bankruptcy court in New York would also accuse them of profiting personally in the tens of millions of dollars while working at the firm .
All of the family members have said in previous statements that they had no knowledge of Madoff ’s crimes .
The sons withdrew $ 35 million from accounts with little or no investment , Picard told “ 60 Minutes ” .
“ Whether or not they have a criminal problem we will pursue them as far as we can pursue them , ” Picard said .
“ And if that leads to bankrupting them --- then that ’s what will happen . ”
The trustee and his lawyers have filed 13 suits already in an effort to recover about $ 15 billion , including one against Madoff ’s wife Ruth and several claims against so - called Madoff feeder funds .
Only $ 1.5 billion has been recovered so far and the estimates for the actual money that was lost in the fraud have varied from $ 13 billion to $ 64.8 billion .
The case is Securities Investor Protection Corp v Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities 08-01789 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York ( Manhattan )
The Socialist Party ( Pasok ) Headquarters in Athens were evacuated when they came under sustained attack by anarchists early on Friday evening .
The attack is believed to mark the first reaction to the arrest of the 4 youngsters accused of urban guerrilla activities .
On the evening of Friday 25 of September and as the four youngsters arrested earlier this week now stand accused under the notorious anti-terrorist law which renders any petty crime punishable by 10 years imprisonment , the new and shiny Headquarters of PaSoK , the Socialist Party of Greece , which is preparing itself to head the country 's government next week , came under attack by anarchists , who leaving the radical enclave of Exarcheia managed to break through the permanent riot police lines surrounding the area and with recourse to extended use of molotov cocktails wage their attack against one of the most guarded buildings in the country .
During the attack a TV van was consumed in flames with the fire spreading rapidly and putting the very building at .
Authorities moved to evacuate PaSoK 's headquarters from its emergency exits to back streets while battles still ranged on the central street of Hippocratus .
No arrests were made and the attackers disappeared behind flaming barricades .
The attack is believed to be the first act of reaction or solidarity to the arrest of the 4 young persons who were arrested after anti-terrorist police stormed two apartments in relation to the bombing of PaSoK 's Economic shadow - minister apartment .
All 4 refuse to cooperate with the police not even giving their fingerprints .
Police authorities claim they are in the course of issuing a warrant for the arrest of 6 more people , with the progressive press already ringing the alarm of an anti-anarchist pogrom on the eve of the October 4th elections .
The 4 will be presenting their case to the 32nd State Inquisitor on Tuesday morning .
Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder .
It can trigger intense fear in situations where escape may be difficult or help hard to access .
The name comes from the ancient Greek word “ agora , ” which refers to a place of assembly or a marketplace .
People often misunderstand agoraphobia as a fear of open spaces , but it is more complex than that .
Situations that may trigger fear in people with agoraphobia include : crowded or enclosed spaces
open and remote spaces
being far from home Some people with agoraphobia also have panic attacks or panic disorder .
When the symptoms are severe , they can keep a person from leaving their home .
Agoraphobia can develop at any age , but the symptoms usually appear at around 25 – 35 years of age , and they affect females more often than males .
Here , learn more about agoraphobia , including how it can affect a person ’s life and the types of help available .
What is agoraphobia ?
Share on Pinterest The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , Fifth Edition ( DSM - 5 ) classes agoraphobia as an anxiety disorder .
A person with this type of disorder has persistent feelings of anxiety that affect their ability to function in daily life .
Agoraphobia is an anxiety disorder that involves a fear of being in places from which it is hard to escape or receive help .
Feelings of embarrassment , helplessness , or being trapped can trigger agoraphobia .
A person may have one or more of these feelings in crowded or remote areas or on bridges or public transport , for example .
Agoraphobia can develop after a person has had a panic attack .
A fear of further attacks , for example , may cause the person to avoid the kinds of situation in which the first attack took place .
Though agoraphobia may follow panic disorder , the DSM - 5 considers them separate diagnoses .
People with agoraphobia may need help from a companion to visit public places .
They may feel unable to leave home on their own or at all .
Treatment Doctors usually treat agoraphobia with a combination of medication and cognitive behavioral therapy ( CBT ) , a type of psychotherapy .
Medication
One or both of the following types of prescription medication may help : Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors : Known as SSRIs , these antidepressants may help with agoraphobia , but they can take 2 – 4 weeks to start working .
Known as SSRIs , these antidepressants may help with agoraphobia , but they can take 2 – 4 weeks to start working .
Benzodiazepines :
These are sedative medications that can relieve the symptoms of anxiety in the short term , though they can become habit - forming .
It is important to note that antidepressants sometimes have unwanted effects at the beginning , which may make symptoms of the disorder seem worse .
People should follow their doctor ’s instructions and ask for advice if they have concerns about side effects .
Psychotherapy
In a psychotherapy appointment , a person works with a therapist to address the causes and symptoms of their anxiety .
In the process , the person can find new ways of facing their fears .
CBT focuses on changing the way that a person thinks about and reacts to certain circumstances .
The person may learn : new ways of facing the situations that trigger their symptoms
new ways of managing stress and symptoms of agoraphobia
techniques for managing fear , such as deep breathing exercises
To help a person overcome their fear , a therapist may start by walking a short way from home with them and gradually increase the distance over time .
This can provide a safe way to confront unwanted feelings .
Initial treatment may take place online or by telephone , making it unnecessary for the person to leave their home .
Friends and loved ones can also help by learning about agoraphobia , showing understanding , and encouraging the person to take new steps as they feel ready .
Self - care tips for managing symptoms
Some helpful strategies for people with agoraphobia include : seeking help and following the resulting treatment plan
practicing relaxation techniques
getting regular exercise
having a healthful diet
avoiding drinks that contain alcohol or caffeine , including sodas
avoiding recreational drugs
Symptoms Agoraphobia can involve a combination of fears , other feelings , and physical symptoms .
These can all vary from mild to severe .
Some people can manage agoraphobia symptoms by following a routine .
For others , it can be severely debilitating .
According to the DSM - 5 , a person with agoraphobia commonly fears : using public transportation
being in open spaces
being in enclosed spaces
standing in line
being in a crowd
being outside of the home alone
The most characteristic fear involves a situation in which dangers arises and help is unavailable or escape is impossible .
The fear can escalate until the person has a panic attack .
Physical symptoms
When agoraphobia occurs with panic attacks , the physical symptoms can include : a racing heart or rapid heartbeat
shortness of breath or hyperventilating
sweating
feeling sick
chest pain or discomfort
dizziness
faintness
vomiting and other gastrointestinal symptoms
flushing and chills
choking
trembling
a sense of disorientation Also , a 2015 study found that levels of low - grade inflammation appeared to increase over time in people with agoraphobia .
This suggests that people with the condition may have a higher risk of atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease .
Changes in behavior A person with agoraphobia avoids certain triggering situations , and they may also : change their behavior at home , school , or work
stop seeing friends
do all their shopping online
start misusing alcohol and drugs A person may also become dependent on others or avoid leaving home for a long time .
Causes
The specific reasons why agoraphobia develops remain unclear , but changes in the areas of the brain that control the fear response may play a role .
The DSM - 5 lists three types of risk factors : Environmental factors : Agoraphobia may develop after experiencing a crime , abuse , or a traumatic event .
Agoraphobia may develop after experiencing a crime , abuse , or a traumatic event .
Genetic factors :
There are signs that people can inherit it .
There are signs that people can inherit it .
Temperamental factors :
Some people appear to be more prone to anxiety - related disorders .
Regarding the apparent link between panic disorder and agoraphobia , the DSM - 5 reports that 30 – 50 % of people with agoraphobia had a panic disorder diagnosis or panic attacks before the agoraphobia symptoms arose .
Diagnosis
To diagnose agoraphobia , a healthcare professional will interview the person and ask about their symptoms .
They may also ask how the person feels about leaving the house and being in certain situations .
Using criteria from the DSM - 5 , doctors can diagnose agoraphobia if a person experiences anxiety or extreme fear in at least two of the following situations .
public transport
open spaces
enclosed spaces
a crowd or a line
out of the house alone
In addition , the doctor looks for the following features :
The person avoids the triggering situation or refuses to be there without a trusted companion .
The reason for the avoidance is a fear of being unable to escape , get help , or care for themselves if embarrassing or panic - like symptoms occur .
The fear and anxiety are out of proportion to any real danger that may exist .
The fear and anxiety cause profound distress and affect the person ’s ability to function .
There is no other explanation for the fear and anxiety .
The symptoms must be persistent , and the person must have experienced them for at least 6 months to receive a diagnosis .
The doctor also needs to establish that the symptoms do not result from another disorder , such as a specific phobia or social anxiety disorder .
They may perform or order tests to rule out other conditions that could cause the symptoms .
A person with a diagnosis of agoraphobia may be eligible for a disability allowance .
In June of 2004 , during the WWDC keynote address , Steve Jobs revealed Mac OS X 10.4
Tiger to developers and the public for the first time .
When the finished product arrived in April of 2005 , Tiger was the biggest , most important , most feature - packed release in the history of Mac OS X by a wide margin .
Apple 's marketing campaign reflected this , touting " over 150 new features . "
All those new features took time .
Since its introduction in 2001 , there had been at least one major release of Mac OS X each year .
Tiger took over a year and a half to arrive .
At the time , it definitely seemed worth the wait .
Tiger was a hit with users and developers .
Apple took the lesson to heart and quickly set expectations for the next major release of Mac OS X , Leopard .
Through various channels , Apple communicated its intention to move from a 12 - month to an 18 - month release cycle for Mac OS X. Leopard was officially scheduled for " spring 2007 . "
As the date approached , Apple 's marketing machine trod a predictable path .
Apple even went so far as to list all 300 new features on its website .
As it turns out , " spring " was a bit optimistic .
Leopard actually shipped at the end of October 2007 , nearly two and a half years after Tiger .
Did Leopard really have twice as many new features as Tiger ?
That 's debatable .
What 's certain is that Leopard included a solid crop of new features and technologies , many of which we now take for granted .
( For example , have you had a discussion with a potential Mac user since the release of Leopard without mentioning Time Machine ?
I certainly have n't . )
Mac OS X appeared to be maturing .
The progression was clear : longer release cycles , more features .
What would Mac OS X 10.6 be like ?
Would it arrive three and a half years after Leopard ?
Would it and include 500 new features ?
A thousand ?
At WWDC 2009 , Bertrand Serlet announced a move that he described as " unprecedented " in the PC industry .
That 's right , the next major release of Mac OS X would have no new features .
The product name reflected this : " Snow Leopard . "
Mac OS X 10.6 would merely be a variant of Leopard .
Better , faster , more refined , more ... uh ... snowy .
This was a risky strategy for Apple .
After the rapid - fire updates of 10.1 , 10.2 , and 10.3 followed by the riot of new features and APIs in 10.4 and 10.5 , could Apple really get away with calling a " time out ? "
I imagine Bertrand was really sweating this announcement up on the stage at WWDC in front of a live audience of Mac developers .
Their reaction ?
Spontaneous applause .
There were even a few hoots and whistles .
Many of these same developers applauded the " 150 + new features " in Tiger and the " 300 new features " in Leopard at past WWDCs .
Now they were applauding zero new features for Snow Leopard ?
What explains this ?
It probably helps to know that the " 0 New Features " slide came at the end of an hour - long presentation detailing the major new APIs and technologies in Snow Leopard .
It was also quickly followed by a back - pedaling ( " well , there is one new feature ... " ) slide describing the addition of Microsoft Exchange support .
In isolation , " no new features " may seem to imply stagnation .
In context , however , it served as a developer - friendly affirmation .
The overall message from Apple to developers was something like this : " We 're adding a ton of new things to Mac OS X that will help you write better applications and make your existing code run faster , and we 're going to make sure that all this new stuff is rock - solid and as bug - free as possible .
We 're not going to overextend ourselves adding a raft of new customer - facing , marketing - friendly features .
Instead , we 're going to concentrate 100 % on the things that affect you , the developers . "
But if Snow Leopard is a love letter to developers , is it a Dear John letter to users ?
You know , those people that the marketing department might so crudely refer to as " customers . "
What 's in it for them ?
Believe it or not , the sales pitch to users is actually quite similar .
As exhausting as it has been for developers to keep up with Apple 's seemingly never - ending stream of new APIs , it can be just as taxing for customers to stay on top of Mac OS X's features .
Exposé , a new Finder , Spotlight , a new Dock , Time Machine , a new Finder again , a new iLife and iWork almost every year , and on and on .
And as much as developers hate bugs in Apple 's APIs , users who experience those bugs as application crashes have just as much reason to be annoyed .
Enter Snow Leopard : the release where we all get a break from the new - features / new - bugs treadmill of Mac OS X development .
That 's the pitch .
Uncomfortable realities
But wait a second , did n't I just mention an " hour - long presentation " about Snow Leopard featuring " major new APIs and technologies ? "
When speaking to developers , Apple 's message of " no new features " is another way of saying " no new bugs . "
Snow Leopard is supposed to fix old bugs without introducing new ones .
But nothing says " new bugs , coming right up " quite like major new APIs .
So which is it ?
Similarly , for users , " no new features " connotes stability and reliability .
But if Snow Leopard includes enough changes to the core OS to fill an hour - long overview session at WWDC more than a year before its release , can Apple really make good on this promise ?
Or will users end up with all the disadvantages of a feature - packed release like Tiger or Leopard — the inevitable 10.x.0 bugs , the unfamiliar , untried new functionality — but without any of the actual new features ?
Yes , it 's enough to make one quite cynical about Apple 's real motivations .
To throw some more fuel on the fire , have a look at the Mac OS X release timeline below .
Next to each release , I 've included a list of its most significant features .
That curve is taking on a decidedly droopy shape , as if it 's being weighed down by the ever - increasing number of new features .
( The releases are distributed uniformly on the Y axis . )
Maybe you think it 's reasonable for the time between releases to stretch out as each one brings a heavier load of goodies than the last , but keep in mind the logical consequence of such a curve over the long horn haul .
And yeah , there 's a little upwards kick at the end for 10.6 , but remember , this is supposed to be the " no new features " release .
Version 10.1 had a similar no - frills focus but took a heck of a lot less time to arrive .
Looking at this graph , it 's hard not to wonder if there 's something siphoning resources from the Mac OS X development effort .
Maybe , say , some project that 's in the first two or three major releases of its life , still in that steep , early section of its own timeline graph .
Yes , I 'm talking about the iPhone , specifically iPhone OS .
The iPhone business has exploded onto Apple 's balance sheets like no other product before , even the iPod .
It 's also accruing developers at an alarming rate .
It 's not a stretch to imagine that many of the artists and developers who piled on the user - visible features in Mac OS X 10.4 and 10.5 have been reassigned to iPhone OS ( temporarily or otherwise ) .
After all , Mac OS X and iPhone OS share the same core operating system , the same language for GUI development , and many of the same APIs .
Some workforce migration seems inevitable .
And let 's not forget the " Mac OS X " technologies that we later learned were developed for the iPhone and just happened to be announced for the Mac first ( because the iPhone was still a secret ) , like Core Animation and code signing .
Such conspiracy theories certainly are n't helped by WWDC keynote snubs and other indignities suffered by Mac OS X and the Mac in general since the iPhone arrived on the scene .
And so , on top of everything else , Snow Leopard is tasked with restoring some luster to Mac OS X .
Got all that ?
A nearly two - year development cycle , but no new features .
Major new frameworks for developers , but few new bugs .
Significant changes to the core OS , but more reliability .
And a franchise rejuvenation with few user - visible changes .
It 's enough to turn a leopard white .
Independent investment brokerage CLSA ( short for Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia ) is paying Sarah Palin to deliver the keynote address at its 16th Investors ' Forum in Hong Kong tomorrow .
CNN notes that she will speak about " governance , economics , and current events in the United States and Asia . "
This strikes me as riotous on two levels :
1. Someone is actually giving Palin money to talk to 1,000 or so international investors about global economics and what 's going on in Asia .
2 . In her new role as buck - raker extraordinaire , the darling of wingnut conservatives is pocketing a fat wad of cash from a China - based financial brokerage owned by a French banking conglomerate .
How perfect is that ?
Cycling is a healthy and sustainable method of transportation , but one of its limitations is that you ’re susceptible to less - than - ideal weather conditions .
What if you could cycle to work in any weather conditions without having to worry about your safety or comfort ?
Furthermore , what if you could cycle to work in a reclined , comfortable seat with an aerial view of your city ?
This is the possibility that inventor Geoffrey Barnett had envisioned when he first thought about the idea while working in Tokyo .
He wanted to find a more efficient means to cross the city .
Six years later , in November 2007 , the Shweeb monorail amusement ride opened for business at Agroventures in New Zealand , about 3 hours from Auckland .
The Shweeb is the world ’s first human - powered monorail .
One to four people can use the Shweeb and it uses about half of the energy required to ride a racing bike , or about 1/3 of the energy required to ride a mountain bike .
The Shweeb is enclosed – thus shielding the rider from poor weather conditions – and they say it is as comfortable as lying in a hammock .
The Shweeb creates an array of potential opportunities for the future .
In the short term , the Shweeb could provide an alternative to shuttling around large amusement parks – for example Disney World .
In the longer term , the Shweeb could provide an alternative to underground subway lines for commuters .
The first city to adopt such a system would surely benefit from the publicity .
There are however a number of logistical constraints that will make the Shweeb a difficult system to implement .
Although being enclosed has its benefits to prevent poor weather from impeding you in your journey , it also has its downside .
Being enclosed on a hot summer day or cold winter night is less than ideal , so the capsules would need to be cooled in the summer and heated in the winter .
The inventors claim :
“ The result is the most efficient vehicle on earth , the most inexpensive infrastructure of any proposed urban transit and one of the highest capacity systems available – potentially delivering thousand ’s of people per hour in a very small airspace .
All this with zero carbon emissions and no parking worries or cost ! ”
Although the Shweeb may be the most inexpensive infrastructure of any proposed urban transit , it would surely still have a significant price tag to build and maintain .
But then again , what transit system in the world is truly inexpensive to implement or operate ?
( Besides a bicycle - sharing system of course ) .
One blogger states an obvious concern about what happens if a capsule breaks down mid-trip : “ Imagine if a pod breaks down mid trip : the person inside would be trapped , and all the people behind it would be stuck until it ’s fixed ” .
It ’s not that he does n’t like the concept , he just does n’t think it could be viable , “ As an amusement park attraction , the Shweeb is pretty cool ; as mass transit system , it ’s stupid ” .
I believe that some day this system could be a viable method of transportation once all of the possible constraints have been considered and resolved .
The great minds of the world have come together to solve difficult challenges before , so I do n’t see why they could n’t find a way to re-engineer the Shweeb system to make it a viable method of transportation in a major city .

High winds and torrential rain of Typhoon Morakot hit coastal provinces Fujian and Zhejian hardest , and caused the worst flooding in decades in Taiwan -- where flood waters as high as 7 feet were reported , China Daily reported .
The deadly typhoon swept across the Philippines and Taiwan 's Hualien region before crashing into eastern China , claiming nearly two dozens lives along the way , the newspaper reported .
The storm -- measuring about 1,600 kilometers ( about 1,000 miles ) across -- continued to pummel coastal China Monday , but forecasters said it is unlikely that Morakot would reach Shanghai , the country 's largest city , which sits further north along the coast .
Government officials expect the typhoon to cause more than 8.5 million yuan ( $ 1.2 billion ) in damages , the newspaper said .
The storm made landfall in the coastal area of Beibi Town , Xiapu County in Fujian province at about 4:20 p.m. Sunday ( 0820 GMT ) , according to China 's state - run Xinhua news agency .
Morakot 's winds were clocked at 118 kilometers per hour ( 73 mph ) in its eye , according to the province 's meteorological bureau as cited by Xinhua .
Do n't Miss Typhoon Morakot lashes Taiwan
Video from Taiwan showed a six - story hotel crashing into the floodwaters coursing below .
The well - known hot springs resort had evacuated before the collapse .
At least seven people were killed , 32 wounded and 46 unaccounted for , according to Taiwan 's Central News Agency .
In China , five houses were destroyed as the front of the typhoon brought flooding rains to Wenzhou City in neighboring Zhejiang province just after 8 a.m. Sunday , Xinhua said .
Three adults and a 4 - year - old boy were buried in debris about 8 a.m .
Rescue workers were unable to save the child , and he died , the city 's flood - control headquarters told the news agency .
A " red alert " -- the highest degree in danger levels -- was issued in Zhejiang , where more than 35,000 vessels were called back from sea , China Daily reported , citing provincial flood control officials .
More than 300 homes collapsed , and more than 16,000 hectares ( 39,500 acres ) were flooded , Xinhua said .
The city 's airport was closed and 56 roads were rendered impassable .
As the eye of the storm reached Beibi , the sky turned completely dark , and people caught in rainstorms staggered as they used flashlights to see , Xinhua reported .
Trees were being uprooted and torn apart by damaging winds .
Farmers were attempting to recapture large amounts of fish , flushed from mudflat fish farms by high winds , Xinhua said .
Nearly a million people were evacuated from Fujian and Zhejiang provinces as Morakot approached .
Late Friday , the storm lashed Taiwan , killing two people , wounding 15 and knocking off power to about 650,000 households , according to Hong Kong 's Metro Radio .
Meanwhile , another typhoon hit west Japan on Monday , with 12 people confirmed dead .
Two others are missing , police said .
Among the victims of Typhoon Etau was a 68 - year - old woman who died when a landslide caused a hill to collapse on her home in Okayama prefecture , police said .
In neighboring Hyogo prefecture , an 86 - year - old woman was found dead in her flooded house and a 54 - year - old man in his submerged car .
Officials expect the number of victims to rise as torrential rains continue .

TOKYO ( Reuters Life ! ) -
Imagine a light switch or a book that appears only when you need it -- Japanese scientists are one step closer to making the stuff of sci - fi films into reality after creating a hologram that can also be felt .
“ Up until now , holography has been for the eyes only , and if you ’d try to touch it , your hand would go right through , ” Hiroyuki Shinoda , professor at Tokyo university and one of the developers of the technology , told Reuters .
“ But now we have a technology that also adds the sensation of touch to holograms . ”
Holograms -- three - dimensional images -- are commonly found on credit cards , DVDs and CDs to prevent forgery , and larger scale holograms have been used in entertainment .
By using ultrasonic waves , the scientists have developed software that creates pressure when a user ’s hand “ touches ” a hologram that is projected .
In order to track a user ’s hand , the researchers use control sticks from Nintendo ’s popular Wii gaming system that are mounted above the hologram display area .
The technology has so far been tested with relatively simple objects , although the researchers have more practical plans , including virtual switches at hospitals , for example , and other places where contamination by touch is an issue .
Shinoda also said the technology could be used to replace other physical objects , making it economical and environmentally friendly .
Just when it looked as though there might never be a solution to the problem of walking , Honda today unveiled the U3 - X personal mobility device , a sci-fi- looking , unicycle - ish mobile stool that moves forward , backward , side - to - side , or diagonally in response to a simple adjustment in the user ’s body weight .
The U3 - X remains upright by utilizing balance control technology that Honda developed while researching ASIMO , Honda ’s famous bipedal humanoid robot .
Its omni-directional driving system appears to be a single wheel , though the “ larger - diameter ” wheel ( which rolls forward and backward ) is actually made up of a several smaller wheels that enable it to move side to side .
A combination of forward or backward thrust and lateral thrust produces diagonal motion .
Looking at the U3 - X , we ’re reminded of the Segway ( and all the commercial success that came with it ) .
To be fair , the U3 - X was designed to aid the elderly , but it seems like the balance needed to operate the machine might pose a bit of a hazard for those who already have mobility problems .
Still , the unit is designed to keep the user ’s feet close to the ground while keeping the user ’s carriage upright enough to be nearly eye - level with other people who are standing up .
The prototype model of the U3 - X ( in action below ) weighs just shy of 22 pounds and can roll for about an hour on a single charge to its lithium - ion power source .
When a commercial version might become available is anyone ’s guess .
Personally , we ’re not holding our breath .

THIS story is of no material importance to Japan .
It is the story of Jane .
And it is a story of a very small , dark sliver of 20th century geopolitics that festers still .
Jane is an attractive , blonde 40 - something Australian , resident for many years in Japan and a mother of three boys .
She is also the victim of a rape .
Jane is not her real name .
She is actually the victim of two violations .
The physical one was committed on April 6th 2002 near the American naval base at Yokosuka by Bloke T. Deans , an American serviceman .
He violently raped her in her car .
What Jane refers to as her “ second rape ” happened afterwards , when she reported the crime to the Kanagawa prefectural police .
There , she alleges that she was interrogated for hours by six policemen , who mocked her .
At a later meeting , they laughed and made crude sexual comments .
She was initially denied medical treatment , water and food .
Jane was denied a receptacle to keep a urine sample — key forensic evidence in a rape .
After four hours , all she could do was relieve herself on a cold police toilet and cry .
The police made no attempt to preserve sperm or DNA on her body .
Her torment at the hands of the police so amplified the trauma of the evening that she actually tried to dial emergency services to report that she was being held against her will at the station , but an officer ripped the phone from her hand .
Ultimately she was kept in custody for some 12 hours following the crime , before having to drive herself home .
The police located the assailant , Mr Deans , of the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk , but for reasons that remained unclear , no charges were filed against him .
Jane , however , filed and won a civil case against him : a Tokyo court ordered him to pay ¥3 m ( around $ 30,000 ) in November 2004 .
But unbeknownst to Jane or the court , soon after the suit was filed , the American navy had quietly discharged Mr Deans , who returned to America and disappeared .
Later , she received compensation from Japan 's Ministry of Defence , out of a discreet fund for civilian victims of crimes by American military personnel .
In Jane 's view , the first rape went unpunished : Mr Deans remains at large .
So she turned her attention to the “ second rape ” .
She sued the Kanagawa police for a bungled investigation that denied her proper justice .
In December 2007 the court ruled against her , stating that the police had fulfilled their responsibilities .
She appealed the decision .
Jane 's ordeal underscores the clumsiness of Japan 's police force .
In several recent high - profile cases , the police have coerced confessions from suspects .
It also highlights the lack of a tradition of individual rights in the country , and the often thinly reasoned rulings of Japanese courts .
And it fits the pattern that in many crimes by American servicemen , the Japanese authorities fail to press charges .
But the reason why cases like Jane 's are not prosecuted may have less to do with incompetent police and more because of a secret agreement between America and Japan in 1953 that has recently come to light .
In September 2008 , Shoji Niihara , a researcher on Japanese - American relations , uncovered previously classified documents in the U.S. National Archives .
They show that in 1953 , soon after Dwight Eisenhower assumed the presidency , John Foster Dulles , his secretary of state , embarked on a massive programme to get countries to waive their jurisdiction in cases of crimes by American servicemen .
On October 28th 1953 , a Japanese official , Minoru Tsuda , made a formal declaration to the United States ( not intended for public disclosure ) , stating , “ The Japanese authorities do not normally intend to exercise the primary right of jurisdiction over members of the United States Armed Forces , the civilian component , or their dependents subject to the military law of the United States , other than in cases considered to be of material importance to Japan . ”
In other words , Japan agreed to ignore almost all crimes by American servicemen , under the hope that the military itself would prosecute such offences — but with no means of redress if it did not .
This helps explain the perplexing , toothless approach of the Japanese police and prosecutors even today in cases of crimes by American military personnel .
When Mr Niihara first made the documents public in October , a senior Japanese official denied any such agreement , but in words so mealy - mouthed that it raised suspicion .
Japan 's landmark accord with the United States over troops stationed in the country , called the Status of Forces Agreement , was signed in 1960 .
Article XVII.1 b states : “ The authorities of Japan shall have jurisdiction over the members of the United States armed forces , the civilian component , and their dependents with respect to offences committed within the territory of Japan and punishable by the law of Japan . ”
But in practice the Japanese do not exercise their authority .
Jane 's case was just one of many in which the Japanese authorities opted to look the other way .
This has nothing to do with the specifics of her case ; it stems from an intergovernmental security protocol negotiated a half - century earlier .
Why did America fight so hard in 1953 to maintain control of criminal cases involving its boys ?
The documents do not say , but provide a clue : in numerous settings , American officials express unease that American servicemen commit roughly 30 serious crimes each month .
Having 350 soldiers sent to Japanese jails each year would have been bad for America 's image .
According to a separate document , America struck similar , secret agreements with the governments of Canada , Italy , Ireland and Denmark .
When Jane talks to reporters , she wears stylish , bug - eyed , mirrored sunglasses that seem more shields than fashion statement .
It is futile protection — a tangible symbol of her quest for anonymity , akin to her pseudonymity .
On December 10th 2008 , the Tokyo High Court ruled on Jane 's appeal in the suit against the Kanagawa police .
Judge Toshifumi Minami entered the court , told her “ You lost .
And the financial burden of the case lies with you , ” and then left .
A 20 - page ruling , considered short , sheds little insight into how the court reached its decision .
Jane plans to appeal to the Supreme Court .
“ I lost — but they lost too , ” she said .
Jane will always bear indelible , invisible scars .
But this is of no material importance to Japan .
Or America .

WORLD champion 800 metre runner Caster Semenya has been revealed to have both male and female sexual organs , posing an ethical and political quandary for the world international athletics body , the IAAF , and South Africa .
Extensive physical and emotional examinations of Semenya , 18 , have shown the athlete is technically a hermaphrodite .
Caster Semenya at the world titles last month and ( inset ) with a magazine makeover this week .
Medical reports indicate she has no ovaries , but rather has internal testes , producing amounts of testosterone considered abnormal for a woman .
Late last night the IAAF was trying to contact Semenya to inform her of the medical results following exhaustive examinations involving blood tests , chromosome tests and a gynaecological exam she underwent after dominating the world titles in Berlin last month .
Mutter : a window manager for GNOME 3
Did you know ...?
LWN . net is a subscriber - supported publication ; we rely on subscribers to keep the entire operation going .
Please help out by buying a subscription and keeping LWN on the net .
GNOME 3 is the GNOME project 's ambitious effort to take its desktop into the future .
A key component of the desktop is the window manager , which defines much of the overall feel of the system .
Thomas Thurman , the maintainer of Metacity — GNOME 's current window manager — is looking ahead to " Mutter " as the window manager for GNOME 3 .
Metacity 2 will gradually be phased out in favor of Mutter ; in GNOME 2.28 it will be an alternative window manager , while in GNOME 3 , it will take over the reins from Metacity .
The GNOME Shell , responsible for the new user experience in GNOME 3 , runs as a plugin for Mutter .
Started as a fork of Metacity , Mutter uses the Clutter toolkit .
Clutter does its rendering using OpenGL or OpenGL ES , so using it in Mutter makes hardware acceleration for the window manager possible .
Meanwhile , Clutter has just announced its 1.0 release .
500 bugs to squash
With Mutter becoming the new kid in town for GNOME 3 , Metacity 2 will not be actively developed any more , except for bug fixes .
This makes Mutter essentially Metacity 3 .
Of course people who would like Metacity 2 to continue because they do n't like the Clutter backend may fork it , but it remains to be seen if that would happen .
On his blog , Thurman welcomes anybody to do that and offers them " as much support in doing so as possible " , but he will switch to working on Mutter himself .
Besides all the work that has been done over the years on Metacity , Mutter has 12 contributors with at least three commits .
The project is maintained by Owen Taylor and Tomas Frydrych .
This fork , however , has one big problem : what to do with the more than five hundred bugs open against Metacity ?
As Thurman describes on his blog , " this is more than one maintainer can humanly tackle . "
The simplest " solution " is to close them all , a mistake that GNOME has made in the past with the switch from GNOME 1.4 to GNOME 2 .
Jamie Zawinski called this the cascade of attention - deficit teenagers model .
Thurman proposes a better solution : work through all the bug reports , then decide what to do with each bug .
Enhancement requests will not be fixed , unless Mutter or GNOME
Shell could use it .
Bugs that can be reproduced in Mutter should be reassigned .
Bugs that are already fixed in Mutter , such as enhancement requests , should be marked as already fixed .
Thurman kindly asks his readers to help him with this painstaking work , for which no volunteers seem to have stepped up yet .
New directions for a window manager
The development of GNOME 3 seems to be bringing new ideas from many different directions .
Thurman has been doing some investigation into switching to a CSS - based format for Metacity themes ; as Mutter is just the new incarnation of Metacity , many of these considerations directly carry over into Mutter :
I am convinced that the current theme format is far too complicated ( or , it could be said , far too powerful ) for the job it does .
Designing window border themes is not a very complicated matter , but the current format makes it complicated through requiring complicated algebraic expressions for placement .
Thurman is proposing a switch to CSS , or at least the use of CSS as an alternative format .
He sees several advantages of this approach :
The Metacity / Mutter developers will be able to use existing libraries for layout rather than doing it all with custom code in the window manager .
Theme designers will be able to use their existing knowledge of CSS rather than having to learn a complicated new format .
CSS 's box model is far more amenable to a simple drag - and - drop editor program than Metacity 's current expression - based system .
Thurman is also imagining a theme designer , with a simple mode that is a wizard : it would ask the user a series of questions and would then produce some CSS code .
An advanced mode would let the user edit each CSS rule individually , and reflect the changes on the screen .
He is also working on a wiki , which he 'll announce soon , that allows users to enter CSS and render it to an image of the window borders :
The idea here is that people who like to play with theme design are not necessarily the same people who like to build experimental software , so this lets them test it out using only a web browser .
Owen Taylor explains another new direction : Mutter will get application - aware window management .
More specifically it will get knowledge about tabs :
Dave Jordan is working on a GNOME Shell Google Summer of Code project to let applications export information about their tabs to Mutter via window properties .
This will allow , for example , switching directly to a specific web browser tab , rather than switching to the window , then switching to the tab .
Another developer , Sam Hoffstaetter , is working on letting the user group together arbitrary windows as tabs , something that so - called tabbed window managers offer .
Each application would think it had multiple windows open , but the user would see them as tabs .
The reasoning , which your author is very sympathetic to , is as follows :
Being part of the window - manager , every application would make use of tabs without having to re-invent them specifically for that application .
It has always struck me that tabs were something that belonged into the window manager , not in browsers , terminals , editors , etc .
Some issues with Mutter
Interesting as the new directions may be , some people fear that Mutter will not run on older hardware .
For example , the Sugar developers did n't choose Mutter , and went for Metacity instead , exactly because of this fear .
However , Taylor puts that in perspective :
Our target for Mutter is to provide a good GL - based compositor .
This does exclude machines , like the first generation XO , that have no 3D hardware .
Almost any desktop or standard laptop built within the last 5 years has sufficiently good graphics .
Another fear that has been expressed is that Mutter will be too tightly coupled with GNOME 3 .
As GNOME
Shell is a Mutter plugin , it depends on it , so users will not be able to use another window manager with GNOME Shell .
According to Taylor , this integration is not coincidental but by design .
For example , supporting Compiz instead of Mutter would require a window management abstraction layer that " greatly increases the amount of work " .
However , this approach is problematic for some use cases , as Sam Spilsbury , one of the Compiz developers , pointed out a few months ago :
If users were to use compiz with GNOME , they would lose a significant chunk of essential functionality .
This is the dilemma I am sure a lot of other desktop - agnostic window managers are facing as well .
It would essentially mean that users _must_ use your window manager in order to use their desktop as normal .
Of course it will perfectly be possible to create a GNOME desktop using another window manager , but then the user would miss out on the new desktop experience of GNOME Shell .
For example , users will not be able to swap GNOME 's window manager with a flexible window manager such as xmonad and still leave all GNOME functionality intact .
Accessibility growing pains
The fact that GNOME Shell and Mutter use Clutter directly makes support for accessibility features such as AT - SPI ( Assistive Technologies Service Provider ) tricky , because Clutter has no accessibility support at the moment .
GTK applications , on the other hand , have ATK ( Accessibility Toolkit ) which talks with the AT - SPI daemon .
However , there 's no inherent reason that a switch to a Clutter - based composited user interface should pose any problem for accessibility .
The switch in toolkits will need a certain amount of reimplementation .
That said , Taylor maintains that some accessibility features such as good magnification could become much easier in Mutter .
An active project to provide accessibility interfaces for Clutter is Cally ( the name stems from Clutter + a 11y ) , originally funded by Nokia that uses Clutter in Maemo 5 .
The main developer , Alejandro Piñeiro Iglesias , explains the work he has done :
Cally implements Gnome 's ATK interfaces for the basic Clutter objects , but if you are using a custom Clutter object with extra functionality in your application , probably extra accessibility support would be required , like HAIL was required to implement the extra accessibility support for Hildon widgets .
Cally would be useful to implement accessibility support in Mutter and GNOME Shell , but Iglesias says he should check the code first and see what he needs to implement and how .
He presented Cally [ PDF.GZ ] at the recent Gran Canaria Desktop Summit .
A fresh start
According to Taylor , Mutter is not that exciting in isolation , but it is meant to provide a platform for building exciting user interfaces like Moblin and GNOME
Shell : " I 'm personally pretty interested in getting applications and the compositor properly synchronized so the user sees everything drawn as smoothly and cleanly as possible . "
Thurman is excited about the opportunity to get a fresh start and rethink how to interact with the user :
We have been working for ten years in a mindset which is now , of course , ten years old .
There 's only so far you can go in a purely evolutionary line of development .
That said , I 'm very glad the existing Metacity codebase is being integrated into Mutter and not thrown away .
The new directions of CSS - based themes and application - aware window management finally make GNOME 's window manager more than a dull but necessary component .
However , the developers have made some decisions under the hood that will not be popular in some circles .
There is no fallback option for those that cannot or do not want to use compositing , and the integration of GNOME Shell with Mutter shuts out alternative window managers .
But maybe this is the price that must be paid for innovation .
MOGADISHU – One of two French security advisers kidnapped by insurgents in Somalia last month escaped yesterday after killing three of his captors and fleeing to the presidential palace in Mogadishu , police said .
Militants had seized the Frenchmen at a hotel in the capital on July 14th and handed one to the Hizbul Islam rebels and the other to fighters from the al - Shabaab group , which Washington describes as al - Qaeda ’s proxy in the Horn of Africa state .
Al - Shabaab militants said they had later taken custody of both men , although that could not be confirmed .
Somali government officials at the city ’s hilltop Villa Somalia palace said the man who escaped was in good health .
“ We understand he killed three al - Shabaab guys who were guarding him .
I cannot understand how this good story happened , but now he is in the hands of the government , ” Abdiqadir Odweyne , a senior policeman , said .
Somalia ’s fragile UN - backed government faces a stubborn insurgency mounted by al - Shabaab and others .
They have been joined by foreign jihadists who Western security agencies say are using the country as a safe haven to plot attacks in the region and beyond .
An al - Shabaab source confirmed three of its members were killed , but said it was not known by whom : “ Three of my friends died but who killed them is the question .
We were expecting a ransom this morning , ” the rebel source said .
One associate of the kidnappers said the Frenchman had been freed after talks with Somali elders , and a senior Somali government source said a ransom had been paid for his release .
Adding to the confusion over who was holding the pair captive , a French foreign ministry statement said the man had escaped the clutches of Hizbul Islam .
“ He is now safe , ” the statement said .
“ Contrary to certain allegations and rumours , this occurred without violence and France did not pay any ransom .
The second hostage is still being held . ”
A spokesman for African Union peacekeepers said the Frenchman had been moved from the palace to their base .
A Somali government official said last month that the two Frenchmen had been posing as journalists .
President Sheikh Ahmed ’s administration controls only small parts of the lawless country ’s central region and a few districts of bomb - blasted Mogadishu .
Underlining the insecurity , police said 12 people were killed yesterday as guards from the agriculture ministry battled other government forces in Mogadishu .

Focus on Africa Magazine , Tanzania
At a road block in western Tanzania , miles from anywhere , a uniformed official raises a flagged barrier .
Nearby is a spill of black , like an oil slick .
This is one of several checkpoints which have been set up around the country in a half - hearted attempt to curtail the largely unregulated trade of charcoal , widely used across the continent as a fuel for cooking .
The guard on duty has confiscated six sacks .
They lean against one another and bleed black dust into the sand .
Once , Africa boasted seven million square kilometres of forest but a third of that has been lost
Lee White
Climate change expert
Over the next 50 miles there are dozens of sacks propped up under trees .
These will be loaded up by truck drivers who pay around $ 4 a bag to sell for up to six times the price in the city .
The guard at the roadblock has clearly opened his hand for " kitu kidogo " - a pay - off from coal traders in search of a quick buck .
The numbers tell the story - according to the Tanzania Association of Oil Marketing Companies , 20,000 bags of charcoal enter the capital Dar es Salaam every 24 hours .
Millions at risk
But the impact of this unregulated coal trade is chilling .
Aid agency Christian
Aid estimates that 182 million people in Africa are at risk of dying as a consequence of climate change by the end of the century .
Meanwhile , Oxfam believes climate change is frustrating the efforts of millions on the continent to escape poverty .
Drought is forcing Kenya 's Masai herders to travel further for grazing Nobel laureate Professor Wangari Maathai offers a solution .
Why is climate change such a harbinger of doom ?
Andrew Simms from the New Economics Foundation explains : " Global warming means that many dry areas are going to get drier and wet areas are going to get wetter . "
This imbalance will make subsistence farming , upon which millions of Africans depend , even more precarious .
It will also exacerbate famine and disease .
" One adaptation option for Africa is to keep her forests standing so that they provide essential environmental services such as carbon sinks , " she said .
It is estimated that carbon is accumulating in the atmosphere at an annual rate of 3.5 billion metric tonnes .
A 40 - year - study by the University of Leeds of African forests - which account for a third of the world 's total tropical forest - demonstrates that Africa is , indeed , a significant carbon sink .
Lee
White , a climate change expert , concurs : " To get an idea of the value of the sink , the removal of nearly 5 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests should be valued at around $ 25 billion a year .
This is a compelling argument for conserving tropical forests . "
But Africa has not been very good at this .
According to the UN the continent is losing forest twice as fast as the rest of the world .
" Once upon a time , Africa boasted seven million square kilometres of forest but a third of that has been lost - most of it to charcoal . "
Lucrative business
The reality , however , is that in sub-Saharan Africa only 7.5 % of the rural population has access to electricity .
Wood and its by - product charcoal are , unless radical steps are taken , likely to remain the primary energy source for decades .
POWER IN AFRICA Only 4 % of electricity generated worldwide is produced in Africa Sub - Saharan Africa has the world 's lowest electrification rate at 25.9 % Rural electrification rates in sub-Saharan Africa are only 8 % 70 % of household income in Africa is spent on energy ( diesel , kerosene , charcoal ) 80 % of Africans rely on biomass for energy ( wood or charcoal fuel ) 4 million hectares of forest are felled each year in Africa , twice the world average Source :
The World Future Council Additionally , charcoal is a lucrative business - not only for those collecting wood to burn .
In the Kenyan capital , Nairobi , over 70 tonnes of charcoal dust is discarded daily .
Some 10 % of that waste is absorbed by a company called Chardust , which salvages it from charcoal traders across the city and processes it with binders as a charcoal alternative .
The company manufactures 250 tonnes of saleable product a month .
Some though are trying to look beyond the finite resource .
To the west of Nairobi , Cheryl Mvula of the Tribal Voice consultancy has introduced the extraordinary Cow Dung Fuel Initiative to counter deforestation in the Mara Triangle of Kenya 's Masai Mara .
Here dung is mixed with waste paper and water , fashioned into briquettes and sundried for use .
Since the project 's inception in March 2009 , firewood collection has reduced by 75 % in the five villages where the scheme has been piloted .
Organic alternative Back in Tanzania , where the charcoal market remains largely backstreet , the industry is valued at upwards of $ 150 million a year .
This figure encouraged Briton Nicholas Harrison to get involved .
His company , the East Africa Briquette Company , is the only producer of an organic alternative in a region where 90 % of people use charcoal .
The company 's product , Mkaa Bora , is prepared from waste and post - harvest products - sawdust , charcoal dust , maize cobs and even banana skins .
Effectively , local " recipes " are designed according to a given area 's crop predominance .
The waste burns more slowly and is 30 % hotter than traditional charcoal .
The production is also much leaner than traditional charcoal - making , where just 40 % of the wood felled is converted into a useable fuel .
But how to balance job creation with the need to protect the environment ?
In Uganda , for example , which has lost half of its forest cover in the past 30 years , charcoal production yields 20,000 jobs and generates more than $ 20 million in income every year .
In Kenya it is 10 times that figure .
Clearly any future charcoal alternative has to fill the gap .
Whether any African governments are keen to break away from the convenient job - creator - particularly during a challenging economic climate - to invest in alternatives will be a true test of their commitment to the environment .

Fox News has been caught flashing up a subliminal image of presidential candidate John McCain during its TV intro sequence in what appears to be a deliberate , criminal , and underhanded propaganda ploy .
Blink and you ’ll miss it , but the image of a smiling John McCain and his wife Cindy is sure to register in your subconscious as it flashes up behind the logo of Fox 5 News , a Fox News affiliate .
Neo -Cons are obviously denying reality again by claiming the image is accidental , but this is n’t a " bleed image " from a roll of Kodak , it ’s state of the art digital editing .
It is impossible for an image to be placed there unless its done deliberately .
" I think you people are getting ahead of yourselves , " claims one debunker , " the fox guy working the computer prolly just got lazy and used a clip from a previous show , calm down .
There are such things as lazy people . "
If he merely used a clip from a previous show then why on earth does the McCain image flash up for only a matter of milliseconds ?
If the image was inserted for a genuine reason then why would it appear for less time than the conscious mind could register it ?
The story following the intro is not about John McCain , so that excuse is out of the window too .
Again – the image flashes up too quickly to be recognized consciously .
The fact that Fox News is engaging in this stunt may be unsurprising to some , but the most disturbing aspect of using subliminal advertising is that it has been proven successful .
James Vicary ’s infamous 1957 claim that he could get New Jersey movie - goers to buy more popcorn and drink coca-cola by flashing the words " Drink Coca - Cola " and " Hungry ? Eat popcorn " for 1/3000 of a second at five - second intervals during a film is the subject of much controversy .
Vicary asserted that sales of popcorn and Coke in that New Jersey theater increased 57.8 percent and 18.1 percent respectively , but the accuracy of the results has long been disputed .
However , a 2006 New Scientist investigation concluded that " Researchers have shown that if the conditions are right , subliminal advertising to promote a brand can be made to work . "
23 - millisecond subliminal messages for " Lipton Ice " resulted in 80 % of subjects choosing Lipton Ice Tea over other drinks brands in an experiment conducted by Johan Karremans at the University of Nijmegen in the Netherlands .
An investigation needs to be conducted into how the image appeared during the Fox News intro sequence and if a deliberate motivation to engage in mass public deception is found , authorities should consider revoking Fox 5 ’s broadcast license or at least handing out a gargantuan fine .
The use of subliminal advertising in the UK , Australia and the US is a criminal offence .
It is the mandate of the FCC to clamp down on such an egregious attempt to sway public opinion by means of subliminal psychological influence , especially when the brand being pushed is not merely a soft drink , but a presidential candidate .

( New York ) - The Iranian authorities are using prolonged harsh interrogations , beatings , sleep deprivation , and threats of torture to extract false confessions from detainees arrested since the disputed June 12 presidential election , Human Rights Watch said today .
The confessions appear designed to support unsubstantiated allegations by senior government officials that Iran 's post- election protests , in which at least 20 people were killed , were supported by foreign powers and aimed at overthrowing the government .
" The Iranian government is desperate to justify its vicious attacks on peaceful protesters , " said Sarah Leah Whitson , Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch .
" What better excuse does it need than confessions of foreign plots , beaten out of detainees ? "
Human Rights
Watch has collected accounts from detainees after their release illustrating how the authorities are mistreating and threatening prisoners in a deliberate effort to obtain false confessions .
A 17 - year - old boy who was arrested on June 27 and released on July 1 told Human Rights Watch how his prison interrogator forced him and others to sign a blank statement of confession :
" On the first day , while blindfolded , the interrogator took me to a parking garage .
They kept everyone standing for 48 hours with no permission to sleep .
On the first night , they tied up our hands and repeatedly beat us and other prisoners with a baton .
They kept cursing at the prisoners .
The atmosphere was very frightening .
Everyone had wet themselves from fear and stress .
There were children as young as 15 and men as old as 70 ; they'd be begging and crying for mercy , but the guards did n't care .
" After two days of interrogation while blindfolded , we were asked about everything : where we had studied , what our parents do , who we voted for , who is educated in the family , if anyone in our family is part of the military .
We were forced to give the names of everyone .
It was a scary situation because they were threatening us and were very harsh .
All we could hear were other people crying and screaming .
" They provided us with a big piece of bread once , but no water .
On the last day , they took away the blindfold to force us sign a paper that was blank on top but said at the bottom : ‘ I agree with all of the above statements . ' "
Senior Iranian officials have said that detainees have confessed to their involvement in a foreign - backed plot to overthrow the government with a " velvet " revolution .
Mojtaba Zolnour , the representative of the Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in the Revolutionary Guard Corps , said on July 2 that all the prominent detainees except one had now confessed .
During his July 3 Friday prayer sermon , Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati , a high - ranking member of the Guardian Council , said that the government would make public some of the confessions obtained from detainees .
State - backed media already have broadcast the confessions of some detainees .
Amir Hossein Mahdavi , editor of reformist newspaper Andishe No , confessed on Iranian TV on June 27 that reformist groups had laid plans to create unrest before the June 12 elections .
Friends of Mahdavi who saw his confession told Human Rights
Watch that it was clear from his demeanor that he confessed under duress .
Among the detainees who were recently forced to appear on Iranian television is Newsweek 's correspondent in Iran , Maziar Bahari .
He was detained on June 21 and is believed to be held in Tehran 's Evin prison , where Human Rights Watch has documented cases of torture and detainee abuse in previous years .
He has not been allowed to see a lawyer or his elderly mother , with whom he lives .
No charges have been filed against Bahari , who holds dual Iranian and Canadian citizenship .
On June 30 , the semi-official Fars news agency reported that Bahari had given a press conference where he denounced efforts of Western media to stage an uprising in Iran similar to the 1989 Czechoslovak " Velvet Revolution , " and confessed to a role in covering these " illegal demonstrations . "
Newsweek has strongly defended Bahari 's innocence and called for him to be released immediately .
Vajiheh Marsousi , the wife of dissident intellectual Saeed Hajjarian , whom authorities arrested on June 15 , believes that he is under intense pressure to sign a false confession .
After visiting him in Evin prison , she believes that his life is in danger due to his poor health and lack of medical care in prison .
Information about the abuse of Iranian detainees in custody continues to filter in .
An eyewitness who visited the Revolutionary Court on July 1 told Human Rights Watch :
" Hundreds of the prisoners ' families were gathered in front of the entrance of the court .
On the court 's wall , a piece of paper listed the names of 1,349 prisoners .
This was a list of people that the court would be soon releasing .
There was also a separate sheet with another 223 names .
It said that the authorities were still investigating the people on this list and that their families should come back in a couple of weeks .
In the few hours that I spent before outside the court , I witnessed a number of people being released .
Almost all of them had bruised faces and hands .
Some of the families , after seeing their sons / daughters in such bad condition , started to cry , while other families claimed their sons or daughters were missing and their names were not listed . "
The authorities have arrested thousands of people in a nationwide crackdown aimed at ending mass street protests that started in Tehran and other cities on June 13 after the official results of the June 12 elections gave incumbent President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad a landslide victory .
Although authorities subsequently released many of those detained , they have continued to make new arrests .
Human Rights
Watch has collected the names of 450 persons whom security forces have arrested since June 13 , including more than a hundred political figures , journalists , human rights defenders , academics , and lawyers .
Most of the best - known detainees have now been held incommunicado for up to three weeks without access to lawyers or family members , raising serious concerns about the probability of mistreatment and pressure to make false confessions .
In the past , the Iranian government has frequently subjected political prisoners to various forms of pressure , including beatings , sleep deprivation , solitary confinement , torture , and threats of torture in an effort to force them to make confessions that they have then publicized in order to criminalize and discredit government critics .
Because of this past record of abuse , relatives , friends , and professional associates of several prominent detainees contacted by Human Rights Watch raised concerns about their probable mistreatment in detention and the likelihood that they would be forced to make false confessions .
International human rights law clearly protects detainees from mistreatment , including forced " confessions . "
Article 14 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , to which Iran is a party , states that every person charged with a criminal offense has the right " to communicate with counsel of his own choosing , " and " not to be compelled to testify against himself or to confess guilt . "
Principle 21 of the UN Body of Principles for the Protection of All Persons under Any Form of Detention or Imprisonment states that , " No detained person while being interrogated shall be subject to violence , threats or methods of interrogation which impair his capacity of decision or judgment . "
A fundamental rule of international human rights law is that all evidence , including confessions , obtained by torture or other ill - treatment must be excluded .
The Tesla Roadster is the all - electric supercar that 's as fast as a Ferrari
... but as quiet as a bicycle
Can you be green , without ever wanting to hear another bleeding - heart word about the environment as long as you live ?
I do my bit more than most : I recycle all my rubbish and sort it into three different bins .
I turn all my kitchen waste into compost .
Even my washing powder is twice - the - price organic stuff that does n't give worms tummy - aches when it returns to the earth .
But whenever I drive to London , dutifully paying my £ 8 for the privilege ( on top of my road tax , petrol tax , parking and all the other rip - offs ) , without fail a cyclist will rap on my window and make some holier - than - thou comment , before zooming off through a red light where he knows I can't get him .
With the Tesla Roadster there 's absolutely no power lag : put your foot down and you instantly get the entire 380 Nm of thrust
God , I hate those cyclists .
Every last herbal tea- drinking , Harriet Harman - voting one of them .
That 's one of the reasons I live in the countryside , where birds tweet , horses roam , pigs grunt and Lycra - clad buttocks are miles away .
But recently , there 's been a disturbing development .
Each Saturday , a big black truck appears at the bottom of my road , with bikes stuck to the roof and rear .
Out of it step a bunch of City - boy ponces in fluorescent Spider - Man outfits , shades , bum bags and stupid cleated shoes , who then pedal around our narrow lanes four abreast with their private parts alarmingly apparent .
Do they enjoy it ?
They never smile .
I 'm sure they just come here to wind me up .
Anyway , the other day Live sent me the new eco-friendly electric car .
Not a G - Wiz ( if they did that I 'd be off ) , but a Tesla Roadster , trumpeted as the world 's first battery - powered sports car .
It costs £ 90,000 , does 130 mph , but emits 89g / km less carbon than a Toyota Prius - ie , none at all .
So naturally , the first customers were tree - huggers Leonardo DiCaprio and George Clooney .
It 's very Californian , this car .
Company boss Elon Musk is a Silicon Valley multimillionaire , so that 's where they build them - but it 's actually based on Norfolk 's own Lotus Elise .
The Tesla Roadster 's steering wheel
Not much of the Elise has survived the transformation : they had to strengthen the chassis and add six inches to its length to accommodate both the battery ( actually 6,831 laptop batteries stuck together ) and the powerful temperature control , without which it would overheat - and refuse to work in cold weather .
Centre console with drive models and display screen showing tyre pressures
Where an Elise uses aluminium and glass fibre , this uses carbon fibre - and because it does n't need the scoops and vents the Elise uses to cool its engine and brakes , it 's got more aristocratic lines , almost like a grand tourer .
I have n't seen anything quite like it before .
The wheels look good , but the tyres are low - rolling - resistance to extend its range , which means a harder ride and less grip .
Thanks to that heavy pile of batteries , it handles a fair bit worse than an Elise , but it 's still sporty .
The T - top roof ( removable panels either side of a central strut ) is a godsend , as during my test drive the sun made one of its brief appearances and it only took seconds to chuck the bits in the boot next to the recharging plug .
Yes , it uses an everyday 13 - amp plug , charging up on just £ 3.50 of electricity - though you 'll need to fit a 62 - amp ' three phase ' socket in your garage if you want to reduce the charge time from 16 hours to less than four .
Inside there is n't a lot - two seats that are comfortable up to a point , a cup - holder , a stereo and air con - but then you do n't always expect luxuries in sports cars .
Ferrari ripped the carpets , stereo and padding out of its 430 , called it a special - edition ' Scuderia ' and charged £ 30,000 extra , so it 's quite commonplace .
I promise you , in the Tesla you do n't notice anything except the acceleration .
Sports - style bucket seats for driver and passenger
This could go head - to - head with any Ferrari , hitting 60 mph from a standing start in 3.9 seconds .
But what completely freaked me out was that it does it in complete silence .
At the speed limit , I could still hear the birds tweeting in the bushes .
Adding to the out - of - body experience , there 's absolutely no power lag : put your foot down and you instantly get the entire 380 Nm of thrust - all coming , unbelievably , from a motor the size of a cabbage with just two moving parts ( moving at up to 14,000rpm ) .
I had this car for six hours - partly because they needed to get it back to the showroom in Knightsbridge , but also because it only had enough juice in it for 120 miles , after which it needs to be recharged overnight .
You may think that 's a huge drawback for a sports car , and I agree .
I like to drive to the Essen Motor Show in Germany at this time of year .
In this , it would take two or three days - assuming you could find somewhere to plug it in ... and I 've just remembered the plugs are a different shape in Europe .
It 's a logistical nightmare .

Feinstein skeptical about health care costs HEALTH CARE

President Obama 's ultimatum in his health care reform speech to Congress this week was not to insist on a government - run insurance option that is dear to his party 's liberals .
His promise was to veto any bill that " adds one dime to the deficit - either now or in the future .
Period . "
His emphasis on an often - overlooked bottom line points to the chief constituency that Obama must win over to pass health legislation this year - moderate Senate Democrats , including California 's Dianne Feinstein .
Those moderates , and the independent voters whose allegiances tilt public support one way or the other , will determine if and what kind of health care overhaul reaches his desk .
After Obama 's address to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night , Feinstein remained skeptical about the wholesale overhauls to the nation 's health care system that Obama contemplates .
" I just find that if you 're going to remake a sixth of the American economy , it 's very difficult at this time of great economic angst , " Feinstein said in an interview with The Chronicle .
Public hospitals
Among her chief concerns are the hundreds of billions of dollars in savings that Obama promised would not come out of California 's public hospitals , which use federal funds to help provide care to the state 's poor , including an estimated 2 million illegal immigrants - 22 percent of the nation 's entire illegal population .
Many overhaul proposals call for cutting subsidies to public hospitals to care for the uninsured , assuming that everyone - except illegal immigrants - will get insurance .
Feinstein echoed the alarm of many governors , including California 's Arnold Schwarzenegger , that states can ill afford a large expansion of the Medicaid program for the poor to cover some of the uninsured .
States share Medicaid funding .
Like her red -state colleagues , Feinstein also worried about creating new automatic spending programs - known as entitlements - that would compound an already serious fiscal situation .
" There is real concern over debt and deficits , and whether this bill will create additional entitlements , " Feinstein said .
" That 's important to me and I think it 's important to them . "
The Democratic Party is now the " big tent " that Republicans once were , and recently elected senators from swing states such as Virginia and North Carolina , along with rural moderates from such states as North Dakota and Nebraska , provide the majority that Obama needs to get a health care bill through the Senate .
Unlike those conservatives , Feinstein is a coastal social liberal who supports the public insurance option that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of San Francisco and other liberals want .
Like Pelosi , she expressed support for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom 's burgeoning experiment with universal care , known as Healthy San Francisco .
She made a radical call for making the insurance industry a nonprofit , a goal she acknowledged is politically untenable .
She supports a mandate requiring individuals to carry insurance .
But she made clear she is not a guaranteed vote for Democrats .
Polls show gains
There is little doubt that Obama made gains with his speech .
Polls showed a double - digit bump in public support .
Democrats appear re-energized .
Pelosi indicated for the first time that she is open to compromise on the public option , a signal that liberal Democrats will fall in line .
" This is about a goal .
It 's not about provisions , " Pelosi said , echoing Obama 's lead .
But she also postponed any House vote until the Senate Finance Committee passes its long - delayed bill , an acknowledgement that it will be the template .
The goal Obama laid out - expanding care to 46 million Americans who lack insurance , while not adding to deficits , not just over the next decade , but after that - will be extremely difficult to achieve , experts said .
His $ 900 billion , 10 - year price tag averages $ 90 billion a year .
To put that in perspective , that 's 3.6 percent of the $ 2.5 trillion the nation spends each year - spending that is expected to total $ 35 trillion over the next decade .
Despite criticism from Republicans , Obama made a clear shift to the center Wednesday .
He embraced a tax on expensive " Cadillac " insurance plans , a step toward limiting the tax exclusion on health insurance that economists advise and unions oppose .
He proposed finding most of the money from savings in current programs , mainly Medicare and Medicaid .
Republicans for decades have called for slowing the growth of these giant programs for the elderly and poor , but now decry any such moves as cutting benefits - a charge Democrats once leveled against them .
Worries over cuts
Obama promised the savings would come from " reducing waste and inefficiency , " but that is more easily said than done .
States would share a costly expansion of Medicaid to cover near - poor families .
" If you put everybody on Medicaid at 133 percent of the federal poverty rate , the cost to the state is $ 2 billion , " Feinstein said .
" Where does the state get that money when it 's got a $ 15 billion shortfall next year and probably for many years after that ? "
Feinstein , who has outlined her positions on her Web site , embraces Obama 's call for tough new regulations on insurance companies , such as bans on coverage denials for pre-existing conditions and terminations of policies when people get sick .
But she is to Obama 's right when it comes to expanding coverage , preferring to do that through community health centers that could provide basic care .
She also supports an idea Republicans propose : tearing down restrictions on selling insurance across state lines , which would allow bigger risk pools that could lower premiums .
" I happen to think that 's a good idea , " Feinstein said .
GOG.com ( good old games ) turns one tomorrow and will celebrate by offering a free Interplay game for every Interplay game purchased .
In other words : buy one , get one free .
Speaking to Eurogamer , chief mouthpiece Lukasz Kukawski said the promotion runs until 7th September .
That means a trip down memory lane for games like Fallout 1 & 2 wo n't break the bank .
Those games , incidentally , are GOG 's best sellers .
GOG.com had also planned to give one lucky user the entire Interplay catalogue for free - a saving of around $ 100 - but there are " too many legal issues " to get this out on time .
GOG.com launched in beta form last September , counting support from only Interplay and Codemasters .
Today , there are over 140 games available to download , DRM - free .
GOG hopes to continue this " snowball effect " over next couple of months , and entice other publishers with " huge back catalogues " .
" Every announcement of new publisher joining GOG made other publishers think , ' We also have some back catalogue games , why not release it on GOG ? ' , " said Kukawski .
During September , GOG.com has " one or two new announcements " to make , and believes " the next couple of months should make fans of classic games really happy " .
" Our team was at gamescom and they came back tired but very happy , if you know what I mean !
Aside from that , our development and design team is working really hard on another update of the service itself that will bring many useful features and will improve the GOG.com experience , " he added .
" It looks like a really great autumn / winter for GOG fans ! "

On December 31 , three provisions of the USA PATRIOT
Act that broadly expanded government surveillance authority in the wake of 9/11 are set to expire .
The Obama Administration made clear in a letter this week to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy that although the Justice Department supports reauthorization of those provisions , it is also open to discussing modifications to the law “ to provide additional protection for the privacy of law abiding Americans . ”
Today , Senators Russ Feingold and Dick Durbin — along with eight other Senators — have taken the Administration up on its offer by introducing the JUSTICE Act , which would rein in the worst excesses of PATRIOT and last year ’s FISA Amendments Act ( FAA ) .
The announcement of the bill ’s introduction , along with a fact sheet outlining the bill 's details , is here ; the text of the JUSTICE
Act is here ( the “ JUSTICE ” , if you ’re wondering , stands for Judiciously Using Surveillance Tools In Counterterrorism Efforts ” ) .
The JUSTICE Act would renew two of the three expiring PATRIOT provisions , PATRIOT sections 206 ( John Doe roving wiretaps ) and 215 ( FISA orders for any tangible thing ) , but would also add strong new checks and balances to those provisions and to the PATRIOT
Act in general , especially those provisions dealing with the government ’s authority to issue National Security Letters .
If passed , the bill would also establish critically important protections for Americans against surveillance authorized under the FAA .
Of particular importance to EFF 's clients in the Hepting v. AT&T case and to the preservation of the rule of law , JUSTICE would completely repeal the FAA provision intended to legally immunize telecoms like AT&T that illegally assisted in the National Security Agency 's warrantless wiretapping program .
Last summer when Congress passed the FAA , Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid stated his intention to revisit that law as part of the PATRIOT renewal debate , and we 're very glad that Senators Feingold and Durbin have kick - started that process .
We 'll be blogging more about the JUSTICE Act and other PATRIOT - related proposals in anticipation of the Senate Judiciary Committee 's hearing next week on PATRIOT reauthorization , and we 'll alert you when the time is ripe for you to contact Congress through our Action Center and voice your support for PATRIOT reform .
In the meantime , EFF applauds Senators Feingold and Durbin , as well as cosponsoring Senators Akaka , Bingaman , Menendez , Merkley , Sanders , Tester , Udall , and Wyden , for their continuing hard work to protect Americans ' civil liberties .
EFF would prefer that none of the expiring PATRIOT provisions be renewed , but if they are , they absolutely must be accompanied by meaningful new checks and balances like those introduced today .
It 's time that JUSTICE was restored .
I ’ve installed the new Delphi from Embarcadero .
I want to enthuse about this product , as a long - time Delphi enthusiast , but a few things have dampened my zeal :
1 . The install on Windows 7 64 - bit was not totally smooth .
First Avira Antivir claimed that a file installed during setup , called convert.exe , contained a virus ( not the fashionable new one , something else called DR / Delphi .
Gen dropper ) .
I thought this was most likely a false positive .
I tested the file with with Kaspersky which declared it clean , and I ’ve emailed Avira about the problem .
I ’m not sure why I bother at all with running anti-virus software .
It is very little use .
After all , what is the point of having it , if when it claims to find something you ignore it ?
On the other hand , what is the chance that this is a real virus on Embarcadero ’s new CD , that Kaspersky does not detect ?
None of this is Embarcadero ’s fault , of course , unless it has shipped a virus , which I doubt .
2. Next , on running and quitting Delphi 2010 for the first time , the Windows Program Compatibility Assistant was triggered .
See this earlier post for what this guy looks like and what it does .
This one made the same change , ELEVATECREATEPROCESS .
A minor niggle perhaps , but it looks bad .
At this stage , the Delphi team should have come to terms with UAC and made RAD Studio properly UAC - aware .
I ’m guessing most of the team run with UAC disabled .
3. Another UAC issue .
When the IDE starts up , you get a message :
Error executing ‘C: \ProgramData\{BBD31133-40F8-4B57-9BA6-DB76C03D153B}\Setup.exe ’:
The parameter is incorrect
This does not occur if you run as administrator .
4 . I ran up the IDE and noticed there is a new documentation wiki with user contributions .
I think this is a great idea .
It seems to be built with mediawiki .
Unfortunately it failed with “ A database query syntax error has occurred ” .
Update : it ’s working now .
5 . I ’d understood that Delphi 2010 is somewhat Windows 7 ready .
It has great support for multi- touch and gestures .
That ’s fine , but I was interested to see how to support the Windows 7 Jump Lists .
A Jump List is the menu that pops up when you right - click a taskbar icon .
Well , if support for this is there I can’t find it .
There is support for the Windows 7 Direct 2D Canvas , and as I mentioned for multi-touch , but that ’s about all I can find .
It ’s a shame because only a few people will be using multi- touch in the near future , and Direct 2D is not a feature visible to users , but the new Windows 7 taskbar and its features – there ’s also the ability to add controls to taskbar preview windows – is the thing that every Windows 7 user will notice .
Of course you can easily call the Windows API from Delphi , and the community will figure out how to support these features before long ; there ’s already an alpha “ Windows 7 controls for Delphi ” that Daniel Wischnewski has come up with .
But I ’d like to have seen it in the box , and it would have been a nice selling point .
Do n’t let me put you off .
There are other new features – including Firebird support , integrated code formatter , better thread debugging - and no doubt the core of Delphi is as good as ever ( no 64 - bit yet , but it will come eventually ) .
Still , my impression is that Embarcadero still has to work a bit on that last degree of polish .
One final gripe : why is the discussion forum so darn slow ?
It has also been in beta forever .

Video footage has been released of a robot that can leap over obstacles more than 7.5 m ( 25 ft ) high .
Most of the time , the shoebox - sized robot - which is being developed for the US military - uses its four wheels to get around .
But the Precision Urban Hopper can use a piston - actuated " leg " to launch it over obstacles such as walls or fences .
The robot could boost the capabilities of troops and special forces engaged in urban warfare , say researchers .
The robot is shoebox sized and guided by GPS
The programme is being funded by Darpa , the US military 's research arm .
Earlier this year , Sandia National Laboratories awarded the contract to build the next generation of the hopper to Massachusetts - based robotics firm Boston Dynamics .
Researchers at Sandia have tried out the robot on a variety of different surfaces .
The semi-autonomous , GPS - guided gadget could be used for surveillance in urban environments .
Its developers say this could potentially reduce troop casualties .
Testing and delivery of the Precision Urban Hopper is planned for late 2010 .
( CNN ) --
Two Norwegian citizens were sentenced to death Tuesday in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for espionage , murder and attempted murder , Norway 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has confirmed to CNN .
Joshua French and Tjostolv Moland have been sentenced to death and have five days to appeal .
Asked about the sentence , Lambert Mende Omalanga , Congo 's minister of communications , told CNN , " We do n't have a habit of commenting on judicial decisions . "
However , Omalanga said , his country has not carried out the death penalty in 10 years .
He said lawmakers in parliament are in the process of trying to take the law off the books .
A military court in Kisangani found Tjostolv Moland , 28 , and Joshua French , 27 , guilty on all charges , Norwegian TV2 reported .
The court also ordered the pair to pay $ 60 million in damages .
The men have five days to appeal their sentence , the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs told CNN .
It was not clear why the men were in Congo .
" I have earlier made absolutely clear that these two have not been conducting business for Norway in any shape or form , " Norwegian Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr Store told Norwegian state television NRK after the verdict .
" We will now read through the sentence to see exactly how it is written , " Store added .
Norwegian authorities have been following the trial closely on television , and have tried to keep a balance between respecting the judicial system of a different country and helping Norwegian citizens in trouble , Store told NRK .
The two men were found guilty of spying for Norway and for killing a driver in May , according to NRK .
In an earlier statement on the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Web site , the ministry said that if the two Norwegians were to receive the death penalty , Norwegian authorities would immediately try to seek assurances from Congolese authorities that the death sentence would not be carried out .
" Norway has a very strong stand on the death penalty , and we are very much against it , " a Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman told CNN .
Images on NRK TV showed that after the sentence against the two men was read , applause broke out in the courtroom .

( CNN ) --
Four tropical cyclones , two major earthquakes with accompanying tsunamis , all occurring around the Western Pacific and Southern Asia within one day .
The goal for scientists is to provide warnings ahead of these deadly earthquakes .

So much activity in the same portion of the world , how unusual is something like this , and could they be related ?
According to CNN meteorologist and weather producer Brandon Miller , this is certainly not unprecedented as far as tropical systems go .
" September represents the peak of tropical activity around the world , and the Western Pacific sees more tropical cyclones each year than anywhere on the globe , so even having four systems active at the same time is not incredibly unusual , " he said .
Perhaps the more intriguing events are the two major earthquakes ; the 8.0 magnitude near Samoa Tuesday followed by the 7.6 magnitude in western Indonesia .
The epicenters of the two tremors are about 4,700 miles ( 7,600 km ) apart , but the U.S. Geological Survey has declined to say whether the two quakes were linked .
Miller said : " We only see between five and 10 earthquakes of this magnitude on average around the globe each year , so to see them in the same general region within 18 hours seems to be quite a coincidence . "
The earth is covered with a relatively thin set of tectonic plates that make up the outer shell of the planet -- known as the lithosphere .
The plates are all connected and constantly moving , creating pressure and tension along their boundaries .
Earthquakes occur when this tension reaches a critical maximum , and similar to a rubber band that has been stretched to its limits , it will snap .
" It seems to reason that a large earthquake in one location could provide the extra force needed in another nearby location , to stretch that rubber band to the breaking point , thus triggering another earthquake , " Miller said .
Another piece to the puzzle : Both of these earthquakes occurred along opposite ends of the same tectonic plate , the Australian plate .
The Australian plate borders the Pacific plate to the East ( the Samoan quake occurred along this boundary ) , while on the Western side , it borders the Eurasian plate ( where the Indonesia quake occurred ) .
Several of these plates surround the Pacific Ocean basin forming an arc of quake sites and active volcanoes known as the " Ring of Fire . "
This ring is actually a 40,000 km horseshoe shape , where most of the Earth 's active volcanoes above sea level and most of the world 's earthquakes are located .
So did the Samoan quake help to trigger the Indonesian quake ?
" While we can not say for sure , it does seem plausible , " said Miller .
" Scientists will certainly study these events and try to find any connection that could tie them together , with the ultimate goal of some day being able to provide warnings ahead of these deadly earthquakes . "
The biggest earthquake ever measured -- magnitude 9.5 -- occurred within the ring along the coast of Chile .
It created a tsunami that killed around 2,000 people before it radiated outwards , killing 61 people in Hawaii and 122 in Japan .
In December 2004 , an earthquake measuring at least 9.0 struck off the coast of the northern tip of Indonesia 's Sumatra island , triggering a major tsunami in the Indian Ocean that killed more than 200,000 people in 11 countries .
The impact on Indonesia , Thailand and Sri Lanka was particularly devastating .
The most famous volcanic eruption in recent history was Krakatoa , Indonesia in August 1883 .
It generated 40 - meter tsunamis that smashed into islands nearby , destroying hundreds of villages and killing tens of thousands of people .

MY HEALTH EXPERIENCE :
When John Maguire was diagnosed with cancer of the oesophagus , fear went through him ‘ like a cold steel scythe ’ .
But after radical surgery he has survived to tell the tale .
This is his story
I CAME home on Wednesday , August 12th , having spent three months in Cochin public hospital near my Paris apartment fighting oesophageal cancer .
As I write , I am in my final cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy , a bit harder than the pre-operative sessions but bearable .
My medical team is acting as if it is Christmas .
They consider that I ’m cured .
I am still reeling from the shock of all that I ’ve been through since I got the telephone call from my gastroenterologist during an office meeting on January 5th to tell me that my cancer biopsy was positive .
The fear went through me like a cold steel scythe .
I could n’t stop thinking about the Nuala O’Faolain interview on RTÉ .
I had been reading about cancer of the gullet on the internet .
Barrett ’s oesophagus , a pre-cancerous mucous cell condition , had been diagnosed in 2002 , caused , as it always is , by acid reflux or chronic heartburn .
The Barrett ’s and the French public health system saved me from certain death within four years had the cancer not been detected .
Although cancer does not necessarily develop from Barrett ’s , the condition increases the chances .
Of course , I thought it would never happen to me .
My GP insisted that I undergo an annual endoscopy , the “ stomach camera ” , under general anaesthetic .
The endoscopy in mid-December last year showed up the cancer which had likely been developing for six months .
Once the panic had subsided a bit , I contacted a friend who is a hospital specialist in Nice who gave me the name of a reputable Paris gastroenterologist .
That ’s how my cancer year began .
At first , my specialist was hopeful that the problem could be solved by a relatively non-invasive procedure , known as a mucosectomy , the removal of the top layer of cells in the lower gullet where it joins the stomach .
I woke up from a general anaesthetic on January 18th to be told that the procedure had not been possible .
The cancer cells had gone further than expected .
At work I put on a brave face , telling my colleagues at Radio France Internationale that everything had gone well .
My specialist told me that further tests were necessary as the cancer might have gone into my lungs .
This can happen quite early on as the oesophagus is parallel to the trachea , the windpipe .
In retrospect , eight months down the tracks , I think that the waiting period was the worst of all .
Never before had I been faced with absolute uncertainty while staring death at 53 years of age right in the face .
My cancer was finally “ staged ” on February 28th after weeks of tests .
The tumour was “ stage 1 in situ ” – the size of a one cent piece , had no apparent lymph - node and no organ spread .
My gastroenterologist was confident it could be operated on successfully .
I was to be one of the lucky 25 per cent who could undergo surgery .
Cancer is a wily enemy .
It reduces the victim to using cliché .
It keeps moving the goalposts .
It is the ultimate game of cat and mouse .
It took a medical team of 10 doctors , the most important being the gastroenterologist , the oncologist , the surgeon and the radiologist , to reach a final staging .
They could n’t agree among themselves whether or not to operate immediately or to subject me to pre-operative chemotherapy .
There was some doubt about the status of a single lymph node which still did n’t change the early “ stage 1 ” status of the tumour .
True to form , I made up their minds for them by asking the team ’s doubting Thomas who wanted to operate on March 9th which way he would swing if it were he who had cancer .
He replied he would do it .
So I started EOX three - drug chemotherapy a week later .
I feel that it is so necessary to demystify cancer and chemotherapy .
One in three of us get cancer .
The majority survive .
Here ’s another cliché .
There ’s nothing worse than the fear of the unknown .
My anticipation of every stage of the cancer treatment was far worse than the actual , concrete experience .
I had heard so many horror stories about chemo .
It ’s true that people react differently and that it is often far from pleasant .
But if it ’s necessary , is there a choice ?
I was relatively lucky during the first nine - week period of three - week cycles of chemotherapy .
The three - weekly infusions were made easier by the insertion of a subcutaneous catheter near my right collar bone .
The current sessions are complicated by my trying to get used to my new digestive system , eating little and often .
It ’s funny but everybody I know who has battled with cancer worries about losing their hair .
I did n’t , not that it would have mattered much anyway given my zero haircut .
Nausea and vomiting were controlled by medication .
But I did get severe neuropathy .
Anti-cancer drugs prevent fast cell reproduction , mainly in the skin ( hence the hair - loss ) , the mucosa of the digestive tract ( hence the chronic sea- sickness ) and the nerves ( neuropathy ) .
I had the N - word .
I had to wear gloves against the cold and especially when handling anything from the fridge .
Another cliché , you get used to anything , especially taking daily doses of chemotherapy tablets .
All the members of my medical team are nothing short of wonderful , for their technical skills , for their honesty and compassion .
I never once felt I was a number , which was all - important since the statistics about survival of oesophageal cancer are chilling to say the least .
I had all of their mobile phone numbers and I used them , albeit respectfully and sparingly .
When I went for one of my chemo infusions , there was a public health service strike against cuts proposed by the government of French president Nicolas Sarkozy .
I felt so angry that such a vital , excellent service , reputedly the world ’s best , could be in danger .
My surgeon had briefed me about the likely outcome of the Ivor - Lewis surgical procedure .
I was to be opened first from sternum to navel , to release my stomach and oesophagus from their moorings .
After that wound was sown up , I was to be turned on to my left side , the right side of my back cut open , my right ribcage prised apart , my right lung deflated , and my stomach remodelled to replace the diseased oesophagus .
Okay , I said , let ’s do it .
The 10 - hour operation took place on May 27th .
It was deemed a success , and 10 days later I was removed from the intensive care unit to an ordinary ward .
That ’s when the real trouble began .
The surgeon had warned me that having been a cigarette smoker for 30 years until 2004 , I had a 100 per cent chance of some form of lung infection after the operation .
Had seven years gone by since stopping , my lungs would have been clear .
Little did we know that I would almost die from a massive lung infection during the second week of June .
When I came through that ordeal , a leak was discovered in the newly remodelled stomach which necessitated the insertion of a plastic stent to hold the wound together .
A word about pain : the pain - control was total and I suffered very little and the news that my cancer had been stopped in its tracks kept me buoyed up .
My carers suffered far more .
One of my ex-partners fainted when he came into the ICU to see me tied up to 13 tubes and out of my head from an epidural of morphine .
One of my closest friends was deeply upset as she witnessed my descent towards near death in June .
My partner came in to see me every day despite having to hold down a demanding job .
The stress on my loved ones , friends and family was immeasurable throughout .
I am eternally grateful to each and every one of them who stood by me lovingly and faithfully through this life - changing ordeal .
The major change is that I do n’t feel much fear anymore no matter what happens next .
Been there , done that .
I obviously have no time whatsoever for the public health service bashers in France .
I got A1 treatment from top - level professionals .
Agreed , healthcare is expensive .
I amateurishly worked out that my three months in hospital probably cost at a rough estimate in the region of € 70,000 all told .
I have been paying hefty income tax in France for 24 years , to the current tune of over a € 1,000 a month , not to count the other taxes I pay .
Work it out for yourselves .
I have 100 per cent public insurance coverage of all my medical expenses until 2014 , should I ever need it .
And I get full pay at work topped up by the social security system for a total of three years , again should I need it .
The begrudgers can go to hell , because I do n’t intend to , not yet at any rate .

Cancer of the oesophagus : what you need to know
Cancers arising at the junction of the oesophagus and stomach are increasing at a rapid rate in the West .
Ireland has one of the highest rates of oesophageal cancer in the world and incidence of the disease among women is increasing faster here than in many other European countries .
Oesophageal cancer is the ninth most common cancer in the UK .
Obesity , smoking and drinking alcohol to excess all increase the risk of developing this cancer .
Another health problem which is believed to be a contributory factor is acid reflux .
This is where food and stomach juices pass into the oesophagus from the stomach .
Undiscovered , oesophageal cancer quickly spreads to the stomach , lungs and liver , as well as nearby parts of the body ’s lymphatic system called lymph nodes .
It is one of the most difficult cancers to treat .
The overall outlook is very poor .
The five - year survival rate for cancer of the oesophagus is less than 10 per cent .
Survival rates are higher in younger patients who are fit enough for intensive treatment based on surgery , with cure rates of 20 per cent or more .

CHEEKY television show The Family Guy has stirred up a new controversy , this time getting itself banned from an entire country .
Government authorities in Venezuela are enforcing a boycott of the show after an episode that promoted the use of marijuana , the Associated Press reports .
Television stations have been threatened with fines if they do n't stop airing the show .
Earlier this week the show caused outrage at the Emmy Awards thanks to a violent clip showing one of the characters , Stewie Griffin , bashing Brian the family dog and flushing his head down the toilet .
" Originally I would have said this show was tired and boring .
Definitely not entertaining , " said one reader on a New York Times blog .
" After just watching what was supposed to be a funny cartoon clip with Family Guy 's Stewie beating the dog into a bloody pulp , I can now call it disgusting . "
Family Guy sketch ' disgusts '
Emmy viewers
The controversy in Venezuela was sparked by an episode in which the Griffin family campaigned to legalise marijuana .
The politically - incorrect animated show has been nominated for 11 Emmy Awards and has won three .
Originally published as Family Guy smoked out of Venezuela
People with autism are known to lack the ability to automatically attribute mental states to self and others also known as “ mindblindness ” .
A result of this impairment is failure on verbally instructed false - belief tasks .
However , people with Asperger syndrome , a milder form of autism , seem to pass with flying colors .
This presents a problem for the “ mindblindness ” theory .
So do people with Asperger syndrome really have a theory of mind ( ToM ) contrary to popular theory ?
Senju , Southgate , White , and Frith decided to take it upon themselves to sort out this confusion .
Instead of using verbal instructions , they had adults with Asperger syndrome perform an eye - tracking task that measured the spontaneous ability to mentalize .
This entailed subjects to view a scene of an actor first placing a ball into one of two boxes , then having a puppet move the ball to the alternative box unbeknownst to the distracted actor , thus causing a false belief in the actor about the location of the ball .
Results showed that the Asperger group showed significantly less looking bias toward the correct window compared to a control group indicating the Asperger group ’s inability to spontaneously anticipate others ’ actions in a nonverbal task .
It seems that to a certain extent they do lack a ToM .
But then how are they able to pass the verbally instructed false - belief task ?
The authors suggest that because they are higher functioning compensatory learning is involved .

Ms Wang said she spent a long time looking for her new dog
Tibetan Mastiffs have joined the roster of luxury items coveted by China 's wealthy elite , according to a purchase reported by local media .
A young woman paid $ 600,000 ( £ 360,000 ) for a Tibetan Mastiff and had a convoy of luxury cars meet her and the dog at an airport , the Xian Evening News said .
" Gold has a price but this Tibetan Mastiff does n't , " the woman , named only as Wang , was quoted as saying .
The dogs typically sell for about $ 2,000 outside China , breeders say .
Ms Wang and the dog were met at Xian airport after she returned from buying it in Qinghai province in north - west China , home to many ethnic Tibetans .
She was greeted by fellow lovers of Tibetan Mastiffs , who held up a long red banner welcoming the dog to Xian , capital of Shaanxi province .
Ms Wang said she and a friend had spent a long time looking for a true Tibetan Mastiff .
The dogs are fairly rare in Tibet and around the world , and are valued by the nomadic peoples of Central Asia for their skills as watch dogs .
Tibetan Mastiffs were also traditionally used to guard Buddhist monasteries in Tibet .
The dogs are large and fierce , reaching a height of up to 80 cm ( 31 inches ) and a weight of 80kg ( 176 lbs ) .
Richard Gardiner , chairman of the Tibetan Mastiff Club of Great Britain , said mastiff puppies typically sell in the West for between $ 1,400 and $ 2,000 .
A DRUNK amateur pilot had to be guided to land by a rescue helicopter after he radioed the control tower of his airfield to ask : '' Where the bloody hell have you hidden yourself ? ''
The 65 - year - old drank a large quantity of beer and wine before flying over the central German state of Thuringia in his Cessna light aircraft on Saturday .
Once airborne , he continued to drink while at the controls .
Two hours later he was happy but alcoholically challenged - so much so he was unable to read the instruments telling him where the Schoengleida airfield was .
'' Come on , I know you 're down there , '' he radioed .
'' Where the bloody hell have you hidden yourself ? ''
Control tower staff say he also sang a few songs , cracked a mother - in - law joke and told them to '' pull their fingers out as I 've got a party to go to ' ' .
The US FCC , headed by new chairman Julius Genachowski , wants to apply the same net neutrality rules to mobile networks as wireline systems , to the fury of the cellcos .
In the most radical neutrality program ever outlined in the US , the new - look FCC is insisting that wireless carriers should account for their open policies in the same way as their wired broadband counterparts .
The proposed policy outlined this week would allow the FCC to monitor cellcos ’ policies and rule on how well they conform to guidelines on neutrality .
Genachowski also plans to toughen up the rules for the big phone companies such as Verizon and AT&T .
He has reaffirmed the 2005 broadband principles that consumers are entitled to access any legal internet content , and run any apps , from their choice of legal device , and with the right to competition among operators and providers of services , content and applications .
These principles will now be formalized by the FCC and extended to mobile broadband .
Genachowski has also added two extra principles .
Access providers will be barred from discriminating against particular internet content or apps , and they must be transparent about the network management practices they adopt .
" The rulemaking process will enable the Commission to analyze fully the implications of the principles for mobile network architectures and practices , and how , as a practical matter , they can be fairly and appropriately implemented , " Genachowski said in a statement .
However , the plan is short on implementation details , so far at least , and there is sure to be long - winded debate over the fine print , and even legal challenges .
" I will propose that the FCC evaluate alleged violations of the non-discrimination principle as they arise , on a case - by - case basis , recognizing that the internet is an extraordinarily complex and dynamic system . ”
The CTIA , which represents wireless carriers , is reiterating its line that competition is sufficient to regulate the internet world , while cellcos are predictably trotting out the argument that unfettered internet access could overburden their wireless networks .
" As we have said before , we are concerned about the unintended consequences Internet regulation would have on consumers considering that competition within the industry has spurred innovation , investment and growth for the US economy , " said Chris Guttman - McCabe , VP of regulatory affairs for CTIA , in response to Genachowski ’s speech .
He continued : " How do the rules apply to the single purpose Amazon Kindle ?
How does it apply to Google 's efforts to cache content to provide a better consumer experience ?
How about the efforts from Apple and Android , Blackberry and Nokia , Firefly and others to differentiate the products and services they develop for consumers ?
Should all product and service offerings be the same ? "
AT&T and Verizon have both accepted neutrality and open access ( sometimes reluctantly ) on their wireline networks , but still argue that wireless is a special case because of spectrum limitations .
Jim Cicconi , AT&T 's senior VP of external and legislative affairs , said in a statement : " We are concerned , however , that the FCC appears ready to extend the entire array of net neutrality requirements to what is perhaps the most competitive consumer market in America : wireless services . ”

Jonathan Zasloff 's defense of using budget reconciliation for health care ?
First , Ezra 's assertion that the reconciliation rules ban health care reform is at best unproven and contrary to the plain language of the law .
Those rules bar putting things in a reconciliation bill that have only an " incidental " effect on the budget .
But , say , prohibiting discrimination against pre-existing conditions would have more than an incidental effect .
Such a move , for example , could save billions from Medicaid , because it would allow people to get insurance in the private market who might otherwise have to go to Medicaid .
As far as I know , Medicaid eligibility is generally restricted to those who are pretty low income .
And the waiver - program premia are usually lower than any private entity would charge , even in Europe .
With community rating , the prices of private insurance will go up even further .
What the heck is Zasloff talking about ?
How many people does he really think are quiting their jobs and deliberately impoverishing themselves in order to qualify for Medicaid , rather than earning an income which can support the $ 350 or so per person that gets charged for an HMO in a community - rated state like New York with generous mandatory benefits ?
I 'm sure that there are enough for an enterprising New York Times reporter to write a trend piece , but enough to make a noticeable dent in the budget ?
The best ways to get Medicaid are to go on welfare , or disability .
Both of which imply insufficient income to buy insurance .
Or substantial fraud .
New research into a meteorite that crashed into northern British Columbia nine years ago is revealing startling clues that could help unravel the origins of life on Earth .
Parts of the Tagish Lake meteorite were found on a frozen lake near the Yukon border in January , 2000 , after it fell to Earth in a spectacular blue - green fireball that was seen for hundreds of kilometres .
Researchers recovered parts of the still - frozen meteorite after an extensive search .
Since then , scientists have repeatedly tried to unlock the clues that the rare 4.5 billion - year - old carbon and water rich meteorite has long been suspected to contain .
Now , a team at the University of Alberta has found some important material nestled inside the rock , formic acid — the key ingredient in bee stings , ant venom and stinging nettles .
U of A scientist Chris Herd says similar molecules on much , much earlier meteorites may have been instrumental in kick - starting life on Earth , making the meteorite the most important rock ever found on Earth .
" Four billion years ago , when the Earth had kind of cooled off from its initial hot state , and there was liquid water on the surface , we may have had an influx of meteorites like Tagish Lake [ that ] delivered the right mix of molecules to the Earth 's surface , " he said .
How exactly that mix might have turned into actual life is still a mystery , but Herd said the findings of formic acid on the meteorite may provide important clues .
" It 's a type of molecule known as a carboxylic acid .
So it 's sort of like the shortest , smallest molecule in that group .
The longer molecules in this same group are actually what life uses in building cell walls . "
In 2001 , U.S. exobiologist Sandra Pizzarello , who was studying some of the fragments from the Tagish meteorite at Arizona State University , said they contained almost no amino acids but did contain high concentrations of hydrocarbon molecules , along with a type of clay that forms in the presence of water .
In 2006 , Mike Zolensky , a cosmic mineralogist at the NASA Space Centre in Texas , said tiny bubbles in the rock were organic globules where the universe 's earliest life forms could have been able to live .
Christians urged to mentor consumerist generation of believers
They were responding to the results of a survey of young Christians which were unveiled during the Evangelical Alliance council symposium on mission among 18 to 30 - year - olds , the so - called ‘ missing generation ’ .
The survey of 800 young Christians at a Soul Survivor conference found that most were drawn to a church that could provide resources to help them in their own personal faith , followed by one which provided excellent worship or was a place where they could relate to the people .
The characteristics least likely to attract them to a church were being mission - orientated or a safe place to invite friends .
Addressing the council , Soul Survivor ’s Mike Pilavachi said that a culture of consumerism , individualism and entitlement had “ eaten into the psyche of 20 - somethings ” .
“ What that mitigates against completely is commitment to community , ” he said .
Pilavachi added that 20 - somethings were caught in a futile search for perfection , were afraid of going into the real world and showed a great deal of pain in ministry times .
“ We ’ve got to help them , ” he said .
“ We ’ve got to love them , we ’ve got to listen to them , but also we ’ve got to find ways of gently , lovingly but definitely challenging some of the things that come from a culture of consumerism , individualism and entitlement . ”
Gavin Calver , of Youth for Christ , and Tim Rudge , of UCCF , told the symposium that the church had a responsibility to mentor and invest in young people as they made the transition from childhood to adulthood .
The symposium also heard from Jason Lane , of Innovista , who said that young Christians often felt like they had to choose between “ a church that ’s for me ” and a “ church that ’s about mission ” .
“ For them , it ’s actually a choice between surviving as a Christian or not , ” he said .
“ We need to give them both , where church can support you as a Christian and helping you live for Jesus , which involves and includes mission . ”
The symposium brought together around 100 people , including leaders of other youth ministries like Fusion , Ignite and The Message Trust .
The leaders also spoke of the role that the Evangelical Alliance had to play in helping churches to reach 18 to 30 - year - olds .
General Director of the Evangelical Alliance Steve Clifford said the findings were a “ wake - up call ” to the church .
“ As an alliance , we are committed to provoking conversation and all of us , across all ages , are ready to respond to this challenge , ” he said .
The Evangelical Alliance plans to prepare a report on the discussions from the symposium and make recommendations for further action .
One of the most obvious refinements to earbuds has been the minimization , if not outright elimination , of wires — a good thing even if your phone still has a headset jack .
Using Bluetooth , today ’s top earbuds might have , at most , a wire that connects the two buds to each other — this can be a nice option if you ’re prone to misplacing small objects , or you want in - line controls .
A wired pair of Bluetooth earbuds is sometimes a more affordable option too , although that ’s less so now than it was in the early days of “ true wireless ” options .
True wireless earbuds are just that , free of any wire whatsoever .
Think of Apple ’s AirPods as the standard bearer of this category .
There are also plenty of AirPod alternatives — some more worthy than others .

Joe Biden has just returned from a visit to the Middle East US Vice - President Joe Biden has hinted the administration will not restrain Israel if it decides on military action to remove any Iranian nuclear threat .
Mr Biden told ABC television the US could not " dictate to another sovereign nation what they can and cannot do " .
Mr Biden also said President Obama 's offer of dialogue with Iran remained on the table .
A senior Iranian official said his country would respond decisively to any attack by Israel on its facilities .
Mr Obama has given Iran until the end of the year to talk about its nuclear programme , which Iran insists is for energy purposes only .
Western countries are concerned Tehran is working to acquire a nuclear weapons capability .
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has indicated Israel would take matters into its own hands if Iran did not show a willingness to negotiate .
' No hypotheticals ' Appearing on ABC 's current affairs programme This Week , host George Stephanopoulos asked Mr Biden whether the Israeli position was the right approach .
The vice - president replied : " Israel can determine for itself - it 's a sovereign nation - what 's in their interest and what they decide to do relative to Iran and anyone else . "
He added that this was the case , " whether we agree or not " with the Israeli view .
Asked whether the US would stand in the way if the Israelis decided to launch a military attack against Iranian nuclear facilities , Mr Biden said Israel , like the US , had a right to " determine what is in its interests " .
White House spokesman Tommy Vietor said Mr Biden was not signalling any change of approach on Iran or Israel .
" The vice - president refused to engage [ in ] hypotheticals , and he made clear that our policy has not changed , " he was quoted as saying by the Associated Press news agency .
' Full - scale ' response Alaeddin Boroujerdi , chairman of the Iranian parliament 's national security and foreign policy commission , responded to Mr Biden 's remarks while on a visit to Tokyo .
Iran would respond " in a very full - scale and very decisive way " to an Israeli attack , he said .
" I think that America and Israel are fully aware what kind of result such a wrong judgement will entail , " he said in remarks quoted by AFP news agency .
" Israel showed its military power sufficiently in the 22 - day war [ in Gaza ] .
That kind of erroneous judgement poses a threat to the entire Middle Eastern region and the world . "

Bear McCreary : Coming Back To Earth
For the last five years Bear McCreary has been in space .
Deep space .
As the man responsible for scoring one of the most acclaimed television series in many years ( yes , the new Battlestar Galactica ) , and one of the most heralded sci - fi shows ever , his expansive , cinematic work has been heard by millions of fans worldwide .
Even more impressive , though , is their adoration and devotion to him .
Most composers are heard not seen , but his followers know exactly what he looks like .
They avidly read his blog , interface with him and recently fêted him at Comic - Con and the Southern California concerts where he and the Battlestar Galactica Orchestra played the show ’s music live to enraptured audiences .
As all BSG fans know , the epic series wrapped up on Earth , and while he is going back to the stars for the new Battlestar spin - off Caprica , McCreary will be more grounded on that planet .
His other new television work will keep him planted on Earth , much like his recent Sarah Connor Chronicles gig .
Between the new NBC medical procedural Trauma and the Fox action adventure Human Target , plus a possible return for the fourth season of Syfy ’s wacky inventor show Eureka , McCreary will be exploring more terrestial adventures , although they will be as equally fantastic as the interstellar ones he has been used to scoring .
And given his work in the Rest Stop and Wrong Turn franchises , who knows what other horror film work may come his way as well .
When he had a moment to catch his breath from all of his frenzied activity , McCreary sat down to answer some questions for A.D.D .
As with past interviews I have done with him ( for Mix Magazine and for Grammy.com ) , Bear proved to be ever thoughtful and engaging .
The music for Caprica is more subdued and airy than much of your Battlestar Galactica work .
What have been the new challenges presented to you with this show , both in maintaining sonic continuity with its parent series and branching out in new directions ?
I ca n’t say it ’s been a challenge as much as a release .
Caprica is much more restrained , lyrical and classical .
I have stripped away much of the tribal , primitive and divine elements from the Galactica score , and used more chamber orchestra and [ classical ] woodwinds than I ever did on BSG .
After all , the events of this series take place in an entirely different environment .
Caprica
City is a familiar society at its most decadent and opulent peak , hardly a rag - tag fleet of refugees struggling for resources .
The audience knows that doomsday looms on the horizon for the citizens of Caprica City , but the characters themselves do not .
However , there are subtle hints of the ethnic percussion and soloists that defined Galactica .
I hope the result is a score that stands on its own , but resonates even more deeply with Battlestar fans who catch all the references .
One scene , in particular , features the sole melodic connection to BSG , and it ’s a real tearjerker .
What was it like to be mobbed fans at Comic - Con and to be treated like a rock star ?
It was pretty surreal .
I could n’t take ten steps in San Diego that week without being asked to sign photos or have my picture taken .
Then to be up there on stage with the screaming audience out there , and being able to make music with them …
It was an experience I ’ll never forget .
How did it feel to perform your music with the Battlestar Galactica Orchestra live in front of a large audience ?
It was interesting , especially because it was n’t really a symphony orchestra .
It was more like a huge rock band .
It was hot , sweaty , loud and out of control .
The audience lost their voices from screaming so hard .
That does n’t happen at the symphony !
And yet , despite all that , when I turned to the concert grand to play my introspective classical - inspired compositions , the audience silenced and soaked in every note .
When the piano pieces ended , they burst back into screaming applause .
I ’ve never seen an audience so into the music .
And one of the other highlights of our concerts in San Diego last month was having about half the cast show up on stage .
We had our official MCs , Edward James Olmos and Grace Park , but were also joined by executive producer David Eick , director Michael Nankin and actors Michael Hogan , James Callis , Tahmoh Penikett , Richard Hatch , Michael Trucco , Michelle Forbes and Nicki Clyne .
They had all turned up to see the concert and support the musicians .
What was it like to play a piano duet with Katee Sackhoff ?
How accomplished of a musician is she ?
She ’s the first to admit that she has n’t taken any piano lessons in a long time .
However , she is a very musical person , and quite a good singer , although we did n’t get her singing at all this time .
Her musical instincts are spot on , and it was a lot of fun to have her join the band .
Beyond Edward James
Olmos , who seems to adore you , do you have other well - known Hollywood fans ?
Sure , I have lots of well - known friends .
The BSG family seems pretty close knit .
Do you think you will all stay in touch ?
Absolutely , we will all stay in touch .
We try to get together as often as possible .
And the transition to post -BSG life was made a little easier because Galactica cast and crew are involved in nearly every project I ’m working on .
The Human Target pilot featured Tricia Helfer and Donnelly Rhodes , Trauma is directed by [ Caprica producer ]
Jeff Reiner , and of course Caprica itself is written , produced and directed by many of the same people [ from BSG ] .
So , I still get to work with some of them on a regular basis , which helps .
What are you going to miss most about scoring Battlestar ?
Ironically , the thing I will miss the most is also the thing I ’m most glad to have escaped : the familiarity and comfort .
The BSG themes had become second nature to me .
I ’d been living with them for five years , and the musical universe had become a safe place for me .
I could look at a scene , and instantly know which character themes I ’d want to use and how they were going to be set .
I will miss that level of comfort , however , I ’m also thankful that I ’m moving on to other projects that will push me into new creative directions .
Will you be doing any more work on Eureka ?
We just got the pick up for Season 4 , and I have not yet been asked to return , which is totally normal .
Usually the composer ’s contract is the last to be renewed .
I ’m certainly hopeful that I ’ll get to come back and keep scoring .
It ’s an incredibly fun series .
Were you disappointed when The Sarah Connor Chronicles was canceled ?
It was an intensely satisfying show to work on , and I ’m very disappointed that I can no longer look forward to watching the adventures of John , Sarah , Cameron ( or Allison ? ) and Derek ( or other Derek ? ) .
The series ’ cliffhanger really mixed things up , and [ producer / writer ] Josh Friedman had already told me some of the planned events for Season 3 .
It would have been awesome .
As for my music , its hard to say where it would have gone , but my guess is that it would have become even darker and more sinister in Season 3 .
I would have loved to move forward with the series , but I ’m very proud of the work we all did in our season and a half .
The soundtrack CD we put out is also really solid , and I think rivals the BSG discs , but with a completely different tonality .
You are working on the forthcoming NBC series Trauma , which is like ER in the field .
What has it been like to shift from a major cable show to a major network show where audience numbers and expectations run higher ?
Terminator was really my first big network show , so I ’m used to the deadlines , expectations and pressure .
Honestly , they ’re no different than on Syfy Channel shows , just on a larger scale .
However , studio interference can be a major creativity - killer .
Thankfully , the executives and producers involved in Trauma have an enormous amount of faith in me and are giving me incredible creative freedom to create the sound of this show .
So far , I ’m really enjoying it and not experiencing any additional stresses .
What are you learning working on Trauma ?
How does it compare with your other new network series Human Target ?
The two series are apples and oranges .
Trauma is written for a sweaty and dirty rhythm section and has a very rock and roll sensibility .
Human Target , on the other hand , is an orchestral series , and bursts out of the gate with the kind of polished and bombastic orchestral score that people generally do n’t associate with my name .
How did scoring the video game Dark Void differ from your film and television work ?
At first , it was very different .
I had trouble wrapping my brain around the idea of adaptive music .
However , once I got past that initial creative block , I found the experience incredibly liberating .
I let my imagination run absolutely wild , and I think it shows in the score .
It ’s the most fun I ’ve ever had writing music since I was in high school .
With any luck , the soundtrack album will be that much fun to listen to .
You have worked with recording engineer , mixer and musician Steve Kaplan since day one .
How is your relationship evolving lately ?
Working with Steve has been one of the great joys of being in the business .
He ’s a remarkable artist and technician who helps shape my music and gives it a unique sound .
Our working relationship is constantly evolving as I take on more and more projects and we both have to find a way to get everything done .
Your blog has attracted many avid readers .
Are you surprised by its popularity ?
Honestly yes , I am quite surprised .
I thought that the audience for a musically detailed TV scoring blog would be quite small .
The more technical I get about the nuts and bolts of my job , the more people seem to flock to the blog .
And its had a positive impact on how I write music , because I start thinking about what all the fans will think when they hear it .
I hope to continue blogging even though BSG is over .
When he ’s not composing or performing , what does Bear McCreary like to do with his time ?
In all seriousness , I can say very safely that there has not been a time since 2003 that I have not been composing or performing .
It ’s been a busy few years .
However , when I can steal a few minutes here and there , I like to catch movies or play video games .
What is one of the video games you ’ve recently played ?
Any genre preferences ?
It took me about a year to finally get around to playing Grand Theft Auto IV , and it ’s pretty amazing .
I ’ve completed the story line and I still ca n’t put it down , so now I ’m going back and finishing all the little sub-missions .
Very addictive .
What are some goals that you ’d like to achieve in the future ?
I ’d like to take a week off .
I ’d also love to take the Battlestar Galactica Orchestra on tour to multiple cities .
We just set up our website and are generating fan support for just such a venture .
What do you think your fans would be surprised to learn about you ?
I must confess that my blog is pretty brutally honest .
There ’s nothing too interesting about me that fans do n’t already know , or ca n’t find out by looking at my blog .
But I ’ll think of something for you …
How ’s this ?
My fans do n’t know that when I was a kid the only music I liked to play on the piano was ragtime .
I devoured works by Scott Joplin , Jelly Roll Morton and George Gershwin .
I ’m not sure how I ended up from there to orchestra and taiko drums .
Policies that set the pay for tens of thousands of bank employees nationwide would require approval from the Federal Reserve as part of a far - reaching proposal to rein in risk - taking at financial institutions .
The Fed 's plan would , for the first time , inject government regulators deep into compensation decisions traditionally reserved for the banks ' corporate boards and executives .

Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 11/9/2009 ( 4036 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Opinion
A tall teenager walked into a Pembina Highway Starbucks last week and told what sounded like an even taller tale .
The university freshman , who is 6 - 7 , was asked a simple question by the young woman barista who took his order for a pumpkin - spice latte .
" How are you ? "
" Well , " he shrugged , " I 'm alive . "
" Why are you just alive ? " the barista asked .
So he told her .
" I just got a $ 17,000 phone bill . "
Actually , the precise amount on the Rogers bill -- $ 17,913.14 -- was closer to $ 18,000 .
And the full amount was due on Sept. 20 , which , just to upsize the pain , happens to be his 18th birthday .
Coincidentally , the conversation between the shocked barista and the traumatized customer was overheard by broadcaster / writer Leslie Hughes who -- knowing a good story when she heard one -- asked for the young man 's name and phone number .
And then emailed it to me .
Which is how I managed to reach Miguel Yetman on Thursday , the day after he paid the University of Manitoba $ 1,600 in tuition .
He did that with the $ 1,800 he had made selling the saxophone he played at Vincent Massey Collegiate .
Naturally , I wanted to know how Miguel -- who 's taking science and math courses -- could have miscalculated his iPhone usage so disastrously .
He said it happened in July , while he was out of the country on vacation .
He and a friend spent two weeks in New York City , checking out jazz bars , but judging by the bill he got in August , most of the damage was done while he was visiting his mother 's family in Trinidad .
Hollette Valverde - Yetman is a single mother of four who works at St. Amant Centre .
The contract with Rogers -- which is a four - phone family package -- is in Hollette 's name .
Which means if the bill is n't paid , it 's her credit rating that takes the big hit .
Anyway , by the time I reached Miguel , Rogers had relented somewhat on the bill .
Instead of having to pay nearly $ 18,000 , Rogers had reduced it to $ 6,000 .
That 's still money the family does n't have .
The reason for the phone fiasco is that the Yetmans did n't understand -- did n't educate themselves -- on the realties of travelling and " roaming " internationally .
Miguel said most of what he used his iPhone for in Trinidad was related to the Internet -- selling his sax on eBay , briefly checking Facebook -- and text - messaging .
In fact , the total usage on the $ 17,913.14 bill came out to 452 megabytes , Miguel said , which would n't even be close to going over his plan if he was using his iPhone in Winnipeg .
It was only when his younger teenage sisters arrived in Trinidad " and began texting like fiends , " that Miguel said something " clicked " about using his phone internationally .
That and recalling a recent story he'd been following about Adam Savage , the co-host of the TV show MythBusters .
Savage is no dummy but , on a trip to Canada in late June , had rung up an $ 11,000 cellphone bill for " maybe two or three hours " of web surfing .
An outraged Savage turned to Twittering his story , rallying tens of thousands of supporters in the process .
AT&T , Savage 's cell coverage provider , quickly cancelled the charges .
A week into his two - week trip to Trinidad , Miguel decided to stop using his iPhone .
But most of the damage had already been done during that first week in Trinidad .
The total bill -- all $ 17,000 - plus of it -- even shocked the Rogers rep who looked it up when Miguel returned to Winnipeg in August .
Miguel -- and the bill his mother was responsible for -- was directed to what he called " a high - usage investigation unit " at Rogers , where his bill was ultimately adjusted to $ 6,000 .
Again , money the family does n't have .
And the first $ 2,000 instalment was due Friday .
" ö " ö " ö
Friday afternoon , I called Vancouver and explained Miguel 's and his mother 's situation to Sara Holland , the communications manager , western region for Rogers Communications .
She sounded sympathetic .
But she also had an important message for cellphone users who travel internationally .
" It 's really important that people educate themselves about roaming before they travel with their phones , " she said .
" The information is on our website and they can call us if they have questions .
We also have special roaming packages .
That information is also on our website . "
Since I do n't text , I picked up my phone later Friday and called Miguel with a message .
It was from Sara Holland .
" Rogers is working with the Yetmans on a solution . "
By that time , Miguel had already received a call .
Do n't you love happy endings ?

INGLEWOOD , Calif . 
They came for new teeth mostly , but also for blood pressure checks , mammograms , immunizations and acupuncture for pain .
Neighboring South Los Angeles is a place where health care is scarce , and so when it was offered nearby , word got around .
For the second day in a row , thousands of people lined up on Wednesday  starting after midnight and snaking into the early hours  for free dental , medical and vision services , courtesy of a nonprofit group that more typically provides mobile health care for the rural poor .
Like a giant MASH unit , the floor of the Forum , the arena where Madonna once played four sold - out shows , housed aisle upon aisle of dental chairs , where drilling , cleaning and extracting took place in the open .
A few cushions were duct - taped to a folding table in a coat closet , an examining room where Dr. Eugene Taw , a volunteer , saw patients .
When Remote Area Medical , the Tennessee - based organization running the event , decided to try its hand at large urban medical services , its principals thought Los Angeles would be a good place to start .
But they were far from prepared for the outpouring of need .
Set up for eight days of care , the group was already overwhelmed on the first day after allowing 1,500 people through the door , nearly 500 of whom had still not been served by day ’s end and had to return in the wee hours Wednesday morning .
Four high - level members of a pre-release music piracy group called " Rabid Neurosis " were indicted on criminal copyright infringement charges Wednesday , including one of its leaders .
The indictment ( .pdf ) brings to six the number of alleged Rabid Neurosis defendants ensnared in what the authorities are calling a " multi - year federal investigation of organized piracy groups responsible for the illegal distribution of significant amounts of copyrighted movies , software , games and music through the internet . "
Rabid Neurosis , also known as RNS , is said to have uploaded thousands of copyrighted music files , many pre-release , according to the charges in the Eastern District of Virginia .
In their uploads , the warez group , founded in 1996 , often used the tagline " Rabid Neurosis – Spread the Epidemic . "
The authorities , in a statement , said " RNS members were granted access to massive libraries of pirated music , video games , software and movies by gaining a reputation for providing previously unavailable pirated materials .
The indictment alleges the supply of pre-release music was often provided by music - industry insiders , such as employees of compact disc ( CD ) manufacturing plants , radio stations and retailers , who typically receive advance copies of music prior to its commercial release . "
According to a Wikipedia entry , the group apparently disbanded in early 2007 .
The entry said that its first upload was Metallica 's " Ride the Lightning . "
The indictment said RNS would also lawfully purchase CDs immediately after they were released , posting them online ahead of rival groups – thus earning a lofty reputation that gave it access to pre-release material from industry insiders .
Those charged include alleged ringleader Adil R. Cassim , 29 , of Granada Hills , California ; Bennie Glover , 35 , of Shelby , North Carolina ; Matthew D. Chow , 28 , of Missouri City , Texas and Edward L. Mohan II , 46 , of Baltimore .
Each face a maximum five - year sentence and $ 250,000 fine .
Within the last month , the investigation recently ensnared Patrick L. Saunders , 30 , of Brooklyn , New York and James A. Dockery , 39 , of Mooresboro , North Carolina .
Saunders has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit copyright infringement and scheduled for sentencing in December .

Standing in the well of a jail on New York ’s Rikers Island as profanities rain down on you from the cells above , you realize the absurdity of academia ’s most celebrated book on incarceration .
Discipline and Punish , by the late French historian Michel Foucault , criticized jails and prisons for subjecting inmates to constant , spirit - crushing surveillance .
The truth is that surveillance goes both ways in correctional facilities .
Inmates watch their keepers as intensely as they are watched — and usually much more malignly .
Jails are the ideal testing ground for romantic myths about incarceration .
As policing has gotten more efficient at nabbing wrongdoers over the last decade and a half , it has pumped a growing volume of increasingly troubled individuals into the jail system .
Governing that population is a management challenge more complex than that faced by any other criminal - justice institution .
Yet jails , unlike prisons , remain largely out of sight and out of mind .
This public ignorance is unfortunate , because jails have been evolving important principles for controlling criminal behavior of late , ideas that directly contradict the Foucauldian critique .
To understand the difficulties of running a large jail , imagine that your job is personally to shepherd each of the thousands of commuters streaming through New York ’s massive Penn Station to their trains safely and on time . . . except that the commuters are all criminals who keep changing their travel plans , and their trains , to which they do n’t want to go , have no fixed timetables .
A cross-section of the entire universe of criminal offenders , from the most hardened murderer to the most deranged vagrant , cycles through the nation ’s 3,365 jails .
But the majority of jail inmates show up with no predictable release date , since they have as yet only been charged with a crime and are awaiting a trial that may or may not occur and whose duration is unknown .
Even before their trials begin , they may make bail at any moment and be released .
Planning for pretrial detainees is therefore no easy task .
“ The ones who stay less than 36 hours drive you out of your mind , ” says Michael Jacobson , a former corrections commissioner in New York City .
“ You think : ‘ Could n’t you have made bail ten hours ago rather than coming into my facility ? ’ ” Prisons , by contrast , hold only post - conviction defendants who have been found guilty or pleaded guilty and have been sentenced to a known term of more than a year .
( Prisons and jails differ as well in their government overseers : the former are run by states and the federal government , the latter by cities and counties . )
Jail administrators are obligated to get pretrial detainees back and forth to court on time and to keep them safe until their cases are completed .
But pretrial detainees are just less than two - thirds of the nation ’s approximately 780,000 jail inmates .
The remainder consists of post - conviction defendants with a sentence of a year or less , who serve their time in jail ; post - conviction defendants sentenced to more than a year and awaiting transfer to prison ; parolees and probationers who have violated their conditions of release ; illegal immigrants detained for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement ; and inmates in transit between prisons .
These populations show up at all hours , often with no background information on who they are .
Their turnover rate is extremely high : jails process as many admissions and releases in two months as state and federal prisons ( which hold about 1.5 million inmates ) process in a year .
Managing that “ churning mass of humanity ” is a nightmare , says Jacobson , who now directs the Vera Institute for Justice .
“ So many arrestees lead unbelievably disorganized lives ” — but as soon as they enter a jail , the jail becomes responsible for their well - being .
Two men in street clothes amble down the wide , buffed corridor of the Otis Bantum Correctional Center , one of ten razor - wired fortresses on Rikers Island that together hold nearly 14,000 inmates .
They ’re as odd a couple as any pair of Shakespearean rustics : one short and white , with mismatched eyes that look as though they ’ve been squished by a pickup truck ; the other tall and black , with a gap - toothed smile spreading broadly across his craggy face .
The very picture of bonhomie and goodwill , the two flag down a passing official to share the happy news : they have just made bail after a day inside and are going home .
“ Congratulations .
Now please do n’t come back to my hotel again , ” Deputy Chief of Staff of Operations Mark Cranston responds cheerfully .
The chances that they will honor Cranston ’s request are slight .
At Rikers , 40 percent of all inmates return within a year of release .
Such recidivism is typical ; all jails have “ frequent fliers ” who cycle through repeatedly .
“ I see these guys leave and they ’re back in two days , ” says Gerald , a slender , already - sentenced drug offender in a green uniform who is swabbing the floors of the Otis Bantum intake area .
Fifteen men are standing , sitting , or lying down in a holding pen inside the bustling intake office .
Plexiglas covers one side of the cell to protect the staff from “ splashing ” incidents — drinks or bodily fluids thrown at them by cell occupants .
One tall detainee in a Yankees jacket is talking on a phone that reaches into the cell , trying to line up bail .
As Gerald cleans , he keeps his distance from the new admits .
“ This place can get you in trouble ; there ’s no need to get involved , ” he says .
Over the next few days , Rikers officials will try to gather as much information as they can on the men in the pen , seeking to determine how securely to house them and whether they need medical or psychological care .
They will analyze their criminal records , intake questionnaires , medical examinations , and current behavior .
Such inmate classification is the cutting edge of jail management .
Jails are only now starting to recognize the importance of rigorously analyzing information to maintain order , just as policing has in the last decade .
Some jails still practice “ open bed ” classification , housing an inmate wherever there is an empty bed or , at best , separating felony and misdemeanor pretrial detainees .
But careful inmate classification acknowledges that a Mike Tyson in on a drunk - driving charge , say , is likely to be more dangerous than many a felony auto thief — and should be housed accordingly .
At Rikers , new inmates spend up to 72 hours under observation in quasi- quarantine , until the results of their tuberculosis and other medical tests come back .
Outside one such quarantine area , a square , windowed dormitory filled with rows of mussed beds , a sentenced inmate working as a suicide - prevention aide roams the hall every ten minutes , checking on new admits suspected of suicidal tendencies .
Inside , a pallid transvestite with widely set eyes , several missing teeth , and a curtain of hennaed hair stares intently at a group of visitors .
Though he claims that he has just been slapped for not providing a sexual favor to another inmate , the 28 - year - old heroin addict otherwise is n’t worried about getting attacked .
“ At Rikers , unlike New Jersey , they cater to you , ” Della says .
“ They wo n’t put me in protective custody here ” — isolating an inmate for his own safety , that is — “ or make me feel like an animal . ”
( Recent studies suggest that rape among inmates is far less prevalent than was previously claimed . )
The spread of quality - of - life policing , which targets low - level offenses like aggressive panhandling , public urination , and littering , has brought a more mentally unstable , troubled population into jails — one that mental hospitals would have treated before the deinstitutionalization movement of the 1960s and ’70s shuttered most state mental hospitals .
In fact , jails have become society ’s primary mental institutions , though few have the funding or expertise to carry out that role properly .
Mental illness is much more common in jails than in prisons ; at Rikers , 28 percent of the inmates require mental health services , a number that rises each year .
“ People are coming right off the streets with a whole range of street problems , ” Jacobson reports .
“ You have to deal with them immediately and figure out : ‘ Are you a dangerous lunatic , or just tough ? ’ ”
Jail administrators worry constantly about inmates ’ killing themselves — in 2008 , Rikers spent $ 5.3 million in overtime pay for officers to sit watch , 24 hours a day , outside the cells of potential suicides .
Mentally ill jail inmates stay longer than other inmates because of pretrial competency hearings and other self - induced complications .
One mentally ill Rikers inmate has been incarcerated for five years , during which time he has staged numerous diversionary courtroom dramas to defer his case .
Another “ has defied all efforts to safely get her to court by injuring herself every time a hearing is approaching , ” sighs Assistant Deputy Warden Helena Smith , who oversees a Rikers mental health ward .
The Kent County Correctional Facility , a pair of squat , striped cylinders housing 1,300 inmates in Grand Rapids , Michigan , is a leader in correctional mental health care .
Mental clinicians sit in on every intake interview , and they have access to mental health records on every inmate dating back to 2003 — an unparalleled degree of medical record - keeping .
Every morning , clinicians and corrections supervisors discuss each detainee who has been placed in a suicide cell — a camera - monitored cell lacking a table or any kind of fixture that the inmate could use to hang himself .
The discussion sounds as though it is taking place in a hospital , not a jail .
The head clinician brings up a picture of a bedraggled female on a PowerPoint screen .
“ Miss Wilson is a frequent flier , ” she begins .
“ I tried to direct her to the positive aspects of her life ; she said she did n’t have any . ”
“ Does she have a place to go ? ” asks a supervisor .
“ She would n’t engage with me , ” the clinician answers .
A series of men appears on the screen .
“ Derek wanted someone to talk to ; he has a strained relation with his child ’s mother .
I allowed him some time to process those thoughts and feelings .
Mr. Taylor continues to be evasive .
He smiles and reported that he does n’t want to hurt himself , but if he had to move , he would make no promises for his safety .
He says he hears voices , but he does n’t tell me what they say . ”
The night before , a man just sentenced to life imprisonment for second - degree murder had been moved into a suicide cell under protest .
He now lies on Cell 34 ’s green bunk , under a long horizontal slit of a window , tightly wrapped in a blanket like a shroud , his face invisible ; a dictionary , slippers , manila envelopes , and rolls of toilet paper litter the floor .
In his old cell , a dozen sheets of paper are attached with toothpaste to a wall , each displaying a softly shaded word : judas , guilt , death , sinner , empty , fear , pain , lust , hope ?
A blob of green - and - white soap on the wall holds a pencil .
This convict has required more than 1,000 staff interventions during his 20 - month stay , over ten times the number of incidents that a typical non–mentally ill inmate would generate over a comparable period .
Outside the convict ’s cell , other mentally ill inmates wander around the cell block ’s dayroom ( the common area where inmates not on lockdown spend their time ) following a group - therapy discussion ; a few sit at a table with a jigsaw puzzle .
John , an elfin Sudanese drunk driver who looks as though he has been dusted in flour , complains in barely comprehensible English about getting bossed around and says that he refuses to take showers .
Spencer , a 45 - year - old unmarried father in on an assault - and - battery charge that he wo n’t discuss , says with an affectless , unblinking gaze that he has tried to get a job but gets too stressed out to hold it .
A few mentally ill inmates defeat all efforts to get them to take their medication .
They can not be forced to do so without a court order , but they refuse to go to court , thus requiring a judicial order to extract them from their cells .
Others hide the pills or spit them out .
Once treated and sobered up , some mental - needs inmates become model prisoners , while others remain difficult to control .
The question of whether mentally ill inmates are disproportionately violent is a fraught topic .
The Wisconsin state auditor reported in March 2009 that mentally ill state prisoners commit nearly 80 percent of assaults on staff , though they are 30 percent of the state prison population .
At Rikers , the rate of fights in the mental health observation units is 12 times greater than in the general population .
One day in February , a black - uniformed search team is mustering outside Rikers Island ’s redbrick Robert M. Devoren Center after an assault by a mentally ill teen .
A delusional 17 - year - old robbery suspect who fancies himself “ King the Punisher ” has slashed a fellow adolescent ’s ear with a razor fashioned from radiator metal .
A perennial troublemaker , the assailant has been at Rikers for two years while his trial stretches on .
Now the elite search team , drawn from security officers across the island , will search every crevice of the jail for more weapons , while the victim goes into protective custody .
The assailant is at a court hearing as the search team gathers ; when he returns , officials will try to bring a new charge of attempted murder against him .
Two of Rikers Island ’s “ punitive segregation ” wings — areas where inmates who have broken the rules stay confined up to 23 hours a day in a single cell — are devoted to mentally ill detainees , like King the Punisher .
improve the moment , exhorts a mural leading into the two wings , located in the George R. Vierno Center , a low tan building with blue corral - type rails on top .
The most violent mentally ill offenders , almost all of whom have assaulted staff , are housed in the Mental Health Assessment Unit for Infracted Inmates ( MHAUII ) , a long , double - tiered room of cells with heavy doors .
The hatches in the middle of the doors where officers deliver food are bolted like safes , because they also serve as complicated mechanisms for handcuffing inmates .
Before a detainee can leave the MHAUII for a visit to the doctor or other appointment , he must be handcuffed and searched for weapons , all while isolated beyond striking range of another human being .
He is first cuffed from behind through his food tray while in his cell , then escorted to a small cage containing a battered gray magnetometer .
There he is uncuffed through an opening in the cage and asked to strip and walk through the magnetometer .
After dressing again , he is recuffed through the cage .
Even these precautions do n’t always protect officers .
A cuffed and scanned inmate on his way to the health clinic has just kicked an officer in the face , cutting him deeply .
That inmate will now have leg irons as well as handcuffs when outside his cell .
The violence of MHAUII inmates exceeds the jail ’s capacity to punish it .
No Rikers inmate may spend more than 90 days at a time in punitive segregation , but the most recalcitrant accumulate far more punitive time ( known at Rikers as “ bing days ” ) than they can pay in a single stretch .
The average MHAUII resident owes 303 bing days ; one current inmate owes 4,000 .
When an inmate with a backlog of punitive segregation leaves the island , his debt stays on the books .
If he returns , he ’ll go right back to punitive segregation to start paying down his bing days again .
Even in punitive segregation , mentally ill Rikers inmates continue to receive treatment from a clinical psychologist and a psychiatrist , who try to persuade them to enter behavior - modification therapy .
As a reward for good behavior , a group of MHAUII detainees in orange jumpsuits clusters around a TV set in a tall glassed - off room .
Outside several cells on the block , single officers sit on stools , each staring at the cell ’s door .
Rikers , unlike Kent County , may not film inmates on suicide watch inside their cells ; instead , it must post an officer outside each cell , 24 hours a day .
One such detainee , a jailhouse bully awaiting trial on gun , assault , and drug charges , is curled up in a ball under his green mattress , while his monitor sits watching .
Such surveillance , said Foucault in Discipline and Punish , turns inmates into powerless subjects of the “ disciplinary ” state .
Foucault called jails and prisons “ Panopticons , ” after a circular prison model by eighteenth - century philosopher Jeremy Bentham that let guards observe a large number of inmates from a central position .
But jails and prisons are also reverse Panopticons ; to walk around one is to be under constant observation from the inmates .
The moment that Deputy Warden Thomas Hall enters another Rikers punitive segregation unit , inmates watching from their cells unleash a torrent of obscenities : “ Fucking Hall ! ” “ Call Hall ! ”
While the authorities ’ surveillance of inmates is often protective — as in the ubiquitous suicide watches — the inmates ’ surveillance of the authorities can be aimed at corrupting them .
Like surveillance , power in jails flows between officers and inmates in multiple directions .
Rikers Island ’s most dangerous inmate stands watching at his cell door in Twelve Main , a small , square space that contains the island ’s maximum - security prisoners .
Lee Woods , tall and well built , with a broad mouth , has just been sentenced to life in prison for the murder of New York police officer Russel Timoshenko .
Woods was driving a stolen SUV with two other thugs on the night of July 9 , 2007 , when Officers Timoshenko and Herman Yan pulled it over .
Gunfire burst from the SUV .
Timoshenko died of face and neck wounds five days later , and Yan was seriously injured .
Now the former Bloods leader and career criminal stares impassively at some visitors , a white T - shirt tied rakishly around his head , as a corrections officer sits outside his cell .
Woods is in Twelve Main — where the walls are made of reinforced steel so that inmates can’t rip out sinks and toilets for weapons — because of the eerie power he exercises over corrections officers .
After his arrest for the Timoshenko murder , he arrived at Rikers owing 3,000 bing days , accumulated from 14 assaults on staff , three arson attempts , and several contraband violations during previous stays .
In earlier state - prison stints , he had devised homemade razor blades and thrown feces at staff .
Yet on his current visit to Rikers , this monster managed to seduce at least six staff members to break the rules on his behalf .
Two rookie officers brought him marijuana , tobacco , and alcohol ; another two officers supplied him with a cell - phone memory chip and a handcuff key ( the key was discovered inside his bowels by a magnetometer ) ; a female officer exchanged photos with him during her frequent stops outside his cell ( a violation of fraternization rules ) ; and a captain let him make a phone call without supervision .
When news of Woods ’s treatment broke in the summer of 2008 , New York police officers were so angry that they allegedly went on a ticket - writing spree against vehicles belonging to the Department of Correction , a separate entity from the NYPD .
Woods could corrupt his keepers because of the two - way nature of surveillance and power in jail .
“ You ’re in a mirror as a corrections officer , ” says Rikers captain Sean Jones .
“ The inmates watch you continuously ; they can get a heads - up on you before you get one on them .
They know when you get a haircut , whether you ’re wearing your wedding ring any longer .
‘ Your hair looks great today , ’ they ’ll say , or ‘ I see you took your ring off . ’ ” If a supervisor berates an officer , they will appear to sympathize .
The goal is to gain control of the officer .
An inmate ’s most potent method of corruption is to persuade an officer to break the rules for him .
“ Inmates know that once they get a corrections officer to do something for them , even if it ’s just bringing them a cheeseburger from McDonald ’s , they own the officer , ” says Frank Straub , the police commissioner of White Plains , New York .
It is illegal to bring an inmate so much as a stick of gum , as corrections officers learn from their first day in the academy .
But there will always be a few officers who are turned by a skilled con man .
The manipulators test officers quickly — looking for a sign of weakness or perhaps kindness to exploit , or using intimidation to try to bring an officer to heel .
“ Inmates say it all the time : ‘ I ’ll see you when I get out , ’ ” says Jones .
The threat can be realistic because at Rikers , as at other urban jails , inmates and officers often share community ties .
The Rikers workforce is predominantly minority ; there is a proud tradition in black families of correctional work , dating from the time when police and fire departments were less friendly to blacks .
Given the black incarceration rate , the chance that an officer and an inmate know each other is not negligible .
Most officers do n’t let any prior acquaintance they have with an inmate — which they ’re supposed to report to supervisors — affect them ; most perform their vital law enforcement function with honor .
But for a few , familiarity with an inmate or intimacy with the culture of crime raises the risk of malfeasance , and not just because of fear of retribution when the inmate is released .
The president of the New York corrections officers ’ union recently addressed the problem of fraternization on the union ’s website .
“ Are you just willing to surrender all that you ’ve worked for and all that your family is proud of just because of some individual who lives down the street from you and you want to be a part of some acceptable click [ sic ] ? ” wrote Norman Seabrook .
The 1 percent of officers “ who say it ’s ok to bring in that cell phone or that contraband for an inmate , because they are ‘ friends ’ ” put the lives of their colleagues at risk , Seabrook warned .
“ Today it ’s a cell phone ; tomorrow it ’s a 9 millimeter . ”
The results of any favoritism , even if it ’s less shocking than bringing contraband to a cop killer , are disastrous for a jail .
“ When a corrections officer builds a relation with an inmate , the system starts to collapse , ” says Straub , who has studied corruption in New York prisons .
“ The whole process is undermined . ”
On October 18 , 2008 , four months after the Woods contraband scandal came to light , 18 - year - old Christopher Robinson was killed in his Rikers cell by three fellow adolescents .
Investigation into the murder revealed a different locus of corruption .
Officers Michael McKie ( “ Mack ” ) and Khalid Nelson ( “ Nel ” ) , with help from Officer Denise Albright ( “ Mama A ” ) , had licensed 12 young thugs ( the “ Team ” ) to enforce discipline on their cell blocks by means of an extortion racket .
New inmates had a choice : they could join “ the Program , ” which meant forking over a percentage of their commissary accounts and telephone privileges to the Team ; or they could receive “ spankin ’s ” ( beatings ) in their cells .
Nelson and McKie taught the Team how to beat the holdouts so as to avoid bruises that supervisors might detect .
Team members got to dictate who sat on which chairs in the dayroom , who went to the bathroom and when , and who could go into and out of his cell .
Lowly lookouts policed the communal seating areas , “ pop - off dummies ” delivered the beatings , and the top dogs controlled the housing areas .
In exchange for their extortion privileges , Team members were to keep order on the wing .
Throughout the history of corrections , officers seeking to maintain order have tried to exploit the brutal authority that inmates exercise over one another .
Mississippi and Louisiana prison officials , among others , issued pistols to selected prisoners to keep other inmates in line in the 1940s and 1950s , writes John DiIulio in Governing Prisons , with predictably predatory results .
A respected Texas prison commissioner , George Beto , tried to civilize this so - called con-boss system in the 1960s by more carefully choosing the inmates who would perform staff functions , but the same abuses developed , including quasi- official beatings of noncompliant inmates .
Other institutions , like the small South Dakota jail where Kent County captain Randy Demory once worked , had more informal means of delegation .
“ A guard got a local college football player out of a cell and put him into another cell with instructions to ‘ settle these boys down , ’ ” Demory recalls .
“ The football player took care of business and was rewarded with extra food . ”
McKie and Nelson ’s Program had a particularly dire outcome .
Rikers officials had transferred Christopher Robinson into McKie and Nelson ’s housing unit in an effort to disrupt Robinson ’s own predatory behavior toward fellow inmates in a different cell block .
Accustomed to being the top dog himself , he refused to join the Program .
Two days later , three inmates known as “ Pop Brim , ” “ Ant Luv , ” and “ Fire ” beat him to death .
Such delegation arrangements are no longer officially tolerated , yet they keep breaking out .
Why ?
Perhaps because keeping a lid on inmate violence is so difficult .
After all , the other benefits to corrections officers from such schemes appear modest .
Police corruption usually entails considerable financial gain for the dirty cop , but in jail there are few deep pockets .
At best , McKie and Nelson were freed from the necessity of patrolling the cell block every hour or so .
They were undoubtedly lazy ( and probably also part of the same criminal culture to which their charges belonged ) , but what we should learn from the Program scandal is just how great the challenges for corrections officers are .
Left to its own devices , inmate society is not carnivalesque spontaneity , as the Foucauldians might have us believe , or grassroots democracy , as proponents of the misguided 1970s and ’ 80s “ prisoner self - governance ” movement suggested , but Lord of the Flies cruelty in which the strong try to control and exploit the weak .
The symbols of detainee power would be laughable if the means of attaining them were n’t so dangerous .
Power - seeking inmates will try to control bathroom use and food consumption .
Low - status inmates will wind up excluded from the dayroom .
Commissary accounts , with which inmates purchase snacks and personal hygiene items from the jail store , are an obvious target for extortion .
And chairs are a particularly useful tool of domination .
A detainee sitting on a stack of four chairs is broadcasting : “ I ’m king . ” A battle - gray adolescent dayroom at Rikers recently got rid of its freestanding chairs in favor of a green cement picnic table with attached benches .
“ The inmates were trying to control the seating : stacking chairs and not allowing certain people to sit , ” says Edmund Duffy , the tall , energetic warden who now runs the jail where the Robinson murder occurred .
Eliminating movable chairs solved another problem as well : they ’re the first thing grabbed during a fight .
The predatory drive is particularly strong among younger inmates .
Not only are young detainees in thrall to their hormones , but only the worst of the worst adolescent criminals go to jail , rather than to the far milder juvenile - justice system .
Three - quarters of the adolescent detainees at Rikers are awaiting trial for the top felonies , such as homicides , shootings , and robberies , a far higher percentage than in the detainee population at large .
In such a world , ordinary objects must be viewed as potential weapons — such as a King of Hearts card containing a razor blade made from a battery shell that had just been discovered during one of my trips to Rikers — and attacks can come at any time .
Moments before I entered Rikers ’s Central Punitive Segregation Unit , which houses non–mentally ill infractors , an inmate had thrown an unknown liquid at a guard — it could have been water or urine — angry that he had to wait to use the showers .
Red lights flashed throughout the facility , and a team in riot gear trotted by to make sure that the unit stayed calm , as the inmate looked coolly around while being escorted to a medical evaluation .
Simply directing the movement of bodies in a jail can be a monumental task .
Officers work alone or in pairs , vastly outnumbered by the inmates .
One evening at the intake area of Rikers ’s Anna M. Kross Center , a 1960s facility whose anachronistic baby - blue geometric security gates appear to have been inspired by Mondrian , several dozen inmates press their faces against the barriers of six small pens , their features barely visible through the fine blue mesh .
A table outside the pens is strewn with the recent admits ’ sneakers , MP3 players , and jeans .
A wiry inmate with dreadlocks in an orange jumpsuit shouts at a visitor , “ You have food poisoning , too ! ” as he is escorted from a pen into the main jail .
The detainees are all on different trajectories to and from court , the Bellevue mental hospital , and punitive segregation , and all need to be searched or are waiting to be fed .
Getting 20 bodies from court and through the search procedures without a fight requires considerable command presence and finesse , especially if some inmates have previously been separated for security reasons .
Now , imagine that you are a corrections officer in such a situation .
Your safety depends on inmates ’ cooperation .
But there ’s a very fine line between saying , “ Hey , guy , work with me here , ” and letting an inmate call the shots .
Time and again , officers have crossed that line , trying to solve the inmate - control problem by ceding authority for order maintenance to the inmates themselves .
“ It ’s not easy managing this kind of humanity , ” says former corrections commissioner Jacobson .
“ One way to do it is to make deals between yourself and the people . ”
Observers are divided over how devastating a managerial failure the Robinson case represents .
Most acknowledge that in an institution as large as Rikers , some bad things will happen , despite management ’s best efforts .
Bernard Kerik , whose accomplishments as New York corrections and police commissioner in the 1990s have been tarred by a federal indictment for corruption and tax fraud , is the most damning .
“ If the supervisors were doing their job , there is no way that you could have enforcers , ” he says .
“ Where was the captain ?
If he was making his rounds , inmates should have told him . ”
Current New York City corrections commissioner Martin Horn disagrees .
The Robinson corruption scandal was essentially undetectable , he argues .
The noise of opening and shutting heavy gates to cell blocks means that supervisors can’t secretly enter a housing area , and participants had a system of signals to alert one another about approaching visitors .
“ I have to rely on the integrity of my officers , ” says Horn .
“ Without integrity , all the staff in the world wo n’t make a difference . ”
The ethic among inmates and officers against informing further complicates efforts to detect corruption , Horn adds : “ There may be no secrets in a jail , but there ’s also no snitching . ”
A month before Robinson ’s death , the mother of an inmate on the McKie - Nelson wing told Rikers officials that her son ’s eye socket had been fractured after he refused to join the Program — but when questioned by authorities , the inmate responded , “ I ai n’t talkin ’ . ”
Horn does n’t know whether other officers were aware of the ring , though the likelihood that no other adults saw what was happening seems small .
In a paramilitary organization , however , bad news does not flow easily up the chain of command ; a jail leader constantly needs to figure out ways to extract the facts on the ground , such as showing up at 3 am to talk to inmates and staff .
Compared with New York police - corruption cases — such as the Dirty 30 in the NYPD ’s 30th Precinct in the early 1990s , in which more than two dozen officers were stealing drugs and money from West Harlem drug dealers — the McKie - Nelson affair is peanuts and does not discredit Commissioner Horn ’s achievements overseeing the most complex jail facility in the country .
He has continued to drive violence down at Rikers through data - driven managerial accountability ; the jail bears no resemblance to the inmate - dominated anarchy of the mid-1990s ( see “ Why the Jails Did n’t Explode , ” Spring 1999 ) .
In 1995 , there were more than 1,000 inmate slashings ; in 2008 , there were 21 , with a total population down by just 2,000 or so .
Horn has kept the facility clean and orderly through rigorous attention to prisoner classification and Broken Windows–type detail .
New York City ’s jail - homicide rate is a small fraction of Baltimore ’s , Philadelphia ’s , Chicago ’s , or Los Angeles’s .
Nevertheless , recent revelations of officially sanctioned favoritism toward inmates further suggest that top management has lost contact with some operations on the ground .
The most damning disclosure concerns the royal treatment that the politically influential Hasidic rabbi Leib Glanz secured for Jewish inmates , benefits that included an elaborate , catered bar mitzvah in a Manhattan jail for the son of an inmate ; semiweekly feasts for Jewish inmates in the rabbi’s office ; and inmate use of the rabbi’s private phone to call girlfriends and bookies , according to the New York Post .
When such special treatment is conducted with the approval of jail officials , as Glanz ’s apparently was , it is even more destructive of correctional fairness than surreptitious favors passed from a guard to an inmate — and when targeted at an already resented ethnic or religious group , it is the most inflammatory of all .
However outrageous the Jewish dispensation in the New York City jail system , the more common problem throughout corrections is inmate misbehavior and secret guard corruption .
Such corruption is best prevented by ensuring order through discipline and as much information - gathering on inmates as possible .
These principles remain abhorrent to a Foucauldian perspective on corrections , but they ’re essential to sound management .
Foucault criticized visual surveillance as an oppressive encroachment on inmate autonomy .
In fact , visual surveillance has only a limited effect on inmate behavior and leaves officers largely ignorant about what happens on the cell block .
The D1A pod in the Kent County Correctional Facility is a semicircle of cells on the second floor of a maroon atrium , holding the jail ’s most assaultive inmates .
It ’s a pie-slice - shaped version of Bentham ’s Panopticon — guards stay behind a glass barrier observing the cells in front of them , emerging only for their prescribed tours of the cell block .
Recently , the occupant of Cell 37 chiseled out the plate holding his window to the point where he could stick his hand out .
Every time he heard the guard entering the cell area , he would replace the plate with a papier - mâché version made out of toilet paper .
“ The incident resolved for all time the question : ‘ Do we know what ’s going on inside the cells ? ’ ” observes Captain Demory .
More important than visual surveillance is information - gathering .
Just as the NYPD started debriefing every suspect it arrested in the 1990s to collect knowledge about unsolved crimes , progressive corrections officials recognize the need for grassroots information in fighting jail crime .
“ We teach our officers that the most important thing they can do is to listen to the inmates , ” says Rikers deputy warden Hall .
“ Jot things down : Who ’s Big Daddy , or Red -O ?
Feed it up the chain so we can figure out who ’s running things , who the predators and victims are .
When someone gives you information , be receptive ; do n’t shut it off . ”
The Kent County jail reports the information it gathers to the Grand Rapids Police Department — in 2008 , 70 reports about unsolved crimes , including 23 homicides and six robberies .
The imperative to be open to information from inmates is in tension with officers ’ instinct to erect a wall between themselves and their charges , a useful check against corruption .
Corrections officers develop a strong degree of skepticism toward everything they hear .
“ If it ’s not verifiable , you have to take it as not true until you can prove otherwise , ” says Rikers captain Jones .
Indeed , officials can develop a hair - trigger authority reaction to the barrage of claims and requests that they face .
As Ernest Lewis , assistant warden of New York ’s Westchester County jail , walks though a high - security area , a wiry inmate with a history of making trouble shouts through a barred cell : “ I ’m about to lose my cool .
Can I switch to a pen ? ”
In a flash , the previously relaxed warden turns on his command presence : “ You better chill out , ” he warns .
Despite the complexity of the officer - inmate relationship , an emerging philosophy of correctional design , “ direct supervision , ” seeks to break down the physical and psychological barriers between officers and inmates .
In traditional prisons and jails , the corrections officer stays behind a barrier at a workstation , emerging only to make his rounds on a predetermined schedule , while inmates spend their day either in their cells or in a group dayroom .
“ It ’s difficult to manage behavior under such conditions , ” says Demory , “ because for 59 minutes of the hour , the inmates control the turf . ”
The traditional design ’s passive management style is good at containment but not at shaping the culture , he adds .
Demory would n’t let me into the remotely supervised high - security D1A pod because the inmates , beyond the influence of the guards , would likely start exposing themselves and throwing bodily fluids when I entered .
“ Right now , it ’s settled down ; the officers like it nice and quiet , ” he explained .
In a direct - supervision facility , by contrast , when inmates congregate out of their cells , the corrections officer is in the same space , either at an accessible workstation or circulating among them , like a community - policing cop walking his beat .
The objective is to break down any distinction between the territory of inmates and of officers ; the officer is supposed to talk with inmates , set the tone , and intervene immediately in predation and misbehavior .
The direct - supervision model has had impressive results in managing one of Rikers Island ’s most difficult populations .
A few dormitories of the adolescent jail are devoted to a program in which officers engage constantly with detainees to try to encourage self - control and respect for authority .
One day in February , about 50 teenagers enrolled in the Institute for Inner Development sit quietly on immaculately made cots that extend in three rows down a long , shady hall ; a fellow inmate is mopping the floor .
Francis X , a slender , goateed officer , speaks deliberately and with mellow self - assurance to the group : “ I have to say that y’all are quite remarkable .
You make me proud .
You ’ve only been here for a week or two , but there ’s already a trust factor here . ”
Officer X invites me to point to a boy at random .
I choose a hefty boy with soft features .
“ Rodriguez , stand up ! ” X commands .
“ Why do you want to be here , Rodriguez ? ”
Awkwardly , but still audibly , Rodriguez , in on a drug charge , answers : “ To try to learn discipline , to try to change .
I came here saggy , I came here with a temper , but if you get jail time , this is the place to be . ”
Another boy is summoned to stand .
“ Sharif , tell me something about maturity , brother ! ” Sharif is awaiting sentence on an attempted murder and armed robbery charge .
“ When I came here , I was running around , but Brother Francis told me what I was doing was wrong and how to humble myself to others .
Hopefully , I ’ll take Brother Francis ’s teaching when I go upstate .
When I come out , I ’ll be an adult . ”
In the next wing , a laid - back female officer , Anisah Watkins , leads a rambling discussion with young inmates .
A few lay their heads down on their folded arms — the classic ghetto gesture of classroom indifference — while another is lying on his bed .
In short order , the discussion tacks from what it means to grow up too fast ( it means “ you grew up with no father , ” a boy suggests ) to sexual relations between boys and girls ( “ sometimes the mom had babies just like her teen daughter ” ) to the need to be prompt and organized in life ( here the only insights come from the officer ) .
The boys push back against the implacable Watkins , complaining that the regimen in the Institute for Inner Development is too strict .
She calmly reminds them : “ That ’s how it ’s gonna be down here ; it ’s not going to change . ”
“ We ’re trying to take the urban street that ’s inbred in the detainees and file it down , soften it a bit , in order to make them productive members of society , ” says Officer Alfonzo Miller , a tall , composed man standing in a glass vestibule overlooking another Institute for Inner Development dorm .
Still , Rikers officials stress that the main purpose of the Institute is maintaining order , not reducing recidivism when detainees get out .
It has accomplished that goal , lowering the fight rate in what was once the jail ’s most violent area .
One boy ejected from Officer X ’s wing for violence now wants back in .
Patrick , a diminutive 17 - year - old gun defendant , presses his face against the light - green bars of his cell in the Administrative Segregation Unit and calls Warden Duffy over .
As a gesture of courtesy , Duffy opens the food - tray door and starts to bend down toward it ( some inmates prefer to speak through the open slot , where there is no screen ) .
Patrick remains standing , however , and asks Duffy in hushed tones if he can get back into the Institute .
“ I want to get my GED .
It ’s hard to focus here .
I need structure , ” he says .
“ With a high school diploma , you can get a good job . ”
Duffy says that he does n’t know if there ’s still room in the program but that he ’ll look into it .
Direct - supervision theory is evolving further in the direction of community - policing concepts .
“ Place - based management , ” for instance , teaches officers to think of themselves as owners of the housing units they supervise .
They ’re accountable for everything that happens on their watch , just as a community - policing officer should feel responsible for what happens on his beat .
Too often , says Demory , who trains jail officials in the concept for the National Institute of Corrections , “ if a fight breaks out , the officer thinks , ‘ They ’re just fools , ’ rather than , ‘ I ’m the manager .
How did that happen ? ’ ”
Very few jails offer rehabilitation - oriented programming for the pretrial population because the length of pretrial detainees ’ stay is unknown and usually brief .
Merely getting them safely to and from their legal appointments on time consumes most jails ’ attention and budgets .
However , the Westchester County jail , a redbrick hilltop facility north of New York City and surrounded by geese , recently began an antiviolence program for adult pretrial detainees that combines direct supervision with intense group therapy .
The 44 inmates in the Resolve to Stop the Violence Project ( RSVP ) are all awaiting trial on murder , rape , robbery , and other top felonies or have just been sentenced and await transfer to prison upstate .
On Monday mornings , they sit in a large oblong circle in the light - filled atrium of their two - tiered cell block , arms crossed , orange - jumpsuit - clad legs splayed out in front of them , paying close attention to an unusual conversational ritual .
Pat , a designated inmate leader , begins .
“ I heard you say , Fred , that I discounted you .
You said you were angry .
Can I ask you a clarifying question ? ”
Fred ’s response is less than clear , but Pat presses on : “ Can I propose an agreement that we support each other and let us nurture each other ? ”
Another man chimes in : “ Can I validate that I heard you say that you propose an agreement that you support each other ? ”
A third inmate picks up : “ I support you validating the agreement that they support each other , ” and everyone claps .
The men are performing their “ one - on - ones , ” public interactions between two inmates who bring up any tense moments they ’ve recently had with each other , discuss what they learned the previous week about controlling and expressing their emotions , and announce what they intend to learn as the day progresses .
The conversational conventions would undoubtedly be familiar to group - therapy habitués , but without such therapy experience , the self - referentiality of the discussion seems like a madly literalistic enactment of social - contract theory .
The participants turn to the future .
“ Now can I give you some feedback , Greg ? ” the leader starts .
“ My kernel of truth is that I ’m excited because I ’m expecting a visit on Saturday . ”
Greg responds : “ Pat , can I give you some feedback ?
Would you like me to validate it ?
I heard you say that your kernel of truth is that you are happy because you are expecting a visit ; my kernel of truth is that I ’m happy , too . ”
Pat replies : “ I heard you say that you heard me say that I ’m asking for validation ; however , you said . . . ”
Some members of the ring are n’t paying rapt attention to this exchange .
A facilitator rebukes them : “ Is that respectful that you are talking while these brothers speak ? ”
The inattentive detainees soberly apologize .
That men with a criminal inability to control violent impulses can participate in this artificial ritual , known as “ conscious languaging , ” with seeming sincerity says a lot about human malleability .
What will remain of these conversational mannerisms when they collide with the code of the streets is unknown .
But program director Eddie Concepcion says that the inmates are already bringing their new language to court .
“ A detainee will say to the judge : ‘ I hear you say that if I take this plea , I can go home .
Can I ask you a clarifying question ? ’
The court personnel are blown away .
Usually these guys are cussing out the judge . ”
RSVP aims to train the inmates to think twice about their reactions before acting on them and to take responsibility for everything that they do .
If a participant even hints at blaming drugs , alcohol , or anger for his past violence or a present conflict , program leaders will call him out .
“ Every day , we remind them that they are violent and are responsible for being violent , ” Concepcion says .
The Westchester RSVP is too new to have produced reliable post - release outcomes yet , but the rate of infractions among its members is a small fraction of those among the inmate population at large .
Graduates who have been sent upstate to prison have requested the RSVP manuals so that they can start their own groups there .
And the San Francisco prototype of RSVP does boast a significant impact on recidivism : the one - year rearrest rate for violent offenses dropped 82 percent for participants who spent 16 weeks in the program ; participants who spent less time in the program had higher rearrest rates .
The challenges of running jails exceed anything that the academic world — and most of us — can begin to understand .
In addition to the huge problems of logistics and safety that jails present on their own , commissioners also face a well - organized inmates ’ rights lobby that fights commonsense antiviolence measures .
Until recently , for example , New York City officials were n’t allowed to put pretrial detainees in uniform , which made detecting contraband more difficult .
Only last year did Commissioner Horn win the right to monitor detainees ’ phone calls .
Adolescents arrive at Rikers with their criminal histories largely concealed from officials to protect their privacy , hindering the determination of their security risk .
But the order that the lobbyists , academic critics , and neo-Foucauldians see as oppressive is inmates ’ only hope for safety and even , perhaps , rehabilitation .
The recent insights of urban policing — that order matters , that small violations lead to greater crimes , and that information must be gathered and analyzed — are all equally pertinent to jails , where chaos and corruption always threaten .

Scrum :
Hm , you ’re rather small .
Are you sure you want to do this ?
Kanban : Bring it .
Scrum : Right .
I represent a fundamental mindshift in the way that people do projects .
Kanban : So do I .
My mindshift is different to yours ; it feels subtler .
Scrum : I doubt that .
I help teams collaborate and deliver working software iteratively .
Kanban : As do I .
Unlike you , I do n’t tie people down to fixed iterations ; I let them find their own cadence .
Scrum :
You say that like it ’s a good thing !
What if people are n’t even used to delivering iteratively ?
How can you possibly stop novices from taking weeks over their increments of code ?
Kanban :
Well , maybe I do n’t work so well with novice teams .
A high - discipline team , though , who can keep their flow consistent , will find themselves more responsive with me than they will with you .
Scrum : I help new teams get started .
I give them easy , simple approaches that they can follow .
You ’re all about the maths .
Kanban : Actually , I ’m all about the theory of constraints .
By limiting work in progress , I make the bottlenecks obvious .
Scrum : I do that by focusing on getting the work through to production .
What ’s more , I was designed for software .
You ’re just the bastard offspring of manufacturing ; you have no relevance !
Kanban :
If I have no relevance , then why do so many people believe that I ’m valuable , and fight to defend me ?
Scrum :
They ’re in it for the money …
Kanban :
Says the world ’s fastest - growing pyramid scheme …
Scrum : I resent that !
There are plenty of successful Scrum projects out there .
We ’re good people ; we just want to change the world .
Kanban : I ’ll settle for continuous improvement , thanks .
Scrum :
We ’ve got that too , except we call them Retrospectives .
Kanban :
You do n’t need to batch up your improvements if everyone is focused on it .
Scrum :
There ’s nothing to prevent us from continually improving .
Kanban :
There ’s nothing to prevent us from having retrospectives , if we need them , or in fact from taking on any of your valuable practices .
I ’m just like you , except that I have sensible limits .
Scrum :
You ’re not just like me .
You do n’t even worry about estimates half the time .
Kanban :
We estimate in time to deliver , not story points .
The business understand this .
Scrum :
The business do n’t trust my teams ; they have n’t delivered successfully for a while .
My planning enables them to regain that trust .
You ca n’t even work without it .
Kanban :
That ’s true .
Once we have the trust , though , we do n’t need to waste as much time on planning and estimating as you do .
Scrum :
How can you call a practice that establishes trust wasteful ?
Kanban :
You ’re right .
We value people too , you know – we work well with the Lean principles , and “ Respect for People ” is one of the pillars .
Scrum :
Well , that ’s good to know .
People are the most important part of the process .
Kanban :
We seem to have quite a lot in common .
Thinking about it , you ’d probably make quite a good stepping - stone for people learning to deliver software iteratively for the first time .
I guess they could turn to me later , once the discipline is there .
Scrum :
That might work .
I know some people have used you in odd ways , and found value .
Maybe we should just be friends ?
Kanban : Let ’s call it a draw .
XP : Let ’s not .
You may have the planning and estimation sewn up ; you may be shifting your constraints and delivering responsively .
Neither of you can survive without my technical practices .
Get over here !

Candida Albicans es una enfermedad infecciosa de los genitales en particular y de las mucosas en general .
No es una enfermedad grave , pero debe identificarse y tratarse con prontitud para evitar complicaciones .
Para defenderse de Candida es importante conocerla a fondo , saber cómo se contrae , cómo se transmite , cómo se manifiesta y cómo se trata .
En este artículo explicaremos todo esto de una forma sencilla y esquemática .
Te recordamos que una correcta higiene personal , y una revisión anual en tu ginecólogo de confianza , es el protocolo ideal a seguir para una buena salud sexual .
¿ Qué es Candida Albicans ?
Candida Albicans es el nombre científico de un hongo saprofito perteneciente a la categoría de Saccharomyces .
En la práctica , es un microorganismo que vive en cantidades limitadas en el intestino humano .
Sirve para metabolizar azúcares .
Para ser claros , es uno de los elementos que componen la flora bacteriana intestinal , lo que resulta beneficioso para el correcto funcionamiento del sistema digestivo .
En algunos casos , este hongo puede comenzar a reproducirse de manera anormal .
Cuando está presente en cantidades superiores a las necesarias , puede atacar el tracto genital desencadenando una serie de síntomas y molestias .
¿ Por qué razones puede suceder algo así ?
Aquí está la lista de las principales causas de una infección por Candida Albicans :
- contagio directo , a través de relaciones sexuales con personas infectadas o intercambio de ropa ;
– disminución de las defensas inmunitarias , por ejemplo , durante una infección viral o bacteriana de otra naturaleza como un resfriado , gripe , bronquitis , gastroenteritis y similares ;
– tomar medicamentos que destruyen la flora bacteriana , especialmente antibióticos ;
– tomar preparaciones a base de estrógeno - progestina o hormonas , luego la píldora anticonceptiva o todos aquellos medicamentos que sirvan para promover la fertilidad o regular el ciclo menstrual ;
– períodos de fuerte estrés psicofísico , que contribuye a la disminución de anticuerpos ;
– uso de un limpiador íntimo demasiado agresivo ;
– sudor , uso diario de pantiprotectores no transpirables o lino en tejidos sintéticos que no permitan que la piel respire ;
– Dieta no regulada , rica en grasas y sobre todo en leudados .
Hay una cosa importante que decir sobre las infecciones por Candida relacionadas con una nutrición inadecuada .
Este hongo se alimenta de levadura .
En algunos casos , la candidiasis recurrente puede ser un signo de intolerancia a la levadura o al gluten .
Si se da cuenta de que a menudo es víctima de Candida Albicans , sería importante someterse a un examen de intolerancias alimentarias .
Además , dado que estamos hablando de un hongo que vive en el sistema digestivo , es fácil entender que una dieta alta en grasas puede favorecer la aparición de candidiasis .
Esto se debe a que las digestiones largas y laboriosas estimulan la producción de mucha flora bacteriana y pueden desencadenar la proliferación del hongo Candida Albicans .
Cómo se cura la infección por Candida Albicans
Como ya se mencionó , los hongos Candida Albicans viven en el intestino humano .
Debido a una o más de las razones mencionadas en el párrafo anterior , pueden sentirse estimulados a reproducirse en mayor número de lo normal y más rápido .
El excedente de estos microorganismos no puede permanecer en el intestino , por lo que invade el sistema urogenital .
Al encontrarse en un entorno adverso , con un ph diferente , no lo reconocen y lo atacan .
El resultado es un ataque de Candida molesto que , si no se trata con prontitud , puede provocar otras infecciones o complicaciones .
Además , esta patología es muy contagiosa .
Una persona con Candida puede infectar a otras , ya sea a través de las relaciones sexuales o indirectamente .
¿ Como ?
Principalmente de estas formas :
– usando las mismas toallas ;
– con las manos , si toca los genitales de alguien después de ir al baño o tocarse los suyos ( en este caso , tenga cuidado con los bebés y niños pequeños , al cambiarles los pañales o lavarlos ) .
Si tiene candidiasis , es importante recordar siempre lavarse bien las manos después de ir al baño y no compartir toallas y albornoces con otras personas .
¿ Candida Albicans solo puede atacar el sistema genital ?
La candidiasis genital es la manifestación más común de la enfermedad .
Sin embargo , Candida es un hongo que puede atacar todas las membranas mucosas , por lo que también puede manifestarse en otras partes del cuerpo .
Por ejemplo :
– en la boca , formando placas blancas muy dolorosas ;
– en los pezones .
La candidiasis del pezón es la principal causa de infecciones por Candida en los lactantes .
Esto ocurre con mucha frecuencia y se conoce mejor como aftas .
Las mujeres que están amamantando , por lo tanto estresadas y debilitadas , son particularmente propensas a las infecciones por Candida .
El recién nacido , mientras amamanta , está infectado .
El resultado es que la boca del bebé está llena de placas blancas , similares a volutas de espuma .
Debido a que siente mucho dolor e incomodidad , se niega a alimentarse o muestra mucha incomodidad mientras se alimenta .
Para evitar esta situación desagradable , las nuevas madres que están amamantando pueden :
– limpiar los pezones y las areolas con una solución desinfectante específica después de cada toma ;
– Hacer compresas en los pezones y las areolas con aceite de árbol de té , recordando lavar el pecho antes de ofrecérselo al recién nacido .
Estos pequeños trucos son bastante efectivos para prevenir Candida en los pezones .
Minimizan el riesgo de transmitir la candidiasis a su recién nacido .
Síntomas de Candida Albicans : si sabes reconocerla puedes curarla
Darse cuenta de que tiene Candida es bastante fácil .
Los ginecólogos suelen diagnosticarlo simplemente con un examen objetivo y escuchando los síntomas que reporta el paciente .
Candida Albicans vaginal tiene síntomas muy específicos :
- leucorrea , es decir , flujo vaginal mucho más abundante de lo habitual ;
– las pérdidas son extremadamente características , blanquecinas y similares al ricotta ;
- las pérdidas tienen un olor desagradable , que a menudo recuerda a la levadura cruda ;
picazón severa ;
– ardor más o menos intenso ;
– una sensación de malestar , de tener que orinar continuamente aunque solo se produzcan unas pocas gotas .
Si la enfermedad se descuida durante varios días , lamentablemente puede evolucionar y dar síntomas más graves .
Por ejemplo :
– infecciones bacterianas del tracto urogenital , como cistitis simple o incluso hemorrágica , es decir , con presencia de sangre roja brillante en la orina ; – dermatitis , a veces incluso con erupciones en la zona genital , ampollas o pequeñas úlceras ;
- temperatura ;
fatiga , apatía ;
– trastornos gastrointestinales de diversa índole .
Si puede reconocer Candida , porque puede que no sea la primera vez que la combate , simplemente vaya a la farmacia y pida un medicamento de venta libre adecuado .
Alternativamente , o si el tratamiento sin receta no funciona , debe comunicarse con su ginecólogo para que le aconseje .
¿ Cómo se trata la Candida ?
Como todos los hongos , Candida Albicans se trata con antifúngicos .
Generalmente , un tratamiento tópico es suficiente , es decir , local , en forma de crema para aplicar dentro de la vagina o supositorios vaginales .
En otros casos , por consejo médico , es posible que los medicamentos por vía oral , como antibióticos o antifúngicos más potentes , también se prescriban en combinación .
En general , los ingredientes activos más efectivos para tratar Candida son :
– clotrimazol , que es un ungüento que se inserta en la vagina a través de un aplicador pequeño pero que también se encuentra en forma de supositorios vaginales ;
– si además de Candida también hay bacterias que han provocado cistitis u otra infección , el ginecólogo puede prescribir antibióticos de amplio espectro , como amoxicilina o fosfomicina .
Candida se cura en unos días .
El tratamiento con pomada o supositorios generalmente dura 3 días .
En casos graves , para los que también se necesita el antibiótico , no más de 10 días .
Desafortunadamente , después del primer ataque de Candida es posible sensibilizarse y tener recaídas .
Si estos episodios no superan los dos al año no hay que preocuparse , especialmente en edad fértil .
Si por el contrario el problema se presenta con mucha frecuencia es bueno hacer un frotis vaginal y un análisis de heces , para entender por qué este hongo prolifera tanto en el intestino .
Una cosa muy importante : si se enferma de Candida , incluso si está tomando medicamentos específicos para tratarla , es bueno tomar fermentos lácticos durante al menos 10 días .
Estos ayudan a reequilibrar la flora bacteriana , acelerar la curación y prevenir las recaídas .
Curas naturales para Candida Albicans
La cándida siempre debe tratarse con medicamentos específicos , sugeridos por el farmacéutico o el ginecólogo .
En combinación con la medicina tradicional , se pueden tomar algunas precauciones que aceleren la curación .
Aquí hay algunas sugerencias :
- lavar al menos dos veces al día con agua tibia enriquecida con un par de gotas de aceite de árbol de té , que es un antibacteriano natural muy potente que alivia el picor y las molestias , desinfecta y desodoriza ;
- bebe mucha agua , de hecho , cuanto más orina , más hongos y bacterias se eliminan ;
- comer yogur , rico en fermentos lácticos vivos que restablecen el buen funcionamiento de la flora bacteriana intestinal ;
– use lino de algodón , preferiblemente blanco , cómodo y transpirable ;
– evitar , si es posible , protectores de bragas y toallas sanitarias ;
– use talco en polvo si el picor es muy molesto o si tiende a sudar , para contrarrestar la humedad .
La cándida es un problema muy común y casi todas las mujeres , y muchos hombres , han tenido que lidiar con él al menos una vez en la vida .
Precisamente por eso es objeto de continuos estudios e investigaciones .
De hecho , ya existen tratamientos alternativos , por ejemplo este nuevo método para tratar cándida completamente natural se está volviendo famoso en la web .
Prevención de Candida Albicans
Como dicen en todos los casos de enfermedad , siempre es mejor prevenir que curar .
¿ Existen trucos o buenos hábitos que ayuden a mantener alejada a Candida ?
Sí , por supuesto .
Aquí está la lista completa :
– no descuides la higiene íntima , teniendo en cuenta que lo ideal es lavar por la mañana y por la noche con un excelente detergente antibacteriano ;
- Predicar lino de algodón y evitar el uso de jeans tanto como sea posible
o pantalones demasiado ajustados ;
– use protectores de bragas solo si es necesario y no como un hábito diario ;
– limitar la ingesta de antibióticos a lo esencial ;
– siga una dieta variada , sana y rica pero no exceda con alimentos grasos , alcohol y alimentos ricos en levadura ;
- introducir el yogur en la dieta diaria , que es una panacea para la salud de la flora intestinal ;
– visite a su ginecólogo anualmente para chequeos de rutina

Joe Wilson Voted to Provide Taxpayer Money for Illegal Immigrants '
Healthcare
On Wednesday night , Rep. Joe Wilson [ R , SC - 2 ] , shouted “ You lie ! ” at President Obama when he said that the healthcare bill would not cover illegal immigrants .
“ The supporters of the government takeover of healthcare and liberals who want to give healthcare to illegals are using my opposition as an excuse to distract from the critical questions being raised about this poorly conceived plan , ” Wilson said the next day in a campaign fundraising video .
However , in 2003 , Wilson voted to provide federal funds for illegal immigrants ’ healthcare .
The vote came on the Medicare Prescription Drug , Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 , which contained Sec. 1011 authorizing $ 250,000 annually between 2003 and 2008 for government reimbursements to hospitals who provide treatment for uninsured illegal immigrants .
The program has been extended through 2009 and there is currently a bipartisan bill in Congress to make it permanent .
Hospitals have a legal obligation to treat everyone who comes in seeking care , regardless of citizenship status , insurance or other characteristics .
This means that hospitals treat millions of people every year who do n’t have the means to pay .
Obviously , this drives up the nation ’s healthcare costs overall .
Section 1011 helps cushion the costs for hospitals , but it ’s not nearly enough to cover the actual costs in most areas .
To be fair , Section 1011 is just a small part of a much larger bill that contained many Republican priorities .
Still , Wilson ’s protest against the current healthcare reform proposal giving coverage to illegal immigrants ( which is false ) , is in direct contradiction to his 2003 vote .
Allowing illegal immigrants to purchase unsubsidized healthcare through the Exchange that would be set up under the current proposal would n’t cost taxpayers a cent , and it would be a step towards fixing the problem that Section 1011 was designed to throw federal money at .
Here are a few more links on Wilson and the healthcare reform bill :
According to the Star Tribune , the Secret Service has interviewed Thomas .
The alleged comments about the Obamas drew the attention of the Secret Service , whose agents interviewed Thomas on Friday , according to his family .
" We will appropriately investigate , as we do all threats against the president , " said John Kirkwood , special agent in charge of the Secret Service 's Minneapolis field office .
Such threats , Kirkwood said , are felonies .
At present , two suspects are under arrest and charged with two felonies , aggravated first - degree robbery and attempted first - degree robbery , and two gross misdemeanors , fourth - degree assault and attempted fourth - degree assault .
The two latter charges address the racial motivation and reflect penalty - enhancement for hate crime .
The third suspect is still being sought .
While the two suspects have criminal records ( for burglary , terroristic threats , underage drinking and possession of burglary tools ) , neither ( as is true of most hate crime offenders ) was a member of an extremist group , and they claimed to watch BET not Glenn Beck .
In fact , the sister of one suspect offered up the typical color - blind mitigation that we see whenever a white person is accused with a horrific crime .
" He 's not a bad person , and I 'm just in shock .
He 's not like that at all , " she said on the back patio of her south Minneapolis home Saturday .
" We have foster cousins that are black .
One of his best friends is black ... "
" Yeah , it was wrong that he took part in that , but it 's definitely not a hate crime , " she said .
" That 's just not my brother . "
Yes that is your brother and yes this is a HATE CRIME .
Maybe the alcohol brought out his true feelings , maybe the non -stop news cycle of Joe Wilsons and tea-partyers and Limbaugh soaked into his psyche .
Maybe the flagrant disrespect and proliferation of overtly racist imagery allowed him to feel he had " permission . "
Maybe the racial resentment towards a Black Preseident was transferred to the first black man he saw on the street .
Say what you will about Nancy Pelosi -- but she was right .
The climate of hate , fear and violence is growing , and it is deeper than what we see on news or talk radio .
Make no mistake , these " hidden " racists are everywhere -- my town and your town .
Start calling them out .
UPDATE
Thank you for responding to this story .
As of yet , the third man has not been apprehended .
It is also be noted that there is no doubt as to whether or not this was a hate crime .
Interviews with the second victim , 40 year old Johnney Robinson , reveal that racial epithets were directed at him as well .
It was ( N - word ) this and ( N - word ) that ; I did n't pay no mind , " Robinson said .
" Suddenly they got out , and one said , ' ( N - word ) , I 'm gonna cut your head off . ' "
Robinson , his left cheek still swollen Friday , said one of the men swung an axe .
As he dodged it , he was struck in the face with the brass knuckles .
Before he knew what happened police arrived .

Rally Held After Third Man Arrested in Brooklyn Park Hate Crime
HUMANA VS. BAUCUS / CMS ….
Humana , among the nation ’s leading private insurers , is not at all pleased that policymakers intend to pay for health care reform by reducing unnecessary spending in Medicare Advantage .
Humana , after all , makes an enormous amount of money through the program .
So , the company , which has already spent $ 1.2 million on lobbying on health care , initiated a new mobilization campaign , contacting its customers with frightening and misleading letters to try to scare them about reform , and creating a website to send form emails to lawmakers .
( The emails identify the sender as Medicare Advantage members , whether they are or not . )
This came to the attention of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , which began investigating Humana ’s lobbying efforts .
More importantly , at the request of Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus ( D - Mont. ) , the CMS asked Humana to stop the misleading mailings and shut down the form - email website .
The agency has authority on the matter , given all the taxpayer money Humana accepts , and the marketing limits Humana accepted as part of the program .
Republicans are n’t happy .
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , who represents Humana ’s home state of Kentucky , and has received tens of thousands of dollars from the company over the years , called the CMS actions a “ gag order ” — a characterization that has been echoed by House Minority Leader John Boehner and Rep.
Dave Camp ( R - MI ) — ranking member on the House Ways and Means Committee — who fired off an angry letter to CMS acting administrator Charlene Frizzera .
“ In light of CMS ’ seemingly uneven and potentially politically - motivated use of its regulatory authority , ” Camp writes , “ I therefore request that …CMS immediately suspend this virtual gag order on efforts by an MA plan to let its enrollees know how they could be hurt by the health reforms plans being pushed by President .
Just so we ’re clear , Republican politicians , some of whom get plenty of money from Humana , are defending an insurer misleading Medicare recipients with taxpayer - subsidized communications .
Senate Minority Whip Jon Kyl ( R - Ariz . ) said he ’s only looking out for free - speech rights .
“ You do n’t lose your rights because you happen to sell insurance for heaven ’s sake , ” he said .
That is , of course , a foolish argument .
The government is paying the bills here .
Humana accepted lobbying and marketing limits when it started collecting tax dollars .
As Ryan Grim noted , “ Communication between the private Medicare Advantage providers and beneficiaries is strictly regulated because the private companies are using public dollars . ”
Republicans should n’t decry the attached strings simply because Humana and the GOP have the same goal — attacking health care reform .
In the meantime , Democrats on the Hill were quick to note the background of the company Republicans were desperate to defend : “ Humana was recently featured in a HuffPost story for denying health care due to lack of an enema .
In 2005 , it settled a racketeering suit for $ 40 million .
It settled a fraud lawsuit in 2000 for $ 14.5 million .
Since 2000 , its profits have soared from $ 90 million to $ 834 million . ”
Republicans often pick the wrong friends , do n’t they ?

NY Post
Dr. John Muney ’s unlimited office care for
uninsured patients got the thumbsdown
from the state .
The state is trying to shut down a New York City doctor ’s ambitious plan to treat uninsured patients for around $ 1,000 a year .
Dr. John Muney offers his patients everything from mammograms to mole removal at his AMG Medical Group clinics , which operate in all five boroughs .
“ I ’m trying to help uninsured people here , ” he said .
His patients agree to pay $ 79 a month for a year in return for unlimited office visits with a $ 10 co-pay .
But his plan landed him in the crosshairs of the state Insurance Department , which ordered him to drop his fixed - rate plan – which it claims is equivalent to an insurance policy .
Muney insists it is not insurance because it does n’t cover anything that he can’t do in his offices , like complicated surgery .
He points out his offices do not operate 24/7 so they can’t function like emergency rooms .
“ I ’m not doing an insurance business , ” he said .
“ I ’m just providing my services at my place during certain hours . ”
He says he can afford to charge such a small amount because he does n’t have to process mountains of paperwork and spend hours on billing .
“ If they leave me alone , I can serve thousands of patients , ” he said .
The state believes his plan runs afoul of the law because it promises to cover unplanned procedures – like treating a sudden ear infection – under a fixed rate .
That ’s something only a licensed insurance company can do .
“ The law is strict on how insurance is defined , ” said an Insurance Department spokesman .
A possible solution that Muney ’s lawyer crafted would force patients to pay more than $ 10 for unplanned procedures .
They are waiting to see if the state will accept the compromise .
Still , Muney is unhappy because , he said , “ I really do n’t want to charge more .
They ’re forcing me . ”
One of his patients , Matthew Robinson , 52 , was furious to learn the state was interfering with the plan .
“ The whole point is , he [ Muney ] found a way of paying his rent , paying his workers , and getting to see patients for the price , ” said Robinson .
“ How can the state dictate you ’ve got to charge more ? ”

Tickets for the NYC show are on sale August 7th , with a few pre-sales happening before that .
" Dethklok is both a fictional death metal band featured in the Adult Swim animated program Metalocalypse , created by Brendon Small and Tommy Blacha , and a virtual band created to perform the band 's music in live shows .
The band is sometimes cited as an example of " comedy rock " on par with bands such as GWAR and Spinal Tap . " [ Wiki ]
Not surprisingly , this tour is billed as " Adult Swim Presents " .
Dethklok will release their new album , Dethalbum II on 9/9/9 .
Meanwhile , High On Fire recently announced that they will begin work on the follow - up to Death Is This Communion , for a 2010 release date .

Suur Tõll
1980 , Rein Raamat
Posted by John Martz , September 30 , 2020
Suur Tõll is a Soviet - era retelling of the Estonian mythical god Toell the Great , a great giant hero , and king of the Baltic Sea island of Saaremaa .
Toell is large and in charge , easily angered , and seems to cause his share of destruction in his efforts to do good .
He 's like the Hulk , but with a weirdly - shaped head .
President Obama on Monday sternly admonished the financial industry and lawmakers to accept his proposals to reshape financial regulation to protect the nation from a repeat of the excesses that drove Lehman Brothers into bankruptcy and wreaked havoc on the global economy last year .
But with the markets slowly healing , Mr. Obama ’s plan to revamp financial rules faces a diminishing political imperative .
Disenchantment by many Americans with big government , along with growing obstacles from financial industry lobbyists pressing Congress not to do anything drastic , have also helped to stall his proposals .
Mr. Obama chastised Wall Street denizens in the audience at Federal Hall , at the foot of Wall Street .
“ Instead of learning the lessons of Lehman and the crisis from which we are still recovering , they are choosing to ignore them , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ They do so not just at their own peril , but at our nation ’s . ”
The speech came on the first anniversary of the collapse of Lehman Brothers and implicitly recognized that time was an enemy of reform .
Throughout history , most major laws to change the financial system arose from the cauldron of a crisis .
Senior officials have acknowledged that as the financial system begins to mend , a kind of political inertia sets in as lawmakers have less of an incentive to act boldly .

In short , a former and a current Blackwater employee have accused the company of , among other things , knowingly deploying mercenaries who had a history of unjustified and arbitrary killing of civilians , smuggling weapons , engaging in a prostitution ( including child prostitution ) ring , failing to provide medical aid to innocent civilians that were arbitrarily killed , and destroying evidence .
Not much comment to make here , other than , if this stuff is true , it should horrify everyone , regardless of ideology .
The declarations are a very short read , and very chilling .

I 've been called everything from stupid to a Microsoft fanboy in recent days for an opinion article criticizing Apple 's handling of a bug fix in the iPhone OS .
While there 's legitimate argument over how damaging Apple 's decisions were , many e-mails , comments , and blog posts show how few users really understand the issues around access policies when connecting to corporate servers .
And many bloggers are telling users that there 's a simple fix to this issue .
There is n't .
For many enterprises that allowed or were planning to allow iPhone access to their networks , Apple 's handling of this situation is , in some measure , a betrayal .
[ Read the article that set off the controversy over Apple 's handling of the iPhone 's Exchange policy support .
|
Learn how this is not the first time Apple had quietly fixed a policy bug in the iPhone . ]
First , a recap : A bug fix in the iPhone OS 3.1 update now ensures that iPhones and iPod Touches accurately report back to Microsoft Exchange servers whether they have on - device encryption enabled .
Prior to Version 3.1 , iPhone OSes reported to Exchange that the devices had on - device encryption despite the fact that no device prior to the iPhone 3G S included that functionality .
Because of this , Exchange servers set to allow connections only from devices with encryption enabled -- a federal and state requirement for many organizations -- have been accepting connections from unencrypted iPhones for more than a year .
Somewhere along the line , Apple figured this out .
And by not telling IT of this issue earlier , Apple has put many organizations at risk of noncompliance .
To add insult to injury , Apple 's quiet bug fix suddenly and unexpectedly caused encryption - requiring Exchange servers to block iPhone and iPod Touch users , except for those with iPhone 3G S and the late - 2009 - model iPod Touch devices .
This has caused headaches for many IT support staffs and embarrassed those IT admins who had convinced their companies to allow Apple 's technology into their sacrosanct networks .
i Phone users and IT admins dealing with this issue would be wise to avoid falling prey to the following myths circulating widely on the Web .
Myth 1 : You just need to turn off the policy at Exchange
Several blogs have recommended a quick fix to the access issue : Turn off Exchange 's on - device encryption policy requirement , and all iPhones and iPod Touches will then be able to connect to your network .
Incredibly , Apple makes the same recommendation on its support page .
Sure , it 's possible to change this setting , as AppleInsider explains in a recent blog post , but most enterprises will not .
They have that policy in place for a reason , and they 're not going to make an exception for the iPhone .
( Or other devices -- they 're not targeting the iPhone , despite what some conspiracists seem to think . )
In many cases , they would face huge costs if they did .
There are a bevy of regulations -- such as Sarbanes - Oxley , FIPS , HIPAA , and the privacy breach notification statutes in most states -- that require many companies to enforce various access and security policies for corporate and personal data .
For example , HIPAA ( which applies to the health care and insurance industries ) requires that patient data be kept confidential and cites encryption as an acceptable method of doing so .
The state privacy breach disclosure laws say that if data is encrypted on devices -- laptops , mobile devices , and so on -- companies do n't have to notify everyone whose personal information might have been on a lost or stolen device ; such notification costs a lot of time and money , and it damages the company 's reputation -- remember the brouhaha when a Veterans Affairs employee lost a laptop that had thousands of Social Security numbers on it ?
Good luck getting your corporation 's legal , security , and / or risk officers to grant iPhone users an exemption to such regulations just because their device can't support the encryption policy .
They 'd be foolish to say yes .
It 's like expecting a waiver from obeying speed limits because you drive a hybrid .
Sorry , public -- or in this case , corporate -- safety comes first .
If your company does n't need to follow these regulations , then maybe you can convince IT to drop the requirement for iPhone and / or other devices .
But do n't be surprised if IT still says no :
Even if not required to follow these regulations , many companies choose to do so to reduce their risks .
Myth 2 : Encryption can be broken , so it should n't be required
Yes , encryption can be broken , and it appears the iPhone 3G S's and most recent iPod Touch 's encryption is easily defeated .
But legally , if a device has encryption , it satisfies many of the regulations that apply to larger businesses .
That gives them a legal pass even if the data is ultimately compromised .
Can you really imagine a company not taking advantage of that legal pass just to satisfy iPhone users ?
Of course , many organizations -- especially those subject to Defense Department 's standards -- must support specific levels of encryption .
In those cases , you can bet that your choice of devices allowed onto the network will be very small : likely just some BlackBerry and Windows Mobile models .
And if your data really is supersecret , your company would n't allow it on a portable device anyhow , no matter what encryption is in use .
Myth 3 : The iPhone supports SSL encryption , so I 'm covered
Sorry , but SSL encrypts data as it is sent between the device and the server .
Most organizations require such encryption , which the iPhone does in fact support .
But SSL does not protect the data stored on the device , so it does n't satisfy that encryption policy requirement .
Myth 4 : You can require passwords and remote - wipe an iPhone , so you do n't need encryption
Yes , the iPhone supports these capabilities , though sometimes you need to use Apple 's free iPhone Configuration Utility to enable them .
But so what ?
Bottom line , some regulations require encryption .
They do n't say that you can substitute other policies in place of encryption .
( To learn more about using the iPhone Configuration Utility , see InfoWorld 's article " Can you manage an iPhone like a BlackBerry ? " )
By the way , some regulations require multiple policies be in force , such as insisting that the device be password - protected against use , that it be remote - wipe - enabled in case it is lost or stolen , that its built - in cameras are turned off , and that on - device encryption is enabled for corporate data .
Myth 5 : My laptop 's not encrypted , so my iPhone need n't be , either
It 's true that many organizations have not enabled encryption on laptops , though that 's been changing in recent years as the risks of having employees carry their data out the door have become clearer .
( For a good primer on how to deploy encryption , check out Mel Beckman 's article " Your laptop data 's not safe .
So fix it " on InfoWorld . )
Some argue that organizations that have fallen down on the job when it comes to laptops should thus relax the requirements on other devices .
Good luck there .
If your organization qualifies under regulations requiring encryption ( or any other access policies ) , you can bet that at some point all portable client devices will have to adhere .
Mobile devices are often the first targets because there are n't that many of them , and as the new device in the IT mix , it 's easier to start off requiring policy adherence .
You can bet that your laptops will get encrypted , too .
Myth 6 : It 's really Microsoft 's fault
One of the more ludicrous arguments I 've seen is that it's not Apple 's fault that the iPhone OS was misreporting to Exchange that it supported on - device encryption when it did not .
It 's Microsoft 's fault for not catching the lie .
That 's impossible .
As the folks at Internet security firm VeriSign explain , " It appears all policy conformance claims ( like this ActiveSync mailbox policy on device - encryption claim from the iPhone ) are not programmatically verifiable , so they 're not programmatically enforceable . "
In other words , Exchange can't peer into a client device and figure out what 's going on under the hood ; it has to rely on the client to be honest .
That makes sense :
How could Exchange or any server independently access all the kinds of devices out there and figure out how they 're set ?
Myth 7 : Microsoft 's software is so buggy , Apple should get a pass
The only more ridiculous argument along this vein is that because Microsoft produces such buggy , insecure software , Apple should n't be criticized when it has a bug .
Microsoft does produce a lot of buggy software .
There 's a reason it has a regular Patch Tuesday schedule to release fixes to the never - ending stream of bugs that Microsoft seems to generate .
[ To learn more about addressing the Mac 's security issues , see InfoWorld 's article " Mac ( in ) security : How to secure Macs in business . " ]
So what ?
Microsoft 's failures do n't justify Apple's .
Remember what your mother said :
If your friends jumped off a cliff , would you ?
I would argue that Apple has a higher standard to meet .
It 's needled Microsoft mercilessly for years about Windows ' proneness to viruses and other security flaws , leaving the ( false ) impression that its Mac OS X is somehow immune to them .
So Apple needs to be like Caesar 's wife : beyond reproach .
Of course , Mac admins know that Mac OS X is less susceptible to malware because hackers have focused on the hapless , widely deployed Windows instead , not because the Mac OS is inherently safer .
Mac admins also know Apple is often slow to fix bugs in its OS and rarely describes what it did fix .
Microsoft at least tells you , though buried in reams of documents that make you think it is trying to hide its flaws in plain site .
A related argument on some blogs is that Apple never promised that the iPhone would accurately report its on - device encryption status , so it is wrong to hold Apple accountable for the iPhone OS 's misrepresentation .
That 's an argument that justifies any poor product , and I doubt it 's a standard that any reputable company would hold itself to -- least of all Apple , which has staked its business on delivering exceptional products .

Simplicity in website design does n’t necessarily equate with a minimalist design aesthetic .
Simple sites just remove all unnecessary elements from the design , content , and code .
While minimalist sites generally fit this criteria , there are plenty of sites that would n’t , by any stretch of the imagination , be considered “ minimalist ” that still fit the definition of simple .
Below is a rundown of some of the benefits of simplified website designs , as well as some easy techniques for simplifying your own web design process .
Advantages of Simple Websites
1. Easier to Navigate
Simple websites do n’t have extraneous information .
This helps navigation in two wyas : generally , sites have fewer pages and sections ; and the design of the site is usually less cluttered , making it easier to find navigation elements .
Simplifying your website designs can be a great solution to navigation usability problems .
Here are some tips for simplifying your navigation :
Use only one main navigation menu .
Make sure navigation is consistent throughout the site .
Use subnavigation for individual sections to simplify your main navigation .
Do n’t use dropdowns for navigation , which can easily hide a cluttered menu .
Instead , force yourself to incorporate the navigation elements into the site ’s design .
Generally , this will result in cleaner navigation .
2. Simple Designs Load Faster
Simple designs generally result in smaller file sizes .
And smaller files load faster .
Also , if you keep your code simple and streamlined , you ’re less likely to be calling multiple stylesheets , a ton of JavaScript files , or lots of other content that increases the number of HTTP requests your site makes .
Faster loading and faster responding websites improve user experience .
3. Content is More “ Scannable ”
When there are n’t tons of complicated decorative elements in your site ’s design , your content takes center stage .
Content that is put to the forefront of a website is easier to scan by visitors .
One study showed that 79 % of test users scanned any new page they visited , while only 16 % read the page word - for - word .
It ’s better to work with these scanning visitors than to try to fight them .
By putting your content front - and - center , you make it easier for visitors to quickly scan what ’s there .
These visitors will perceive your site as more user - friendly and are more likely to return in the future .
4. Simple Sites are Quicker to Design and Build
If your site ’s design is simple , the code will likely follow suit .
Designing a site with a simple layout , one or two page templates , and simple typography is a lot quicker than designing a site with eight sections ( each with different page templates ) , complex typography , and a background that needs complicated slicing and coding .
Just beware of creating a site that looks simple but is actually very complex .
Aim to keep your code as bare - bones as possible .
Sometimes just tweaking a margin or padding on a certain element or moving something around a little bit can make it possible to greatly simplify your site ’s code without making any noticeable impact on the frontend design .
5. Simple Code is Easier to Debug
If your code is simplified , it ’s easier to find bugs .
If you have a stylesheet with 300 different properties , it ’s going to take you a lot longer to figure out why something is n’t working than if you have 30 .
Look for ways to simplify your code right from the outset .
Things like combining CSS properties and definitions can make your stylesheets a whole lot shorter .
Combining stylesheets or JavaScript files can also greatly simplify your overall code .
And take advantage of automated programs that can strip out unnecessary markup from your stylesheets , scripts , and other files before you upload them ( just make sure you double - check that everything still works as intended ) .
6. Smaller File Sizes Mean Less Server Space
It ’s already been mentioned that simple sites generally have smaller file sizes than complex ones .
This means that your sites will take up less server space and bandwidth than other sites .
While this might not be a big deal for a site with only a few thousand visitors a month or with limited content , for site with more pages and more visitors , this can actually add up to a huge savings .
Consider that some minimalist homepages with few images might be less than 100kb , while more complicated sites can sometimes approach 1 mb .
That means that you could have ten times as much traffic with the simple site for the same cost as the more complicated one .
If you have a lot of content or a lot of visitors , it makes sense to simplify your site and reduce your file sizes .
How to Simplify Your Websites
Remove unnecessary decorative elements
Many initial website designs incorporate a lot of decorative elements that really serve no purpose .
While it ’s not necessary to remove every decorative element from your designs , removing at least some of them can often make your site appear cleaner and more polished .
Elements that might be able to be removed or simplified include image borders , drop shadows , extra images in your header or footer , and extra illustrative images on individual pages ( oftentimes one or two images is plenty ) .
Ask yourself : “ Is this element really important ? ”
This is somewhat of the “ golden question ” when creating simple websites .
On every element , whether design , code , or content , you should be asking yourself if it ’s really necessary .
Look at what elements on your site could be combined , too .
Are there pages that could be combined into one ?
Can you combine styles to simplify your stylesheets ?
There are almost certainly elements within your design and code that can be combined to simplify things .
Make sure the backend of your site is as simple as the frontend
So many designers only focus on the frontend of their designs and pay little attention to their code .
Some simple - looking sites are a mess in the backend .
Make sure that the markup for your site is as simple as you can make it .
This could be limiting the number of styles in your stylesheets or the number of JavaScript effects you use .
It also means writing good , standards - compliant markup .
This also means you should choose an appropriate CMS for your site ’s backbone .
Some CMSs are overly complicated and , while some sites benefit from their complexity , they can easily be overkill for a lot of sites .
Choose a CMS that offers only the functions you need or allows you to turn functionality on and off as needed .
Excellent Examples of Simple Website Designs
Below are a dozen examples of great , simple website designs to get you thinking about how to simplify your own designs .

If you talk to doctors about malpractice , you come to realize that the root of their objections is n’t financial .
Yes , the money matters , and , yes , there are horror stories about $ 200,000 premiums for malpractice insurance .
But most premiums are nowhere near that high .
All told , jury awards , settlements and administrative costs  which , by definition , are similar to the combined cost of insurance  add up to less than $ 10 billion a year .
This equals less than one - half of a percentage point of medical spending .
There have been years when malpractice payouts rose sharply , but there have also been years when they did not .
Over the last two decades , the amount has increased roughly in line with total medical spending , according to a study in the journal Health Affairs , based on a national database .
This being said , the malpractice system does affect the morale of doctors .
It leaves them wondering when they will be publicly accused of doing the very thing they ’ve sworn not to do : harm patients .
Dr. S. Anthony Wolfe , the chief of plastic surgery at Miami Children ’s Hospital , told me he had been to court three times in the last 34 years and won all three times .
“ But it was a Pyrrhic victory , ” he said .
He spent weeks in court , enduring “ rude , demeaning and endless depositions and badgering . ”
You can understand why such experiences would lead doctors to order extra tests and treatments .
Perhaps the best - known study of defensive medicine  by Dr. Mark McClellan , who later ran Medicare in the Bush administration , and Daniel Kessler  compared cardiology treatment in states that had capped malpractice awards in the 1980s and early ’90s with those that did n’t .
In the states without caps , stenting and other treatments were more common , but the outcomes were no better .
Later research  into various surgical operations , for instance  has found less of evidence of defensive medicine .
But Mr. Chandra points out that this later work ( including some of his own ) is not as elegant as the cardiology paper .
States have not made as many changes to malpractice law in recent years , which makes research tricky .
That ’s why Mr. Chandra ’s estimate of the cost of defensive medicine , up to $ 60 billion a year , stems largely from the cardiology work .
Obviously , the precise amount of defensive medicine can never be known .
Anyone who sets out to find a certain answer will be able to cite one study or another .
( One good example of ideology dressed up as economics : the American Medical Association does not adjust for inflation when claiming that malpractice costs are soaring . )
Still , the researchers in the field tend to agree about the scale of the problem  and how much malpractice reform might accomplish .
How'd the site come about ?
Like all satire , somebody just thought it would be funny and went for it :
One of the Fark readers then took the forum meme to the next level , registering a domain name and launching a web site in order to make a point about talking head TV demagoguery .
" Why wo n't Glenn Beck deny these allegations ? " asks the site .
" We 're not accusing Glenn Beck of raping and murdering a young girl in 1990 — in fact , we think he did n't !
But we can't help but wonder , since he has failed to deny these horrible allegations .
Why wo n't he deny that he raped and killed a young girl in 1990 ? "
At the very bottom of the page was a small text disclaimer saying that the site was satirical .
The site went big , fast -- more than 120 K hits in a day after it went up on September 1 .
Beck immediately went berserk :
By September 3 , lawyers for Beck 's media company , Mercury Radio Arts , had contacted the domain registrar demanding that the " highly defamatory domain name " glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com be deleted , that the WhoisGuard privacy protection service be revoked , and that the owner 's contact information be turned over to the lawyers .
Heck , he even took it international !
Beck 's lawyers also filed a case with the World Intellectual Property Organization ( WIPO ) in Switzerland , the group which handles the worldwide domain dispute resolution process , on the grounds that the new website was improperly using Glenn Beck 's trademarked name .
Poor Glenn Beck .
The actual legal case is n't clear cut -- check the Ars article for the details -- but it sure sounds like he 's feeling the pressure these days .
Who could have predicted that his dangerous and extremist fear - mongering would lead to people returning the favor ?
Speaking of which ...
UNITED NATIONS —
The United Nations at dawn on the morning of the opening session of the General Assembly resembles a Hollywood disaster movie : the tense quiet over Manhattan ahead of an apocalyptic catastrophe or an alien assault .
Eerie calm prevailed for several blocks around the gigantic building looming over New York ’s East River .
Armed police , Secret Service officers and SWAT teams poised with assault rifles , manned roadblocks and checked the armored black SUVs cruising the restricted zone .
Inside the green tower of Babel was a hive of activity .
Leaders arrived for the most important day in the annual schedule .
Aides , translators , delegates and journalists rushed through the marble hallways .
Just past the columns of satellite trucks lined outside the building , U.N. correspondents previewed the controversies of the day : would Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad throw a gauntlet to the West ?
Would he " unintentionally " brush against U.S. President Barack Obama just as former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had once lain in ambush for then Iranian President Mohammad Khatami ?
What fresh outrage would the theatrical Libyan President Moammar Gadhafi spring in his first appearance at the world ’s podium ?
We were here on the last leg of a documentary shoot that took us from Istanbul to Paris , London and then Washington in an effort to understand where Iran stood 100 days after the June presidential election tumbled the country into its current political crisis .
For me , the journey had been longer :
After being imprisoned in a jail cell in Tehran ’s Evin Prison , I was now treading the halls of the U.N. to ask the Iranians some burning questions .
For three weeks , I was held in an isolation cell after the disputed presidential elections , alongside dozens of Iranian colleagues branded as subversives by the regime for their reporting of events .
Now I had come to New York in the hope that I could set some tough questions for the Iranian president :
If he had really won such an overwhelming majority , why had he cracked down so harshly on the demonstrators ?
Why was state - run television banned from mentioning the opposition candidates ’ names ?
And where next for a government viewed by many inside Iran as illegitimate ?
The U.N. accreditation process for journalists redefines bureaucracy .
After a two - week screening , we were accepted .
Turning up at 7 a.m. , we were photographed , filed and issued with a building pass .
After registering at a chaotic room called the Liaison Desk , we entered the dance for a fistful of colored papers , each allowing access to different areas .
As one journalist put it , “ the places where we ’re allowed to be are not the places where we should be . ”
Others had given up and fatalistically filmed the screens broadcasting speeches from inside the main hall .
Two Iranian journalists freshly arrived from Tehran struggled to fill in accreditation forms .
One of them spoke fluent English but his alert , 50 - something colleague with a military posture did not understand a word .
“ Do n’t help them , ” the Chinese - American lady handling accreditations advised sotto voce .
“ Be politically correct . ”
Later , we heard from an Iranian journalist that U.N. security had been instructed to tail any Persian speakers .
If we ’d thought that our sheafs of paper and plastic passes meant we could move around at will , we were seriously misled .
Escorts shepherded cameramen , correspondents and photographers around a warren of exposed concrete back - passages and hallways covered in stained , frayed carpet , ushering them into small rooms or overcrowded galleries that looked over the assembly itself .
After the claustrophobia of passing through checkpoints and past armed guards , the first glimpse of the cavernous assembly hall was breathtaking .
Stacked in double - tiered rows fanning out from the speaker ’s podium , hundreds of diplomats and heads of state sat hushed as U.S. President Obama addressed the U.N. for the first time .
But Obama ’s star presence did not carry the day .
With Third World authoritarian populists like Iran ’s Ahmadinejad and Libya ’s Ghadafi in attendance , this year was billed as the most controversial inaugural session ever .
From where I half - hanged out of a press box , I could see Gadhafi immediately below me , swathed in desert robes upon which a badge of the African continent ( his latest revolutionary cause ) was pinned .
He listened distractedly to simultaneous translation and occasionally dabbed at his crevassed face with a scarlet handkerchief .
Across the hall , Iran ’s monolingual president sat erectly at his seat , watching uncomprehendingly the man who had offered him a hand for an “ unclenched fist . ”
It was a perfect case of the man who thinks he knows it all .
“ Just being in the room and hearing an American president speak was a symbolic move for Ahmadinejad since American delegations during the Bush years always made a point of walking out when Iran ’s turn came round , ” said Hooman Majd , the author of " The Ayatollah Begs to Differ . "
The Americans were not to return the gesture .
By the time Ahmadinejad climbed the podium in the evening , a gapingly empty U.S. seat greeted the Iranian ’s defiant rhetoric .
The U.K. , Canada and Israel also snubbed the diminutive dictator .
As night fell and we left the building , television spotlights illuminated network correspondents doing stand - ups to a backdrop of limousines sweeping out .
A little further along , hundreds of demonstrators waved Shah - era flags and — in a grisly piece of street theater involving whip - snapping revolutionary guardsmen and giggling Shiite mullahs — re-enacted the killing of Iranian demonstrator Neda Agha Soltan .
Thousands of Iran 's diaspora opposition descended on the U.N. from around the U.S. and Canada ( some even flying out from Iran ) .
The chanting crowd formed an angry sea of protest but well beyond the hearing of the Iranian VIPs .
After all the drama of Obama ’s outreach and Ahmadinejad ’s contested re-election , it was business as usual at the U.N. : a confrontational speech , a U.S. walkout and exile protests outside .
Plus ca change …
Calendar
Days and Dates
Dates and times are recorded using the typical notation of Astrology , indicating the positions of the Sun and Moon in the tropical zodiac .
The day of the week is recorded in Latin .
Precision
The more precisely the solar and lunar positions are noted , the more precisely the date and time will be known .
The Moon takes about 2.3 days to move through a zodiacal sign .
Simply recording the signs that the Sun and Moon are in will therefore only describe a period of slightly more than two standard days .
Recording the day of the week eliminates the possibility of uncertainty about the day referred to .
In addition , more precision can be had by indicating the degrees , minutes , and seconds of the position of the Sun and Moon .
Symbolism
The planetary assignment of days of the week and the tracking of the sun and moon through the zodiac all tap into a great wealth of symbolism .
Events may be scheduled according to their symbolic relevance : for example , the installation of a lodgemaster on Dies Jovii ( the day of Jupiter ) .
Examples
The following are examples of accepted ways to record the same Thelemic date , beginning with the most precise .
Sol 22°13 '5 " Taurus , Luna 29°6 ' 19 " Pisces , dies Saturnii
Sol 22°13 ' Taurus , Luna 29°6 '

How To Get Your Love On /
What , you think you know ?
Think you have some tiny idea of how love works ?
Are you high ?
I am not married .
I have never , to the best of my knowledge , been married .
I do not have any children of which I am right now aware .
I am , in fact , recently single again for the first time in many years .
Also : no mortgage .
No debt .
No daily array of behavioral meds ( yet ) .
No significant or particularly dangerous skeletons -- none that can speak or call the CIA or reveal the location of the photographs buried on my hard drive , anyway .
This , as you might imagine , is a weirdly fascinating position to be in , and not only because many of my long - coupled friends think I must 've won some sort of amazing social lottery , with the prize being a debauched free - for - all of sybaritic adventure .
Nor is it because I 'm now apparently supposed to learn the skill that is pornographic text messaging or that I must now stock up on loathed condoms and certainly not because I have to practice sifting out all the women who insist on listing Dave Matthews and / or their five cats as their BFFs on Craigslist or Nerve personals .
No , when you 're single and you 've finally made it past the age when you 've felt both love 's deepest tongue probings and also its most random horror - flick slashings , past the age when getting moronically drunk every weekend and hooking up is the ultimate goal and you 've had enough sex to fill a thousand porn movies and everyone around you is no longer on some sort of giddy , wide - eyed first - adult - relationship must - get - married must - have - babies track of impossibly optimistic utopian desire , what it means , at least for me , is that you get to become this odd sort of sounding board -- a blank slate of love 's warped potential , a reason for others to extrapolate on the nature of love and life and sex and how goddamn difficult / wonderful / impossible it all really is .
Which is merely another way of saying , I am learning something .
Or rather , re-learning .
Or rather , having something everyone sort of knows but no one really talks all that much about because it's so damn obvious and also painful and fraught and wonderful , pounded back into my thick skull in a delightfully unexpected way .
Here is the big lesson , the thing that keeps coming at me , again and again and again :
No one has the slightest clue how to make love work .
I know .
Shocking .
But truly , it 's weirder that you might think .
See , singlehood at my pseudo - mature age can be a time of profound cleansing , of enjoying the moment as you ready for the new , of trying to figure out just what you 're all about and what you really want and how to go about getting it , or not getting it , or letting it all go and not attaching to it so that it may find you , in the healthiest and sexiest and most honest way possible .
And so , you look around .
And you ask .
And you get feedback , comments , perspectives from all those in various stages of lovedom around you .
( Very few of my circle are single , and if they are , they 're almost certainly seeking that special one to make it all make sense . )
And that feedback ain't what it used to be .
If it ever was .
For every happily married couple I know ( and I do know a few ) , there are three more who are confused and tense and battling all sorts of doubt and crisis and regret .
For every wedding announcement , there are two more separations .
For every guy I know who 's tremendously happy to be settled , there 's another who wishes he could 've had " just one more year " of unbridled freedom .
It goes on .
For every woman I know who simply can't wait to have kids and who tears up in front of a newborn and whose biological clock is ticking like Dick Cheney 's pacemaker in a gay fetish dungeon , there 's another who has quietly realized she should maybe never have become a mother .
Or that it 's not all it 's cracked up to be .
Or that it 's wonderful and profound , but oh my God the changes and the sacrifices are just never - ending and it's insanely difficult and You .
Have .
No. Idea .
What , still too obvious ?
Oh , it gets juicier .
Couples you think were rock solid and perfect have fallen apart , screamingly .
Couples you thought would n't last a year have made it to 10 and show no signs of slowing .
Couples who got together in college and were miserably mismatched took a decade off and had lots of sex with other people and then got back together and it's now the perfect , true thing .
More or less .
Unless it 's not .
See , at a certain point , all the variants become so astounding , so dizzying , so universal , that you finally realize ( yes , for the 1,000th time ) there is no rule .
There is no pattern .
The exceptions are the rule .
There is no approach that , overall , seems to work for most people most of the time .
There 's not even a hint of a possibility of a whisper of a rule and anyone who deigns to tell you differently , be it a church or a parent or a relationship guru , is , to put it gently , astoundingly full of crap .
This is why God laughs .
This is why the fates roll their eyes and belch .
Because you think you know .
You think you have this crude set of boundaries and guidelines that you insist you will live by as you head into uncharted waters of love and sex and attraction , and these silly notions grow and thrive and breed like happy Mormons all through your 20s and 30s , when all your friends are hooking up and all the marriages are fresh as squirted mother 's milk and all the love is sweet and skittering and hot and everything seems aimed toward the positive , the perfect , the right .
And then , time happens .
Fights .
Breakdowns .
Crisis .
Fertility issues .
Financial stress .
Loveless marriages .
Sexless marriages .
Second marriages .
Unwanted kids .
Wanted kids who end up being the repository of all the angst of the loveless marriage .
Divorce .
Step children .
Open relationships .
Closed relationships .
Polyamory .
Experimentation .
Sperm donation .
Therapy .
Also : Cancer . Disease .
Accidents .
Death .
Rebirth .
Morning breath .
Oh , and one more : Infidelity .
Oh yes .
Here is perhaps the most fascinating topic of all , the soul 's dirty little secret , the hottest of love 's hotbuttons .
Because maybe you used to look at adultery and say , oh my God , no way , it 's just so wrong , horrible , hurtful , dangerous .
Maybe it was even your absolute rule .
Unassailable .
You simply do not cheat .
Do not wander .
Not ever .
No no no no no .
Except , yes .
Except when you get to know someone -- or perhaps multiple someones -- for whom , for whatever unexpected reason and unquantifiable mutation of love and body and life , it becomes actually understandable .
Justifiable .
Encouraged , even .
Still painful , hurtful , dangerous ?
Yes .
But if you 're honest , your boundaries will shift .
Your definitions will blur .
And what 's more , you realize that this is how it has to be .
Maybe it 's simply a case of the more you learn the less you understand .
Maybe it 's all about the wisdom of aging .
Maybe it 's a big fat case of just when you think you might have some of it figured out , the world spins and spits and slaps your warily romantic little ass and makes you realize you 're completely full of s--.
Me , I like to think it 's simply because , for the most part , we 're still just one big gaggle of spiritual infants , still love 's little quivering carry - on Chihuahua : trembling and jumpy and sweet and trying like hell to work through the infinitely frustrating , cruelly painful , orgasmically delicious variants of how the human soul can get its love on .
And baby , from what I can tell right now , we 've got one hell of a long way to go .

Cannabis ' is not harmless ' warns coroner after drug use triggers teenager 's fatal fit
A coroner has condemned claims that smoking cannabis is ' harmless ' after hearing how it triggered the death of a teenager who had given up smoking the drug .
Cheshire deputy coroner Geoff Roberts said it was a misconception to think cannabis was safe to use after it directly led to the death of teenager Adie Gardner .
The 17 - year - old suffered a fatal seizure in front of his father in October last year just months after quitting cannabis to take up his first ever job .
Coroner Geoff Roberts cannabis was never harmless to use after it directly led to the death of teenager Adie Gardner .
File photo
Doctors who examined the the trainee chef 's body confirmed Adie had not taken cannabis in the run up to his death .
But the coroner heard how his body had been ravaged so badly by the effects of his past misuse that it killed him .
An inquest in Macclesfield , Cheshire , was told Adie had fallen victim to a ' legacy ' of using the drug in the past .
Mr Roberts said : ' People use cannabis and think it is a harmless property .
But we have heard clear evidence in this case that it is not .
' Very sadly this young man died as a result of the direct toxic effects on the heart that the use of cannabis had , as such it was an avoidable death . '
Mr Roberts ruled Adie 's death was caused as a result of using drugs .
The coroner added the teenager had used cannabis over a period of time and that his death was all the more tragic as he had given up the drug and was turning his life around .
' This is a very sad case because despite his turbulent past and cannabis use , he had got a job as a trainee chef , ' the coroner said .
' The post mortem showed no findings of recent drug use .
But his body was left with a legacy of using cannabis in the past which directly led to his death . '
Adie , whose real name was Hadrian , led a ' turbulent ' life taking drugs and was expelled from the former 1,000 puil Henbury High comprehensive school , the coroner was told .
The teenager had suffered a heart attack the year before his death , but had vowed to turn his life round after being offered a place on a scheme run by Cheshire Fire Service aimed at ' hard to reach ' youngsters .
He visited fire stations and learned how to be good citizen before taking a ' big step forward ' in taking a job as a trainee chef at Prestbury Village Restaurant .
He died in October last year on only his second day at work .
Adie 's father , Robert Gardner , told the inquest he was waiting to pick his son up from the Village Restaurant when his son began to fit .
He told the hearing : ' He came out of the restaurant , crossed the triangular piece of grass and then stumbled and fell on the pavement .
' It was a bit surreal .
He fitted for about ten seconds . '
Paramedics rushed to the scene but battled in vain to save him and he was later pronounced dead at Macclesfield Hospital .
Dr Mark Nicol , who treated the teenager at Macclesfield A&E , said in his report that the case was ' unique ' as he had been admitted to A&E in 2007 after suffering a heart attack .
On that occasion , doctors were able to revive him .
Dr Nicol said , ' Drug problems were acknowledged at that time .
This case highlights that Cannabis is potentially life threatening .
Dr Sally Hales , who carried out the post mortem , said in her report to the coroner that there were no traces of cannabis or other illegal drugs in Adie 's body when he died .
Dr Hales examined the heart and concluded the teenager had myocarditis - an inflammation of the heart .
Sh said 'a history of using cannabis , amphetamines and cocaine would appear to be the most likely cause ' of the teenager 's death .
After the inquest , Adie 's former boss at the Prestbury Village Restaurant paid tribute to the youngster .
Manager Rick Palmer said : ' He was a nice lad who worked hard .
He was reliable , no trouble and good to work with .
His death was a total shock to us all . '
Motivational music has been used by the military for centuries , but in modern wars , soldiers are bringing their own playlists
It was a throwaway statistic in an article about the heavy metal band Slayer that got Jonathan Pieslak thinking .
During the Gulf war , he read , some 40 % of the band 's fan mail came from soldiers stationed in the Middle East .
Professor Pieslak is a music theorist at the City College of New York .
Over the past few years he has interviewed US soldiers about the music they listen to and – more importantly – what they listen to it for .
You would n't expect much Chris de Burgh or Barry White to come floating over the barbed wire fences around military camps in Iraq or Afghanistan , and Pieslak 's research confirms the hunch .
The playlists are dominated by Slayer , Metallica , Eminem and others .
What 's interesting about the work is not so much which bands soldiers are drawn to , but the extraordinary terms they use to describe the power the music has over them .
Some talk about tracks turning them into monsters , making them inhuman so they can do inhuman acts .
The subjects of Pieslak 's interviews are among the first generation to take MP3 players to war .
Some , only half joking , say iPods should be standard issue for soldiers .
The psychological effect the music has , and highly stressful situations , make for a powerful mix .
There 's some fascinating psychology and ethics in this , but also questions for neuroscientists .
How does the combination of the group , a stressful situation , and very specific tracks , or types of music , combine to produce such a powerful motivational , even transformative effect ?
What does this tell us about people listening to this kind of music in their daily lives as civilians ?
Pieslak has kindly made some of his audio files available for us to post .
We also interview him on this week 's science podcast .
The audio files we do n't include in the podcast are added below .

By now you ’ve probably heard about the Glen Burnie family that stored their 83 - year - old grandmother ’s dead body in a freezer : http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/anne-arundel/bal-md.ar.freezer15jul15,0,168200.story.
It turns out that no law was broken .
Yep , dumping a body is legal around here .
Health care workers and other professionals are required to report deaths , but ordinary citizens are not .
And , apparently , no state law prohibits the burial or storage of a body on private property .
I ’m a laid - off Baltimore - area homeowner .
After ten months of unemployment , and the future looking even more grim , I ’m willing to consider allowing my backyard to be used for body dumping .
Call it private burial if you prefer .
I could probably take a half - dozen bodies without arousing the attention of neighbors .
It would n’t hurt to have one under the garden too .
Me : A discreet Baltimore County homeowner with a half - acre of easily tillable property on a quiet dead - end street .
You :
An individual ( not a health care worker or other professional required to report a death ! ) with the awkward inconvenience of disposing of a deceased relative , friend , colleague or acquaintance .
You must provide your own trash bags , tarp , quicklime , shovel , etc .
I might be available to hold a flashlight , but I wo n’t do any heavy lifting .
Accidental deaths or natural causes only .
I ’m not going to get involved in any shenanigans with Omar wannabes .
I will not be a participant in , or an accessory to , any sort of crime .
This is a limited time offer !
Act now before the state legislature changes the law !
If and when the law changes ( measures failed 10 years ago , after the 1999 incident ) , you ’ll be grandfathered , literally and figuratively .
Price is negotiable .
Serious inquiries only .

Volunteers are asked to bring a valid medical or dental license , but all supplies are provided .
Nonmedical volunteers are also need , according to the organization ’s Twitter feed , including those who simply stand in line as placeholders for patients waiting for multiple services .
The organization also continues to put out the call for volunteers , including oral surgeons , dental and optical technicians .
The free medical clinic at the Forum in Inglewood reached capacity again Wednesday , as hundreds camped out overnight to receive medical and dental care .
More than 2,000 sought services on the first day of the medical clinic -- and hundreds were turned away .
People were lined up Tuesday night , hoping to get in .
The MTA announced it was extending service of Line 115 because of " overwhelming demand " for rides to the clinic , which runs for eight days .
On Tuesday , procedures included 95 tooth extractions , 22 oral surgeries , 470 fillings , prescriptions for 140 eyeglasses , 45 mammograms , 43 HIV tests and 96 Pap smears .
The Remote Area Medical Foundation is a trailer - equipped service that has staged health clinics in rural parts of the United States , Mexico and South America .
It brought its health camp to urban Los Angeles County on Tuesday to begin a stint that the group 's officials described as its first foray into a major urban setting .
Organizers expected big crowds in a county with high unemployment and an estimated 22 % of working - age adults lacking health insurance .
On Tuesday , the turnout was so large that hundreds had to be turned away .
" We 're shorthanded , " said the mobile clinic 's founder , Stan Brock .
About 100 dentists were needed , but only about 30 showed up Tuesday .
Twenty eye doctors were required , but only about five were on hand , Brock said .
The mobile clinic , based in Knoxville , Tenn. , has staged 576 medical clinics over the last 25 years .
They have treated nearly 380,000 patients and provided care valued at $ 36.9 million , said Executive Director Karen Wilson .
The group raises money through contributions .
Doctors , nurses and other medical workers who donated their time said most visitors ' ailments were basic .
But " many have chronic diseases -- high blood pressure , diabetes , asthma -- conditions we can't deal with in just one day , " said Dr. Nancy Greep of Santa Monica .
Some had problems , such as a recurring cancer , that demand long - term treatment .

On November 18 , 1883 , precisely at noon , North American railroads switched to a new standard time system for rail operations , which they called Standard Railway Time ( SRT ) .
Almost immediately after being implemented , many American cities enacted ordinances , thus resulting in the creation of time “ zones . ”
The four standard time zones adopted were Eastern , Central , Mountain , and Pacific .
Though tailored to the railroad companies ’ train schedules , the new system was quickly adopted nationwide , forestalling federal intervention in civil time for more than thirty years , until 1918 , when daylight saving time was introduced .
Before clocks , people marked time by the sun and the phases of the moon .
With the development of the railway and the invention of the telegraph , accurate time became more important .
Prior to adopting SRT , trains traveling east or west between towns had a difficult time maintaining coherent schedules and smooth operations .
The new time zones were each one - hour wide , simplifying train schedules and virtually everything else in increasingly industrialized America .
The SRT system was based on geography , economics , the locations of major cities , and the habits and needs of the populace .
The one - hour difference in zones was a result of the fact that fifteen degrees of longitude corresponds to one - hour difference in solar time .
It was decided that official time would correspond to the mean solar time of the closest meridian of longitude that could be divided evenly by fifteen degrees and was referenced to the meridian at Greenwich , England .
There are twenty - four meridians fifteen degrees apart that circle the globe , beginning with Greenwich , the “ prime ” meridian .
Impetus for the adoption of standardized time , however , did not originate with the railroads .
Astronomers and geophysicists , trying to get simultaneous observations from scattered geographical locations , had long advocated standardized time .
Beginning in 1875 , Cleveland Abbe — astronomer , meteorologist , and the first head of the U.S. Weather Bureau — lobbied the American Meteorological Society ( AMS ) to take action on a uniform standard time .
The AMS then established the Committee on Standard Time and named Abbe chairman .
In 1879 , the committee ’s Report on Standard Time , the key document leading to the implementation of standard time in the U.S. , was released .
In 1881 , the railroad industry ’s General Time Convention ( GTC ) , a group of officials involved in scheduling , took up the proposal for standardizing time and in 1883 , convinced by the AMS report , decided to adopt SRT .
The following year , a conference in Washington took up the proposal for international implementation .
The goals of the 1884 International Meridian ConferenceExternal , were to agree on a common initial meridian ( in consideration of the longstanding preference for the Greenwich meridian ) and ultimately to standardize time worldwide .
A globally recognized initial ( prime ) meridian had to be established because , unlike latitude , there is no obvious starting point for the meridian lines around the globe that specify east - west positions of longitude , and thus one had to be designated and agreed upon .
Greenwich , England , site of the Royal Observatory , was already widely used by mariners , mapmakers , and navigators , and was the prime candidate .
Its selection by the railroads also forestalled potential conflict between U.S. cities vying for the honor .
International time zones were established according to the SRT system that was implemented in 1893 , creating Universal Time ( UT ) based on the Greenwich meridian , which became “ time zero . ”
The twenty - four standard meridians marked the centers of the zones around the globe .
An artist 's impression of Corot - 7 b Astronomers say they are now confident that a planet orbiting a star some 500 light - years away is rocky .
Detailed observations show the world , dubbed Corot - 7b , to have a mass just five times that of the Earth .
Combined with the object 's known radius , the measurement means the far - off world should be solid in nature .
Most of planets identified outside our Solar System are so big they are almost certainly gas giants like our Jupiter and Saturn .
But it is unlikely that life could survive on the surface of Corot - 7b because the temperatures would be blistering .
The planet is only 2.5 million km away from its host star , or 1 / 23rd of the distance from Mercury to the Sun .
The discovery of Corot - 7b was announced in February .
It was detected using the French - led Corot spacecraft .
The satellite is equipped with a sensitive telescope and camera - system which hopes to catch a planet as it crosses the face of a distant " sun " , dimming its light ever so slightly .
This transit method , as it is known , established that the planet has a radius that is about 80 % greater than the Earth's .
The Corot approach , though , cannot , establish the mass of the planet ; and without the mass , the density ( and an assessment of its rockiness ) cannot be firmly established .
To fix this number , scientists went to the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher ( Harps ) spectrograph attached to the European Southern Observatory 's 3.6 m telescope at La Silla in Chile .
It investigates planets in a different way , recording the " wobble " a massive object will induce in its parent star as it orbits about it .
The observations with Harps infer that Corot - 7b has a mass of about five Earth masses , making the exoplanet 's density very similar to the Earth's .
This is compelling evidence that it is a solid , rocky world .
" This is science at its thrilling and amazing best , " said Didier Queloz , leader of the team that made the Harps observations .
" We did everything we could to learn what the object discovered by the Corot satellite looks like and we found a unique system . "

here is the latest news from the zionist terrorist colonist regime : Education Minister Gideon Sa�ar briefed the cabinet on plans for the start of the school year , and announced that the word " nakba " will be taken out of lesson plans .
" It can be said with certainty that Arab Israelis experienced a tragedy in the war , but there will be no use of the word ' nakba , � whose meaning is similar to holocaust in this context , " said Sa�ar .
" The education system in the Arab sector will revise its studies about the homeland , geography , and society in elementary schools . " interestingly , palestinian refugees are asking unrwa to remove material about the nazi holocaust from the palestinian curriculum in their schools :
A group of refugee camp committees in the Gaza Strip wants the United Nations to remove history of the Jewish Holocaust from its classroom curriculum .
According to a letter sent to UNRWA director John Ging , the committees urged the refugee agency to scrap its program because mention of the genocide " confirms the Holocaust and raises sympathy for Jews . "
UNRWA did not immediately return calls seeking comment .
In an extraordinary ruling , U.S. District Court Judge Loretta Preska ordered the Federal Reserve to turn over records of the details concerning the lending of taxpayers ’ money to financial institutions and banks .
The lawsuit was filed by Bloomberg LP , parent of the Bloomberg News division which sought to look over the documents detailing the actions of the Federal Reserve in dispersing up to $ 2 trillion in funds to numerous banking companies .
Some of the details sought by Bloomberg were what assets were put up by the banks , who the borrowers were , and how much the loans were .
The Fed asserted that revealing this information could result in runs on some of the institutions given the taxpayer bailouts .
And we should care why ?
We have to understand what the Federal Reserve and Ben Bernanke are saying here .
They want to hide the weak banks from the public , who not only were fleeced of their future through the misguided Fed actions , but were kept in the dark as to whether their money was safe in the very institutions they were tapped to bail out .
It ’s really outrageous when you think of it .
The Fed is literally saying they do n’t want a run on these weak banks by depositors .
Why ?
The bottom line is they do n’t like the idea of consumers holding true democratic power where they vote with their decisions on where they want to place their money .
And when they find out who these weak banks or financial institutions are , darn right they should take their money out .
Who is the Federal Reserve and under what authority do they decide the data and information we are allowed to see in order to make these decisions ?
Under the Freedom of Information Act , Bloomberg based his case , and citing the judge said the Fed “ improperly withheld agency records ” by “ conducting an inadequate search . ”
In other words , the Fed simply did n’t want to turn over the documents after finding them , and tried to leave it at that .
Per the ruling , Preska gave the Federal Reserve five days to turn the documents over to Bloomberg News reporters , who were told by the Fed long ago that they had found them .
Because the Federal Reserve in New York operates most of the loan programs , the judge added they must do a more thorough search there for documents as well and turn them over .
If you ’re not familiar with the history of the Federal Reserve , it ’s hard to understand what has happened with this ruling , but it ’s huge .
We will get the first look at these types of workings within the Fed from the first time it was launched in 1913 .
It will only be a glimpse of their recent actions , but that should open up a crack which hopefully will lead to a full - fledged audit of the Federal Reserve based on the HR 1207 bill introduced by Rep.
Ron Paul , R - Texas , who has a large , bipartisan group of 250 lawmakers that have cosponsored the bill .
At this time only portions of the actions of the Fed have to be disclosed by law .
But just with this ruling we will be able to see what the outrageous bailout was specifically aimed at , and which banks can be considered safe to do business with .
This is groundbreaking and far overdue .
Lunar clock to be built for 2012
By Pallab Ghosh
Science correspondent , BBC News
Scientists and artists plan to build a 40 m - wide lunar clock by the River Thames by 2012 .
The aim is to create a new London landmark close to the proposed Olympic stadium as a monument to a more natural way of marking time .
The proposed site is at East India Dock , six miles along the river from Westminster Palace .
Its designers hope their clock will become as iconic as Big Ben , which has been marking time for 150 years .
The site is currently a bedraggled nature reserve .
The researchers hope their clock will eventually become as iconic as Big Ben Across the river are the magnificent skyscrapers of Canary Wharf , and nearby are offices built from sea freight containers .
Inside one of those offices , I spoke to Laura Williams - an East London artist .
She explained that the clock would be powered by the tides from the Thames .
" There are three giant concentric rings made from recycled glass , " she told me .
" Light shines through from the glass in time with the Moon 's cycles so the largest ring shows the lunar phase .
" Gradually the light waxes on all the way around the ring and connects full circle when it 's full Moon .
" The second ring is like the big hand of the clock .
It 's a marker of light that tracks the Moon around the globe so that 's the lunar day cycle .
" The third ring - the smallest - is the small hand that tracks the tide as it goes from high tide to low . "
Is n't it about time that we looked up and out to those natural time cycles of this spinning rock ?
David Rooney , Science Museum
The clock has been called Aluna .
It is a word from the Kogi indigenous people of Colombia .
" It means memory , possibility , " says Ms Williams .
" It 's also being in tune with the planet 's rhythms and living in harmony with our planet . "
David Rooney , curator of time at London 's Science Museum , is also involved with the project .
He said that people had become " completely besotted with clocks and watches " .
" Is n't it about time that we looked up and out a little bit to those natural time cycles of this spinning rock underneath that Moon we all see ?
" It 's these time cycles that we human beings are wired to - the patterns of day and night . "
Moon time Many of the world 's cultures have their own lunar - based calendars .
Dr Usama Hasan is a Muslim astronomer .
He believes that in this age of iPods and atomic clocks , there is a greater need than ever for an older way of measuring time .
" For practical purposes , calculating the exact time is the way forward of course , " he said , " but I think you lose a a lot of spirit to the way the world works .
" That 's why I do n't wear a watch and I still judge time , especially the daily prayer times from light and darkness .
" Aluna is a project which tries to connect us back to the cosmic cycle , with nature .
I think that 's very important especially in the very technological age we live in . "
The project is more than a gleam in the eye of these artists and scientists .
According to Laura Williams , a number of large corporations have offered their help .

Highly recommend watching this talk by former Silicon Alley Reporter columnist Clay Shirky on the “ cognitive surplus ” and how we ’ll put it to use .
Large - scale distributed work - force projects are impractical in theory , but doable in reality .
http://blip.tv/scripts/flash/showplayer.swf?enablejs=true&feedurl=http%3A%2F%2Fweb2expo%2Eblip%2Etv%2Frss&file=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Frss%2Fflash%2F862384%3Freferrer%3Dblip%2Etv%26source%3D1&showplayerpath=http%3A%2F%2Fblip%2Etv%2Fscripts%2Fflash%2Fshowplayer%2Eswf
We ’ve all heard someone say it : “ If that fascist / socialist / weasel / liar / idiot / etc wins , I ’m gettin ’ the hell out of the country . ”
Here ’s a quick , short and entirely un-researched checklist for the 0.2 % of those who may actually consider following their convictions when the results are in on Wednesday morning .
Politics
If the outcome of an election is your primary reason to move on , bear in mind that escape wo n’t necessarily help .
It ’s something you obviously feel strongly about , so do n’t think you ’ll ever stop paying attention .
Depending on where you choose to go , the consequences could be even worst .
In Europe , watching debates live meant staying up or waking up at 3 am .
My sleep cycle is still screwed up .
Suggestion ?
Stay in roughly the same time zone .
If you ’re from the right and want to escape the ludicrously bizarre hysteria of an America taken over by Obama ’s “ socialism ” , suffice it to say that the chances are quite good that you wo n’t be very happy almost anywhere else .
Practicality
When your anger / shock / despair subside enough and you start planning your move , consider some practical matters before booking that one - way ticket ( VERY expensive , by the way ) .
Choose your expatriation destination extremely carefully .
Laws , rules and regulations on immigration and foreign workers vary wildly from country to country .
Jobs are n’t that easy to find .
The global economy is in a tailspin at the moment , remember ?
Everyone ’s situation is different .
Although it was on the list , politics was n’t my primary reason for moving .
Work was .
And the simple fact that I always preferred Europe in general .
I was born in Slovenia , and although my family moved to the US before my second birthday , I had ties here .
Immediate relatives , and a few good friends .
I visited quite a bit as I was growing up and later in life .
I was fluent in the language .
I enjoy drinking and eating lots of meat .
No - brainer : have real steady work lined up and a decent place to live before you leave .
You ’re not stuffing a backpack for a vacation , remember ?
You ’re not going on an extended couchsurfing tour , remember ?
And do n’t even consider boarding that plane until you have , at minimum , enough cash on hand to cover at least six months of living expenses , plus pocket money .
Six months fly by .
Six months in a profoundly different environment fly by even faster .
Socializing .
You ’ll be leaving your family , best friends and other relationships you ’ve cultivated over your entire lifetime behind .
Email , photo and video sharing , phone calls and text messages wo n’t begin to fill that void .
The older you are , the more difficult it is to create those sorts of relationships in far off and unknown places .
Virtually all expats agree that this is the most important consideration , one that will make or break your move .
Moving boxes .
You ’re not packing your stuff for a vacation , remember ?
Moving sucks .
Packing shipping containers sucks even more .
A few months ago Adventures in Wheelsville ’s Camille linked to a great expat adjusting write - up here , a good starting point to begin your planning .
Good luck !

Social music service Last.fm is about to hop from the web onto your local radio station .
It 's been a long time coming .
CBS , the parent company of Last.fm , has announced that it is going to launch a brand new radio station on CBS Radio HD on October 5th .
The broadcast , which will begin to air in New York ( 102.7 HD2 ) , Los Angeles ( 93.1 HD2 ) , Chicago ( 93.1 HD3 ) , and San Francisco ( 105.3 HD3 ) , will be powered by Last . fm 's weekly charts , which are determined by Last.fm " scrobbles " in what amounts to the biggest crowdsourcing experiment to ever hit radio .
This is something that CBS has wanted to do ever since it acquired the company for $ 280 million , and it makes complete sense .
The flagship program will be called " Last.fm Discovers , " hosted by Sat Bisla .
The station will play music based on the total number of plays , artists that show significant growth , and the most favorited music on Last. fm .
Does n't that seem like a better way to choose a radio's playlist than a robot or a single DJ ?
We think so .
Perhaps the major limitation to this new radio station is that it 's only available on HD Radio .
The format has nowhere near the reach of FM radio , despite the improved quality .
However , that will probably change as the technology becomes cheaper and is standard on more and more vehicles .
Luckily , it will also be available online .
We 're rooting for this experiment to succeed .
We believe that social media crowdsourcing is an incredible tool for understanding what the people want and how people react ( for example , we are able to quickly gauge opinions about Obama 's health care speech via Twitter crowdsourcing ) .
Do you have an HD radio ?
Will you tune in ?
If you had your TV and radio blaring Wednesday , it was pretty much impossible to avoid seeing or hearing Michael Moore everywhere you turned as the portly filmmaker made the media rounds , touting his new film , " Capitalism : A Love Story , " which opened that day in New York and Los Angeles .
( It goes wide Oct. 2 . ) Moore was on " Good Morning America " and " Larry King Live , " along with Howard Stern 's radio show and Martha Stewart 's syndicated TV show .
But what happened to his appearance on " Oprah , " the show that every filmmaker , author and pop star would kill to appear on , since having Oprah 's de facto endorsement sells more books , films and CDs than any other piece of TV real estate ?
When I turned on " Oprah , " all I saw was Mackenzie Phillips , plugging her new book , which largely seems newsworthy because it reveals that as a teenager she frequently had sex with her father , John Phillips , the deceased founder of the Mamas and the Papas .
Oprah seemed sympathetic , repeatedly furrowing her lovely brow , but I have to admit that all I could think about was -- hey , where 's Michael Moore ?
You may recall that we reported earlier this month that Overture Films , who 's releasing Moore 's film , had embargoed all interviews until this Wednesday , since Moore was scheduled to appear on " Oprah " Sept. 22 .
Eager to protect its exclusive , La Winfrey wanted all of Moore 's appearances and interviews held until after he appeared on her show .
( Moore was on Jay Leno 's show last week , but that was scheduled before the Oprah appearance had been booked . )
But guess what ?
The embargo fell apart at some point in the past few weeks after Oprah mysteriously backed out of the Moore interview .
While Overture has n't given up all hope , insiders acknowledge that Moore is no longer on the Oprah schedule and say that its doubtful that a full - scale interview will ever occur .
The " Oprah " brain trust has n't given any official reason for giving Moore the cold shoulder , But there are two theories floating around .
No .
1 : With his gift for gab and fondness for controversy , Moore is a great guest for most talk shows , but not " Oprah , " which prefers some sort of dramatic revelation -- like , say , having sex with your pop -- which allows its host an opportunity to either empathize or offer a stern rebuke .
No .
2 : As one of the richest women in America who has turned herself into a hugely successful commercial brand , Oprah may have decided that she might leave herself open to charges of hypocrisy by hosting a show promoting a movie that preaches against the evils of capitalism .
I would n't worry about Moore , who has an unfailing knack for attracting media attention , so I suspect he 'll still log plenty of more TV appearances in the coming days .
But " Oprah , " the Moby Dick of media opportunities , increasingly looks like the one that got away .

Google is facing a lot of threats to its future relevancy lately .
First , Apple claims to have “ not yet approved ” its Google Voice app which allows cheap international or free calls to Canada , free SMS texting , and phone intelligence .
Secondly , Google ’s competitor , Yahoo , partners with Microsoft to use their Bing search engine .
Thirdly , Facebook is still growing and becoming a social desktop with rumored micro payments and online check out in the works .
Successful technology companies are the ones that control the platform .
The platform allows 3rd parties to extend features by using the APIs .
An example is the widely successful iTunes App Store .
This allows the company controlling the platform to grow exponentially with scale and thus profit with others effort .
This is another reason why Google wants to be the operating system for both mobile phones ( Android ) , laptop computers ( Chrome OS ) , and browser ( Chrome browser ) .
Google ’s core business is search and advertising .
What do you do , however , when the ISP serving the user injects their own ads instead of defaulting to your engine ?
Well , most recently , I noticed this when searching using Safari but instead of the usual Google Search page , I get Comcast with Yahoo results !
Is this a threat to Google ?
Absolutely !
Is this legal ?
Not sure .
But by the time this matter goes through the courts .
Google may have lost so much revenue that it does n’t matter if Google wins by law .
Remember the fate of Netscape browser after Microsoft included their own browser in their Windows releases ?
Microsoft got fined a huge amount .
However , by the time it was over , Netscape was gone ( well , actually sold to AOL ) but is no longer relevent .
Human society faces a global health catastrophe if climate change is not effectively tackled at the UN conference in Copenhagen in December , leading doctors from around the world warn today .
Calling on medical practitioners everywhere to put pressure on politicians in advance of the meeting , the doctors say that the world 's poorest people will be hit first by the health effects of global warming , but add that " no one will be spared " .
Their stark challenge to governments follows a report in May which said climate change would represent " the biggest global health threat of the 21st century " .

Malaria , dengue fever and other tropical diseases would increase , the study predicted , spelling out how rising temperatures will cause health crises in half a dozen areas : there will be increased problems with food supplies , clean water and sanitation , especially in developing countries .
Meanwhile , the migration of peoples will combine with extreme weather events such as hurricanes and severe floods to make for disastrous conditions in human settlements .
The doctors make their appeal as momentum begins to build for the UN conference , which will be held in the Danish capital from 7 - 18 December , and which will see the world community attempt to draw up a comprehensive new climate treaty to replace the 1997 Kyoto protocol .
Its crucial objective will be drastic worldwide cuts in the emissions of industrial gases such as carbon dioxide which are causing the atmosphere to warm .
On Tuesday , the UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon is convening a climate change summit of world leaders in New York , including Gordon Brown and President Obama , to try to give some impetus to the tortuous pre-conference negotiating process – the draft text of 200 pages already contains 2,000 " square brackets " : that is , points where the 190 countries taking part disagree .
The doctors ' challenge to politicians to sort this out comes in a letter published simultaneously in Britain 's two principal health journals , the British Medical Journal and The Lancet .
In the letter , Professor Ian Gilmore , the president of the Royal College of Physicians , joins 17 other national doctors ' leaders from the US to Australia in saying : " There is a real danger that politicians [ at Copenhagen ] will be indecisive , especially in such turbulent economic times as these .
Should their response be weak , the results for international health could be catastrophic . "
They go on : " Doctors are still seen as respected and independent , largely trusted by their patients and the societies in which they practise ...
As leaders of physicians across many countries , we call on doctors to demand that their politicians listen to the clear facts that have been identified in relation to climate change and act now to implement strategies that will benefit the health of communities worldwide . "
The letter follows the report on the health effects of global warming which was launched jointly last May by The Lancet and University College London ( UCL ) , and which squarely labelled climate change as the 21st century 's biggest global health threat .
That report 's lead author , Professor Anthony Costello , director of UCL's Institute for Global Health , said at the time : " The big message of this report is that climate change is a health issue affecting billions of people , not just an environmental issue about polar bears and deforestation .
The impacts will be felt not just in the UK , but all around the world – and not just in some distant future but in our lifetimes and those of our children . "
Today 's letter is accompanied by an editorial written by two of Britain 's most senior figures in the area of health and development : Professor Sir Michael Marmot , director of the UCL International Institute for Society and Health , and Lord Jay of Ewelme , who as Sir Michael Jay was head of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office , and is now chair of Merlin , ( Medical Emergency Relief , International ) , the UK charity which provides healthcare and medical relief for vulnerable people caught up in natural disasters , conflicts and major disease outbreaks .
The two men write : " A successful outcome at the UN climate change conference in Copenhagen this December is vital for our future as a species , and for our civilisation . "
And they echo the writers of the letter in asserting : " Failure to agree radical reductions in emissions would spell a global health catastrophe . "
They point out that there is now wide consensus that global temperatures are rising and that human actions are responsible ; that there is a need to cut carbon emissions by at least 50 per cent of 1990 levels by 2050 to avoid dangerous climate change ; and that the economic argument that taking action now rather than later will be cheaper has also been widely accepted since the Stern report in 2006 .
Furthermore , they say , the election of President Obama has shifted policy in the US from seeking to block an agreement to seeking to find one .
They go on : " So the chances of success should be good but the politics are tough .
The most vocal arguments are about equity : the rich world caused the problem so why should the poor world pay to put it right ?
Can the rich world do enough through its own actions and through its financial and technological support for the poor to persuade the poor to join in a global agreement ? "
Here is an awesome sculpture that will definitely give the trick - or - treaters a fright this coming Halloween .
The model clay is incredibly detailed and I believe we can all agree it is quite scary .
This is definitely one hell of a job by Artist Kalupsa .
Only thing missing is maybe some fireballs , you ’ll need one hell of an imagination to make that happen ( safely ) with out hurting the trick - or - treaters .
That would definitely bring a whole new meaning to epic .

81 . Django Screencasts
I 've made a short screencast to demonstrate Django , a Python framework for rapid web development which we 've been evaluating at Torchbox .
It 's not intended as a tutorial - aspects of Django 's API are likely to change before its forthcoming 1.0 release , and the project website already provides excellent documentation - but as an introduction to some of the basic functionality .
Areas covered include :
Setting up a project Designing the model Installing the administration interface Customising administration screens URL dispatching Generic views Django templates
The screencast is encoded with the extraordinary H.264 codec ; you 'll need QuickTime 7 or VLC to watch it .
There 's a rather breathy soundtrack , but it should make sense without it .
If you 're having problems viewing the screencast or you 're interested in an alternative format , let me know .
Django in Seven Minutes ( H.264/AAC , 7.4 MB )
Update : here 's a Flash - encoded version , which is lower quality and nearly double the file size ( 13.5 MB ) .
