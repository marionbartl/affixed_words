The conference call spin war continues .
Mark Penn kicked the day off on a Clinton campaign conference call with reporters by saying that Clinton ’s renewed focus on national security , the Austan Goolsbee affair ( also known as NAFTA - gate ) , and the Rezko trial opening today in Chicago are combining to create a “ tipping point and change in the momentum ” in the race for the Democratic nomination .
“ NAFTA - gate ” is the Clinton campaign ’s name for this bizarre saga that began when Canadian television reported a senior economic adviser to Barack Obama named Austan Goolsbee met with Canadian officials to assure them that Obama is not as protectionist on trade as his campaign rhetoric suggests .
The Obama campaign and the Canadian government both denied the meeting occurred , but a memo proving the meeting was leaked ( presumably by someone in the Canadian government ) to the American press .
Howard Wolfson , Clinton ’s communications director , read a series of quotes from Obama campaign members in which they denied in no uncertain terms that the meeting ever took place .
Now that the campaign is admitting the meeting took place but insisting that Goolsbee ’s comments on NAFTA are being misrepresented , said Wolfson , “ why should we trust or believe them now ? ”
The Clinton campaign , probably sounding more assertive and confident than they have on any call in the recent past , also hammered Rezko - gate .
The campaign helpfully distributed a memo with all the questions journalists ought to ask the Obama campaign about Obama ’s relationship with disgraced real estate developer Antoin “ Tony ” Rezko .
“ How many times did Senator Obama visit Tony Rezko ’s house ?
What was the purpose of these visits ? ” asked the memo .
“ Did Sen. Obama intercede on behalf of Mr. Rezko in any governmental capacity ? ”
The implication was clear : Obama is a dangerous choice ; he has not been fully vetted .
The truth is that investigations of the Rezko situation by the press has not turned up anything other than the fact that Rezko , who is definitely a sleazeball , helped Obama expand the plot of land on which his house in Chicago sits .
Obama has called the fact that he entered into a business transaction with Rezko “ bone - headed , ” but insists that nothing illegal occurred .
Rezko ’s indictment did not mention Obama , but his trial , which begins today in Chicago , holds the possibility of embarrassment for Obama .
The Clinton camp refused to brook any discussion of Clinton dropping out if she lost Ohio and Texas .
But her representatives on the call did back off earlier claims that Clinton would be tied with Obama in the delegate count after tomorrow ’s primaries .
They said instead that “ Senator ’s Obama ’s momentum will be seriously blunted . ”
One report in the press suggests the campaign may last until April 22 , at the least .
From the NYT :
Mrs. Clinton herself has privately told advisers that she has a hard time imagining ending her campaign if she wins Ohio and narrowly loses
Texas , given that she has money in the bank and that she believes she would have an edge in the next big vote , Pennsylvania on April 22 , because its demographics are similar to Ohio’s .
While downplaying the worst case scenario for themselves , the representatives played up the worst case scenario for their opponent .
If Obama does n’t sweep tomorrow , it will be a serious sign of “ buyer ’s remorse ” from Democratic voters , they said .
The Obama campaign held its own conference call two hours later to try and swat down some of these allegations .
Campaign manager David Plouffe began by saying that he expects tomorrow ’s results will create “ no big delegate shift one way or another , ” and that more of the status quo essentially means it is time for Clinton to exit the race .
“ They keep trying to move the goalposts , ” said Plouffe , “ but at some point you run out of field . ”
When NAFTA came up , Plouffe said that Goolsbee ’s meeting with Canadian officials was “ essentially a tour ” of the Canadian consulate in Chicago , and that he was “ approached not as member of our campaign , but as a University of Chicago professor . ”
Goolsbee had a “ casual conversation , ” Plouffe insisted , “ not a formal meeting of any sort between our campaign and a foreign government . ”
Of course , these comments do not answer the question of why a senior member of a presidential campaign would think that he could have “ casual conversation ” with a representative of a foreign government about a front - and - center policy issue without knowing it would be treated seriously .
Nor do they explain why the same senior member thought he could divorce himself from his campaign role just days before a major primary , or why a University of Chicago professor needed a tour of a local Canadian consulate in the first place .
But before these questions could be considered , Plouffe pivoted to an article in the NY Sun that he said seriously called into question Senator Clinton ’s commitment to ending the war .
In the article , retired four - star general Jack Keane , who is not an adviser to Clinton ’s campaign , is quoted as saying Clinton “ would not act irresponsibly and issue orders to conduct an immediate withdrawal from Iraq , regardless of the consequences , and squander the gains that have been made . ”
In response , the Clinton campaign said the Senator “ speaks for herself . ”
Clinton claims that she will begin withdrawing troops in the first 60 days of her presidency .
Before further questions could be asked about Keane ’s statement , and before questions about Rezko and his trial could be seriously discussed , the call was cut off , thus preventing the Obama campaign from taking a serious beating on one of its toughest press days of the primary season .
Olbermann guest : Suspending habeas corpus has made us less safe David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Friday June 8 , 2007 Print This Email This Keith Olbermann reported Thursday on the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 , calling it " a historical restoration project , the reconstruction of one of the cornerstones of American democracy . "
The Military Commissions Act , passed last year by the Republican Congress , stripped away the fundamental Constitutional right of habeas corpus .
Now the Senate Judiciary Committee , in voting for the Restoration Act , has taken the first step in restoring it .
Olbermann asked constitutional law scholar Jonathan Turley about the argument by supporters of the Military Commissions
Act that habeas corpus has been suspended before in times of war without destroying the Republic .
Turley responded to that argument in three different ways , saying first that the nation 's survival of previous suspensions of habeas corpus " says more about the Republic than the actions of the earlier presidents .
This is a system of government that was designed to be idiot - proof -- and God knows we 've tested that through the years .
...
This was one of the most disgraceful moments of the last Congress , and it will be equally disgraceful to see many Republicans vote to fight the effort to bring back the Great Writ . "
Turley went on to explain that habeas corpus is not a dangerous luxury or some sort of lawyer 's trick to get crooks out of jail , but " is actually the foundation for all other rights .
When the government throws you into a dungeon for what you say or who you pray to , it 's habeas corpus that 's the right that allows you to see the enforcement of the other rights . "
Finally , Turley emphasized that suspending habeas corpus has actually made us less safe : " The greatest irony of the Bush administration is that his legacy will be to show the dangers of walking away from those rights that define us .
We 're very much alone today .
...
We 're viewed as a rogue nation .
And it is a dangerous world to live in when you 're alone . "

At 13 I was alone and afraid .
Taught by my well - meaning , progressive , English - teacher parents that violence was wrong , that rage was something to be overcome and cooperation was always better than conflict , I suffocated my deepest fears and desires under a nice - boy persona .
Placed in a small , experimental school that was wrong for me , afraid to join my peers in their bumptious rush into adolescent boyhood , I withdrew into passivity and loneliness .
My parents , not trusting the violent world of the late 1960s , built a wall between me and the crudest elements of American pop culture .
Then the Incredible Hulk smashed through it .
One of my mother ’s students convinced her that Marvel Comics , despite their apparent juvenility and violence , were in fact devoted to lofty messages of pacifism and tolerance .
My mother borrowed some , thinking they ’d be good for me .
And so they were .
But not because they preached lofty messages of benevolence .
They were good for me because they were juvenile .
And violent .
The character who caught me , and freed me , was the Hulk : overgendered and undersocialized , half - naked and half - witted , raging against a frightened world that misunderstood and persecuted him .
Suddenly I had a fantasy self to carry my stifled rage and buried desire for power .
I had a fantasy self who was a self : unafraid of his desires and the world ’s disapproval , unhesitating and effective in action .
“ Puny boy follow Hulk ! ” roared my fantasy self , and I followed .
I followed him to new friends — other sensitive geeks chasing their own inner brutes — and I followed him to the arrogant , self - exposing , self - assertive , superheroic decision to become a writer .
Eventually , I left him behind , followed more sophisticated heroes , and finally my own lead along a twisting path to a career and an identity .
In my 30s , I found myself writing action movies and comic books .
I wrote some Hulk stories , and met the geek - geniuses who created him .
I saw my own creations turned into action figures , cartoons , and computer games .
I talked to the kids who read my stories .
Across generations , genders , and ethnicities I kept seeing the same story : people pulling themselves out of emotional traps by immersing themselves in violent stories .
People integrating the scariest , most fervently denied fragments of their psyches into fuller senses of selfhood through fantasies of superhuman combat and destruction .
I have watched my son living the same story — transforming himself into a bloodthirsty dinosaur to embolden himself for the plunge into preschool , a Power Ranger to muscle through a social competition in kindergarten .
In the first grade , his friends started climbing a tree at school .
But he was afraid : of falling , of the centipedes crawling on the trunk , of sharp branches , of his friends ’ derision .
I took my cue from his own fantasies and read him old Tarzan comics , rich in combat and bright with flashing knives .
For two weeks he lived in them .
Then he put them aside .
And he climbed the tree .
A scene from Gerard Jones and Gene Ha ’s comic book “ Oktane ”
But all the while , especially in the wake of the recent burst of school shootings , I heard pop psychologists insisting that violent stories are harmful to kids , heard teachers begging parents to keep their kids away from “ junk culture , ” heard a guilt - stricken friend with a son who loved Pokémon lament , “ I ’ve turned into the bad mom who lets her kid eat sugary cereal and watch cartoons ! ”
That ’s when I started the research .
“ Fear , greed , power - hunger , rage : these are aspects of our selves that we try not to experience in our lives but often want , even need , to experience vicariously through stories of others , ” writes Melanie Moore , Ph.D. , a psychologist who works with urban teens .
“ Children need violent entertainment in order to explore the inescapable feelings that they ’ve been taught to deny , and to reintegrate those feelings into a more whole , more complex , more resilient selfhood . ”
Moore consults to public schools and local governments , and is also raising a daughter .
For the past three years she and I have been studying the ways in which children use violent stories to meet their emotional and developmental needs — and the ways in which adults can help them use those stories healthily .
With her help I developed Power Play , a program for helping young people improve their self - knowledge and sense of potency through heroic , combative storytelling .
We ’ve found that every aspect of even the trashiest pop-culture story can have its own developmental function .
Pretending to have superhuman powers helps children conquer the feelings of powerlessness that inevitably come with being so young and small .
The dual - identity concept at the heart of many superhero stories helps kids negotiate the conflicts between the inner self and the public self as they work through the early stages of socialization .
Identification with a rebellious , even destructive , hero helps children learn to push back against a modern culture that cultivates fear and teaches dependency .
At its most fundamental level , what we call “ creative violence ” — head - bonking cartoons , bloody videogames , playground karate , toy guns — gives children a tool to master their rage .
Children will feel rage .
Even the sweetest and most civilized of them , even those whose parents read the better class of literary magazines , will feel rage .
The world is uncontrollable and incomprehensible ; mastering it is a terrifying , enraging task .
Rage can be an energizing emotion , a shot of courage to push us to resist greater threats , take more control , than we ever thought we could .
But rage is also the emotion our culture distrusts the most .
Most of us are taught early on to fear our own .
Through immersion in imaginary combat and identification with a violent protagonist , children engage the rage they ’ve stifled , come to fear it less , and become more capable of utilizing it against life ’s challenges .
I knew one little girl who went around exploding with fantasies so violent that other moms would draw her mother aside to whisper , “ I think you should know something about Emily … . ”
Her parents were separating , and she was small , an only child , a tomboy at an age when her classmates were dividing sharply along gender lines .
On the playground she acted out “ Sailor Moon ” fights , and in the classroom she wrote stories about people being stabbed with knives .
The more adults tried to control her stories , the more she acted out the roles of her angry heroes : breaking rules , testing limits , roaring threats .
Then her mother and I started helping her tell her stories .
She wrote them , performed them , drew them like comics : sometimes bloody , sometimes tender , always blending the images of pop culture with her own most private fantasies .
She came out of it just as fiery and strong , but more self - controlled and socially competent : a leader among her peers , the one student in her class who could truly pull boys and girls together .
The title character of “ Oktane ” gets nasty
I worked with an older girl , a middle - class “ nice girl , ” who held herself together through a chaotic family situation and a tumultuous adolescence with gangsta rap .
In the mythologized street violence of Ice T , the rage and strutting of his music and lyrics , she found a theater of the mind in which she could be powerful , ruthless , invulnerable .
She avoided the heavy drug use that sank many of her peers , and flowered in college as a writer and political activist .
I ’m not going to argue that violent entertainment is harmless .
I think it has helped inspire some people to real - life violence .
I am going to argue that it ’s helped hundreds of people for every one it ’s hurt , and that it can help far more if we learn to use it well .
I am going to argue that our fear of “ youth violence ” is n’t well - founded on reality , and that the fear can do more harm than the reality .
We act as though our highest priority is to prevent our children from growing up into murderous thugs — but modern kids are far more likely to grow up too passive , too distrustful of themselves , too easily manipulated .
We send the message to our children in a hundred ways that their craving for imaginary gun battles and symbolic killings is wrong , or at least dangerous .
Even when we do n’t call for censorship or forbid “ Mortal Kombat , ” we moan to other parents within our kids ’ earshot about the “ awful violence ” in the entertainment they love .
We tell our kids that it is n’t nice to play - fight , or we steer them from some monstrous action figure to a pro-social doll .
Even in the most progressive households , where we make such a point of letting children feel what they feel , we rush to substitute an enlightened discussion for the raw material of rageful fantasy .
In the process , we risk confusing them about their natural aggression in the same way the Victorians confused their children about their sexuality .
When we try to protect our children from their own feelings and fantasies , we shelter them not against violence but against power and selfhood .

Every member of Congress -- but particularly the chairs of the intelligence committees -- needs to read today 's explosive Wall Street Journal article before considering moving forward on any FISA legislation .
Five years ago , Congress killed an experimental Pentagon antiterrorism program meant to vacuum up electronic data about people in the U.S. to search for suspicious patterns .
Opponents called it too broad an intrusion on Americans ' privacy , even after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks .
But the data - sifting effort did n't disappear .
The National Security Agency , once confined to foreign surveillance , has been building essentially the same system .
The central role the NSA has come to occupy in domestic intelligence gathering has never been publicly disclosed .
But an inquiry reveals that its efforts have evolved to reach more broadly into data about people 's communications , travel and finances in the U.S. than the domestic surveillance programs brought to light since the 2001 terrorist attacks ....
Two former officials familiar with the data - sifting efforts said they work by starting with some sort of lead , like a phone number or Internet address .
In partnership with the FBI , the systems then can track all domestic and foreign transactions of people associated with that item -- and then the people who associated with them , and so on , casting a gradually wider net .
An intelligence official described more of a rapid - response effect :
If a person suspected of terrorist connections is believed to be in a U.S. city -- for instance , Detroit , a community with a high concentration of Muslim Americans -- the government 's spy systems may be directed to collect and analyze all electronic communications into and out of the city .
The haul can include records of phone calls , email headers and destinations , data on financial transactions and records of Internet browsing .
The system also would collect information about other people , including those in the U.S. , who communicated with people in Detroit ....
Two current officials also said the NSA 's current combination of programs now largely mirrors the former TIA project .
But the NSA offers less privacy protection .
TIA developers researched ways to limit the use of the system for broad searches of individuals ' data , such as requiring intelligence officers to get leads from other sources first .
The NSA effort lacks those controls , as well as controls that it developed in the 1990s for an earlier data - sweeping attempt .
Sen .
Ron Wyden , an Oregon Democrat and member of the Senate Intelligence Committee who led the charge to kill TIA , says " the administration is trying to bring as much of the philosophy of operation Total Information Awareness as it can into the programs they 're using today . "
The issue has been overshadowed by the fight over telecoms ' immunity , he said .
" There 's not been as much discussion in the Congress as there ought to be . "

Most Jeep Cherokees do not boast police - defying smoke machines
The car was abandoned by the gang members after a shoot - out .
The police and army sent to fight Mexico 's drug cartels have seen most things - sophisticated rocket launchers , powerful assault rifles and gold - plated pistols .
But in the northern state of Tamaulipas even they were shocked to come across a Jeep Grande Cherokee kitted out with its own anti-police gadgets .
Spikes
Inside was a smoke machine and a device to spray spikes onto the road behind - the purpose to make a getaway easier and stop the car from being followed .
Mexico is plagued by drug - related gang violence
It is not known if the gadgets were ever used .
The vehicle was abandoned after being rammed into a military truck .
Those in the Jeep threw a hand grenade before making their escape .
The episode may have its lighter side , but the reality of fighting the cartels is much deadlier .
So far this year more than 300 people have died in violence related to the cartels .
That follows more than 2,500 deaths last year .
Billion - dollar business
The cartels are not short of money to buy the equipment they use .
It is estimated they control an industry smuggling cocaine into the United States worth around $ 13 bn ( £ 6.5 bn ) a year .
The authorities have had some success in arresting the leaders of these gangs .
Last week a man thought to be at or near the head of the Tijuana cartel , Gustavo Rivera Martinez , was arrested .
Those setbacks may be leading to violent infighting among the gangs , which may account for the rising death toll .
It may also be the reason why some gang members are equipping themselves with more and more sophisticated weapons and vehicles as they fight to stay ahead of the police , the army and their rivals .
ALBANY - Gov. Eliot Spitzer , who gained national prominence relentlessly pursuing Wall Street wrongdoing , has been caught on a federal wiretap arranging to meet with a high - priced prostitute at a Washington hotel last month , according to a law enforcement official and a person briefed on the investigation .
The wiretap captured a man identified as Client 9 on a telephone call confirming plans to have a woman travel from New York to Washington , where he had reserved a hotel room , according to an affidavit filed in federal court in Manhattan .
The person briefed on the case and the law enforcement official identified Mr. Spitzer as Client 9 .
Mr. Spitzer , a first term Democrat , today made a brief public appearance during which he apologized for his behavior , and described it as a “ private matter . ”
He did not address his political future .
“ I have acted in a way that violates my obligation to my family and violates my or any sense of right or wrong , ” said Mr. Spitzer , who appeared with his wife Silda at his Manhattan office .
“ I apologize first and most importantly to my family .
I apologize to the public to whom I promised better . ”
In Silicon Valley , they love to say it 's not about the money .
Yet in late September privately held online social network Facebook , with an expected $ 150 million in 2007 sales , sought new investment based on a stunning $ 10 billion - plus valuation .
A few days later , a financial opinion Web site , 24/7 Wall St. , speculated that TechCrunch , a blog that grosses about $ 200,000 a month , might fetch $ 100 million or more from an acquirer such as CNET Networks .
Now there 's talk that RockYou ! , the second - largest maker of software " widgets " that add features to social networks such as Facebook , might seek up to $ 500 million to sell out .
No matter that Rock You denies it .
Or that , by several estimates , the sum total of monthly Facebook widget advertising revenue is less than $ 1 million .
None of those deals has come to pass , and maybe none will .
Google is real enough , though , and its stock price shot past 600 on Oct. 9 , giving the search giant even more power to buy up companies .
These lofty valuations have a lot of people in Silicon Valley and beyond squirming .
They worry about a replay of the dot - com boom , which peaked early in 2000 , only to crash later that year .
" Companies like Facebook are driving everybody bananas , " says Sumant Mandal , managing director at Clearstone Venture Partners .
But the bubble chatter misses the point .
Buyouts by established companies , from Google , Microsoft , Yahoo ! , and eBay to News Corp. and CBS , bubbly as they may appear , serve a valid strategic purpose .
Marketers and media companies alike fervently believe there are lucrative opportunities to get people engaged with their brands , products , and ads in ways Madison Avenue could never dream of .
Fantastical valuations signal an important transformation in the Web economy , one that will shake things up even more than the dot - com bust did .
The Web is changing from a place where people find information , entertainment , and products over to a social medium where they share videos on YouTube and communicate with friends on Facebook .
Consider Microsoft , which was said to be interested in buying a 5 % stake in Facebook for up to $ 500 million .
That 's 2 % of Microsoft's $ 23 billion stash of cash and short - term investments -- chump change for pole position on the emerging new Web .
And the downside of betting too much is minimal .
As if to prove the point , when eBay recently took a $ 1.4 billion writedown on its $ 2.6 billion acquisition of Internet phone service Skype in 2005 , its stock actually rose slightly .
Investors had already written it off themselves .
And so the race continues to heat up .
In August , Microsoft closed on its $ 6 billion acquisition of online ad firm aQuantive .
Yahoo recently bought online office productivity software maker Zimbra for $ 350 million and ad network BlueLithium for $ 300 million .
Google alone has bought 11 Web outfits so far this year , about double last year 's pace , including a " microblogging " service called Jaiku on Oct.
9 .
Media companies are accelerating their activity , too , making News Corp .'s 2005 purchase of MySpace for $ 580 million look reasonable .
CBS , for instance , bought a far smaller , more targeted music site called Last.fm in May for $ 280 million , a price that one venture capitalist says was more than five times what he expected .
Notes Reid Hoffman , chairman of professional networking site LinkedIn and an angel investor in Facebook and other Web startups : " Strategy is a lot more important than cash to these companies . "
That said , rationales for some valuations can get rather creative .
Some members of the fast - growing Facebook ecosystem pin their analyses on the idea that the company could become the next Google .
Lee Lorenzen , CEO of Altura Ventures , which recently launched a fund for companies building applications for Facebook , even makes the case that Facebook is worth $ 100 billion .
He 's assuming that various new kinds of ads and e-commerce will help Facebook produce $ 2.2 billion in profits by the end of 2008 .
Not surprisingly , others are aghast at this kind of analysis .
Anant K. Sundaram , a finance professor at Dartmouth College 's Tuck School of Business , notes that the only way Facebook 's value can get to $ 10 billion is by assuming much higher , sustained growth in users and revenue than the fabulously profitable Google .
" I look at this valuation and go , ' This is silly , ' " says Sundaram .
Even if Facebook somehow fulfills these projections , he warns , " the mistake would be for the rest of the world to make decisions based on that valuation . "
Indeed , imagine what happens if the economy cools further , taking online advertising with it , and Google reports a quarter that misses analysts ' expectations ?
A stock swoon might slow Google 's and other companies ' buying binge .
But for now , Google can still spend big , and tech and media executives feel they need to keep pace in building the new Web .
In a sense , startups themselves , rather than silicon chips and disk drives , are becoming the raw materials of Silicon Valley .
Each provides a small , modular piece of the end product ; each gets acquired and assembled by the likes of Google and News Corp . -- which , after all , are the ones that really know how to make money .

CNN : Parodies of Clinton's ' 3 am phone call ' flood YouTube David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Published : Tuesday March 4 , 2008
|
Print This Email This Hillary Clinton " 3 AM phone call " ad was intended to send a serious message about experience and judgment .
However , according to CNN , " Not since [ the old public service announcement which asked ] ' It 's 10 pm , do you know where your children are ? ' have kiddies and time combined resulted in so much parody . "
CNN reports that YouTube has been flooded with takeoffs of the ad , to the point where " all Barack Obama has to do is make like he 's picking up a phone and his audience snickers . "
A few of the parodies jab at Obama , but most go after Clinton , making fun of everything from her pantsuits to her mispronunciation of the name of Russia 's new president to the question of where Bill Clinton might be at 3 am .
Others simply mock the ad itself , offering a variety of answers to the original punchline -- " Who do you want answering the phone ? " -- which range from " Ghostbusters " to " Jack Bauer . "
And one more elaborate takeoff by a comedy group targets the spooky voiceover , reassuring viewers , " Do n't be afraid of their narrators anymore . "
This video is from CNN.com , broadcast March 3 , 2008 .
The Qatar - based satellite television channel , al - Jazeera , claimed yesterday that its Kabul office had been targeted by United States bombers .
Ibrahim Hilal , the chief editor of the Arabic language network , said it had given the location of its office in Kabul to the authorities in Washington - yet on Monday night , its office was destroyed by a bomb that almost wrecked the nearby BBC bureau .
The Pentagon yesterday denied that it had deliberately targeted al - Jazeera , but said it could not explain why the office was hit .
Speaking by telephone to the News World conference of media executives in Barcelona , Mr Hilal said he believed that al - Jazeera 's office in Kabul had been on the Pentagon 's list of targets since the beginning of the conflict but the US did not want to bomb it while the broadcaster was the only one based in Kabul .
By this week , however , the BBC had reopened its Kabul office under Taliban supervision , with the correspondents William Reeve and Rageh Omar .
On Monday , al - Jazeera executives in Qatar called their correspondent in Kabul and told him to leave , because they feared for his safety after the Northern Alliance took over .
However , after receiving assurances from the Northern Alliance that he would be safe , the reporter decided to stay .
He did not tell Qatar of his decision - that night , his office was bombed .
At the time , Reeve was being interviewed on BBC World from his bureau in the same street .
Pictures of him diving under his desk to avoid fall - out from the blast have been shown on BBC television .
Mr Hilal said he believed the attack was deliberate and long - planned .
" I still believe the decision to exclude our office from the coverage was taken weeks before the bombing .
But I do n't think they would do that while we were the only office in Kabul . "
He said that US intelligence forces routinely monitored communications between Qatar and Kabul - a recent videotape of an Osama bin Laden statement was played out by satellite to Qatar from Kabul , but not broadcast until seven days later .
Yet Washington knew of its existence and demanded the right to broadcast a response .
The US would have known , therefore , that al - Jazeera had ordered its Kabul correspondent to leave , but would not have realised that he was still in the city .
If the correspondent had died , there would have been an outcry , and the disaster would have been compounded if Reeve had been seriously injured or killed .
Speaking to the conference from the US military 's Florida command centre for the Afghan bombings , Colonel Brian
Hoey denied that al - Jazeera was a target .
" The US military does not and will not target media .
We would not , as a policy , target news media organisations - it would not even begin to make sense . "
He said that the bombing of Serb television in Belgrade during the Kosovo conflict was a different issue .
Col Hoey said the targets in question " appeared to have government facilities associated with them " .
He said the Pentagon did not have the location coordinates of the al - Jazeera office in Kabul even though the broadcaster said it had passed them , on several times , via its partner CNN in Washington .
Andrew Morton wrote in his best - selling biography of Tom Cruise that the Hollywood star was prominent in the hierarchy of the Church of Scientology .
Of all of the author 's claims , it was the one that most enraged the sect : " Insinuations that Mr. Cruise is second - in - command of the Church are not only false , they are ludicrous , " the Scientologists maintained .
" He is neither 2nd or 100th .
Mr. Cruise is a Scientology parishioner and holds no official or unofficial position in the Church hierarchy .
Claims to the contrary are offensive to both Mr. Cruise and the Church . "
But if Cruise was merely a humble parishioner , why in Xenu 's name did the sect spend six figures to celebrate his birthday in 2004 ?
In a video obtained by Gawker , watch Scientology chief David Miscavige lead the sect 's most famous follower into an extravagant celebration of the Hollywood star on Scientology cruise ship , Freewinds .
Cruise 's entrance is , of course , to the theme music from Top Gun , one of the movies for which the actor is best known , or was , until he took up his new role as evangelist for the bizarre Church .
After the movie clips are played , and the bands perform , Cruise exclaims : " This is incredible ...
It 's the best birthday ever , ever , ever , ever , ever , and I mean ever ! "
We agree !
The best moment : watch Cruise in a duet of Old Time Rock and Roll , demonstrating the dance moves we first saw in Risky Business , the picture that made his name .
He was so young then ; and we , thankfully , knew so much less about him .

Firefox includes a non-standard JavaScript extension that makes regular expressions callable as functions .
This serves as a shorthand for calling a regex 's exec method .
For example , in Firefox / regex / ( " string " ) is equivalent to / regex /.exec ( " string " ) .
Early ECMAScript 4 proposals indicated this functionality would be added to the ES4 specification , but subsequent discussion on the ES4 - discuss mailing list suggests it might be dropped .
However , you can implement something similar by adding call and apply methods to RegExp. prototype , which could help with functional programming and duck - typed code that works with both functions and regular expressions .
So let 's add them :
RegExp.prototype.call = function ( context , str ) { return this.exec ( str ) ; } ; RegExp.prototype.apply = function ( context , args ) { return this.exec ( args [ 0 ] ) ; } ;
Note that both of the above methods completely ignore the context argument .
You could pass in null or whatever else as the context , and you 'd get back the normal result of running exec on the regex .
Using the above methods , you can generically work with both regular expressions and functions wherever it 's convenient to do so .
A few obvious cases where this could be helpful are the JavaScript 1.6 array iteration methods .
Following are implementations of filter , every , some , and map that allow them to be used cross - browser :
Array.prototype.filter = function ( func , context ) { var results = [ ] ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < this .
length ; i++) { if ( i in this && func. call ( context , this [ i ] , i , this ) ) results .
push ( this [ i ] ) ; } return results ; } ; Array.prototype.every = function ( func , context ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < this .
length ; i++) { if ( i in this && ! func.call ( context , this [ i ] , i , this ) ) return false ; } return true ; } ; Array.prototype.some = function ( func , context ) { for ( var i = 0 ; i < this .
length ; i++) { if ( i in this && func. call ( context , this [ i ] , i , this ) ) return true ; } return false ; } ; Array.prototype.map = function ( func , context ) { var results = [ ] ; for ( var i = 0 ; i < this .
length ; i++) { if ( i in this ) results [ i ] = func.call ( context , this [ i ] , i , this ) ; } return results ; } ;
Because the array and null values returned by exec type - convert nicely to true and false , the above code allows you to use something like [ " a " , " b " , " ab " , " ba " ] . filter ( / ^a / ) to return all values that start with " a " : [ " a " , " ab " ] .
The code [ " 1 " , 1,0 , " a" , 3.1,256 ] . filter ( /^[ 1 - 9 ] \d*$ / ) would return integers greater than zero , regardless of type : [ " 1 " , 1,256 ] .
str.match(/a?b/g).filter (/^b/) would return all matches of " b " not preceded by " a " .
This can be a convenient pattern since JavaScript does n't support lookbehind .
All of the above examples already work with Firefox 's native Array .
prototype.filter because of the indirect exec calling feature in that browser , but they would n't work with the cross - browser implementation of filter above without adding RegExp.prototype.call .

Dan Abrams with Pat Buchanan and Craig Crawford discuss the super delegates and how they may decide the nomination .
There are a total number of 4,049 Democratic delegates available in the presidential nominating process , making 2,025 the magic number for each candidate .
If no candidate reaches the threshold in time , Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama will have themselves a good ol ’ fashioned brokered convention in Denver this August .
This seemed unlikely a few weeks ago , but after Super Tuesday , it may very well happen after all .
The reason is pretty straightforward : Obama has a slight edge in pledged delegates ( Dems who vote in primaries and caucuses ) , while Clinton has a slight edge in superdelegates ( lawmakers , governors , DNC members , establishment types ) .
Taken together , they each have about 1,000 delegates .
As Jonathan Cohn explained , it ’s going to be tricky for either of them to get to 2,025 .
In the remaining primaries and caucuses , only 1,787 delegates are at stake .
So to win the nomination on pledged delegates alone , a candidate has to win 57 percent of those at stake .
And that wo n’t be so easy to do .
Remember , the Democrats do n’t have winner - take - all contests anymore .
The primaries and caucuses award delegates with formulas that are based on proportional representation .
In a situation where two candidates , each with solid funding , are running strong , it will be difficult to run up large margins .
It ’s entirely possible we ’ll see a lot of results like last night , in which — after all the back - and - forth over who won which state — the two finished nearly even in delegates won .
Exactly .
Neither one can put the other one away .
This not only means a brokered convention , it also means a dynamic in which superdelegates pick the Democratic nominee .
Kevin and Ezra debate whether that 's good or bad .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The two top executives at struggling Countrywide Financial Corp. , the nation 's largest mortgage lender , are slated to receive a combined $ 19 million in payouts , a regulatory filing shows .
Angelo Mozilo helped lead Countrywide as it grew into the nation 's largest mortgage lender .
The payments are part of the company 's pending takeover by Bank of America .
Countrywide CEO
Angelo Mozilo is set to receive $ 10 million in stock , and President David Sambol will get about $ 9 million , according to documents Bank of America filed this week with the Securities and Exchange Commission .
Sambol will receive another $ 28 million in cash and stock to stay with the combined company , the document states .
Their compensation is tied directly to the performance of the company via stock and options that the executives have held over time , according to the filing .
Bank of America agreed in January to buy Countrywide for $ 4 billion .
Mozilo and Sambol , along with ex-Citigroup chief Charles Prince , came under fire this month by members of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee , who chastised the executives for helping foster the current mortgage crisis .
Lawmakers accused the executives of leaving homeowners at risk of losing their homes while fattening their own wallets .
In their defense , the executives said they also lost billions of dollars in the subprime meltdown .
Mozilo , Sambol and Prince made headlines in the past year for their lofty compensation after their companies suffered heavy losses in the U.S. housing market .
Between 2002 and the close of 2006 , the three executives were paid $ 460 million , according to a report issued by the House committee in March .
Mozilo , who grew Countrywide from its modest beginnings into the nation 's largest mortgage lender , reportedly stood to collect a windfall of $ 115 million after his firm agreed to a yet - to - be- completed sale to Bank of America .
After facing heavy criticism from lawmakers , Mozilo forfeited $ 37.5 million in payments tied to the deal .

Lisp as a UNIX shared library : revised interface and new documentation
Allegro CL supports the use of Lisp via a shared library by C/C++ programs in the same manner as they use any other function libraries .
( There is also support for Lisp as a DLL on Windows , see dll.htm .
This note discusses UNIX only . )
The interface and the documentation for Unix Shared Libraries in Allegro CL 8.1 were replaced in an update released in mid February , 2008 .
The new documentation is unix - shared - library.htm .
In this note , we briefly discuss the changes and the example provided , which creates a C program that calls Lisp to calculate a factorial .
What has changed
The new material , which is available for release 8.1 only , is downloaded when you update Allegro CL with sys: update - allegro .
You must have done this if you want to replicate what is done in this essay .
There is actually little new in the Lisp .
Instead , changes to UNIX , particularly in the area of thread library support , allow the same method to be used on all UNIX - like platforms and for a simpler interface .
New files are provided in the examples / unix - shared - library / directory .
The following files are needed to build a lisp shared library application .
The ones in the examples / unix - shared - library / directory are new :
examples/unix - shared -library/lnkacl.{so,sl , dylib, a}
examples/unix- shared - library/lnkacl.fasl
misc / lisp.h ( unchanged from before the update )
( unchanged from before the update ) misc / shlibs.h ( unchanged from before the update )
Finally , you need the Allegro shared library , though this typically will be copied into your application directory automatically when you it is built .
The ( updated ) examples / unix - shared - library / directory contains code for a sample C application that calculates factorials by calling into lisp .
An architecture specific makefile is also provided with the recommended build commands for compiling and linking user applications .
Typing make in this directory will build the factorial example ( ftest ) , placing it in the subdirectory fact / .
Express Users : Before typing make to build the example , it is first necessary to modify the call to initialize_lisp ( ) in ftest.c , at line 113 .
The call should appear , instead , as follows :
if ( res = initialize_lisp ( envp , ( char *) " fact.dxl " , /* image name */ 2 , /* express shared library */ 0 , /* do _not_ suppress i/o */ 0 , /* exit routine .
0 for default */ linked_shared_libraries ) != 0 )
The factorial example
Once this change is made , a call toshould run to completion .
Due to the extra output , a failed test will result , but one should see by visual inspection that the correct result is returned .
Since Lisp easily handles large valued integer calculations , a Lisp based factorial ( ) function is a good , simple example .
To avoid C integer overflow , the answer is placed in a result string , rather than returned as a number .
( The factorial of n is the product of the integers from 1 to n , so factorial of 3 is 1 times 2 times 3 = 6 . )
The example uses a number of files , all in the examples / unix - shared - library / subdirectory of the Allegro directory on UNIX machines .
( The files are not included in the Windows distribution of Allegro CL . )
The files are :
fact.h : this file contains a C #define macro that specifies the Allegro CL shared library .
The #define macro must be changed when used with a new Allegro CL release in the future , since that release would include a differently named Allegro CL shared library .

The #define macro must be changed when used with a new Allegro CL release in the future , since that release would include a differently named Allegro CL shared library .
fact .c : this file contains the shared library C wrapper source .
There are a number of OS specific preprocessor macros .
These are related to architecture differences and OS thread support differences .

ftest .c : this file is an example C program that uses the factorial calculating shared library .
fact .c details
The load_lisp ( ) private function runs in a new thread created by the original main thread .
It loads the Lisp image and starts it running .
It calls the Allegro CL library function lisp_init( ) , which is described in main .htm .
Note that the shlibs.h file is found in the Allegro CL distribution misc / directory .
Use the compiler - I option to add that directory to the include file search list when compiling fact .c .
The Allegro CL library function tcm ( ) is called to prevent the Lisp from writing to stdout and stderr during initialization and subsequent processing .
During your development phase , you may wish to comment this call out , in order to see format or print debugging output .
The wait_on_semaphore ( ) and release_semaphore ( ) private functions are used to synchronize processing between the Lisp thread and the original main thread .
This example uses pipes as semaphores .
The initialize_factorial ( ) public function creates the Lisp thread .
Its argument is a pointer to the main program environment that is available as the third main ( ) argument .
Besides initializing the synchronization semaphores , it uses the Allegro CL library function find_file_using_pathstring ( ) to identify the directory containing the fact .
dxl Lisp image .
It 's a good design decision to use the same environmental variable that the OS uses to find shared libraries for the third argument .
For example , on Solaris , use LD_LIBRARY_PATH .
The wait_on_semaphore ( ) function is called to wait for the Lisp thread to respond that all initialization activities are completed .
The release_end_semaphore ( ) function is provided for the Lisp image to call when initialization steps are complete , releasing the semaphore initialize_factorial ( ) is waiting on , allowing it to return to its caller .
The set_factorial_callback ( ) function is provided for the Lisp image to call during initialization steps to set the callback address for the Lisp ' factorial callback .
The factorial ( ) public function wraps the C / Lisp operations that calculate the factorial result .
It sets some global variables that the Lisp thread will access , releases the semaphore that the wait_for_work ( ) function is waiting on in the Lisp thread , and then waits on another semaphore for the Lisp thread to respond that the factorial calculation is complete .
It then returns , using a global value set by the Lisp thread .
The wait_for_work ( ) function is called by the Lisp image after initialization steps are complete and it has released the semaphore used to synchronize the initialization phase .
It loops forever , responding when the original main thread releases a semaphore that indicates that factorial ( ) has been called .
It invokes the factorial callback and then releases a semaphore that tells the main thread that Lisp processing is complete .
It then goes back to waiting for more work .
The copy_factorial_result ( ) function is called by Lisp during factorial processing to pass the result string into C data .
The terminate_factorial ( ) public function wakes up wait_for_work ( ) in such a way that it breaks out of its endless loop , causing the Lisp thread to unwind .
On Linux , where separate threads have separate process id's , it is imperative that the Lisp thread unwind ; otherwise a hang will occur .
fact.cl details
The factorial function calculates the factorial result .
The wrapper C shared library is loaded and foreign function definitions are made as necessary .
The ' factorial - callback callback calls ' factorial , converts the result to a string , and passes the result string to C data using the copy_factorial_result ( ) function .
The 'initialize - factorial function passes the callback address back to C , releases the initialization semaphore , and goes into a " wait for work " mode , all using C functions defined in fact .c .
When the wait_for_work ( ) call returns , indicating that terminate_factorial ( ) has been called , ' exit is called , to unwind the Lisp thread .
The * restart - init - function * variable is set to 'initialize - factorial , so that the initialization steps commence when the Lisp image is started .
ftest .c details
The ftest .c file is fairly straightforward .
It calls the C wrapper shared library public functions initialize_factorial ( ) and factorial ( ) .
On the way out , terminate_factorial ( ) is called .
Looking at this code , there is no way to tell that the factorial shared library is Lisp based .
The example demonstrated
We start in a shell in the Allegro CL directory .
We change into the examples / unix - shared - library / directory :
% cd examples / unix - shared - library %
We type make to create the fact / directory and the ftest executable ( we have added some line breaks not in the original transcript ) :
% make rm -f build .tmp rm - fr fact echo '( compile - file " fact " ) ' >> build.tmp echo '( generate - application " fact " " fact / " ( list : list2 : foreign : defftype " lnkacl.fasl " " fact.fasl " ) : application - type : exe :application - files ( list " ftest " " liblnkacl.so " ) : restart - init- function nil : restart - app- function nil : include - compiler nil ) ' >> build.tmp echo ' ( exit 0 ) ' >> build.tmp LD_LIBRARY_PATH=. ; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH ; ../../ mlisp -L build.tmp ;;;

If the make experienced a problem , the last line would be different .
The dynamic library search path environment variable needs to be modified to include the new fact directory because the program needs to find the executable while running .
The name of this environment variable is system - dependent ( an appendix to unix - shared - library .htm lists the variable name on all supported systems ) .
On Linux , where we are running the example , the name is LD_LIBRARY_PATH , and the following command updates it ( you must use the path appropriate for your system , of course ) :
% setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH
{$LD_LIBRARY_PATH}:/home/dm/acl81/examples/unix-shared-library/fact
Now we are ready to calculate factorials .
We start with an easy one :
% fact / ftest 3 6
But because Lisp can handle integers of any ( reasonable ) size , quite large factorials can be calculated .
Because the value is actually returned as a string , no overflows occur ( but we have added linebreaks where necessary to avoid making the browser page too wide ) :
% fact / ftest 20 2432902008176640000 % fact / ftest 200 788657867364790503552363213932185062295135977687173263 294742533244359449963403342920304284011984623904177212 138919638830257642790242637105061926624952829931113462 857270763317237396988943922445621451664240254033291864

Files in the fact / directory
In the fact / directory after the application is built , we have on Linux the following files :
fact : the Lisp executable , a copy of mlisp in the Allegro directory .

fact .dxl : the Lisp image file , created by the make .

The filenames or extensions may be different on other platforms but the basic set of files will be the same .
McCain blames homeowners , speculation for mortgage crisis RAW STORY

In scathing remarks during a press event Tuesday in California , Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) blamed " rampant speculation " and homeowners who acted " irresponsibly " for the current mortgage default crisis , saying he saw no need to help distressed homeowners or the banks that loaned them the money .
" Drawing a sharp distinction between himself and the two Democratic presidential candidates , Senator John McCain of Arizona warned Tuesday against vigorous government action to solve the deepening mortgage crisis and the market turmoil it has caused , saying that 'it is not the duty of government to bail out and reward those who act irresponsibly , whether they are big banks or small borrowers , ' " the International Herald Tribune reported Wednesday .
Excerpts follow : McCain 's comments came a day after Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York called for direct federal intervention to help affected homeowners , including a $ 30 billion fund for states and communities to assist those at risk of foreclosure .
Clinton 's Democratic opponent , Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , has similarly called for greater federal involvement , including creation of a $ 10 billion relief package to prevent foreclosures .
As the foreclosure crisis has rippled across the economy , it has thrust itself to the forefront of the presidential race , with Democrats seizing on the issue in urging forceful government steps to alleviate the crisis .
McCain 's remarks Tuesday , to a group of Hispanic businessmen here , signaled a sharpening divide between the two parties ' candidates , with the senator warning against quick , costly government fixes to a crises rooted in the private sector .
" Rampant speculation " on both sides is the root cause of the crisis , McCain said .
He placed part of the responsibility for the mortgage mess on lenders , who he said had grown " complacent " in a rising market and as a result acquired a " false sense of security " that caused them to " lower their lending standards . "

Posted on February 16 , 2008 , Stephany Ex-Blizzard Employee Divorces Husband Over WoW
A California resident who once worked briefly for Blizzard has recently divorced her husband of six years because according to her , his addiction to World of Warcraft ruined their marriage .
Never having played the game herself , 28 year - old Jocelyn stated that her husband Peter ’s crippling addiction to the game became more than she could handle .
“ He would get home from work at 6:00 , start playing at 6:30 , and he ’d play until three a.m .
Weekends were worse — it was from morning straight through until the middle of the night .
It took away all of our time that we spent together .
I ceased to exist in his life . ”
Having been friends with Peter since the age of 13 and married for six years , it only took a paltry nine months for the marriage to collapse after receiving the game as a gift from her .
“ I bought the game for him for Christmas 2004 , when it first came out .
By May we had our first serious discussion about where our marriage was going , and by September I had moved out . ”
Having had many discussions on the fact that WoW had taken over Peter ’s life , Jocelyn tried to intervene and schedule “ together ” time with him – to no avail .
On one such occasion , she had set aside 30 minutes to watch a favorite TV show together , but he refused because he was in the middle of a raid and could not understand why she was upset that he stood her up .
Eventually , Peter ’s domestic duties also began to suffer for the game as he stopped paying bills and refused to do his share of the housework .
Although a gamer herself Jocelyn has never played WoW because she recognized the fact that it was a game that would never end and therefore did not wish to play it .
She also states that WoW was the sole catalyst for the divorce and is still highly emotional about its impact on her marriage .
“ I ’m real , and you ’re giving me up for a fantasy land .
You ’re destroying your life , your six - year marriage , and you ’re giving it up for something that is n’t even real .
[ Blizzard ] build it in such a way that you have to keep putting more and more time into it to maintain your status .
I remember thinking when I was married that it was downright exploitative to people who could n’t control themselves in that way .
It ’s set up like a drug . ”
Because of the emotional scars of the divorce and the reasons surrounding it , Jocelyn has stated that next time around , she will stay clear of gamers .
While this is indeed sad news for her and her ex-husband you cannot put the blame solely on WoW .
Granted , it has proven to be a highly addictive game for some people , but you have to consider their personality and their choices .
Someone like Peter more than likely has a mental issue and has a problem with addiction .
Who is to say that he does not have some other forms of addiction as well ?
His addiction could as easily have been pot , liquor , porn or meth – if she were to have brought them into the house it would have been a different addiction instead of gaming .
You have to go to the underlying source and peel back the layers .
Was he unhappy in his marriage to begin with ?
Was he miserable at his job ?
Was he highly depressed ?
Was this form of escape a way to keep from coping with the living hell that his life had become ?
All of these plus family history can become contributing factors to any sort of addiction .
During her interview with Yahoo !
Games , Joycelyn never stated or hinted around about counseling .
Did the two of them ever discuss the possibility of therapy ?
Did she ever consider canceling their internet service , his Blizzard account and throwing his WoW disc in the trash ?
No one knows the full story of why their marriage collapsed or if anything was done to try and salvage it other than “ together time ” to watch TV .
We may never know , but while this news is indeed sad for the both of them , I mostly feel sorry for Peter because he needs help before his life becomes a vicious cycle of self - loathing and addiction to something worse than a video game .
Blaming it all on WoW is just ignorance .

The traditional view of the Earth ’s interior has the crust ( where we live ) , the upper and inner mantle , the outer core , and the inner core ; wrapped around each other like layers of an onion .
But now textbooks will need to be revised .
It turns out there ’s an inner , inner core .
The core of Earth is known to have an inner core of solid iron about 2,400 km ( 1,500 miles ) .
Wrapped around that is a fluid outer core that reaches 7,000 km across ( 4,300 miles ) .
As the solid core rotates inside the fluid core , it generates the magnetic field that helps us navigate , and protects the planet from harmful radiation and the effects of the solar wind .
Geologists from the University of Illinois at Urbana - Chamaign have been probing the interior of the planet , trying to get a better sense of its structure .
And that ’s harder than it sounds .
You ca n’t just look down through thousands of km of solid rock .
There were using the natural waves that pass through the Earth after earthquakes shake on the surface .
The waves are bent and reflected as they pass through the various layers inside the planet .
The team was specifically studying how the waves were affected as they passed through the solid inner core and were surprised to see that it was n’t a uniform sphere of iron .
Instead , the seismic waves clearly showed that there ’s an additional layer at a diameter of 1,180 km ( 733 miles ) , which makes this less than half the diameter of the inner core .
This is the Earth ’s inner , inner core .
So what is it ?
Here ’s what the lead scientists , Xiaodong Song had to say :
“ Our results suggest the outer inner core is composed of iron crystals of a single phase with different degrees of preferred alignment along Earthâ€™s spin axis , ” Sun said .
“ The inner inner core may be composed of a different phase of crystalline iron or have a different pattern of alignment . ”
It ’s still iron , just not in the same crystalline structure .
Perhaps its time to give the layers new names , inner inner core does n’t quite work for me .

How does the gcc compiler get written ?
Who works on it and why ?
It seems to puzzle some people .
There are vast numbers of free software projects these days , far more than I try to keep track of .
Among these , gcc is unusual in several respects .
gcc is more than 20 years old as an active free software project .
gcc has a large number of active contributors .
gcc is not associated with any single company or organization .
gcc has a relatively informal organizational structure .
gcc has no single central maintainer .
there is significant commercial interest in gcc .
gcc has survived a significant shift in organizational approach : the egcs fork back in 1997 , which eventually took over as the mainline of gcc development .
What people seem to find most confusing is that gcc has no central governing body .
It is a collection of people who cooperate following loosely specified rules .
Many of those people are volunteers who are interested in compilers .
Many , perhaps a majority , work for companies which have a commercial interest in gcc .
No single party decides what to implement in gcc .
Instead , different people work on projects for reasons of their own .
As these projects near completion , they are loosely coordinated by the release managers ( until recently , there was only one release manager ) who decides in which order they should come into mainline .
The release manager does not reject projects .
gcc has a steering committee , but the committee does not make technical decisions , and does not decide what code will be written .
The main effect of the steering committee is to appoint maintainers for different parts of gcc .
This is considerable power , but in practice the steering committee has not chosen to wield it .
There have been essentially no controversies about choices of maintainers –the closest to a controversy has been discussions about which contri buting organizations may have too many maintainers .
How does the gcc community decide to work on something ?
Somebody puts forward a proposal and works on it .
If it needs more than one person , he or she gathers interest and tries to convince people to help .
There is no central directive to work on anything , although there is a list of suggested projects .
How does the gcc community reject a contribution ?
There are certain required guidelines : a copyright assignment for the code , various formatting and documentation requirements .
The code obviously has to work , and it has to not make the compiler significantly slower or otherwise worse .
Given those , pretty much the only way a contribution gets rejected is for somebody else to develop an alternative which makes the first contribution unnecessary .
How does the gcc community fix bugs ?
One way is that releases are not made until the number of open bugs is reduced to a certain level .
This encourages anybody interested in the release to work on bugs .
The other way is that some companies have a commercial interest in high quality releases ; they direct their employees to fix bugs .
How did this haphazard project produce a widely used compiler , probably second only to Microsoft Visual C++?
The compiler is not tied to any single organization , which means that it keeps going even when organizations fail .
Because the compiler is widely used , many people benefit from improving it .
Because it is free , many people are able to improve it .
gcc is a clear success story in the free software world .
Of course it has problems , but I do n’t think it has any structural problems which will prevent it from continuing on for many years in the future .
Welcome to part 2 of our restaurant greening guide .
If you recall from last week , I wrote about Ike ’s Quarter Cafe , a restaurant that has found a great balance of quality food , sustainability in their facilities , and a wonderful experience .
For those of you considering greening your restaurant , or just in search of ways to make eating a less impactful experience , this week we focus on that which goes around the food .
As in the utensils , cups , bowls , plates , and even the foil .
Ike ’s Quarter Cafe has been in business for seven years as of this month , and in that time has had plenty of opportunities to try out the various green options available .
And , lucky you , we ’re going to tell you the best of breed that they ’ve found !
There are a lot of great products out there , made out of everything from corn to potatoes to sugar cane stalks .
That ’s a wonderful alternative to using virgin paper or petroleum based ingredients .
And yet , there ’s the “ rubber meets the road ” factor of how they hold up with actual contents in them .
Specifically hot or wet contents .
In many cases , what started out as a delicious soup you first got has turned into a wet mess , with a melted , wilted bowl .
What to do ?
Go with Stalk Market , says Ike .
All of their products are made from sugar cane .
On their site , they break it down quite well :
It ’s biodegradable , compostable , and recyclable , can be used in the microwave , and put in the freezer too .
It resists oil , handles boiling water , and is both impermeable and non toxic .
And the cherry on top ?
Wood fiber free .
What was once waste product of sugar farming is now what sounds like an awesome , viable alternative for food service .
From bowls to plates to to - go containers , they ’ve got you covered , well .
I learned from Ike that they also make corn based straws .
What about napkins , and other paper products ?
Two recommendations here : Baywest Paper and SCA Tissue .
Baywest is Greenseal certified , which means they went through a thorough examination to meet the standards of Greenseal as a quality product .
Ike ’s uses them for their deli paper , goodie bags , window bags , and parchment paper .
SCA , says Ike , used to be Georgia Pacific , an enviro baddie in many people ’s book .
A Swedish company has since bought them , and now the result is SCA , based in the northwest US .
They do n’t as yet claim post consumer content , but they are one to keep an eye on .
What else is there ?
Foil .
Yes , the ubiquitous wrap for burritos and sandwiches everywhere .
You can now find a recycled alternative , from If You Care .
Have a look at this page for some interesting facts from them about aluminum .
To start , using recycled consumes 95 percent less electricity .
And finally , where does what needs to go in the trash , go ?
Envirobag .
In an interesting factoid , apparently these bags are made from recycled plastic bags that come from schools .
92 million of them so far .
Very worth supporting , I ’d say .
Want to know about green restaurant serviceware , and how to green your restaurant ?
Come on by to Ike ’s , they ’ll be glad to tell you .
And do n’t forget the corn bread .
This is an image of the Muslim prophet Mohammed :
Via AINA ; first published by Jyllands - Posten September 2005
So ’s this :
Via AINA ; first published by Jyllands - Posten September 2005
And also this :
I bring this up because , as you might have guessed , free speech and Islam are again in the news .
Last month , over a dozen Danish newspapers reprinted one of the twelve drawings of Mohammed that caused such a furor after they were first published in the Danish newspaper Jyllands - Posten in 2005 .
The artist of this particular cartoon , Kurt Westergaard , has been under police protection , and recently the Danish police arrested three Muslims whom they alleged were plotting to murder him .
The republication of the cartoons was to show solidarity with Westergaard and to demonstrate the newspapers ’ commitment to free speech in the face of threats from violent fanatics .
The response from the Muslim world was predictable :
The militant Palestinian group Hamas attracted thousands of protesters to a rally in the Gaza Strip last night , when a speaker urged them to bomb Danish embassies and kill the country ’s ambassadors , Danish broadcaster TV2 said on its
Web site today .
The threats from these deranged , bloodthirsty lunatics were to be expected by now .
However , I ’m disappointed with the response of the Danish prime minister :
“ The Danish government respects all faiths and their religious feelings , ” Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen said today in his weekly press meeting at his Copenhagen offices , broadcast live by TV2 .
“ When a long line of independent media decide to reprint the pictures , it ’s not with the intention to insult religious feelings , but to document the background for the murder plans that police have unfolded . ”
Who cares if the intention was to “ insult religious feelings ” ?
That is one of the rights of the press in a free society .
It ’s ludicrous to ban the publication of anything that hurts people ’s feelings , religious or otherwise .
To do that would eradicate free speech altogether by creating a heckler ’s veto for the most thin - skinned members of society to censor anything that offends them .
Is Prime Minister Rasmussen saying that we should n’t criticize any group that will react violently ?
Is n’t the violent response itself an indication that the group in question needs to be criticized ?
It ’s not just the Danes who ’ve been targeted by religious aggressors who think that their dogma should be binding on everyone else .
Wikipedia has been targeted by a flood of petitions demanding that it remove medieval Islamic depictions of Mohammed from its article on him .
To their great credit , the Wikipedia administrators have refused , explaining their position clearly and concisely and reaffirming that they will not censor their encyclopedia for the benefit of any particular group .
Others have not been so lucky .
The Turkish publishing house that translated Richard Dawkins ’
The God Delusion is under investigation on a charge of “ insulting religious values ” .
This even though Turkey is relatively secular , as Muslim - majority nations go .
Fortunately , Turkey is also attempting to join the European Union , whose laws protecting free speech are much better ( if not perfect ) .
Hopefully , this will serve as a wedge that will persuade the Turkish government to lay aside the more regressive of their laws .
Another writer who ’s clashed with fanatics is the French philosopher and atheist Michel Houellebecq , who was charged with inciting racism in 2002 for calling Islam a “ stupid ” religion .
( He quite reasonably pointed out that you ca n’t be racist against a religion , only against a race . )
Thankfully , he was acquitted , but the threat is far from over .
As the more recent case of Ezra Levant shows , there are still plenty of Muslims who ’ll seize every opportunity to use well - intentioned but horribly misguided “ hate speech ” laws as a weapon to shut down any criticism of their beliefs .
And , as Hamas ’ anti-cartoon rally shows , there are many more Muslims who will gleefully call for violence at the slightest provocation .
Western society needs to recognize – it should already be abundantly clear – that Muslim groups and individuals are not calling for the censorship of anti-Islamic speech because their delicate , fragile feelings have been wounded .
No , they ’re calling for censorship because it is their undisguised ambition to conquer the world and turn it into a brutal theocracy under their heel , where all dissenters and nonbelievers would be silenced or put to death .
These measures are , in their eyes , just the first step in that plan .
( I take pains to emphasize that I ’m not including every Muslim in this condemnation , only those who seek to stifle criticism whether through law or through bloodshed . )
Since these groups have n’t gotten the message , we need to inform them more clearly that , whatever rules they choose to follow for themselves , we non-Muslims are not bound by those rules .
The best way to do this would be for many papers and media outlets to rerun the above images and others .
This would send a clear and uniform message of defiance , communicating a commitment to free speech that cannot be silenced by a few belligerent fanatics , and would leave them with no single target even if they did lash out .
Carla Bruni First Lady of France - Marries Nicolas Sarkozy
Reuters is reporting that French Presidentmarried , 40 , at his Elysee Palace residence earlier today .
The couple were engaged one month ago and indicated they would wed in a private setting .
The information was broadcast on RTL radio .
Sarkozy , 53 , ended his marriage in October 2007 to second wife Cecilia after 11 years .
Within two months he was photographed in public with Carla Bruni .
It was very obvious that they were a couple as they took in the sights of Paris Disneyland .
They continued their affair over the holiday 's and made their engagement announcement shortly afterward .
The French voters have complained that he is concentrating on his personal affairs at the expense of his official duties .
Perhaps this is why the couple moved so swiftly to tie the knot .
There has been some speculation that Bruni is pregnant .
Bruni , a former supermodel has changed careers and has now turned to singing .
She has one son by an earlier relationship .
Sarkozy has two adult sons from his first marriage and one son by second wife Cecilia .
We 've reported earlier on the romantic link between the couple .
We 've also recently featured Carla Bruni posing nude in Spanish magazine .
EU countries want Mr Thaci to wait until they are ready
" There are some procedures we need to respect and some consultations , " he told reporters after meeting EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana in Brussels .
Kosovo is still technically a southern province of Serbia , which strongly opposes its independence .
EU states have asked Kosovo 's leadership to wait before a civilian mission can take over from the UN .
A police and judicial staff of about 1,800 is being prepared to work in tandem with the existing Nato force that went into Kosovo in 1999 .
' Pandora 's box '
The future status of Kosovo is also an important issue in the Serbian presidential election , which goes to a second round early next month .
The BBC's Oana Lungescu says the EU wants Hashim Thaci to delay declaring independence until the election is over .
A European Commission spokeswoman earlier declined to discuss a date .
" We are in a very sensitive political context in which it is better to resort to diplomatic means than to public statements , " she said .
In his comments to reporters , Mr Thaci repeated earlier statements that a declaration would be made in co-ordination with the European Union and the United States .
Russia insists any change in Kosovo 's status must have the backing of Belgrade as well as Pristina .
Moscow 's new ambassador to Nato , Dmitry Rogozin , has called on Serbia to resist Western recognition of independence for Kosovo , saying it could open a " Pandora 's box " .
District - level delegates and alternates are elected by caucus followed by a primary .
Convention delegates selected at the district level are allocated in proportion to the percentage of the primary vote won by that presidential candidate in that district .
Each candidate who receives at least 15 percent of the primary vote will be awarded delegates .

Dick Cheney kicked off the three - day Conservative Political Action Conference ( CPAC ) last week with a preemptory analysis of President Bush ’s legacy .
It was a speech chock full of the self - serving misrepresentations the American public — which now rejects Bush ’s leadership by a huge majority — has come to expect from the administration .
But this was CPAC , an annual gathering of hard - core right - wing activists from across the country who are , in Cheney ’s words , “ the heart and soul of the conservative community . ”
Attendees cheered when Cheney said that President Bush “ faces challenges squarely ” without “ passing them on to future generations ” — ignoring the ongoing war in Iraq and the record deficit that will be created by the president ’s latest budget .
Cheney claimed that letting the Bush tax cuts expire would be one of the “ largest government money grabs in American history ” because it would supposedly raise taxes an average of $ 1,800 , even though the vast majority of American taxpayers would n’t see anything close to that tax hike .
Cheney got a standing ovation when he insisted that the administration ’s overseas interrogation program ( the program that introduced rendition , black sites , and “ we do not torture ” into our national vernacular ) has obtained important and useful information .
At one point during the speech , the audience chanted “ Four more years ! ”
Later , while the crowd waited for Mitt Romney and John McCain to speak , a conservative book seminar began , and panelists extolled the virtues of Barry Goldwater ’s Conscience of a Conservative and Ayn Rand ’s Atlas Shrugged .
“ The heroes of Atlas Shrugged were businessmen !
Absolutely astonishing ! ” said Edward Hudgins , executive director of the Atlas Society , an organization that champions Rand ’s philosophy of “ rational , principled individualism . ”
Rand , Hudgins said , instructed her readers to protect their lives , their privacy , and their businesses as they protect their children .
“ How would you feel if the government decided to molest your children ? ” he asked .
Over the course of day one , Mitt Romney dropped out of the presidential race and John McCain got booed .
( Other things that got booed : Keith Olbermann , France , universal health care , and the idea of a “ living Constitution . ” )
The candidates ’ appearances have been well - covered elsewhere , so I ’ll only mention that many attendees told me that they will refuse to vote for John McCain , seeing him as not conservative enough .
One young man , who must have been born in the late ’ 80s , said that he would write in Ronald Reagan ’s name .
Griping , in fact , was a major activity at the conference .
The fact that a supposed false conservative was about to don the mantle of the Republican Party was irksome enough , but there were also Hillary Clinton , Hollywood , and the liberal media to contend with .
Right around the corner , it seemed , waited a welfare / nanny state , attacks from radical jihadists , and a legion of activist judges determined to pervert American society .
And then there are immigrants .
After McCain ’s speech , a man handed out flyers to audience members as they exited the auditorium .
“ Amerixianada ?? Meximerianada ?? ” it read .
“ Whatever they might call it , we must STOP the gradual , planned merging of America with Mexico and Canada . ” I asked the man what he thought about John McCain .
He snorted .
I asked him who he would vote for .
“ Maybe a third party , ” he said .
“ Someone who will really secure the borders . ”
As we were talking , a glowering , heavyset gentleman glanced at the flyer and stopped in his tracks .
He poked the man I was speaking with in the chest .
“ Unless white people like you start having more children , you can kiss this country goodbye , ” he said .
Day two started with President Bush ’s address to the conference at 7:15 am .
Doors opened at 5 a.m. , and attendees stumbled into the ballroom bleary - eyed but excited .
At the front of the room , a young man named Dayton sat next to a row of sleeping college students .
I asked him how early he and his friends had gotten in line .
“ Oh , about 3 a.m. , ” he said cheerfully .
“ A lot of people just stayed up . ”
During his speech , the president ticked off his accomplishments , but concluded by insisting that he is n’t concerned with his legacy because “ history ’s verdict takes time to reveal itself . ”
Bush ’s speech , like Cheney ’s , received chants of “ Four more years ! ”
“ I think President Bush has been a superb president , probably the best in history , ” Frances Rice , chairman of the National Black Republican Association , told me afterward , when I asked her whether she would prefer another Bush term to a potential McCain administration .
“ I have not been a supporter of John McCain , but if he is our nominee I will definitely support him . ”
Another attendee told me , in reference to McCain , that the worst Republican is better than the best Democrat .
Later , I wandered into the CPAC exhibition hall , a good place to take the pulse of the CPAC crowd .
It is the only space in the convention not stage - managed by the event ’s media - savvy organizers .
There , attendees could purchase every book ever written by Ayn Rand and Ann Coulter , or , if they were in the mood for less weighty fare , the Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam .
They could buy a Hillary Clinton bobblehead , featuring Hillary ’s face mounted on donkey ’s body , or bumper stickers that said , “ Press 1 for English , Press 2 for Deportation ” and “ KFC Hillary Special : 2 Fat Thighs , 2 Small Breasts , Left Wing . ”
There was also a t - shirt that read , “ I ’d rather be waterboarded than vote for John McCain . ”
A booth staffed by a friendly young man working for an anti-abortion group called the American Society for the Defense of Tradition , Family and Property , offered a flyer entitled “ 10 Reasons Why Abortion is Wrong . ”
Number nine : “ Addressing an abortionist .
Once you were an enchanting child , as all babies are .
Today you are an abortionist , a killer of babies .
Do you not regret your wicked deeds ?
Do you not see the innocent blood of our children that stains your hands and cries out to God ? ”
And an organization called America ’s Majority offered literature aimed at college students giving tips on how to “ Defeat Radical Islam on YOUR Campus . ”
Unlike the speaking venues , which were crawling with reporters , the exhibition hall was primarily filled with conference attendees from around the country .
I asked John Curry from Virginia for his take on the Democratic candidates .
“ Hillary is just a criminal , that ’s all , ” he said .
“ A criminal .
She just wants to get back in the White House so she can steal the rest of the furnishings . ”
What about Obama ?
“ I think if Obama becomes the obvious frontrunner , he will meet with a horrible accident like the other people that have perished because of the Clinton ’s animosity towards him .
He ’ll be offed , ” he said .
He paused .
“ Also , he does n’t have the experience to run this country . ”
During a 15 - minute conversation , during which Curry managed to use the words “ pakis , ” “ japs , ” and “ sandniggers , ” he delivered a lengthy discourse on the fallacy of global warming , blaming climate change on ice age cycles , sun spot activity , and the currents of the Artic Ocean reversing directions .
On a television screen nearby , former U.N. ambassador John Bolton was wrapping up a foreign policy presentation , claiming that the administration has proof that North Korea is assisting Syria with a nuclear program .
( For evidence to the contrary , read Seymour Hersh ’s latest piece in the New Yorker . )
Next on the conference agenda was a panel discussion on the “ Future of the Life Debate , ” headlined by Wendy Wright , president of Concerned Women for America ; Nigel Cameron , president of the Institute on Biotechnology and the Human Future ; and Representatives Trent Franks ( R - Ariz . ) and Lynn Westmoreland ( R - Ga . ) .
Wright spoke first , claiming that the world is awash in contraceptives — and that global family planning efforts are hopelessly ineffective because people in Third World countries are simply not using them .
In the Philippines , she said , there are so many birth control pills that people use them to fertilize their orchids ; in India , people use their extra condoms to waterproof roofs .
She also suggested that Roe v. Wade “ demands ” sex selection abortion .
Cameron , speaking on how new technologies challenge the “ culture of life , ” told the audience that scientific advancements giving people more information about their unborn children will create a “ new eugenics , ” that will grade people on a number of different criteria , including intelligence and physical fitness .
He also made references to potential technological developments that currently exist only in science fiction novels , such as blurring the human / animal line and downloading the human consciousness onto a computer hard drive .
After Cameron ’s presentation , Trent Franks ’ remarks comparing abortion to the Holocaust and to slavery seemed relatively mild .
Later that day , Ann Coulter , who ’d previously pledged to throw her support behind Hillary Clinton if McCain became the Republican nominee , told a room full of college students that Barack Obama ’s only notable achievement was “ being born half - black ” and that John McCain ’s greatest accomplishment was getting captured by the Vietnamese .
“ I know plenty of Republican POWs , ” she said .
“ We ’re not going to make them all president . ”
Coulter got a huge round of applause when she advocated torturing terrorists .
Afterward , I asked a young attendee named Katie about the “ I want Ann Coulter ” sticker she was wearing .
“ I love Ann Coulter , ” she said .
“ I think she ’s a role model for young women . ”
In an effort reminiscent of the bitter “ Swift Boat ” campaign during the 2004 presidential race , a group of New York firefighters who lost sons in the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks is organizing a political committee to take on former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in Republican primary states .
A leader of the 9/11 Firefighters and Families group met Tuesday with union leaders and political consultants , readying plans to set up a tax - exempt committee that would fund appearances and a media drive against Giuliani .
Jim Riches , a New York deputy fire chief whose firefighter son was killed during the attack , said the group aimed to raise doubts about the central premise of Giuliani ’s presidential campaign -- his leadership role on Sept. 11 .
“ If we have to follow him around all 2008 we ’ll do it , ” Riches said .
Lauded as “ America ’s Mayor ” for his blunt talk and compassion after the attacks , Giuliani ’s political stock soared , and he built a multimillion - dollar consulting group emphasizing his leadership skills .

“ A majority of firefighters believe that Rudy was a great leader on 9/11 , ” said Howard Safir , who ran the New York Fire and Police departments under Giuliani and now heads First Responders for Rudy , a group affiliated with Giuliani ’s campaign .
But the former New York mayor ’s frequent references to Sept. 11 on the campaign trail have infuriated Riches and about 20 activists who lost firefighter sons .
The New Yorkers blame Giuliani for decision - making failures that they say contributed to the deaths .
After protesting near Giuliani fundraising events in New York to little fanfare , they now plan to raise their voices in Florida , South Carolina and other primary states seen as essential to Giuliani ’s path to the GOP nomination .
“ When he announced his plans to run for president we felt he was doing it on the backs of our dead sons , ” Riches said .
The 9/11 group is already being compared by some political observers to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth group that damaged the candidacy of Sen. John F. Kerry ( D - Mass. ) in 2004 by impugning his Vietnam War service in the Navy .
Both groups feature a self - sustaining constituency of passionate supporters and are aided by outside political forces eager to use them as vehicles in the presidential race .

“ Starting small does n’t mean you can count them out , ” said Stephanie Cutter , a political consultant who countered the attacks as Kerry ’s press aide in 2004 .
“ When the Swift Boat group started . . . they had no money and no plan .
In a matter of months they had enough money to go up with an ad buy , and that triggered their relevance . ”
The Swift Boat Veterans for Truth raised more than $ 25 million for media buys .
Some of the money was donated in multimillion - dollar installments from reliable Republican fundraisers , including Texas businessmen T. Boone Pickens Jr. and Bob J. Perry .
But last December , the group was fined almost $ 300,000 by the Federal Election Commission for exceeding spending limits and acting in concert with GOP campaign efforts .
The Swift Boat operation used an Internal Revenue Service exemption that allowed so - called 527 groups -- a reference to IRS code -- to raise funds and participate in political debate as long as they followed funding and election rules .
“ To the extent that new 527 groups would like to do what the Swift Boat group did in 2004 may be subject down the road to much stiffer penalties than the Swift Boat people got , ” said Paul S. Ryan , associate legal counsel with the Campaign Legal Center , a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog group .

According to several participants at Tuesday ’s discussions between Riches and his supporters from the International Assn. of Fire Fighters union , the 9/11 group is leaning toward using a 527 structure .
Riches said the group had already been pledged nearly $ 200,000 and hoped to raise as much as $ 1 million for a website , media buys and campaign travel .
The Giuliani campaign , reeling in recent weeks from dropping poll numbers and running controversies , has already taken steps to blunt the firefighters ’ attacks .
Heading the campaign ’s First Responders for Rudy , Safir has appeared on several political talk shows with Riches , but was careful not to engage him face - to - face , recognizing the delicacy of debating a Sept. 11 victim .
“ We owe all families that lost loved ones on 9/11 an unpayable debt , but finally this small group is admitting that this is a political attack with no other objective than to tarnish Mayor Giuliani ’s good name , ” Safir said Tuesday .
Earlier this year , the union produced an ad for its website that featured Riches and other New York firefighters criticizing Giuliani for blunders before and after Sept. 11 .
The New Yorkers said that Giuliani failed to provide first responders with proper radio equipment before the attacks and sharply reduced recovery teams at the World Trade Center site afterward even though many firefighters ’ bodies had not been found .
Advertisement
Giuliani and his aides have long disputed the radios ’ role in the collapse of emergency communications on Sept. 11 .
In a recent interview , Safir said that the “ radios worked ” but the repeaters -- which can extend the range of the radios into high - rise buildings -- did not .
The 9/11 group ’s effort to raise questions about Giuliani ’s performance before and after the attacks “ takes on Rudy ’s strength , ” said Republican consultant Tom Edmonds .
“ I ’m not sure that will go over with an American public that was impressed with what they saw . ”
But Riches and fellow activists , seared by their losses and offended by Giuliani ’s emphasis on Sept. 11 as the crucible of his leadership , say they expect to travel to primary states early in the new year to turn up the heat on the former mayor .
“ Stay tuned , ” Riches said .

Year - on - year percentage change in monthly consumer food prices and prices paid to farmers ( average across all farm products ) Jan 1970 - October 2007 .
Source Bureau of Labor Statistics , and National Agricultural Statistics Service .
Graph is not zero - scaled .
Click to enlarge .
The Archdruid had a piece last week about the likely future of agriculture in a world with less fossil fuel .
In that piece , he had an unsourced statistic stating that US food inflation was currently 20 % .
That sounded high to me .
A quick check at the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirmed that current food inflation for US consumers is just a little north of 4 % .
In email with the Archdruid , he came up with more statistics .
The FAO 's global food price index , which summarizes agricultural commodity prices , rose 37 % year on year to September 2007 .
This piqued my interest to explore the issue a little further , and here is a quick tour of what I found .
Let 's start by looking at the last almost 50 years of consumer inflation in the United States .
I have separated out energy , food and beverages , and everything else ( this last is often called " core " inflation by economists ) .
In this graph I am showing the percentage change in prices from 12 months ago to the current month :
Year - on - year percentage change in monthly energy prices , food prices , and the rest of the CPI inflation basket Jan 1960 - October 2007 .
Source Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Graph is not zero - scaled .

As you can see , energy prices are far more volatile than everything else , but food is only slightly more volatile than the average consumer good .
Energy price inflation is now of the same order of magnitude as in the 1970s , but food inflation is not yet that remarkable at the consumer level .
At least , not when averaged across the BLS 's basket of food items .
This next graph is the same , but zooms in just on the period from 1978 to now , and with some of the full range of the energy inflation cut off .
I have also emphasized the green food curve more heavily , and made the red energy curve partially transparent , to allow food to be seen more easily :
Year - on - year percentage change in monthly energy prices , food prices , and the rest of the CPI inflation basket Jan 1978 - October 2007 .

Graph is not zero - scaled .
Click to enlarge .
Again , consumer food price inflation is a little over 4 % .
This is well below levels in the late 1980s , never mind the 1970s .
However , it is rising rapidly .
I next explored farm prices by looking at the National Agricultural Statistics Service statistics for average prices for all farm products .
I 've plotted the yearly changes in that basket on the same graph with the consumer food price changes :

As you can see , the prices that farmers receive for their wares are much more volatile than the prices that consumers see at the checkout stand .
In general , farmers have had a miserable couple of decades in the 1980s and 1990s as their price increases generally fell below other forms of inflation .
Indeed farm prices frequently dropped substantially even in nominal terms .
However , since 2000 , they have been seeing larger price increases , and for a larger fraction of the time .
However , this series , too , is not at 1970s levels .
At least not yet .
Unfortunately , the NASS all farm products price series only goes through the end of 2006 .
That conceals what is probably a significant spike in prices in 2007 , centered in grain prices .
Here are corn prices ( and now I 'm switching to price levels ( of futures contracts ) rather than percentage changes .

Corn has gone up dramatically .
Wheat is even more dramatic :

Among major cereals , this season ’s main protagonist is wheat , the supply of which has been hampered by production shortfalls in Australia , a major exporter , and low world stocks , while demand has been strong , not only for food but also feed .
In September , wheat was traded at record prices , between 50 and 80 percent above last year .
Maize prices increased progressively from the middle of last year until February 2007 , when they hit a ten - year high , but have fallen considerably since .
Supply constraints in the face of brisk demand for biofuels triggered the initial price hike in maize prices .
However , reacting to a massive expansion in plantings and expectations of a record crop this year , prices have started to come down , although by September they had still remained 30 percent above last year .
Prices of barley , another important cereal , also soared lately .
Supply problems in Australia and Ukraine , tighter availability of maize and other feed grains , compounded with strong import demand , have contributed to the doubling of prices of both feed and malting barley in recent weeks .
The tightness in the grain sector also affected the oilseed complex , which witnessed a year - on - year price surge of at least 40 percent , depending on crops and products .
Soaring maize markets during the second half of the previous season contributed to keeping oilseed prices at high levels as maize plantings expanded at the expense of oilseed plantings .
Due to the expected shrinking of world supplies and historically low inventories in 2007 , in the face of faster rising demand for food and biodiesel , as well as unusually strong demand for feed , oilseed markets are experiencing further increases in prices in these early months of the new season .
Among all agricultural commodities , dairy products have witnessed the largest gains compared with last year , ranging from 80 percent to more than 200 percent .
Higher animal feed costs , tight dairy supplies following the running down of inventories in the European Union and drought in Australia , the suspension of exports by some countries coupled with the imposition of taxes by others , and dynamic import demand are the main factors that have sustained dairy prices at historically high levels .
The causes ?
As the UN Food and Agricultural Organization Summarizes Here 's milk , at the center of the dairy sector price increases mentioned above :

Not all commodities have gone up though , explaining how averages are lower than the wheat / corn high flyers .

This commodity inflation has a much more muted effect on consumer prices in developed countries , since we largely eat fairly processed foods .
The actual commodity ( ie food ) input in what we buy in the grocery store is a modest fraction .
For example , wheat costs about 16c / lb , but bread is well over a dollar a pound .
Hence bread prices have not increased nearly as much , percentage - wise , as wheat prices , though they are up :

Products unlinked to the major commodities are often not unusually high .
Eg , nothing special has happened to the price of lettuce :

In short , although commodity prices for key agricultural products have increased a lot lately , the impact on consumer food prices in the developed world is quite modest , and no immediate threat to middle class consumers .
Calls to stockpile food are way off the mark in my opinion .
We have a huge amount of room to eat more cheaply by eating less processed food and less meat .
However , it 's another story altogether in the developing world , where a massive tragedy may be in the early stages of playing out if the trends of this year were to continue .
Very poor people eat far less processed food , and rely very heavily on cereals , so they are much more exposed to the price rises in grains than western consumers .
I have n't been able to find any statistics on diet / hunger that are recent enough to show the effects of this year 's price rises , but we can engage in some speculation based on long standing patterns of diet .
For example , here 's consumption of major food groups in a very poor nation , Bangladesh :
Consumption of major food groups in Bangladesh 1964 - 1996 .
Source FAO Nutrition Country Profile for Bangladesh .
Click to enlarge .
As you can see , the diet in Bangladesh is completely dominated by grains , no doubt mostly rice .
And Bangladeshis were hungry to begin with :
Rates of malnutrition in Bangladesh are among the highest in the world .
More than 54 % of preschool - age children , equivalent to more than 9.5 million children , are stunted , 56 % are underweight and more than 17 % are wasted .
Although all administrative divisions were affected by child malnutrition there were important differences in the prevalences of the three anthropometric indicators ...
Bangladeshi children also suffer from high rates of micronutrient deficiencies , particularly vitamin A , iron , iodine and zinc deficiency .
Bangladesh should be commended for making significant progress in reducing vitamin A deficiency ( VAD ) among preschool children over the past 15 years ; however , consumption of vitamin A rich foods is still low , suggesting that the underlying causes of VAD require further attention and support .
Anemia is also highly prevalent among children in Bangladesh and few programs have been initiated to improve their iron status ...
Malnutrition among women is also extremely prevalent in Bangladesh .
More than 50 percent of women suffer from chronic energy deficiency and studies suggest that there has been little improvement in women 's nutritional status over the past 20 years ...
It 's not hard to imagine that sharp increases in the price of grains will have immediate and significant effects in worsening the situation of people already so vulnerable .
Closer to home , here is the diet of a less destitute country , Mexico :
Consumption of major food groups in Mexico 1964 - 2000 .

Here , cereals make up about half the calorific intake ( which is ample on average ) .
So Mexicans are not as vulnerable as Bangladeshis .
Still , the averages will hide many poorer people who have both less food altogether , and a much higher proportion of it from corn and rice ( staples of the Mexican diet ) .
And increasing the hardship of Mexico 's poor is just about certain to increase their tendency to try to move north across the border , which is a major source of political tension in the US .
And there lie the key issues for wealthy citizens of developed nations I think .
In the last year , there have been food riots , protests , or stampedes in Mauritania , China , Senegal , India , Pakistan , Morocco , Mexico , Yemen , Indonesia , and Burkina Faso .
If food prices continue to go up , the world 's middle classes will still be able to afford ample food .
But it 's hard to see how , in the long term , we will be insulated from the social and ecological collapses that might get triggered in poor countries .
Bill Gates , the chairman of Microsoft and a global philanthropist , called upon fellow business leaders at the World Economic Forum last week to pursue a kinder form of capitalism .
But on Friday , the brand of capitalism practiced by his company ’s chief executive , Steven A. Ballmer , came with a decidedly hard edge .
Microsoft ’s $ 44.6 billion bid for Yahoo , pushed by Mr. Ballmer , was hostile .
And during a conference call Friday with analysts and in a subsequent interview , he never once uttered the word “ Google , ” referring to the Internet search giant that has humbled Microsoft only as “ the leader ” in the online world .
Mr. Ballmer , 51 , is a famously fierce competitor .
To him , failure is never an option .
“ If we do n’t get it right at first , we ’ll just keep coming and coming and coming and coming , ” he said in an earlier interview .

Demonoid.com , one of the most popular BitTorrent trackers , was forced to go offline again because the Canadian Recording Industry Association ( CRIA ) threatened their ISP .
It ’s been just over 6 weeks since the CRIA allegedly shut down the Demonoid BitTorrent tracker .
Details were scarce at the time , with lots of people simply claiming the site had some technical or server issues .
Indeed , TorrentFreak came in for quite some criticism when we claimed the CRIA was involved , but when the site returned there were some ominous signs which seemed to support our claims .
Eventually , the Demonoid trackers reappeared , followed by the site itself but was forced to block Canadian visitors by the CRIA .
However , despite blocking Canadians , it seems the CRIA has n’t yet had enough of harassing Demonoid and its host .
On Demonoid.com we now read :
“ The CRIA threatened the company renting the servers to us , and because of this it is not possible to keep the site online .
Sorry for the inconvenience and thanks for your understanding . ”
Indeed , Demonoid ’s host had previously said that if it had any major hassle , it was likely it could pull the plug on the site .
A message on the Demonoid IRC channel says : “ Site is down , tracker is up .
Expect the site to return , unless we hear otherwise from Deimos . ”
Canada seems to becoming more unfriendly for BitTorrent sites – Demonoid are n’t the only ones being threatened by the recording labels there .
Developing story
JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) - A Palestinian stabbed an Israeli rabbi in Arab East Jerusalem on Tuesday , emergency services said , in an attack likely to further increase already high tensions in the city .
The rabbi , 49 , was stabbed in the neck but his wounds did not appear to be life - threatening , ambulance workers said .
The Zaka emergency service said he was walking with a bodyguard in Jerusalem ’s walled Old City , where his seminary is located , when he was attacked .
The bodyguard gave chase but the attacker escaped , leaving behind a blood - stained knife .
Amending preliminary information that had pointed to two attackers , a police spokesman said a single Palestinian had stabbed the rabbi .
The spokesman described the incident , near the Old City ’s Damascus Gate , a busy area of Palestinian shops and cafes , as politically motivated .
Tensions have been high in Jerusalem since a Palestinian gunman killed eight students at a Jewish seminary in the city on March 6 .
On Sunday , dozens of right - wing Israeli activists hurled stones at cars and houses in the Arab neighborhood in East Jerusalem where the gunman , who was killed by an off - duty army officer during the assault on the seminary , had lived .
Israel annexed East Jerusalem after capturing it in the 1967 Middle East and considers all of the city its capital , a claim that has not been recognized internationally .
Palestinians want East Jerusalem , which includes the Old City and holy sites at the heart of the Arab - Israeli conflict , to be the capital of the state they aspire to establish in the occupied West Bank and the Gaza Strip .

President Ahmadinejad came under criticism from a senior cleric
The remarks have intensified the debate over the return of the Shia saviour , the 12th Imam known as the Mehdi .
Since Mr Ahmadinejad came to power he has repeatedly spoken of the need to plan for the Mehdi 's imminent return .
Shia believe he went into hiding more than 1,000 years ago but will return to save the world from injustice .
Scathing criticism
Many Shia clerics do not approve of the cult rapidly growing around the Mehdi .
Iran 's former nuclear negotiator , Hassan Rowhani , has complained about what he calls games , superstitions and trickery that make a mockery of the people .
Hassan Rowhani said the 12th Imam himself made it clear that anybody who claimed to have seen him would be a liar .
Mr Rowhani asked how two or three years ago one person could have said the Mehdi would return in a couple of years .
Some Shia believe the 12th Imam will return soon
His government has often discussed plans for the return of the 12th Imam and Mr Ahmadinejad frequently refers to the " Absent Imam " in speeches .
President Ahmadinejad has also spent millions of dollars on a mosque at Jamkaran , south of the capital , where pilgrims post letters with their prayers to the 12th Imam down a well .
Mr Rowhani's attack on those who promote the idea that the saviour will come soon is one of the most scathing by a prominent cleric .
He said when they pray some people already lay another prayer mat for the " Missing Imam " .
Others set an extra plate on the dinner table for the Imam .
He complained some Iranians were even scheduling meetings on Fridays because that is the day they think the 12th Imam will return .
A few people have recently been asking very similar things -- this is an example : I 'd been a writer professionally for about five or six years , and had three or four books published before I decided that it was time to get an agent , and I got that agent ( Merrilee Heifetz , of Writers House ) because she 'd just sold DON'T PANIC ! on behalf of Titan Books in the UK , and we met while I was in New York , and I liked her and felt very confident in her ; she 's been my agent for almost 18 years now ; which is my way of saying that I do n't know much about the ins and outs of getting agents .
I have read Ten Percent of Nothing , however , a book which explains how Dorothy L. Deering , possessing a high school degree , a recent embezzlement conviction , and no experience as a professional writer , editor , or publisher , began operating a fee - based literary agency out of her garage in Nicholasville , Kentucky .
Over the next ten years , she racked up a fortune in reading and marketing fees , learning the business of sham publishing as she went along .
Later , as the owner of a vanity press , she bilked 1.5 million dollars out of her clients , masterfully manufacturing dreams of literary success until she was brought to justice by Fisher�s investigative journalism , an FBI probe , and the retaliation and testimonies of numerous victims .
So I know there are bad people out there who call themselves literary agents .
And best of all , I know Teresa Nielsen Hayden .
Teresa's an editor at Tor Books ( she 's edited other places too over the years ) and a weblogger besides -- http://www.nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/ -- and she knows publishing better than anyone else I 've ever met .
So I asked her ... What I got back was the kind of comprehensive post that aspiring authors should read with care .
Study , even .
Mark it and copy it and use it as a resource :
Hi , Neil -- Happy to answer .
1 .
If you 're writing fiction , the True Secret Answer is " get anoffer . "
If you 've got an offer , you can get an agent .
If you don ' thave an offer , you do n't want the kind of agent you 're likely to get .a .
If you 're good enough to get published , having an agent may provehelpful .
If you are n't ( yet ) , you definitely do n't want the kind ofagent you 're going to get .i.
There is no substitute for writing a book that people want to buyand read .
If you can do that , you can get published .
If you can't , noclever workaround will help , because we can't force people to buy andread books they do n't like .b.
Some ways you might get an agent without getting an offer : Beobviously and extraordinarily good .
Sell a lot of short stories .
Havesome other seriously hot credentials .
2 . Do n't start by looking for an agent .
Do your research first .
Startby learning about agents , submissions , publishing houses , theindustry , et cetera .
Note :
This is a huge subject .a.
No matter how you think it works , the publishing industry doesn ' twork the way you think it does .
This is true even for publishingprofessionals .
They know how their part of the industry works , andthey know a lot about adjacent areas , but the further afield they go , the less reliable their expertise will be .
People who are n't in theindustry generally do n't have a clue .i.
A phenomenal number of articles about how publishing works arewritten by people who do n't know what they 're talking about .
This ispartly because writing about writing , or writing about publishing , iswhat wanna - be authors do when they 've given up on writing , but don' tyet want to admit it .
It 's also because a made - up version of thepublishing industry is going to be much simpler and more logical thanthe real thing , and thus is easier to write about .ii .
Look askance at articles that credit some industry practice to thestupidity of people working in the industry , who have failed to seethe simple and obvious solution the author of the article is about tosuggest .
3 .
There are easily as many scam agents , useless agents , and cluelessagents as there are real ones .
They all swap bad information with eachother .
The difference is that the scammers know it 's bad information .a.
You can't research this subject just by getting online and looking .
You have to stick to good sources .
4 .
Did I mention that any idiot can write a book about how to be awriter ?
When you see someone who 's never sold a book , but who 'swritten a book about how to get your book published , and said book waspublished by a vanity house , and said author is nevertheless acceptedas an authority on the subject by a great many aspiring writers , youknow you 've wandered into strange territory .a.
The scary part is that I 've just described more than oneAuthoritative Source of Advice about Writing and Publishing .b.
Any idiot can put up a website , too.c .
Check out your source 's credentials .i.

That was sarcasm : actually it looks like it 's turning into a Waterstones PR disaster -- as the Guardian in http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1388249,00.html gets the story out to all its readers , points out that a bookseller that supports free speech and has no policy on employee blogs cannot be seen to have reacted rationally by firing a blogger , then closes its article by extracting every less - than - flattering comment that Joe made about Waterstones and spreading it to a Waterstones - visiting readership much bigger than Joe 's blog ever reached before , while the Scotsman -- http://news.scotsman.com/scotland.cfm?id=33932005

I do n't have anything to add to it , other than Jim is , as always , a gentleman , and that I 'm very much looking forward to reading the conclusion of Omaha .
I do n't know how many people realize how remarkable this algorithm is .
Perhaps the person who realized it better than anyone is Anatol Holt , a former colleague at Massachusetts Computer Associates .
When I showed him the algorithm and its proof and pointed out its amazing property , he was shocked .
He refused to believe it could be true .
He could find nothing wrong with my proof , but he was certain there must be a flaw .
He left that night determined to find it .
I do n't know when he finally reconciled himself to the algorithm 's correctness .
...
What is significant about the bakery algorithm is that it implements mutual exclusion without relying on any lower - level mutual exclusion .
Assuming that reads and writes of a memory location are atomic actions , as previous mutual exclusion algorithms had done , is tantamount to assuming mutually exclusive access to the location .
So a mutual exclusion algorithm that assumes atomics reads and writes is assuming lower - level mutual exclusion .
Such an algorithm cannot really be said to solve the mutual exclusion problem .
Before the bakery algorithm , people believed that the mutual exclusion problem was unsolvable -- that you could implement mutual exclusion only by using lower - level mutual exclusion .
Brinch Hansen said exactly this in a 1972 paper .
Many people apparently still believe it .
...
For a couple of years after my discovery of the bakery algorithm , everything I learned about concurrency came from studying it .
...
The bakery algorithm marked the beginning of my study of distributed algorithms .

" It was inevitable , " That 's P.W. Singer 's reaction to the Iraqi government
" banning "
military contractor Blackwater from the country .
For years , no one has followed the rise of these privatized soldiers more closely than Singer , a
Brookings Institution Senior Fellow and author of the ground - breaking Corporate
Warriors .
Companies like Blackwater have been roaming Iraq without oversight or management for years .
Of course the Iraqi government was going to lose patience .*
Here is Singer ’s take :*
Details are still fuzzy on the incident that led the Iraqi government to act against
Blackwater .
But it may be almost irrelevant to the results .
Initial reports from the U.S .
embassy are that a Blackwater USA convoy that was guarding State Department employees came under fire in the Mansour district in Baghdad .
A vehicle was disabled and a lengthy gun battle broke out .
Witnesses are reporting that it lasted at least 20 minutes .
The Iraqi Interior Ministry is reporting that 8 Iraqi civilians were killed and 13 wounded in the crossfire .
There will likely be lots of claims back and forth about whether the shootings were justified or not , whether who was killed were primarily insurgents or civilians , etc. and likely everyone will have their own spin .
It will be interesting to see whether any video finds its way out .
The only thing we do know is that the Iraqi Government is not happy at all , with the Iraqi Prime
Minister ( who is Shia , so not pre-disposed to cover up for a Sunni attack ) blaming the killings on the company 's employees and describing it as a " crime . "
The Iraqi
Interior Ministry says it is pulling the license of the company to operate in Iraq and will try to prosecute any foreign contractors found to have used excessive force in the Sunday shooting .
Still , even before all the details come to light , a few things are clear :
1 ) It was inevitable .
Private military contractors have been involved in all sorts of questionable incidents , since the very start of the Iraq enterprise .
U.S .
military officers frequently expressed their frustrations with sharing the battlefield with such private forces operating under their own rules and agendas , and worry about the consequences for their own operations .
For example , Brigadier General Karl Horst , deputy commander of the US 3^rd ^ Infantry
Division ( responsible for Baghdad area ) tellingly put it two years back ,
These guys run loose in this country and do stupid stuff .
There ’s no authority over them , so you ca n’t come down on them hard when they escalate force .
They shoot people , and someone else has to deal with the aftermath . ”
No one has kept an exact count of the incidents , but some notable examples include :
The Aegis “ trophy video , ” in which contractors took video of themselves shooting at civilians , set it to the Elvis song " Runaway Train , " and put it on the Internet .
The alleged joyride shootings of Iraqi civilians by a Triple Canopy supervisor .
They became the subject of a lawsuit after two employees , who claim to have witnessed the shootings , lost their jobs .
Armed contractors from the Zapata firm detained by U.S. forces , who allegedly saw the private soldiers indiscriminately firing not only at Iraqi civilians , but also at U.S. Marines .
Again , they were not charged , as the legal issues could not be squared .
Private military firms may be part of the military operation , but they and their employees are not part of the military , or its chain of command or its code of justice .
Abu Ghraib , where reportedly 100 percent of the translators and up to 50 percent of the interrogators at the prison were private contractors from the Titan and CACI firms , respectively .
The U.S. Army found that contractors were involved in 36 % of the proven abuse incidents and identified six particular employees as being culpable in the abuses .
While the enlisted U.S. Army soldiers involved in the Abu Ghraib abuse were court - martialed for their crimes , not a single private contractor named in the Army 's investigation report has been charged , prosecuted or punished .
The Army believes it lacks the jurisdiction to pursue these cases , even if it wants to .
The inevitable part was not just the shootings , but the government 's reaction , which has been on the horizon for a while .
The Iraqi government is supposedly a sovereign state , so it is not surprising that at some point it would start to act like one , trying to enforce its monopoly over violence against other armed organizations on the ground .
2 ) * Pay attention to the politics .
* 2 ) The underlying politics to this are important to understand .
Private contractors are a visible and especially disliked part of the US presence in Iraq .
So a good way for Iraqi government officials , who are often depicted as stooges of the US , to try to burnish their nationalist credentials is to go after the contractors .
They can make it look like they are standing up to the big bad outsiders , but not do so against U.S. troops .
As AFP noted , “ Monday 's action against
Blackwater was likely to give the unpopular government a boost , given the contractors ' widespread unpopularity . ”
3 )
That it was Blackwater is unsurprising .
As illustrated by the examples listed above , Blackwater is not the only company working in
Iraq .
Indeed , the L.A. Times recently reported that there may be over 160,000 private contractors working in Iraq , as many as the overall number of US forces even after the “ surge . ”
However , Blackwater has been one of the most visible – unusual for an industry that typically tries to avoid the limelight .
This notoriety makes Blackwater a fatter target than , say , an unknown British or Bulgarian company .
The relationship between the Iraqi government and Blackwater is particularly tense – and not just because armed
Blackwater guards are the contractors that senior Iraqi government officials run into the most .
On
Christmas Eve 2006 , a Blackwater employee allegedly got drunk while inside the Green Zone in Baghdad and got in an argument with a guard of the Iraqi Vice President .
He then shot the Iraqi dead .
The employee was quickly flown out of the country .
Nine months later , he has not been charged with any crime .
Imagine the same thing happening in the U.S. :
An Iraqi embassy guard , drunk at a a
Christmas party , shooting a Secret Service agent guarding Vice
President Cheney .
You can see some potential for underlying tension there .
In May 2007 , there was another reported shooting of an Interior Ministry driver by Blackwater employees .
That led to an armed standoff and had Matthew Degn , a senior American civilian adviser to the Interior Ministry 's intelligence directorate , describing the ministry as " a powder keg " of anger at the firm .
4 )
* This is what happens when government fails to act .
* The problems with the absence of oversight , management , doctrine , and even law and order when it comes to private military contractors have been known for a while .
Heck , I wrote a book about it back in 2003 , before the Iraq invasion .
While the industry has boomed , the vacuum of policy and strategy has continued for years .
In June 2006 , for example , the Government Accountability Office reported that “ private security providers continue to enter the battle space without coordinating with the U.S. military , putting both the military and security providers at a greater risk for injury . ”
U.S. officers in the field are also complaining about the underlying harm created by this lack of policy .
For example , Col. Peter Mansoor is one of the most influential military thinkers on counterinsurgency – currently serving as Gen. David Petraeus ' executive officer .
In 2007 , he told Jane 's Defense Weekly that the U.S. military needs to take " a real hard look at security contractors on future battlefields and figure out a way to get a handle on them so that they can be better integrated – if we 're going to allow them to be used in the first place .
If they push traffic off the roads or if they shoot up a car that looks suspicious , whatever it may be , they may be operating within their contract ( but ) to the detriment of the mission , which is to bring the people over to your side .
I would much rather see basically all armed entities in a counter - insurgency operation fall under a military chain of command . "
Yet , nothing much has happened .
Indeed , the only real action was limited efforts in the Congress .
In Fall 2006 , Senator Lindsay Graham slipped into the 2007 Defense Bill a clause that could potentially place contractors and others who accompany American troops in the field under the U.S. military ’s Uniform Code of Military Justice
( UCMJ ) .
That is , he changed the law defining UCMJ to cover civilians
\– not just in times of declared war , but also during contingency operations .
Almost 10 months later , however , no Pentagon guidance has been issued on how this clause might be used by JAGs in the field .
So , its impact so far has been like a tree falling in the forest , with no one around .
More broadly , there have been several recent efforts at bringing some transparency and oversight to the U.S. side of the industry .
Key players have been Representatives Jan Schakowsky and David Price , and
Senator Barack Obama .
( His bill , the " Transparency and
Accountability in Military and Security Contracting Act of 2007 , ”
essentially brings together the reforms sought by Schakowsky and
Price on the House side . )
These have not yet passed into law , but may during the upcoming debates .
Whether the executive branch will use them , though , returns us back to the problem of inaction on Graham ’s bill .
The point is that the U.S. government has paid for the industry for years , but had tried to ignore the accompanying responsibility for the consequences .
In lieu of our own inaction , the Iraqi government has stepped in , perhaps in a way that we may not be happy with .
Of course , there is an underlying irony .
There are reports that the
“ license ” that the Iraqi government is supposedly revoking does n’t exist .
The Iraqi Interior Ministry is the entity that every contractor is supposed to register with , but it is also the organization that the recent panel led by retired General
James Jones described as " dysfunctional " and " a ministry in name only . "
So many companies have been unable to register , and many contractors have even had to resort to using their business cards as if they were official IDs .
It will be interesting to see if this included the very company hired to guard senior U.S. leaders in Iraq .
5 )
Over outsource and you paint yourself into a corner .
This is what happens when you hollow out your operations .
Blackwater has a contract to guard State Department employees .
Now , the question must be asked :
If the company cannot do so , what happens next ?
Tongue in cheek , one could say that we all learned last week that : ( a ) the U.S .
has enough extra military forces in Iraq and ( b ) the security situation is getting better .
So , if this is true , then what ’s all the fuss ?
Of course , we all know that the whole Kabuki play last week in Congress was false and that the security situation is atrocious and that State personnel still need to be guarded .
Back in the day , all of these roles would have been filled either by military forces or State
Department diplomatic security .
But our military forces are stretched thin , and the government ’s diplomatic security force has been hollowed out at the same time that the need for it has expanded .
( And just for the record : A consortium of companies , led by Blackwater , got a $ 1 billion contract to do the global State Department diplomatic security job last year .
So it was n't exactly a lack of money that caused the hollowing . )
So , in the short term following such a market failure , we have three likely choices : 1 ) ignore the Iraqis ' wishes and just keeping on using Blackwater contractors as before ; 2 ) find another company to step in and quick - fill take on these roles in lieu of the firm ; or 3 ) negotiate with the Iraqis to find terms under which the firm might continue to carry out the operation ( such as promising a joint investigation , payments to civilians , etc. ) .
Obviously , none of these is a great solution in the short term .
None solve the long - term problems .
But those are the terrible cards we have in our hands right now .
Again , we can't blame anyone else .
When it comes to military outsourcing :
We dealt these cards to ourselves .
As we now see in Iraq and elsewhere , the privatized military industry is a reality of the 21st century .
This entrance of the profit motive onto the battlefield opens up vast , new possibilities , but also a series of troubling questions – for democracy , for ethics , for management , for law , for human rights , and for national and international security .
At what point do we begin answering them ?

The campus
In the 1960s students would regularly go on exchange programmes to top British universities .
A degree from a Nigerian university was highly regarded .
“ All this has changed , ” said one professor at the University of Abuja .
“ The students are bright , but the system lets them down , ” said the veteran scientist , who did not want to be named .
A recent market share study concluded that Ask commanded just 4.5 percent of the search audience , while Google rang in at 58.5 percent .
Yahoo and Microsoft rank second and third , but the possible merger of those two companies would certainly present Google with a more formidable foe .
Now , instead of trying to become the all - purpose search site of choice , Ask is going to focus on women .
Specifically , married women in the South and Midwest .
The site will key on helping that audience find details about subjects such as recipes , hobbies and health .

[ UPDATE : This post caused some big debate over at TechCrunch .
I respond here with the blog post titled “ can you work at a startup and have a life ? ” I updated # 11 to make my point a little less harsh , more true to my true feelings ]
The HowTo team at Mahalo has been an amazing surprise effort .
We did n’t plan on making howto articles , but when we built various how to search pages we realized that many howto articles were , well , lacking .
So , we started building select ones where we thought we could help .
This one on how to save money is very good .
I ’ve got a bunch of tips on how to do this for business .
Among them :
Buy Macintosh computers , save money on an IT department Buy second monitors for everyone , they will save at least 30 minutes a day , which is 100 hours a year … which is at least $ 2,000 a year ….
which is $ 6,000 over three years .
A second monitor cost $ 300 - 500 depending on which one you get .
That means you ’re getting 10 - 20 x return on your investment … and you ’ve got a happy team member .
Buy everyone lunch four days a week and establish a no-meetings policy .
Going out for food or ording in takes at least 20 - 60 minutes more than walking up to the buffet and eating .
If you do meetings over lunch you also save that time .
So , 30 minutes a day across say four days a week is two hours a week … which is 100 hours a year .
You get the idea .
Buy cheap tables and expensive chairs .
Tables are a complete rip off .
We buy stainless steel restaurant tables that are $ 100 and $ 600 Areon chairs .
Total cost per workstation ?
$ 700 .
Compare that to buying a $ 500 - $ 1,500 cube / designer workstation .
The chair is the only thing that matters … invest in it .
Do n’t buy a phone system .
No one will use it .
No one at Mahalo has a desk phone except the admin folks .
Everyone else is on IRC , chat , and their cell phone .
Everyone has a cell phone , folks would rather get calls on it , and 99 % of communication is NOT on the phone .
Savings ?
At least $ 500 a year per person … 50 people over three years ?
$ 75 -100 k
Rent out your extra space .
Many folks have extra space in their office .
If you rent 5 - 10 desks for $ 500 each you can cut your burn $ 2,500 to $ 5,000 a month , or $ 30 - 60,000 a year .
That ’s big money .
Outsource accounting and HR — such a no brainer .
Do n’t buy everyone Microsoft Office–it ’s too much money .
Put Office on three or four common computers and use Google Docs .
Use Google hosted email .
$ 50 or free per user ….
how can you beat that ?!?!
Why screw with an exchange server !?!?
Buy your hardest working folks computers for home .
If you have folks who are willing to work an extra hour a day a week you should get them a computer for home .
Once you get to three hours of work a week from home you ’re at 150 hours a year and that ’s a no brainer .
Invest in equipment * if * the person is a workaholic .
Fire people who are not workaholics .
do n’t love their work … come on folks , this is startup life , it ’s not a game .
do n’t work at a startup if you ’re not into it –go work at the post office or stabucks if you ’re not into it you want balance in your life .
For realz .
Get an expensive , automatic espresso machine at the office .
Going to starbucks twice a day cost $ 4 each time , but more importantly it costs 20 minutes .
Buy a $ 3-5,000 Jura industrial , get the good beans , and supply the coffee room with soy , low fat , etc. 50 people making one trip a day is 20 hours of wasted time for the company , and $ 150 in coffee costs for the employees .
Makes no sense .
Stock the fridge with sodas — same drill as above .
Allow folks to work off hours .
Commuting sucks and is a waste of time for everyone .
Let folks start at 6 am or 11 am and you ’ll cut their commute in half ( at least in LA ) .
Go to each of your vendors every 6 - 9 months and ask for 10 - 30 % off .
If half of them say yes you ’ll save 5 - 15 % on fixed costs .
People will give you a discount if they think they are going to lose the business .
Do n’t waste money on recruiters .
Get inside of linkedin and Facebook and start looking for people–it works better anyway .
Really think about if you need that $ 15,000 a month PR firm .
Perhaps you can get a PR consultant to work on 2 - 3 projects a year for $ 10 - 15 k each and save 75 % .
More PR firms are wasted half the year while you build up your product anyway .
{I ’m going to add a couple more of mine as I remember them } Outsource to middle America :
There are tons of brilliant people living between San Francisco , Los Angeles , and New York who do n’t live in a $ 4,000 one bedroom apartment and pay $ 8 to dry clean a shirt–hire them !
Anyone else have startup money saving tips ?
I will post them below as they come in …
Peter Rojas of RCRDLBL :
You probably do n’t need to rent an office , at least not at first .
It ’s really easy to collaborate online , and unless you have a really compelling reason for everyone being in the same place at the same time , you should save your money for as long as you can get away with it .
Plus it ’ll force you to hire people who do n’t need to be micromanaged .
Pat Phelan gives a ton of advice including : a )
No company cars , b ) put your HQ in the burbs to save 50 % on rent , c ) Blog instead of hiring a PR firm , d ) let one person book flights since it ’s an art , e ) keep conference calls to a minimum ( amen to that ! ) .
AMSTERDAM ( AP )  Royal Dutch Shell , Europe ’s largest oil company , reported Thursday that fourth - quarter profit rose 60 percent because of the sale of some assets and higher oil prices .
Net income was $ 8.47 billion , up from $ 5.28 billion in the period a year ago .
Sales rose to $ 107 billion from $ 75.5 billion despite a fall in oil production .
For the year , profit was a record $ 31.3 billion , while sales rose 12 percent , to $ 356 billion .
Despite the record earnings , which prompted calls for a windfall tax , Shell ’s fourth - quarter numbers “ did miss analysts expectations by a whisker , ” Richard Hunter , an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown Stockbrokers , said in a research note .
Mr. Hunter said that in addition , Shell ’s refusal to disclose its proven reserves  a sensitive topic since the company was forced to restate them downward in a 2004 accounting scandal  was weighing on shares .
A self - defense instructor in Forest Lake , Minnesota has been charged with having sex with a 15 - year - old female student .
Ladislao Enriquez , 48 , faces one count each of first - degree and third - degree criminal sexual conduct .
According to the charges , the girl told police she took the class because she was sexually assaulted more than two years earlier .
A Yakima karate instructor has been accused of having sex with two underage girls .
Yakima Police say 44 - year - old Paul Daniel Barr was charged last week with four counts of third - degree child rape for molesting and raping a 13 - year - old girl after he met her while teaching at the Yakima School of Karate .
On Friday , Yakima Police questioned Barr about his relationship with another girl , who says she had sex with him when she was 14 - years old .
Barr has been charged with second - degree rape and sexual exploitation of a minor in the second case .
On June 14 , four African - American women — Venice Brown ( 19 ) , Terrain Dandridge ( 20 ) , Patreese Johnson ( 20 ) and Renata Hill ( 24 ) — received sentences ranging from three - and - a - half to 11 years in prison .
None of them had previous criminal records .
Two of them are parents of small children .
Their crime ?
Defending themselves from a physical attack by a man who held them down and choked them , ripped hair from their scalps , spat on them , and threatened to sexually assault them
… As they passed the Independent Film Cinema , 29 - year - old Dwayne Buckle , an African - American vendor selling DVDs , sexually propositioned one of the women .
They rebuffed his advances and kept walking .
" I 'll f— you straight , sweetheart ! "
Buckle shouted .
A video camera from a nearby store shows the women walking away .
He followed them , all the while hurling anti-lesbian slurs , grabbing his genitals and making explicitly obscene remarks .
The women finally stopped and confronted him .
A heated argument ensued .
Buckle spat in the face of one of the women and threw his lit cigarette at them , escalating the verbal attack into a physical one .
Buckle is seen on the video grabbing and pulling out large patches of hair from one of the young women .
When Buckle ended up on top of one of the women , choking her , Johnson pulled a small steak knife out of her purse .
She aimed for his arm to stop him from killing her friend .
The video captures two men finally running over to help the women and beating Buckle .
At some point he was stabbed in the abdomen .
The women were already walking away across the street by the time the police arrived .
Buckle was hospitalized for five days after surgery for a lacerated liver and stomach .
When asked at the hospital , he responded at least twice that men had attacked him .
There was no evidence that Johnson 's kitchen knife was the weapon that penetrated his abdomen , nor was there any blood visible on it .
In fact , there was never any forensics testing done on her knife .
On the night they were arrested , the police told the women that there would be a search by the New York Police Department for the two men — which to date has not happened .
After almost a year of trial , four of the seven were convicted in April .
Johnson was sentenced to 11 years on June 14 .
It 's a common technique of whiny dipshits who are usually complaining about uppity women when they 're not complaining aout how women just need to pull themselves up by their bootstraps and fight rape : get a gun .
To that , I offer this response : men whining about how you can't trust women because they 'll actually defend themselves !
With slaps !
Oh , God , the horror !
The sheer horror of it all !
Pay special attention , in the second link , to the guy who says : " Nice poster .
Next time a woman annoys me , I 'll smack her .
Hard .
Great message .
I do n't see what 's to like . "
Remember , this is giving men what they claim they think is a great idea : women defending themselves .
* * * Increasingly , martial arts classes are being marketed to young women and the parents of young girls as " self - defense , " in which is implicit an unspoken narrative about the prevention of sexual assault .
( They are also being sought after in the same way ; see another comment from An Angry Old Broad , in the same thread .)
The brutal irony is that , as ever , sexual predators endeavor to infiltrate programs where they will be given a trusted position and unsupervised contact with a steady stream of victims .
And so we end up with stories like this ( via Marcella ) :
And this ( note that " having sex " is yet again used as a euphemism for rape ) : Those are just the stories I saw last week .
I am not citing them to try to discourage parents from enrolling daughters in self - defense or martial arts classes , but because they expose the inevitable problem with treating self - defense as the end - all - be - all of rape prevention .
There have been fathers in various rape threads at Shakes who have pointedly said that they 're taking their daughters to learn a martial art " so they wo n't ever have to worry about rape , " men who absolutely refused to engage the point of this post , which is that such classes are not a panacea for the rape culture , which is vast and varied and — yes — capable of saturating even martial arts classes .
These stories underline why challenging and undermining the rape culture within your own community — including by insisting that criminal background checks and multiple - adult supervision are required by any instructor of children 's extracurriculars — is at least as important as self - defense training ( and probably more so ) .
Given the plethora of posts to be found at Shakesville on date rape quality of assent , and enthusiastic consent , certainly most readers are already well aware that rape is n't just something that happens to conscious women , but to women who are inebriated , incapacitated , in comas , and in every other varied state of unconsciousness .
And , lest this disintegrate into yet another round of victim - blaming by people who can't seem to wrap their heads around the idea that tasking victims with being the gatekeepers of rape and sexual abuse , rather than the perpetrators , is predicated upon the fallacious assumption that any man is capable of such ugliness given the right circumstances — which is nasty , man-hating bullshit — there 's absolutely no need whatsoever to point out that women need to be more responsible so they do n't end up unconscious in the presence of a rapist .
For a start , it ignores the women who end up unconscious against their wills , by virtue of injury , disease , date rape drugs , or merely being inexperienced drinkers .
Secondly , even if we 're talking about the supposedly legions of women who deliberately choose to throw caution to the wind and purposefully drink themselves into oblivion in the presence of strangers , only in some parallel dimension where that equals consent does this discussion even matter .
The point is this :
If a woman becomes incapacitated for any reason in the presence of a rapist , all the self - defense techniques in the world will not save her .
Even among women who are conscious , who do / can fight back , and have had self - defense training , its efficacy is not 100 % .
Depending on the source , anywhere from about 15 to > 50 % of women who are trained in self - defense techniques are still raped when in a situation where rape appears imminent .
( Naturally , it 's impossible to know whether a woman not trained in self - defense who managed to get off a swift kick to the googlies would have achieved the same result . )
The upside , however — and it's not a small one — is that women who are trained in self - defense and can / do fight back , but are still raped , are nonetheless more likely to feel less responsible , more angry , and more determined to pursue every legal avenue available .
This is where the vastly different cultural standards by which men and women are judged begin to rear their ugly heads .
Although MRA s would have us believe that women can kill a man in cold blood and use " he looked at me cross - eyed " as a defense to get off scot - free , reality is ever - so - slightly different , especially for women of color .
Even in cases of self - defense against an abusive male partner / spouse — in which upwards of 80 % of cases have previous calls to police , and violence is usually a last resort ( we 'll come back to that , btw ) — battered women who use violent means to defend themselves are being convicted or are accepting pleas at a rate of 75 - 83 % nationwide .
When women use self - defense measures against strangers , their odds of getting the A - OK on that decision is not any better .
Take , for example , the case of the Jersey 4
Why did these women , like many others , fare so poorly in what was clearly a case of self - defense ?
Well , it might have a little something to do with the cognitive dissonance between what we say we want women to do to take care of themselves , and what we actually want women to do to take care of themselves .
To wit : About a year ago , Jessica posted a picture of a German warning sign noting that men who harass and / or grope women risk a slap in the face — and that people who see men harassing women ( along with disproportionately targeted " migrants , homeless people , transgender people , gays " ) should get involved to stop it .
Go on and just guess what the comments were .
If you guessed " totally missing the point about men doing something to warrant getting slapped , in order to shame teh ladiez for celebrating violence against men , " give yourself 1,000 points .
As Ginmar noted in regard to this post ( emphasis mine ) : Exactly right .
Ginmar also pinpoints another problem with exhortations to women to utilize self - defense methods , and why we should be suspicious of them , noting that there are men who " make suggestions about womens ' self defense that they know are useless and hopeless , safe in the knowledge that women will always be resented for any act of self defense . "
Admonishing women to learn self - defense in a culture where a cheeky sign about women slapping harassers is greeted with outraged fury and charges of misandry is misguided at best and willfully disingenuous at worst .
The whole idea that a woman can use self - defense to deter a man she presumes is intent on raping her is predicated on ( as all rape scenarios are ) a very specific set of circumstances — that she is capable of fighting back , that she successfully does fight back , and that she hurts the potential rapist only enough to get away , but not so much that he ends up in the hospital ( or morgue ) , lest she face charges , and that all of this happens in front of witnesses who will corroborate her story , just in case .
And even then , as the Jersey 4 case illustrates , that still does n't mean she wo n't be convicted .
Suddenly self - defense does n't seem like quite the cure - all it is repeatedly suggested to be .
And that brings me to : Remember when I mentioned we'd come back to that whole violence - as - a - last - resort thing ?
Okay , here we are .
There are a couple of reasons that most victims of sustained abuse do n't haul off and physically self - defend right from the get - go — including a general instinctual reluctance to hurt people we know ( even if they 're hurting us ) and the very rational and reasonable calculation that retribution for self - defense may be intolerable , possibly life - threatening .
Remember , women are three times more likely to be raped by someone they know than a stranger , and nine times more likely to be raped in their home , the home of someone they know , or anywhere else than being raped on the street , making what we commonly refer to as " date rape " by far the most prevalent " type " of rape .
It 's one thing to talk about using self - defense when you 're picturing the typically ( if erroneously ) conjured rape scenario — a psychopathic stranger jumping out of the bushes and trying to rape you .
It 's quite another proposition altogether to think about trying to incapacitate your date , your boyfriend , your husband , your boss , your friend — someone you trust .
I 'm not saying there are n't women who can and would do it ; there certainly are .
But it 's not as easy .
The incidents of well - trained and even armed military women , policewomen , self - defense instructors , etc. being raped by someone they know speaks to that difficulty .
Women ( and men ) who should be able to , and are able to , overcome their attackers do n't / ca n't always do so .
That 's not meant to impugn women .
It 's a statement on the disposition of humans .
As I said above , the rape culture , with all its manifestations and narratives and accoutrements , is vast and varied , necessarily making rape prevention more complex than any one solution .
There 's no silver bullet .
By all means , support women learning self - defense .
Just do n't let your thoughts about rape prevention end there .

Prince Andrew said the US could learn a lot from Britain
Prince Andrew said the war had led to a " healthy scepticism " in Britain towards what was said in Washington .
The duke made the comments in an interview with the International Herald Tribune ahead of a 10 - day trip to promote British business in the US .
He said the US should have learned lessons from British colonial history .
The duke , who is fourth in line to the throne , told the newspaper there was feeling in Britain of " why did n't anyone listen to what was said and the advice that was given ? " .
The fact is there is quite a lot of experience over here which is valid and should be listened to
The Duke of York
BBC royal correspondant Peter Hunt said it was unusual for a senior royal to so freely enter the diplomatic and political arena .
He said that while the wisdom of the prince 's move may be questioned by some , his officials characterised the comments as a " thoughtful appraisal " of the situation which he stood by .
The prince emphasised the importance of British - American relations , but said there had been " occasions when people in the UK would wish that those in responsible positions in the US might listen and learn from our experiences " .
" If you are looking at colonialism , if you are looking at operations on an international scale , if you are looking at understanding each other 's culture , understanding how to operate in a military insurgency campaign - we have been through them all , " he said .
" We 've won some , lost some , drawn some .
The fact is there is quite a lot of experience over here which is valid and should be listened to . "
During the interview , the prince also said the 1982 Falklands War changed him " out of all recognition " and left him with a " different view of life " .
Moreover , it 's flame retardant and conducts electricity , which would make it useful in tiny electronic devices .
Ironically , the problem with most carbon nanotubes is that they 're too small , or rather , too short -- on the order of tens of microns long .
Short nanotubes are difficult to incorporate into existing manufacturing processes and lack the high performance properties of long carbon nanotubes .
They also tend to be delivered in powder form ( think of graphite pencils ) .
By contrast , Nanocomp 's tubes stretch a few millimeters and the sheets are specially treated to keep them from shedding black specks of carbon .

The Ripple - 15 faucet is so dang cool , every house should have one .
But with such a hypnotic addition I fear we'd all waste a lot of precious water that way due to excessive overuse .
Consisting of a simple rippled circle display and an electromagnetically attracted metal ball , you can change the temperature of the water by simply placing the metal ball either along the hot or cold side of the plate .
Electromagnetic sensors housed beneath the plate adjust the temperature according to the ball 's placement , and LEDs light up in red , blue or neutral to visually cue you in as well .
A flash heater regulates the water and heats or cools it accordingly , while two separate channels direct the hot or cold water flows .
Moving the ball to the outer concentric rings increases the water flow , while placing it in the center turns the faucet off .
Ripple - 15 is the fifteenth version of an initial concept , and with it designer Smith Newman appears to have perfected his craft .
Only thing I 'd be worried about is that little metal ball meeting a cruel fate in the depths of the drain , or in some little person 's stomach .
Oh , who am I fooling ?
I still want it .

The director of the U.S. Navy staff has been fired for providing " false and misleading information " during an investigation into claims that he had an " inappropriate relationship " while serving at the White House in 1990 .
The navy 's top spokesman Admiral Frank Thorp has confirmed that Vice Adm .
John " Boomer " Stufflebeem was relieved by Chief of Naval Operations Gary Roughead , the Military Times reported Tuesday .
Chief of Naval Personnel John Harvey has succeeded Stufflebeem .
The investigation began after officials received an anonymous letter accusing Stufflebeem of having an inappropriate relationship while serving as former President George H. W. Bush 's military aide in 1990 .
The navy stressed that Stufflebeem was relieved due to the misleading testimony , not because of the allegations in the letter , while the findings of the investigation are still under review .
Stufflebeem 's rank has reverted to rear admiral , which is typically done when an officer is not serving in a three - star billet .
Stufflebeem , a career naval aviator , rose to prominence in the opening days of the Afghanistan war in 2001 , frequently briefing reporters as the deputy director for global operations on the Joint Staff .

I ’d assume there ’s going to be some changes , ” said Arenado , who played with the aching shoulder most of the season .
This season was a learning experience , that I need to get better and need to grow as a player .
The Rockies batted a collective .
But in 2002 , the journal Pediatrics reported that preschool children with bedroom TVs were more likely to be overweight .
In October , the journal Obesity suggested that the risk might be highest for boys .
In a study among French adolescents , boys with a bedroom television were more likely than their peers to have a larger waist size and higher body fat and body mass index .
The French study also showed , not surprisingly , that boys and girls with bedroom TVs spent less time reading than others .
Other data suggest that bedroom television affects a child ’s schoolwork .
In a 2005 study in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine , researchers looked at the television , computer and video game habits of almost 400 children in six Northern California schools for a year .
About 70 percent of the children in the study had their own TV in the bedroom ; they scored significantly and consistently lower on math , reading and language - arts tests .
Students who said they had computers in their homes scored higher .
Why a bedroom television appears to have such a pronounced impact is unclear .
It may be that it ’s a distraction during homework time or that it interferes with sleep , resulting in poorer performance at school .
It could also suggest less overall parental involvement .
Another October study , published in Pediatrics , showed that kindergartners with bedroom TVs had more sleep problems .
Those kids were also less “ emotionally reactive , ” meaning that they were n’t as moody or as bothered by changes in routine .
While that sounds like a good thing , the researchers speculated that having a TV in the bedroom dampened the intensity with which a child responded to stimulation .
Another study of more than 700 middle - school students , ages 12 to 14 , found that those with bedroom TVs were twice as likely to start smoking  even after controlling for such risk factors as having a parent or friend who smokes or low parental engagement .
Among kids who had a TV in the bedroom 42 percent smoked ; among the others , the figure was 16 percent .
“ I think it matters quite a lot , ” Dr. Epstein said .
“ There are all kinds of problems that occur when kids have TVs in their bedroom . ”
So while many parents try to limit how much television and what type of shows their children watch , that may be less than half the battle .
Where a child watches is important too .
This plot depicts a refined course for the asteroid 2007 WD5 as it approaches a possible impact with the planet Mars .
This story was updated at 7:01 p.m. EST .
Thepossibility of an asteroid walloping the planet Mars this month is whetting theappetites of Earth - bound scientists , even as they further refine the spacerock 's trajectory .
The spacerock in question — Asteroid2007 WD5 — is similar in size to the object that carved MeteorCrater into northern Arizona some 50,000 years ago and is approaching Marsat about 30,000 miles per hour ( 48,280 kph ) .
Whether theasteroid will actually hit Mars or not is still uncertain .
Such animpact , researchers said , would prove an awesome opportunity for planetary sciencesince NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter ( MRO ) and a flotilla of otherspacecraft are already in position to follow up any impact from orbit .

An impactthat we could witness / follow - up with MRO would be truly spectacular , and couldtell us much about the hidden subsurface that could help direct a search forlife or life - related molecules , ? said John Rummel , NASA 's senior scientist forastrobiology at the agency 's Washington , D.C. , headquarters .
Observationsof the asteroid between Dec. 29 and Jan. 2 allowed astronomers to slightlylower the space rock 's odds of striking Mars to about 3.6 percent ( down from3.9 ) , giving the object a 1 in 28 chance of hitting the planet , according to Tuesdayreport from NASA 's Near Earth - Object program office at the Jet PropulsionLaboratory in Pasadena , Calif .
Moreobservations may further reduce the asteroid 's impact chances to nil , NEOofficials said .
The space rock 's refined course stems from observations byastronomers at New Mexico Tech 's Magdalena Ridge Observatory .
But if WD5 does smack into Mars , some astronomers have a fair idea of what havoc it mayspawn .
The likely strike zone would be near the equator , but to the north ofthe current position of NASA 's Opportunity rover at Victoria Crater , NASA officialshave said .
MarkBoslough , a collision dynamics expert at New Mexico's Sandia NationalLaboratory , said the atmosphere at Mars ' surface is similar to that of Earth atan altitude of 12 miles ( 20 km ) .
Some space rocks that target Earth explodeunder the pressure created as they stream into our atmosphere .
But they tendnot to explode until much below the 12 - mile mark .
" Sothis wo n't be an airburst , " Boslough said .
" It will either hit theground intact and make a single crater , or break up and generate a cluster ofcraters . "
Thecollision , were it to occur , could also create a visible dust plume as ejectais lofted high into the martian atmosphere , he said .
Theresulting crater could reach more than a half - mile ( 0.8 - km ) in diameter , orabout the size of the Opportunity rover 's Victoria home , NASA added .
Boslough 'sbreak - up scenario is reminiscent of CometP / Shoemaker - Levy 9 , which broke into more than 20 fragments as it nearedJupiter in 1994 , then repeatedly pummeled the gas giant over the course of six days .
The resulting impact scars were visible to telescopes on Earth , in orbit and NASA 's Galileo probe , which was en route to Jupiter at the time of the collision .
LikeGalileo at Jupiter , NASA 's MRO probe and its High - Resolution Imaging Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera would be in prime position for a martian collision .
With itsability to resolve objects three feet ( one meter ) across , HiRISE as been billedas the most powerful camera ever sent to study Mars .
? If theasteroid hits Mars , we ?ll get a great look at the crater within a few days ofimpact , ? said HiRISE principal investigator Alfred McEwen of the University ofArizona ?s Lunar and Planetary Laboratory in Tucson .

By now everyone has heard about Barack Obama ’s former pastor Jeremiah Wright and the inflammatory speeches he gave .
But before I go on , stop and ask yourself , what have you actually heard ?
Did you hear the speeches , or did you just hear that the speeches were racist and proclaimed hatred for America ?
Did see the video of the actual speeches or did you hear a bunch of speculation over whether or not Obama has distanced himself enough ?
Did you get to read the full text of the sermons , or did you just see tiny , tiny pieces , quotes taken out of context ?
My undergrad degree was in journalism , and this case is a good example of why I do n’t work in journalism .
Here ’s a great tool to add to your BS - meter : it ’s always very , very suspicious when you hear the same one or two clips played again and again with no context .
Especially if you hear it on TV .
So , how can we determine if this Rev. Wright is really racist , if he really hates America ?
There ’s a story on the Anderson Cooper 360 page that has the text of one of the sermons .
My “ sensationalist BS ” meter picked up on three things :
1 . The “ chickens coming home to roost ” phrase was either a quote or a paraphrase of someone else .
Wright is responsible for putting the statements in his sermons , of course , but normally I like to judge people by their own words .
2 . In retrospect he was largely right .
Some of the points are exaggerated , but most of the people who hate America did n’t wake up one morning and decide to become suicide bombers .
Violence does beget violence , and only rarely solves any problems ( Hiroshima and Nagasaki are arguably counter cases ) .
Perhaps the primary , most disastrous mistake of the past 7 years is that the administration ( and at times half of the American public ) have been unwilling to even consider this .
How can you fight an enemy if you refuse to understand their motivations ?
You do it poorly ( see Iraq ) .
What happens when you blindly apply violence against violence ?
You breed more hate and anger ( see Iraq ) .
3 . One of this main arguments , the argument against violence , is one of the central tenants of Christianity .
Jesus did n’t just say “ do unto others ” as a pleasant aphorism .
In fact , he went further : if your enemy strikes you on the cheek , you do n’t just let it slide , you do n’t just forgive him .
You offer your other cheek .
The Christian response to attacks on two World Trade Towers is to offer up two more .
Wright does n’t even go that far .
The real surprise is not that one preacher gave a sermon saying that we have reaped what we have sown , but that the same sermon was n’t heard in churches all across the country .
But it was n’t .
Instead we had demogogs telling us that “ they hate freedom ” and blaming the existence of gays for calling down god ’s wrath on us .
As for the “ god damn America ” quote , I ’m having a much harder time finding full text .
So I just wo n’t comment until I do .
If you have a link please put it in the comments below .
As for whether or not Obama has properly distanced himself or denounced Wright vociferously enough , I ’m not sure I want to start holding people responsible for what their spiritual advisers say .
The other argument , that this is useful information for people to get to know Obama ’s opinions and beliefs better before deciding to vote for him , would be sound if Obama had n’t already been speaking in public , on the record for years .
If you want to know what eh thinks go get one of his books from the library .
Write has also written some books you can check out if you really care what the candidate ’s pastor had to say .

Here ’s the whole video :

It is the two countries ' second such gas dispute in two years
Mr Putin was speaking after urgent talks with his Ukrainian counterpart Viktor Yushchenko in Moscow .
For his part , Mr Yushchenko said that from Thursday Ukraine would start repaying its debt to Russia 's Gazprom .
Russia earlier threatened to switch off supplies at 1500 GMT if Kiev had not paid its $ 1.5 bn ( £ 770 m ) gas bill .
Ukraine had disputed the bill , saying it was just over $ 1bn .
Warning to Nato
Speaking at a joint news conference , President Putin said Russia 's state - run gas monopoly Gazprom had accepted Ukraine 's proposals at the talks .
" We have heard that the settlement of the debt will begin shortly , " Mr Putin said .
Moscow 's ties with pro-Western Ukrainian PM
Tymoshenko are cool
" A working group should be set up in the next few days to map out direct , transparent relations for the market and [ gas ] deliveries , " he said .
President Yushchenko confirmed that the deal had been reached , saying Ukraine would start paying off its debt on Thursday .
The BBC's Richard Galpin in Moscow says the crux of this latest crisis seems to be over how the bill is to be paid .
Ukraine 's pro-Western Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko wants the money paid directly to Gazprom , rather than going through an intermediary company - RosUkrEnergo - which she views with deep suspicion .
Both leaders described the talks as " constructive and honest " , stressing that Ukraine and Russia would always be strategic partners .
However , President Putin warned that there would be consequences if Ukraine joined the Nato military bloc - a goal publicly stated by Mr Yushchenko .
European anxiety
Before the talks , Gazprom had said the gas row would not affect supplies to the rest of Europe .
But as most of the company 's gas supply to Western Europe passes through Ukraine , concerns remained that the row could escalate into a repeat of the supply interruption that happened two years ago .
In January 2006 , gas shipments to Europe were disrupted after Russia halted fuel supplies to Ukraine for several days amid a fierce argument over price hikes .
Although Gazprom claims the current dispute is purely commercial , fears have been raised that Moscow might be exploiting its energy resources to exert political pressure on its neighbours .
Our correspondent says Moscow does not like President Yushchenko or his prime minister .
Both were leaders of the Orange Revolution three years ago that swept away a pro-Russian government in Ukraine and replaced it with one that looks to the West for support and now wants to join Nato .
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Sea levels are set to fall over millions of years , making the current rise blamed on climate change a brief interruption of an ancient geological trend , scientists said on Thursday .

They said oceans were getting deeper and sea levels had fallen by about 170 meters ( 560 ft ) since the Cretaceous period 80 million years ago when dinosaurs lived .
Previously , the little - understood fall had been estimated at 40 to 250 meters .
“ The ocean floor has got on average older and gone down and so the sea level has also fallen , ” said Bernhard Steinberger at the Geological Survey of Norway , one of five authors of a report in the journal Science .
“ The trend will continue , ” he told Reuters .
A computer model based on improved understanding of shifts of continent - sized tectonic plates in the earth ’s crust projects more deepening of the ocean floor and a further sea level decline of 120 meters in 80 million years ’ time .
If sea levels were to fall that much now , Russia would be connected to Alaska by land over what is now the Bering Strait , Britain would be part of mainland Europe and Australia and Papua island would be the same landmass .
The study aids understanding of sea levels by showing that geology has played a big role alongside ice ages , which can suck vast amounts of water from the oceans onto land .
DOWN NOT UP
“ If we humans still exist in 10 , 20 or 50 million years , irrespective of how ice caps are waxing and waning , the long term ... is that sea level will drop , not rise , ” said lead author Dietmar Muller of the University of Sydney .
Over time , Muller told Science in a podcast interview there would be fewer mid-ocean ridges and a shift to more deep plains in the oceans as continents shifted .
The Atlantic would widen and the Pacific shrink .
Still , the projected rate of fall works out at 0.015 centimeters a century -- irrelevant when the U.N. Climate Panel estimates that seas will rise by 18 - 59 cms by 2100 because of global warming stoked by human use of fossil fuels .
“ Compared to what is expected due to climate change , the fall is negligible , ” said Steinberger .
Cities from Miami to Shanghai are threatened by rising seas that could also swamp low - lying island nations in the Pacific .
Rising temperatures raise sea levels because water in the oceans expands as it warms , and many glaciers are melting into the seas .
Antarctica and Greenland now contain enough ice to raise sea levels by 50 meters if they all melted , the article said .
If all ice on land were gone in 80 million years ’ time , the net drop in ocean levels would be 70 meters rather than the projected 120 .
The study challenges past belief that sea levels might have been only 40 meters higher than today in the Cretaceous period by arguing that measurements from New Jersey in the United States had underestimated the fall .
It said that the New Jersey region had itself subsided by 105 to 180 meters in the period , skewing the readings .

18th , 2008 03:06 pm Do n't Push the River
There is a Buddhist saying : " Do n't Push the River . "
Sometimes , when you are repeatedly frustrated , that is life 's wonderful way of helping you stop pushing the river , to stop trying too hard , to stop fighting the current and instead flow with it .
Ruby has an interactive program called IRB that gets a lot of usage ; for example , Rails uses it as its command - line interface .
One of its features is that after every command , it returns the result of the last evaluated statement .
This is in keeping with Ruby 's return semantics ; if you leave an argument at the end of a function it will be returned automatically .
This is strongly in keeping with Ruby 's functional programming leanings .
The problem with this , however , is that in Ruby , everything returns stuff .
If you print a string with puts , the return code from puts is printed .
( puts always returns nil . )
If you iterate over a collection with each , the collection will be returned .
This has been especially griefsome to me because a lot of the time I use IRB to " pretty print " some collection of data .
Since I 'm an old C programmer who apparently can't change his shorts ( or his longs ) , I do it the way I would do it in C : loop over the collection , printing each element .
>> Airport. find ( : all ) .each do |a| ?> puts " #{a.abbrev} : #{a.name} " >> end DFW : Dallas Fort - Worth ATL : Atlanta Hartsfield - Jackson => [ # < Airport :0x21f131c @attributes= {" name " =>" Dallas Fort - Worth " , " abbrev " = > " DFW " , " id " =>" 1 " } , #< Airport : 0x21f12f4 @attributes= {" name " = > " Atlanta Hartsfield - Jackson " , " abbrev " = > " ATL " , " id " = > " 2 " } ]
You can see the result : the list is printed , and then the collected hash is displayed .
This is tolerable when I 'm printing 2 airports , but when I 'm printing 200 of them , the collection at the end is trash that scrolls off the screen .
Well , I 'm nothing if not a gross hacker , so I have gotten in the habit of adding an extra line of code to the end of the loop : nil .
This causes IRB to evaluate nil as the last expression , and it returns that after the pretty display :
>> Airport.find ( : all ) .each do|a| ?> puts " #{a.abbrev} : #{a.name} " >> end ; nil DFW : Dallas Fort - Worth ATL : Atlanta Hartsfield - Jackson => nil Nice ! ... in a sort of lame , hackish way .
You see , since I read Paul Graham 's post about making new things I have started reconsidering all the little things that hurt in Ruby , with an eye towards writing some cheap , simple fixes .
It should n't be too hard to tweak IRB to stop returning the last expression .
But then I realized that this would change the way IRB works fundamentally .
Sometimes you want this behavior .
In fact , most of the time you do .
Okay , maybe I 'll just make it a mode you can toggle , like expr_on|expr_off .
And then I realized : I am pushing the river here .
I am trying to alter a fundamental Ruby behavior -- functional orientation -- to match my procedural thinking .
How hard would it be to just change my thinking ?
Hmm .
In functional programming , we say what we want rather than how we want to get it .
Okay , so instead of starting with a loop , perhaps I should start with puts .
It just so happens that puts will automatically print a collection one item per line .
So all I need to do is transform my collection of airports into a collection of pretty strings .
For that I 'd want map or collect instead of each :
>> puts Airport.find(:all ) .collect { |a| " #{a.abbrev} : #{a.name} " } DFW : Dallas Fort - Worth ATL : Atlanta Hartsfield - Jackson => nil Nice !
And proper this time .
I went ahead and inlined the block because I was concerned about the result of the transform rather than the side effects of the loop¹ .
I am very pleased about this result : I had a way I wanted to do it , and Ruby was resisting me , and I finally realized that I was in the wrong .
I like Ruby for two reasons .
First , it was the first language I learned in over a decade that actually forced me to learn a new language² .
Second , there are moments , often daily , when I become consciously aware of experiencing pleasure while using the language .
This was an example of both reasons .

I highly recommend the In the long term it is easy to shortchange yourself by learning new syntaxes without ever learning a new language .
In the short term , it makes you highly employable if you can pick up a new language and run with it .

The thing about python is ... that while it 's possible to write while thinking C++ , it 's entirely the wrong way to approach python .
It 's also possible to think Lisp and write python ( you just have to be a bit more explicit than Lisp , ) and be closer to right though still a ways from the right way of coding it .
I think this was a factor in your dismissal of Python , and many times when you posted things in IRC that you had written in python , they seemed entirely wrong and too C ++.
You were working entirely too hard and not looking at what tools were available to you before you reinvented the wheel .
( A disturbing lack of List Comprehensions where they were both easier to read and faster to execute was one thing I remember . )
Personally , your complaint on python being too close to C++ is my same complaint about Ruby .
It 's putting a Perl - esque syntax on top of Lisp , when Common Lisp is a far more elegant language to work with than Perl .
It 's comfort food / trojan horse for those who do n't want to abandon their old syntaxes rather than something revolutionary .
The difference between the python / C++ to Ruby / Lisp comparison is that Python is an actual and real improvement in coding time to C++ and a good prototyping tool ( though perhaps not an improvement over lisp , ) where I 'm not sure Ruby improves Lisp 's already excellent coding speed at all .
( It also does n't really do anything to make Lisp more comprehensible to the general public , only to those from a narrow subset that know the syntaxes that it is using ... )
A trend I 've seen in all the time I 've been programming is the fact that there always seems to be one bandwagon trendy language that large groups are touting as the be - all - end - all .
As far as that goes , I 'm slightly annoyed by those who tout Ruby as a superbly great language for every conceivable problem .
( Example : Ruby on Rails and its using Ruby to do every stage of the process , from database access to logic to presentation . )
Ruby has succeeded C++ , Perl , Java , and Python as the trendy language de jour .
It 's useful in some fields just as Perl in inordinately useful in some tasks , and Java is useful in some tasks and fields still .
None of them will ever be the language to do every task .
It will eventually be supplanted by another trendy language de jour and all the trendy language hoppers will abandon it , leaving a core of people who actually understand it and find it useful in their field .
I do need to get back into Lisp , it has been 5 - 6 years since I used it seriously .
Erlang might be a better path now .

You seem to be arguing that it 's possible to write " C++ in Python " but not in Ruby .
I think your zeal for your new friend Ruby is blinding you a bit here ...
As you demonstrate in this very post , it 's quite possible to write C++ in Ruby .
That kind of code in Python is just as un-idiomatic as non-block - oriented Ruby .

From : chalain Date : February 19th , 2008 05:23 am ( UTC ) Re : Python is not a C language ( Link ) I certainly agree when you write C++ code in language XYZ , you generally end up with lousy XYZ code .
The frequency and spectacularness with which my Ruby code stopped working when I tried to code in C++ , however , was an order of magnitude higher than with other languages .
As far as Python not being a C language ... let 's just agree that you 're wrong .
Oh sure , it 's got continuations and closures and list comprehensions .
But the language works just fine without them .
If you sit down and write straight - up C++ architecture in Python , it will work .
Un-idiomatic ?
Yes .
Wrong and icky ?
Yes .
Absolutely anything in the language itself to suggest that you 're doing it wrong ?
No .
Ruby , on the other hand , does not work just fine without its non-C bits .
When I first got into it , I was furious and considered it a defect that my C - style code broke in weird ways .
And then I realized that I was doing it wrong , and there WAS a right way to do it .
Do n't get me wrong : Python is a wonderful language , and the way I used it was inelegant and brutal .
I 'm not criticizing the language on those terms at all .
But it 's lexically scoped and block oriented , and I shipped close to 100,000 lines of Python code over 3 years with a syntax reference and headful of C++ architecture .
As Kazriko has already pointed out , it was dreadful code .
But neither the language nor the Python community at the time gave me any feedback that suggested there was anything wrong with it .

I 'm not sure what this is supposed to mean , either , since again , Ruby is also block oriented .

How was the community supposed to give you feedback ?
If you post dreadful code to comp.language .
python , for instance , you will certainly get suggestions for improvement .
My experience was that the language itself quickly pushed me towards using it more idiomatically .
Is it not possible that you are simply a more mature programmer today than you were when you were shipping 100 kloc of lousy Python ?

Guilty .
The very phrase " functional language " makes me recoil , through no real fault of the languages ' .
I took a class in about 1993 in which the ( newly - hired ) professor insisted that everything we write be in a language which was so aggressively functional it did n't even support global variables , nor was it object - oriented .
That was such a nightmare , given the kinds of assignments he had us do , that I still balk at the very idea of functional languages , but intellectually I understand their charm .
I 'm not entirely procedural - boy ; I did do a ton of programming in Prolog 20 years ago .
FWIW .

Banning state is something that is a trade off .
Not having state gives you some very interesting options for execution , keeping all of that " state " as parameters and return values that are flying around .
That potentially gives you the ability to really heavily parallelize the whole thing , but also makes coding for it much harder .
You do n't have to synchronize the state between multiple processors , as the only state is stored in these little function calls that are only on one processor at a time .
There 's other benefits and detriments to it as well ...
I 'm sure they discussed those in SICP , even though I have n't watched that yet .
It 'll be more interesting when we have 64 - 256 cores and you 're trying to spread your processing out amongst them .

I 'm excited for the growing trend towards parallelization in software thinking .
A recent project I was on had a lot of " single - minded naivete " in its thinking .
It was obvious that the programmers wrote their code thinking that they were operating in an infinitely long critical section .
IIRC , the SICP lectures get into state about halfway to 3/4 of the way through .
And it really is a beautiful thing when you can eliminate it in a section of code .
For a given series of inputs , the output of the system is a known constant ...
I 'm not sure if I 'm explaining it well .
They give an ATM example , where a user has $ 100 .
She wants to withdraw $ 20 , then deposit $ 50 .
Taken as a series of events , the state of the system is completely constant : $ 100 plus two transactions of - $ 20 and +$ 30 , then $ 80 plus one transaction of +$ 30 , then $ 110 plus no transactions .
All three of those balance + transaction statements were effectively identical .
The state of the account balance is immaterial because after these events it is a constant f( x ) = x+10 .
Suddenly you start seeing your GUI as a constant thing :
This program plus that mouse click equals this program .
It all falls apart , of course , when multiple event streams must be considered , which is where state creeps in :
If another user withdraws $ 90 before the first transaction , the first withdrawal will fail , so now you have an output state dependent on operating conditions .
It all comes apart like a stained - glass window being hit with a rock .
Which was probably Hal 's point in the lecture .
Sometimes we need state .
When we can eliminate it , we can do lots of wonderful things ( reversible computing , anyone ? ) but when you can't , functional programming grinds down a bit .
Sure , you can still create a function for your bank balance .
But in order to remain constant , it must take your bank balance as an input . :-)
For me the current take - home lesson is that it does n't have to be all - or - nothing .
There are places in my programs where I would normally write stateful code , but after looking at it I realize that that one section could be reduced to a function .
The result has been better code almost universally : it certainly is more testable , more decoupled , and more reusable .

You do n't necessarily need to pass the bank balance in to get the bank balance out , but you probably would need to pass in the synchronized way of getting transaction history , such as an external store of state data .
( Perhaps a relational database ... )
For the purposes of parallel programming , that would just be a critical section that would need to be done sequenced with other critical sections accessing the same data .
In the real world , what happens is that both of those withdrawals go into the database , then a program runs at midnight and assesses a $ 39 charge to that account for overdraft . ;)

From : zenspider Date : February 21st , 2008 09:31 am ( UTC ) ( Link ) I agree that the " ; nil " approach is hacky , but IMO switching to the map form is as well ... sometimes it simply does n't translate or is more obtuse to do so .
You can certainly go that route or , you can learn the tools you use to be more effective :
>> IRB.conf [ : MAIN_CONTEXT ].echo = false
>> ( 1..100 ).to_a.map { |n| n * n }
>>
you can wrap that up pretty easy in your ~/.irbrc :
def toggle_output
IRB.conf [: MAIN_CONTEXT ].echo = ! IRB.conf [: MAIN_CONTEXT].echo
end

I hope you enjoy this short video of Shawn Frayne , a young inventor that has created this device to generate , on the micro-scale , energy for LED lights and radios in developing countries .
This is the first approach that uses aeroelastic flutter to create super cheap electricity .
We ’re talking about changing the way wind energy is harvested and captured .
Frayne won a 2007 Breakthrough Award from Popular Mechanics , and he deserves it .
This incredible technology is 10 - 30 times more efficient than the best micro-turbines .
So , Frayne hopes to fund third - world distribution of the Windbelt through sales in first - world applications .
So inspiring …
UPDATE : EcoGeek reports that Shawn Frayne has launched the website for Humdinger Wind Energy .
Soon , according to the website , developer kits are going to be available for schools , researchers , and independents .
Here ’s a different video of Shawn Frayne talking about the Windbelt technology .
Here 's another discovery that once again proves the popular adage that technology is both a boom and a bane .
Security researcher Aaron Weaver has found a way to spam your printer from the Web.
Building on the concept of cross - site scripting , whereby an attacker can inject malicious code in Web pages viewed by others , Weaver has demonstrated how a hacker can inject spam messages into a Web site visitor 's printer .
For a cross -site printing attack to work , a victim would have to visit either a malicious Web site or a legitimate page that suffers from a cross - site scripting flaw , which is a common type of Web programming error .
The hacker would then sendJavaScript code to the browser that would guess the location of the victim 's printer and send it a print job .
The Web site could print annoying ads on the printer and may even issue more dangerous commands , like telling the printer to send a fax , format its hard drive or download new firmware .
The attack is derived from techniques employed in a project called hacking network printers by Adrian " Irongeek " Crenshaw .
The security researcher working with a financial firm , notes that most network printers listen on port 9100 and that you can telnet to port 9100 , type text , and , once you disconnect , the text will print remotely .
Weaver writes " within the last year there have been new discoveries on attacking the intranet from the Internet .
This involves setting an image tag or script tag to an internally addressable IP address and then the browser will request the ' image ' resource .
Several attacks can be accomplished ; port scanning , fingerprinting devices , and changing internal router settings .
" Weaver has launched the attack successfully on both the Internet Explorer and Firefox browsers .
However , since the attack works only on network printers , a printer plugged directly into a PC would not be vulnerable .
Weaver offers two ways to defend against this attack :
Set an administrator password for your printers and consider restricting access to the printer so that it only accepts print jobs from a specific server .
Weaver 's research is available in a paper published on the Ha.ckers.org

Even the tooth fairy feels inflation 's bite .
The price per baby tooth is 22 % steeper today than it was a year ago .
That 's according to a new tooth fairy poll from Securian Dental , which runs dental plans .
The poll , which included 647 parents , shows that the tooth fairy pays $ 2.09 per baby tooth , on average , up from $ 1.71 last year .
Most parents said they pay $ 1 per tooth .
The second most common payment was $ 5 per tooth .
Then there were the outliers .
One parent says the payout is a nickel per tooth .
And at the other end of the spectrum , another parent splurges with $ 50 per tooth .
And since kids have 20 baby teeth , which get replaced by 32 grown - up teeth , that adds up to a pretty penny .
What 's up with tooth fairy inflation ?
Chalk it up to a boom in the $ 5 - per - tooth crowd , notes Marty Weiland , operations analyst for DeCare Dental , which administers Securian Dental plans .
" The tooth fairy poll average usually reflects the health of the economy .
However , this direction of change is inconsistent with trends exhibited in other more commonplace indices , " Weiland says in a news release .
" The NASDAQ and Dow Jones Industrial Average indices have decreased 7.4 % and 3.6 % over this same period , respectively , " says Weiland .
" Either the tooth fairy is an expert investor or we may be seeing something analogous to the ' lipstick effect , ' where during an economic downturn or a recession , the tendency is for consumers to purchase small , comforting items rather than large luxury items . "

The Blog Squad surveyed a number of business professionals who had abandoned or lost interest in their blogs , to find out the key reasons they felt the blog had failed .
The top five reasons given were :
1 . Not enough comments were left by visitors
2 . Not enough subscribers
3 . No increase in traffic to their main website
4. Difficult to come up with fresh new content for the blog every week
5 . Could n’t work out how to promote products and services via the blog
The Blog Squad put such “ failure ” down to a lack of training in four key business blogging areas : Content , Outreach , Design , and Action .
Yes , that does spell out CODA .
Denise Wakeman said , “ Many professionals simply do n’t know how to use the features of their blogging platform .
Furthermore , they often struggle with what to write about on a business blog .
So their posts are infrequent , their traffic stagnant , and they do n’t convert readers to clients . ”
They reckon that over half of all business blogs are abandoned within three months , and unsurprisingly they reckon they can train businesspeople to establish a more effective blog through teleseminar training this month .
More fundamental , as far as I ’m concerned , is that blogging just is n’t for everyone .
While I believe that most businesses today benefit from a web presence , I do n’t believe that they all need to blog .
If you ’ve nothing to say , and you ’re developing better customer relationships and conversions using more traditional methods , then do n’t take resources away from that simply because “ blogging ” is the new buzzword .
Bear in mind , too , that there are plenty of “ experts ” around who ’ll claim to fix your blog in four weeks .
It ’s not ( usually ) that simple .

I heard this story on the BBC International morning news , which is the only place any Americans are likely to hear about it , despite the fact that it has been authenticated by US officials :
An inmate at the US detention centre in Guantanamo Bay slashed his throat with a sharpened fingernail , US officials have confirmed .[..]
US officials characterised the incident as an act of " self - harm " rather than a suicide attempt .
...US Navy Cmdr Andrew Haynes said there was " an impressive effusion of blood " but the prisoner was treated by guards and taken to the prison clinic .
Officials would give no details of the man but lawyer Zachary Katznelson said the inmate had been held without charge for nearly six years .
Cmdr Haynes said " self - harm " incidents were a tactic to discredit US forces .
( CNN ) -- Science has now confirmed what expectant moms already know : Carrying a baby makes them more forgetful .
Researchers suspect that pregnant women 's forgetfulness stems from hormone shifts and lifestyle changes .
A recent study by two Australian researchers has found that pregnant women do experience a slight loss of memory -- and in many cases , the forgetfulness continues after birth .
The memory loss is subtle , and usually involves unfamiliar or demanding tasks , Dr. Julie Henry , one of the authors of the study , told CNN on Tuesday .
" What we found is that memory tasks which are more challenging or more novel , or those that would require multitasking -- these types of tasks are likely to be disrupted , " said Henry , a senior lecturer in Sydney 's University of New South Wales .
For example , a pregnant woman is more likely to forget a new telephone number , but she is able to recall a number she has dialed many times before , Henry said .
Henry and her colleague , Dr. Peter Rendell of Melbourne 's Australian Catholic University , analyzed 14 studies from around the world that tested the memory performances of more than 1,000 women -- expectant women , mothers and non-pregnant females .
The study , published in the Journal of Clinical and Experimental Neuropsychology , found that the memory loss can extend up to a year after birth .
The researchers could not establish whether the forgetfulness lasts longer because none of the research they analyzed went beyond the one - year observational period .
Do n't Miss MayoClinic.com : Pregnancy Center
Henry and Rendell said that more research is needed to determine what causes the loss at such a critical period of a woman 's life .
It may result from hormonal changes or from a lifestyle shift , Henry said .
" You 're probably more preoccupied with the upcoming birth and ( how ) your whole life is going to be changing , " she said .
" You 're going to have more difficult sleeping .
And other studies have shown that sleep deficiency definitely disrupts cognitive performance .
There 's no reason to think it wo n't do so during pregnancy . "
So , has Henry experienced the syndrome firsthand ?
" I have n't yet , " she said , laughing .
" It has n't put me off . "

A Generational War We All Lose ( March 19 , 2008 )
As a very astute reader pointed out last year , what we call " healthcare insurance " is not actually insurance .
Insurance means pooled risk , as in , three out of every 100 cars will be involved in an accident this year , and we spread the risk out by all having auto insurance .
Many of us will go decades without making a claim against our auto policy .
The same is true of home insurance and even life insurance : an actuary table enables the company to estimate how many of its insured will die before the policy matures .
But we all get old , ill , and die .
That means all of us will pull money out of the Medicare system .
That is not insurance ; that is a generational transfer of wealth .
Those of you in the medical and healthcare insurance / services worlds know what care costs in the U.S. ; those of you with good coverage might not know that a few days in the hospital can cost $ 20 - 50,000 or more , and any major procedure can run over $ 100,000 .
Toss in some long - term care , years of multiple expensive medications , horrendously expensive tests and the final weeks of life when the medical community is more or less forced to pull out all the stops to keep the patient alive , and you easily get to $ 1 million dollars per Baby Boomer in the waning years of their lives .
There are about 76 million Baby Boomers -- roughly speaking , the generation born between 1946 and 1964 .
Even assuming a total cost per Boomer of less than $ 1 million , that adds up to $ 60 trillion in medical costs .
Gee , that 's kind of a big number .
OK , let 's grant that some Boomers will die prematurely or suddenly , and many others will require less than $ 1 million in government - paid care .
But others will cost more than $ 1 million .
Any way you cut it , Boomers did not pay $ 60 trillion into some magical " fund " which awaits their insanely expensive decline ; current taxpayers will have to foot the bill .
How many taxpayers does it take to pay $ 1 million over 30 years of work ?
Some high - income taxpayers ( less than 10 % of the U.S. workforce ) might pay $ 30,000 a year in Federal tax , and therefore pay about $ 1 million over their careers , but many lower income U.S. workers with mortgage deductions and children pay little or no taxes .
These workers might pony up $ 20 - $ 40,000 a year in lifetime Federal taxes , meaning that 40 - 50 taxpayers are needed to pay the $ 1 million needed for Medicare benefits for one chronically ill Boomer .
Shall we guess that 10 workers on average will need to pay taxes their entire lives just to fund the Medicare bills ?
Or do you think it might be only five ?
Well , the worker - to- retiree ratio is falling to 3 - to - 1 or less , so any way you cut it , there is n't enough taxes being paid to fund Medicare - - not to mention the rest of the Federal government .
As the chart above indicates , Medicare alone will suck up the same GDP as the entire non-Social Security / Medicare Federal government .
Will your children and grandchildren gladly pay 40 - 50 % tax rates in order to fund your third MRI and your useless stent procedure and your $ 20 K per year in meds ?
The bigger question is : should they ?
My answer : no .
As I wrote almost three years ago in Boomers , Prepare to Fall on Your Swords ( June 2005 ) : Now it falls to us to fix the finances of our foolishly bankrupted nation .
Either we sacrifice our freebies ( every recipient of these programs has extracted far more than they paid in , even including accrued interest ) or we leave our children and their children burdened by an impossible debt .
I say we go out with idealistic panache , and fall on our swords with grace and dignity .
Instead of sucking off future generations like our parents have , let 's pay our own way , tighten our belts , stay healthy without absurdly expensive operations and medications ( which do n't work that well anyway , in case you 've ever read the fine print ) and leave the next generations a financially stable nation rather than a bankrupt , self - absorbed " pass the buck to your kids " mess -- which is the current state of affairs .
So how do we start ?
First , admit our entire " healthcare " a.k.a. " sickcare " system is irredeemably broken .
I mean the whole thing : the legal part , the care part , the pharmaceutical part , the FDA part , the multiple - forms - paperwork - insurance part , all of it .
You think this is some wild opinion from left field ?
Apparently the providers have reached the same conclusion , because they 're shipping patients to Thailand for affordable procedures : Outsourcing the Patients More U.S. health insurers are slashing costs by sending policyholders overseas for pricey procedures ( BusinessWeek ) :
For years , Americans have been traveling abroad to save money on elective procedures or dental work .
David Boucher , 49 , does n't fit the usual profile for such medical tourists .
An assistant vice - president of health - care services at Blue Cross & Blue Shield of South Carolina , he has ample health benefits .
But Boucher recently chose to have a colonoscopy at Bumrungrad International Hospital in Bangkok , mainly to make a point about the expanding options available to Blue Cross customers .
And his company happily picked up the $ 640 tab — a bargain by U.S. standards .
Blue Cross and other insurers would like to see more policyholders traveling abroad for medical care .
Since the start of the year , Boucher has signed alliances with seven overseas hospitals and hopes to add five more by yearend , including them all in coverage for his company 's 1.5 million members .
As health - care costs continue to rise in the U.S. , " medical travel is going to be part of the solution , " he says .
In other words : affordable care is simply not available here yet -- that will take turning off the endless spigots of money ( i.e. Medicare and other " insurance " ) .
When bills are paid in cash and " insurance " is a dead / abandoned system , then affordable care will magically appear -- if not in the U.S. ( which will then lose all those millions of jobs ) then in Mexico , Thailand and India .
This is capitalism at work , folks .
When a bloated , inefficient bureaucracy finally grows to unaffordable heights , it is toppled and replaced by a much leaner system .
As Fernand Braudel and other historians have shown , this process of obtaining cheaper goods and services from overseas has been underway for hundreds if not thousands of years .
Those who do the replacing reap immense profits .
Here is BusinessWeek again : After all , a heart procedure that costs $ 100,000 in the U.S. runs only $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 at some of the best private hospitals in Asia .
And the quality of care ?
Foreign hospitals in such arrangements are typically approved by Joint Commission International , part of the same nonprofit organization that accredits American hospitals .
Two factors which do n't make it onto charts of future Medicare costs are : the costs of borrowing trillions from oil exporters , China and Japan will be rising for decades to come , and the U.S. economy will be shrinking for years .
The interest on the national debt is already an immense burden , and it will be increasing just as tax revenues are shrinking .
As for Federal deficits : you ai n't seen nuthin ' yet .
So far , we 've been cruising down East Street via borrowing trillions from our friendly allies the Gulf Oil States , China 's central bank , Japan , et. al .
As their economies slip into recession and their big surpluses vanish like summer rain in Death Valley , they will be unable / unwilling to pony up the $ 50 trillion we need over the next 20 years .
Here is my affordable solution to Medicare 's obviously unaffordable future : Every taxpayer ( and no , that does n't mean recent citizen 's parents -- it means people who have paid taxes for 30 + years and their spouses ) gets a lifetime account of $ 50,000 .
That is still a lot of tax money but it 's certainly more affordable than $ 1 million .
If you want a heart procedure done in the U.S. , then Medicare pays $ 50,000 and you pay the $ 50,000 balance in cash .
That 's it ; the government 's done with its obligations to your care after the age of 65 .
From now on , it 's on you and your family .
Alternatively , you fly to India or Thailand and get the deal done for $ 10 K plus $ 2 K for airfare , and you have $ 38,000 remaining in your Medicare account .
( Of course this number must be adjusted for inflation . )
Or , you may want to try to solve your heart condition with the Dean Ornish diet and some exercise , and save the $ 12,000 for later .
As millions of Americans flock overseas for procedures , new kidneys , MRIs ( same machines , same tests , at 5 % of the cost in the U.S. -- I know this for fact in China ) , than suddenly competition sprouts up around the world .
Look , if you can't afford the procedure here , or you can't wait for an organ here , then would you go elsewhere for the organ ?
Yes , there are risks -- when did Americans get the idea that risks could be evaporated , or that we can sue somebody if it does n't work out ?
If you want all those legal protections , then by all means , have the operation done here and pay the fees in cash .
That 's always an option .
I predict that a global free - for - all for U.S. healthcare dollars will encourage price cuts in U.S. care which would be considered impossible .
Longtime correspondent Jum Twamley is on record here supporting the idea of " cash and carry " medical care at drive - in clinics provided by Wal - Mart and other consumer - oriented corporations : A Partial Answer to National Health Care ( November 11 , 2006 ) Is this " the answer " a near - sighted populace wants to hear ?
Of course not .
But as $ 7 trillion in real estate wealth vanishes into thin air , and trillions in stocks , bonds and other " financial insruments " slip from our fingers , what is " affordable " is about to undergo a radical re-assessment .
And once we face there is no more free money from overseas lenders , then we will have to finally face the truth of our national bankruptcy , and deal from that reality instead of wishful thinking .

There is an underground world in the web about papercraft modeling .
It is not visible .
It is hard to find .
And , in many cases , the web sites are in a language that most of us ca n’t read .
But , believe me , it is huge .
And it is not about printable cards or paper dolls , or even scrapbooking .
It is about stunningly good looking three dimensional paper models : Gadgets , toys , characters , cars , robots , spaceships , airplanes , buildings and even working photo cameras .
You name it .
This free ebook gathers some notable web sites with hundreds of ready to print models for download .
This is perhaps the most famous photograph of the magnitude 6.9 Loma Prieta earthquake that rocked San Francisco in 1989 .
The 8.4 - mile-long San Francisco - Oakland Bay Bridge , which carries more than 280,000 cars each day , just was n't fit for a high magnitude earthquake — kind of a problem for the city by the bay , because the next Big One could hit any day .
So San Francisco is rebuilding the eastern span of the bridge " to last 150 years . "
It 's a gargantuan $ 5.5 billion project that will require 200 million pounds of structural steel , 5,000 miles of half - inch steel strands in the tension cables and 450,000 cubic yards of concrete .
This is California 's largest infrastructure project , and when completed in 2013 , it will be the largest self - anchored suspension bridge ever built — and a Bay Area landmark .
We got a behind - the - scenes tour of the project from an agent of the Bay Bridge Seismic Safety Project , who showed us around the the new span .
Here 's what we saw .
We started our tour on Yerba Buena Island , where construction has already started on the new asymmetrical self - anchored suspension bridge .
This is one of two columns that have been built .
You can see the complexity of the project from the top of the tower , where you 're confronted by a sea of meshed steel , metal beams , and concrete .
Some 2,000 tons of steel will be used in this section alone .
The views are stunning from the top of what would soon support a new roadway : the San Francisco Bay , Treasure Island , the other section of the new bridge ( the Skyway ) and the foundations for the future towers .
The steel girder connecting the skyway to the SAS spans weighs 1,700 tons .
It and its twin are the largest ever lifted in Caltrans ' 113 - year history .
Our tour took us onto the new Skyway , which will connect the East Bay to the suspension bridge near Yerba Buena Island .
The bridge already has speed limit signs ( 50 mph ) , even though the final completion date is still five years away ( when construction started in 2002 , the bridge was to be finished by 2007 ) .
Pedestrians and cyclists have always wanted access to the Bay Bridge , so a pathway will connect Yerba Buena Island with the East Bay .
Walkers and cyclists will have to take a bus or ferry to get into San Francisco from the span .
The Skyway is wide .
But then , it has to be .
The Bay Bridge handles more than twice as much traffic each day as the Brooklyn Bridge .
Caltrans tells us the new span will have shoulder lanes , which the current span lacks – good news for breakdown - prone jalopies and cops on the prowl .
But there will be no increase in bridge capacity .
Back at the Bay Bridge headquarters in Oakland , several models showed the complete design of the bridge .
Debate over the single - tower " signature span " design raged as the cost of the project ballooned , and critics called for it to be scrapped in favor of a cheaper design .
But the design stayed , and construction on the tower that will support the 1,860 - foot bridge is now underway .
Some 17,000 individual wires will be used in the new suspension bridge 's single catenary .
The new span is slated to open in 2013 , joining the original western span , a classic suspension design that was extensively retrofitted during a five - year project completed in 2004 .
At that point , the original eastern span , a cantilever design built in 1936 , will be dismantled piece by piece ( sorry , no huge explosion ) .

These days , most people imagine that when they succumb to the inevitable and utter what must be their " last words " , they will have time for little more than a brief , faltering sentence .
If they are lucky , it will be shared with a few close family members before being swiftly consigned to the scrapheap of history .
Professor Randy Pausch is not most people , though .
In September , the previously unknown computer science expert delivered a remarkable lecture to students at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh .
Thanks to the wonders of technology , the hour - long speech did not disappear into the ether , but went on to be heard by millions .
It has since changed lives , touched American politics , and is about to spawn a publishing phenomenon .
At the centre of Pausch 's remarkable tale is " The Last Lecture , " an old academic conceit whereby teachers are asked to imagine they 're near death and must therefore sum up the entire collection of wisdom they wish to pass on to their students in a single lecture .
Pausch , a 47 - year - old father of three , did n't have to imagine anything when he gave his own " last lecture " on 18 September .
He had just been diagnosed with terminal pancreatic cancer .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In a little over an hour , to a packed lecture - hall , Pausch delivered a deeply moving speech on the subject of " really achieving your childhood dreams . "
The optimistic philosophy he espoused , in a lecture punctuated by both laughter and tears , resulted in scenes resembling a real - life version of Dead Poets Society .
To Americans who have recently , through the likes of Barack Obama , learnt to love public speaking , it has provided a timely reminder of how life ought to be lived .
The first public mention of Pausch 's lecture appeared in The Wall Street Journal , whose columnist Jeff Zaslow heard about it on the grapevine .
" I almost did n't go , " Zaslow recalls .
" I live in Detroit , about 300 miles away , and I ended up driving to save the cost of a flight .
It was like watching Babe Ruth hit his last home run , or Michael Jordan hitting his jump shot at the end of the NBA finals .
It was electric in that room .
I knew it affected everyone that was there .
But I could not have foreseen what followed , even in my wildest dreams . "
Zaslow decided to write about the lecture in his next column , and put together a five - minute highlights video of it for the Journal 's website .
And so a monster was created : readers passed the clip to their friends and it became a viral hit , receiving hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube and other platforms in a matter of hours .
" It just took off , " says Zaslow .
" The ABC TV network 's Good Morning America show saw it in the Journal and had Randy on the following morning .
Immediately after that , a million people logged on to the ABC website just to find out more about him .
I 've since had thousands of emails from people saying how much it moved them and how it has changed their lives . "
Soon , the video of the entire , hour - long talk was available online .
More than six million people have watched the life - affirming lecture in full on YouTube .
In October , Pausch was invited to appear on The Oprah Winfrey Show , where he gave an edited reprise of his talk to Winfrey 's 10 million - strong television audience .
Next month , his thoughts will be published in The Last Lecture , a book co-written by Zaslow , for which the US publishers Hyperion forked out a reported $ 6.7 m ( about £ 3.4 m ) advance after a bidding war .
In a market crammed full of questionable self - help tomes , Pausch 's honest and humble life lessons are expected to top bestseller lists in America and have already been translated into 18 languages .
" They keep taking the Oprah clip down off YouTube because of copyright infringement , " Zaslow says .
" But it gets a million views every time before it disappears . "
Meanwhile , on 13 March , still alive against the odds , Pausch appeared before a congressional subcommittee on behalf of the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network ( Pancan ) .
Chemo and radiation therapy have kept him alive long enough to demand that Congress set aside $ 170 m to find a cure for the disease , but the treatment has led to congestive heart and kidney failure .
It was a harrowing testimony .
There 's little or no way of preventing pancreatic cancer .
Though smoking or poor diet , for instance , can increase the risk of contracting it , little is known of the disease 's causes .
Only one case in 10 is attributed to hereditary genes .
Pausch has never smoked or drunk heavily , and used to exercise every day .
When he first developed symptoms , he thought it was hepatitis .
" When we got the diagnosis , my wife said , ' Gee , I guess you 'd trade for hepatitis , ' " Pausch told the subcommittee .
" I said , ' Honey , I 'd trade for Aids .
In a heartbeat . ' "

Adding grist to Pausch 's mill was the fact that , although two - thirds of sufferers are over 70 , he 's not the only young victim to have brought pancreatic cancer to public attention recently : at the beginning of this month , the actor Patrick Swayze announced that he had been diagnosed with the disease and was undergoing aggressive chemotherapy treatment .
So what of the speech itself ?
Pausch begins his " last lecture " by introducing the elephant in the room : the CAT scans of his liver , and the 10 or so tumours that are attacking it .
He apologises to those who think he should be more depressed and morose .
Then he does some press-ups .
This is typical of the persona that has made him so popular in his final months .
" He 's a showman , " says Zaslow , who has become a friend as well as a colleague .
" The first time I spoke to him was on the phone the day before the lecture .
He was cycling and speaking on his cellphone headset , and I said , ' Do you want to stop and call me from a landline ?
I do n't want you to get in an accident . '
He said , ' So I get in an accident .
What 's the difference ? '
So I could tell that he had a sense of humour before I even got there . "
" I do n't know how to not have fun , " Pausch tells his audience .
" I 'm dying and I 'm having fun , and I 'm going to keep having fun every day I 've got left . "
Pausch was a founder of CMU 's Entertainment Technology Centre and created a pioneering computer science course , Building Virtual Worlds , which he taught there for 10 years .
It sounds like the most fun a programmer can have : his students were taught how to turn virtual reality technology into entertainment , in video games and amusement - park rides .
However , his last lecture , which Pausch entitled " Really achieving your childhood dreams " , takes as its theme his youthful ambitions : how he achieved them , and how he helped others to achieve theirs .
He does n't discuss spirituality or religion , but speaks with the simple authority of a man who is looking death in the face and assessing what 's really important about life .
" Never lose the childlike wonder , " he advises .
" Show gratitude ...
Do n't complain ; just work harder ...
Never give up . "
" I think we 're hungry for something that 's real , " Zaslow says .
" Celebrity today is so plastic and does n't resonate with people , but there 's something about what Randy had to say that really touched a nerve .
He 's real ; he 's just telling it the way it is .
Many people have known someone that died , or are dying themselves .
All of us want to live and live life to the fullest .
He articulated that in a way that captured people 's imaginations . "
Most of Pausch 's successfully realised dreams were gloriously nerdy , like seeing his name in the World Book Encyclopedia , floating in zero gravity and meeting Captain Kirk ( or , at least , William Shatner ) .
He also describes how not achieving a dream can be as enriching as achieving one .
" Experience is what you get when you did n't get what you wanted , " he says , reflecting on the fact that he never made it as a gridiron player .
Three weeks after his lecture , however , the Pittsburgh Steelers invited him to take part in a practice session , so fulfilling his dream of joining the National Football League , if only for a day .
The team were n't the only ones to demonstrate such generosity .
JJ Abrams , the director of the new Star Trek film , heard about Pausch , learnt that they shared an obsession with the sci- fi series and invited the professor to the Los Angeles set to film a cameo appearance .
One of Pausch 's aspirations was to become a Disney " imagineer " , one of the elite who dream up , design and manufacture the magic in Disney 's magic kingdom .
He became a part - time member of the team that created Disneyworld 's Magic Carpet Ride ( based on the movie Aladdin ) and Pirates of the Caribbean .
Disney has given Pausch another boost in his final months – the corporation owns Hyperion , the publisher that paid a multi-million advance on Pausch 's book .
Pausch 's positive outlook seems to have come from his family .
One of his lecture slides shows his mother go - karting on her 70th birthday ; another shows his father riding a roller - coaster on his 80th .
The most touching moment of the lecture comes when Pausch announces that the previous day had been his wife Jai 's birthday .
The audience of 500 sing " Happy Birthday " as a cake is wheeled out and Jai tearfully blows out the candles .
" It was such an emotional moment , " Zaslow says .
" I 've seen it 100 times now and it does n't move me so much , but to be there on the day was incredible – it was a remarkable act of love .
Jai told me later that she whispered in his ear , ' Please do n't die . '
It sounds like Hollywood dialogue . "
That piece of Hollywood dialogue is inaudible on video , but will make it into the published version .
The book had to be completed in record time , for obvious reasons .
Zaslow visited Pausch three times , but mostly they talked on the phone , one hour a day for 53 days straight ;
Pausch pounding the asphalt on his bike , Zaslow tapping at a keyboard on the other end of the line .
Until very recently , Pausch was in great physical shape : cycling every day , running somewhat faster than the majority of his countrymen and , of course , interrupting his lectures to do a few quick press-ups .
But now , Pausch has stopped the palliative chemotherapy intended to extend his short lifespan for as long as possible .
He spends many days confined to bed .
" He 's not riding his bike any more , " Zaslow admits .
" The appearance before Congress took a lot out of him .
He almost died in a car accident that day – their limo driver hit a truck .
He joked about that , too . "
Pancreatic cancer is the fourth - deadliest cancer , killing 75 per cent of sufferers within a year .
Only 4 per cent make it to their fifth year .
According to Pancan , more than 37,000 people are diagnosed with the disease , and more than 33,000 die from it , each year in the US .
In the UK , the number diagnosed each year is about 7,400 .
Pancan hopes the attention being paid to pancreatic cancer will at least result in more effective early detection .
At the moment , less than 2 per cent of America 's National Cancer Institute budget is allocated to pancreatic cancer research .
Pausch 's fame may help to change that .
He has appeared in TV spots for Pancan , explaining the state of research funding .
" I'm a professor , " he says in the advert .
" I know that people in research labs can do miraculous things if they 're given the resources . "
Pausch talks about his students , friends and colleagues with great warmth and humour .
Their tributes show that the professor is much loved .
Pausch ends his last lecture with a couple of confessions , however .
First , the lecture is n't really " about how to achieve your dreams .
It 's about how to live your life .
If you lead your life the right way , the karma will take care of itself ; the dreams will come to you . "
Second , the life lessons it contains are really meant for his three young children as they grow up .
In the advertising material for his book , he admits that " the lecture was only for three people – my kids . "
As for the book : " It 's only the first three copies I really care about . "
The other people he has touched are just a wonderful side - effect .
" Judging by the emails I get and the comments on the thousands of blogs devoted to it , " Zaslow says , " young people love him , old people love him , academics love him , parents love him , cancer patients love him . "
His passing may be private , but Randy Pausch will be mourned by millions .
The Last Lecture by Randy Pausch and Jeffrey Zaslow will be published in the UK by Hodder & Stoughton on 17th April , £ 12.99
Achieving your childhood dreams – by Randy Pausch
* " Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams "
* Randy Pausch's " final " lecture was given on 18 September 2007 , as part of a series at Carnegie Mellon University .
A full transcript is carried at www.randypausch.com.
Here are some highlights .
* " It 's wonderful to be here .
What they did n't tell you is that this lecture series used to be called ' The Last Lecture ' .
If you had one last lecture to give before you died , what would it be ?
I thought , damn , I finally nailed the venue and they renamed it . "
* " We can not change the cards we are dealt , just how we play the hand .
If I do n't seem as depressed as I should be , sorry to disappoint you .
I assure you I am not in denial .
It 's not like I 'm not aware of what 's going on ...
The other thing is that I am in phenomenally good health right now .
I mean , it 's the greatest thing of cognitive dissonance you will ever see : the fact that I am in really good shape .
In fact , I am in better shape than most of you .
[ Pausch starts doing push - ups . ]
So anybody who wants to cry or pity me can get down and do a few of those . "
* " How do you get people to help you ?
By telling the truth .
Being earnest .
I 'll take an earnest person over a hip person every day , because hip is short - term . "
* " Apologise when you screw up and focus on other people , not on yourself .
How do I make a concrete example of that ?
See , yesterday was my wife 's birthday .
If there was ever a time I might be entitled to have the focus on me , it might be the last lecture .
But no , I feel very badly that my wife did n't really get a proper birthday , and I thought it would be very nice if 500 people ... [ a birthday cake is wheeled on to the stage ] . "
* " Remember , brick walls let us show our dedication .
They are there to separate us from the people who do n't really want to achieve their dreams .
Do n't bail .
The best of the gold 's at the bottom of barrels of crap . "
* " Show gratitude .
When I got tenure I took all of my research team down to Disney World for a week .
And one of the other professors said , ' How can you do that ? '
I said : ' These people just busted their ass and got me the best job in the world for life .
How could I not do that ? ' "
* " Do n't complain .
Just work harder [ shows slide of Jackie Robinson , the first black major league baseball player ] .
It was in his contract not to complain , even when fans spit on him . "
* " Work hard .
I got tenure a year early .
Junior faculty members used to say to me , ' What 's your secret ? '
I said , ' It 's pretty simple : call me any Friday night in my office at ten o'clock and I 'll tell you . ' "
* " Find the best in everybody .
You might have to wait a long time , but people will show you their good side .
Just keep waiting , it will come out .
And be prepared .
Luck is truly where preparation meets opportunity . "
Pancreatic cancer : the victims that rocked the world
Luciano Pavarotti
Operatic superstar Pavarotti died in September last year after a year - long battle with pancreatic cancer .
Despite successful surgery to remove tumours in 2006 , his condition worsened and he was forced to call off concerts .
He was 71 when he died .
Two - thirds of pancreatic cancer sufferers are aged 70 or over .
Magnus Magnusson
The much - loved Mastermind host died in January 2007 , just four months after being diagnosed with cancer .
He was 77 .
His four surviving children said he had taught them both how to live , and how to die .
" He did both , " they said , " with infinite grace . "
Syd Barrett
Roger Keith Barrett – known as Syd – was the iconoclastic former frontman for Pink Floyd .
A recluse , he died of pancreatic cancer in 2006 , aged 60 .
The original acid casualty was supposedly the subject of his bandmates ' anthem " Shine on You Crazy Diamond " .
Bill Hicks
Bill Hicks , an incendiary American comedian , was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 1993 , aged just 31 .
He continued to perform while undergoing chemotherapy , even using his condition for material .
One of his more famous jokes concerned the actor Yul Brynner , who , like Hicks , blamed his own death on prodigious smoking .
Hicks died in February 1994 .
Dizzy Gillespie
Jazz trumpeter John Birks ' Dizzy ' Gillespie died of the disease in 1993 , aged 75 , in Englewood , New Jersey .
Englewood Hospital established the Dizzy Gillespie Cancer Institute and Memorial Fund in his memory .
Rene Magritte
Magritte , the Belgian surrealist known for his witty paintings of pipes , apples and bowler hats , died of pancreatic cancer in Brussels in 1967 .
Though his painting was famously " not a pipe " , Magritte was a smoker .
Miles Kington
The journalist and satirist Miles Kington , a dearly missed daily contributor to The Independent , died in January aged 67 , after a short battle with pancreatic cancer , soon after filing his final column .
Patrick Swayze
The Hollywood star best known for Dirty Dancing and Ghost announced that he had been diagnosed with pancreatic cancer earlier this month .
He is now undergoing chemotherapy .
Swayze , 55 , plans to continue working despite his condition .
Chief executives of big companies and public sector organisations are coping with their stressful positions by drinking the equivalent of almost three bottles of wine a week , new research shows .
Men holding the highest positions drink an average of almost 23 units a week – more than 11 medium ( 175 ml ) glasses of wine .
Their consumption exceeds the total recommended weekly limit for alcohol of 21 units and suggests many businessmen and managers may suffer ill health as a result .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Doctors , lawyers , accountants and other professional men are also knocking back above average amounts of alcohol – 20 units a week – according to figures from the Office of National Statistics ( ONS ) released yesterday .
Overall , they show that across all social classes about 10 million people are drinking more than the recommended weekly maximum of 21 units for a man and 14 for a woman .
Men are likely to drink twice as much as women .
The ONS said it had previously underestimated the amount people were drinking and the real amount was 32 per cent higher .
Men were drinking 18.7 units a week and a women nine units , compared with previous estimates of 14.8 and 6.2 .
Previous studies have pointed to waning total alcohol consumption , but the researchers became concerned that they had not taken into account the trend for stronger beer and the serving of wine in larger glasses .
People may also be under - reporting or under-estimating consumption .
In an attempt to discourage binge drinking , the Government advises women to drink no more than two units a day and men three units a day .
A 175 ml glass of wine counts as two units and a 250 ml glass three units .
Four in 10 men and a third of women exceeded the daily limits at least once a week .
Home was the most popular place for people to drink , with half of the population having drunk there in the past week .
The English drink more than the Scots or Welsh , according to the two ONS reports , Smoking and Drinking Among Adults 2006 and Drinking : Adults Behaviour and Knowledge 2007 .
Almost a quarter of Britain 's 42 million adults exceed the weekly limits .
About 60 per cent of the population , 25 million adults , are low or moderate drinkers .
Almost six million people drink no alcohol and their inclusion in the drinking averages means that those who do drink alcohol drink even more than the figures suggest .
Eileen Goddard , the principal researcher , said that although statistics from the alcohol industry based on Customs data indicated that overall alcohol consumption had fallen by 5 per cent between 2004 and 2006 , it was possible , given doubts over the research , that the total had actually gone up
Frank Soodeen , of Alcohol Concern , said : " Over the last 20 years middle - class families particularly have moved alcohol from the fringe of their lives to the centre of it .
Because it so available they are drinking almost on a daily basis . "
Jeremy Beadles , chief executive of the Wine and Spirit Trade Association , said he detected evidence that people were drinking more responsibly .
" The message of responsible drinking is continuing to get out as the long - term trends continue to improve .
It is also clear that the vast majority of people drink sensibly . "
The government 's centralized terrorist watch list passed the 900,000 name mark this month , according to the ACLU , which estimated the new total by relying on Congressional testimony from the fall that the sprawling list was growing by 20,000 names a month .
The report the ACLU relied on to create its Watch List Counter included the following chart demonstrating the clear growth trajectory of the nation 's centralized watch lists over the last several years .
The Terrorist Screening Center runs the list , accepting nominations of new names from a large range of government agencies .
Agencies use the watch list to check persons seeking visas , traveler entering or leaving the country , domestic airline passengers and persons stopped by state , local or federal law enforcement .
Most of the positive matches on the list came from police routinely checking persons , such as speeding motorists , according to the Government Accountability Office 's report ( .pdf ) .
The number of individuals on the list is likely significantly less than 900,000 , since the name count includes aliases .
Persons on the list are coded with varying suspected threat levels , so simply being on the watch list does n't mean one will be arrested when say a person on the list pulled over for speeding .
In fact , being on list is n't even enough to ensure that a person is denied a visa or entry into the country , according to the report .
The Transportation Security Agency exports two subsets of the list – the no-fly and selectee lists – which airlines use to decide who can get a boarding pass and who has to get hand - searched .
The TSA continues to work on a much - delayed project now known as Secure Flight that would have the TSA perform the name checks in advance of a domestic flight , in an effort to reduce the number of falsely flagged travelers .
Those affected over the last 7 years include many David Nelsons , a high - ranking nun , and federal employees with security clearances .
If the ACLU 's math is correct , the list should pass the million name mark sometime in early July .
UPDATE : Terrorist Screening Center spokesman Chad Kolton dropped a long response in the comments , saying that the list is useful , contains actually more like 300,000 people due to aliases and that only some 5 percent – approximately 15,000 , are U.S. persons .
[ T ]he Terrorist Screening Database ( TSDB ) is now the world ’s most comprehensive and , importantly , widely - shared list of known and suspected terrorists .
The names it includes are there because of credible information developed by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies , or those of our foreign partners .
While the vast majority of people in it likely will never attempt to enter the United States , the TSDB gives our allies , consular officers , airlines , and border screening agencies the ability to make an informed decision about granting admission to the U.S. [...]
We work hard to ensure that the list remains effective even as it grows .
The government does its best to populate the TSDB with the identities of only those who are known or appropriately suspected of being involved in terrorism .
In addition , TSC employees constantly review the database to remove the identities of those who have been cleared of any suspicion of engaging in terrorist activity .
During fiscal year 2007 alone , TSC employees removed over 100,000 records from the database of individuals that had been cleared of having any nexus to terrorism . [...]
This list helps protect Americans .
We 're always at work to do it in the most effective , least intrusive way we can , adhering to our important Constitutional principles in the process .
THREAT LEVEL confirmed that this was Kolton , and sent some further questions about the list and its operations to him .
Due to some very reasonable extenuating circumstances , Kolton can't immediately answer , but THREAT LEVEL will bring you more in 10 days or so .

Featured 12/29/2007
The kid in this video is a smart ass , but the cops did n't have to stoop to his level and power trip while they had him held down .
Building models forms the core of many areas of scientific and engineering research .
Essentially , a model is a representation of a complex system that has been simplified in different ways to help understand its behaviour .
An aeronautical engineer , for example , might build a miniaturised physical model of a fighter plane to test in a wind tunnel .
In modern times , more and more modelling is being performed by computers — running mathematical models at very high rates of calculations .
A computer model of the flow of air over a supersonic wing is incredibly sophisticated , but it is based on very basic principles of program design and simulation .
In this article , the first half of a two - part feature on model behaviour , we 'll take a look at how simple computer models can be programmed to study some very interesting natural systems as well as focus on how a few scientists are using similar models in their own front - line research .
Getting started
Which way are they going ?
Find out how to simulate fish behaviour .
This is a hands - on introduction to mathematical modelling and computer simulation , but wo n't involve an in - depth lesson on programming itself .
If you 've never even looked at a program before , do n't worry because all of the simulations can be watched as Java videos on this website too .
If you have done a little bit of computer programming you might like to download all of the code used in this article and play around to see how you can improve or adapt it .
The software used to write these simulations and produce the animations is called Processing , and is available in PC and Mac versions as a free download here .
Processing has been released as a collaboration between computer scientists and artists , and is extremely easy to pick up and start using yourself .
Have a look at their homepage for a list of all the different projects Processing has been used for around the world .
The essence of building a good model is to think how best to simplify a complex problem , to distil the crucial features of a system and leave out anything that might confuse the analysis of the model 's behaviour .
For example , a simple model of the trajectory of a bullet fired down a rifle range obviously needs to take into account the action of gravity , but could safely ignore the slight effects of air resistance .
Air resistance in this case would be called a second - order effect .
When modelling a different system , the lift produced by an aircraft wing , for example , the action of the air cannot be ignored but other factors could be left out .
The trick is to find a balance between keeping your model as simple as possible so that you can understand its behaviour and see how changing one of the inputs affects the response of the whole system , without cutting out too much that might be important and so produce meaningless results .
All of the examples in this first article are what are known as particle models — they model the movement of individual points around space depending on various rules .
Gas molecules in a box
For our first model we 'll write a very basic physics simulation of molecules of gas trapped in a box .
To keep things nice and simple we 'll only look at two dimensions — the particles are restricted to a square plane .
The physics of this situation is easy — each particle continues in a straight line with the same direction and speed it started with , unless it hits one of the walls of the box .
In this case , the molecule bounces off again , its direction changes accordingly , but its speed remains the same .
Like any movie , the animations in this article consist of a series of frames merging together to give the impression of fluid motion .
The program 's job is to calculate the position , direction and speed of each particle at each time step , based on the information from the previous step .
All the examples in this article store the data at every time step in an array , or a matrix as it is called in maths - speak .
Each row of the matrix stores the necessary information on a different particle .
In this gas example , the state of every particle is described by four numbers .
Two of them give its ( x , y ) position in the plane .
The other two describe the speed with which the particle moves in each of the two directions .
They are called deltaX and deltaY ( meaning " change in X position " and " change in Y position " ) and together they define the velocity of the particle .
Thus the matrix in this case has four columns , and enough rows for all the particles .
After every time - step of the simulation , the ( x , y ) position of each particle is updated depending on its velocity .
The structure of the program written to model this process is also fairly straight - forward .
Have a look at the code and see if you can get at least the general gist of how it works .
The first thing that needs to be done is to define the most important parameters of the model , such as how many molecules to include , and the matrix that will store the information on the position and velocity of each particle .
Next , Processing demands that the simulation is set - up in terms of the size of the world , which is a square in this case , and frame - rate of the animation .
After that the simulation is initialised .
This is where we fill - in the data storage matrix with the necessary information on the starting position and velocity of each particle in turn .
In this case we have chosen to scatter the particle randomly .
Next , we have some code that draws the current state of the system , with a turquoise - coloured background and a red circle placed at the ( x , y ) location of every particle .
Finally , comes the core of the simulation itself , the update function .
At every given time step ,
This function takes each particle in the matrix in turn and calculates whether its velocity would take it outside the boundaries of the box during this time step .
If so , the particle velocity is changed accordingly and it bounces off the wall of the box , otherwise it moves forward by an amount given by its velocity vector ( deltaX , deltaY ) .
Thus , each particle now has a new position and possibly a new velocity vector and the matrix is updated with these new values .
The entire program is set to loop so that after the particles have been updated the system is drawn again , then the particles updated once more , and so on until you stop the program .
This happens so quickly on fast modern computers that the images flow together into a smooth animation of the gas molecules .
The picture link on the right opens up a Java version of this program , so you can see it work even if you have n't installed the Processing software .
You 'll notice that there are two main problems with this overly - simplistic model .
Firstly , our program uses only integer values for deltaX and deltaY .
This means that there are n't many different directions the particles can move in .
Some of the particles can be seen moving perfectly horizontally or vertically as they bounce straight back and forth between two sides .
Secondly , this code includes no interaction between the molecules — they never collide with each other and simply bounce around inside the box in a completely predictable way .
Periodically all the molecules converge back into a tight cluster in the middle before dispersing outwards again like at the start .
This obviously would never happen with the air molecules inside the room you 're sat in — they constantly knock into each other to produce very unpredictable motion .
If you already know a bit about computer programming , you might want to take this simple example as your starting point and make it much more sophisticated and realistic .
Some tips on how to do this are given at the end of the program file
We 'll now move on to another example of modelling motion ; this time there are slightly more complicated rules governing how the particles interact with each other .
Bird flocking
The system we 'll model is that of a flock of birds ; not moving completely independently like the first example but with each particle responding to the motion of others .
We 'll use the same standard structure as the gas program : first defining the parameters and setting up the world size , initialising the starting positions and velocities of all the particles , and next looping around functions that display the current state of the system and then execute the rules to calculate how the system changes over the next time - step .
In the first example we wanted to simulate the motion of particles trapped inside an enclosed space .
This time , however , we 're interested in looking into how birds flock when flying in the open .
We do n't want the world to have any edges because the simulation wo n't behave properly around these artificial features .
A common trick in modelling is to define the world space so that if a particle moves off the left - hand side it re-appears on the right , and likewise with the top and bottom edges .
The top and bottom have been rolled round so that they join together into a tube , and then the left and right ends have been bent round to join together as well — effectively we have remoulded the world into the surface of a doughnut ( a torus in maths - speak ) .
The second advance in this model is that instead of the particles continuing in a straight line , the birds interact with each other and change their direction of flight depending on their neighbours .
At every time step , the program takes each bird in turn , calculates the average flight direction of any other birds within a chosen range , and gets the bird to steer into this direction .
This field - of - view range is displayed as an orange circle around one randomly - selected bird .
In the program the variable that stores its value is called eyeSight .
Take a look through the computer code here to pick up the general gist of how the program works , and then try a few runs of the simulation with the image link on the left .
Almost immediately the initially - random motion of the birds has transformed into ordered behaviour .
Great clumps of birds have spontaneously organised themselves into all flying in roughly the same direction .
Lone birds get attracted into the flocks , and occasionally when two great groups stray too close to each other individual birds peel away to join the other flock as the two clouds smoothly merge together , waver for a short while and then settle on a new group heading .
Compare this modelled behaviour to the dynamics of real bird flocks .
At the time of writing this there is a wonderful advert being run on British television for a certain hops - based beverage , showing the mesmerising flocking of swallows at dusk , and ending with the tag - line " Belong " .
Follow the image link on the right to watch this advert through YouTube , or if it has been removed you 'll have no trouble finding other videos of bird flocking .
This motion appears exquisitely choreographed , with every individual seemingly knowing exactly where it needs to fly next and great streams of birds co-ordinated to all smoothly change direction together .
But within a flock no one bird is the leader ; there is no master plan and all decisions are made by the group dynamics alone .
All of the mesmerising complexity of thousands of flocking birds arises out of the very simple rules that each individual operates by , without any knowledge of what the rest of the group is doing beyond its most immediate neighbours .
This is known as bottom - up control , and is an example of emergence — very complex group behaviour arising out of individuals interacting through simple rules .
Lots of animals use this kind of " swarm intelligence " , including bees , wasps , ants and termites .
But these simple rules underlying flocking behaviour can in unusual circumstances also produce distinctly - unintelligent behaviour .
I 've not had the opportunity to try this myself , but I 've been reliably informed , by a friend of a friend , of an amusing trick you can pull off with a flock of sheep .
If you run suddenly at the sheep they 'll naturally try to move away from the perceived threat , whilst still operating their rules that it 's safest to keep as close as possible to your neighbours and run in the same direction .
But if you keep running slightly faster than the sheep , you overtake them and pass right through the middle of the flock and are now running in front .
The group dynamics have taken over from the initial individual decision to run away from an aggressor , and you end up having the entire flock following behind you , rather than trying to escape !
Bats and eagles
If you download the Processing software and the programming code for this model you can tweak certain features of the model to see how it affects the overall behaviour of the group .
For example , how far each bird can see , the eyeSight variable , is a very important parameter .
In our program above its value is set to 20 ( ie. the orange circle showing the visual field of one bird has a radius of 20 units ) , but this parameter can be set to any value you like .
Let 's take a look at two different scenarios : the " blind as a bat " case where eyeSight equals 1 , and the " eagle eyes " case where the birds ' eyeSight equals 100 and they can see right across the map .
Both of these simulations can be watched by clicking the two links below .
In the first scenario the birds do not interact with each other at all , and are effectively the same as gas molecules whizzing randomly around the world space .
In the other case , there is too much long - distance communication as birds respond to the flight direction of individuals right on the other side of the group .
The group behaviour solidifies very quickly into a uniform rigid movement .
In both situations all the complex flocking behaviour has been lost , due to either too little or too much interaction .
The system output is said to be very sensitive to this particular parameter .
There is a kind of phase - transition between the gas - like and solid - like behaviour , both equally dead in terms of interesting dynamics , as the natural - looking emergent behaviour only arises when the value of eyeSight is somewhere in between these two extremes .
Jiggling along
Another important modelling parameter is what we call the random jiggle ( denoted randomJiggle in the program ) .
It takes account of the fact that a bird 's assessment of the average flight direction of near - by birds is not always dead - accurate .
When the program updates each bird 's direction at a given time step it adjusts it by some random angle that lies within a range given by the random jiggle variable .
For random jiggle values less than about 10 ° the flock eventually settles down into uniform motion in a single direction .
And with randomJiggle set to 180° the system effectively becomes a simulation of the Brownian motion of dust motes .
As in the gas molecule example , there are several ways in which this model can be made more natural .
Some tips on this are given at the end of the program file .
Simplicity versus speed
A crucial factor when writing a model is the efficiency of the algorithm used .
The word " algorithm " descends from the name of the Arabic mathematician al - Khowarazmi , but has come to mean " a series of instructions followed to complete a task " .
The algorithm used in our bird flocking example here is in fact probably not very natural .
A real bird does n't actually log the position of every other bird , calculate the hypotenuse distance between itself and them all , select only those closer than exactly 5 m , and then steer towards the arithmetic mean of their headings .
These steps were chosen for the model because they are easy to follow and do produce the desired result .
It is quite a long - handed method , however , and requires calculating the distance from one bird to every other , for each bird in turn , and every time - step .
Even on a fast desktop computer , the simulation chugs through achingly slowly for bird numbers greater than about 500 .
Iain Couzin Iain is an expert on animal behaviour based at both Princeton University and University of Oxford .
He writes computer models of the group dynamics of everything from locusts to fish and birds .
His research is discovering startling features of how groups of animals make decisions collectively , and even helping agencies in Africa control lethal swarms of locusts .
Most recently , Iain has been focussing on how groups respond to the approach of a predator .

The image below shows a still from a video produced by one of his models that was used by the BBC in their documentary series " Predators " .

So when designing a model you also need to think about how to accomplish the task — whether you use an algorithm that is as fast as possible , or as close to the actual method used within the real system , or simply a method that may be inefficient but gets the job done .
Often in programming it is a good idea to put the algorithm for a particular task in its own function , so that you can call upon it within the program whenever you need a particular calculation .
( If you look at the bird flocking code , you will see that this has been done for the MeanHeading ( ) function . )
If you wanted a simulation to run much quicker while you watch , you could break it down into two stages .
The first runs through all the computer - hungry calculations , and saves the state of the system at each time - step as a separate matrix .
So after running it for 1,000 time steps , say , you end up with a list of matrices like a stack of printed sheets — a three - dimensional matrix .
Once the simulation has run through and all the information has been saved , the second stage is to simply display each time - step in turn ( and without having to wait for all the calculations to process this time ) — like flicking through the pages of the book of matrices to watch an animation .
We have focussed on this simple bird flocking simulation because it highlights important aspects of computer modelling , such as the structure of a computer program and writing algorithms and functions for particular tasks .
Even with such a simple model , however , complex and very natural - looking group behaviour is produced .
This is exactly the kind of computer model that animal researchers build to try and understand the flocking behaviour of birds or schooling of fish .
For example , Dr. Iain Couzin ( see the box above ) uses computer models of large groups to help him understand animal behaviour .
His models are based on exactly the same principles as the one we 've looked at in this article and show the same stunning emergence of complexity ; they are just more sophisticated , working in three dimensions ( rather than our two - dimensional plane ) and with a longer , more realistic , set of rules governing each individual 's behaviour .
Gravitational Models
A further extension to this kind of particle motion modelling is to include effects that stretch right across the map .
One obvious example of this is gravity — although it may become vanishingly slight , the gravitational influence of the Sun reaches over extremely long distances .
To build a simple gravitational model using Processing you could draw a small circle in the centre of the screen as the Sun , and write a function to calculate the distance and direction to the Sun from any other point .
From this you can calculate the gravitational force experienced and thus change in velocity of any particle in your modelled universe .
Initialise the simulation with planets placed at random positions with random velocities and animate their arcing motion around the Sun , their position in the next time - step determined by the current gravitational force and velocity .
You can also modify the program so that each planet leaves behind an orbital trail .
( Remove the background command in the draw ( ) function BY ' commenting it out ' with // at the beginning of the line ) .
Billions of stars were formed during the collision of the Antennae galaxies .
Find out more about modelling galaxy collisions below .

For a representation of the solar system you 'd need to carefully work out the velocity that produces a circular orbit for each planet .
Including only the Sun 's gravity , by far the dominant force in the solar system , produces a model accurate to a first approximation .
But the gas giant Jupiter exerts a noticeable influence on other planets , and so a more accurate model would include such second - order effects .
To make the orbit of Mercury agree perfectly with observations , you 'd have to add a further level of complexity and include Einstein 's theory of relativity as this is more accurate than Newton 's laws of gravity in certain situations .
Again , the trick of modelling is to think cleverly about the minimum amount of detail you need to include — the Apollo program landed men on the Moon with a simple Newtonian gravity model and ignoring everything other than the influence of Earth and its satellite .
Modelling the dynamics of larger gravitational systems , where all particles interact with all others , becomes extremely " computationally expensive " — requiring enormous numbers of calculations on very fast computers .
But such numerical simulations are crucial for many researchers .
For example , the box below focuses on the work of two leading researchers , looking at events billions of years in the past and future : the world - shattering impact that is thought to have created the Moon and how the immense gravitational pulls of our own galaxy and our nearest neighbour will tear each other apart in billions of years to come .
Robin Canup Robin is a space scientist at Southwest Research Institute in Texas .
She is interested in how the Moon formed , and tests the theory that it was born out of a " big splat " event right at the beginning of the solar system , when the young Earth collided with a smaller primordial planet .
Her computer models calculate what happens as the whole Earth is melted by the heat of the impact , and a huge amount of rock is thrown up into space , much of it eventually coalescing into an orbiting satellite , the Moon .
You can read more about Robin 's work on her website .
John Dubinski John is an astrophysicist at Toronto University studying the dynamics of whole galaxies .
Our galaxy , the Milky Way , and our spiral galactic neighbour called Andromeda are gravitationally attracting one another — effectively falling towards each other at 500,000 km / hr .
John has used a supercomputer to model the time about 3 billion years in the future when these two huge galaxies will begin to merge , tearing off great swathes of stars as the two rip through each other .
Amazingly , despite all this disruption the gaps between individual stars will still be so great that none will actually collide .
The fate of our Sun is uncertain , but it will either be ejected out into the dark void of intergalactic space , or plunge into the dense core of the merging galaxies .
You can read more about this at John 's website , or watch movies by following the link below , including one of the view in Earth 's night sky .
In the second article of this series we 'll move on from particle - based simulations to look at so - called Cellular Automata models .

Can Having a Cat Lower Your Heart Attack Risk ?
New research links owning a cat with a lower risk of heart attack and stroke .
Feb. 22 , 2008  --
Beth Birnbaum says she has experienced firsthand the health benefits of owning a cat .
For over 20 years , Birnbaum has been battling painful chronic diseases such as fibromyalgia , arthritis and degenerative disk disease .
The best medicine for her pain , Beth found , did not come from a prescription , but instead from her relationship with her adopted cat , Misty .
" Just last week I was on sofa , and in so much pain that I was crying and could n't get up , " Birnbaum explained .
" And Misty is not a lap cat by nature , but she came over to me , hopped on the sofa , lied down next to me and put her head on my shoulder and started purring away . "
" I can't really explain it , the feelings I have in those moments , " Birnbaum said .
" My pain did n't go away , but it was truly eased . "
And new research suggests the benefits of cat ownership may even go beyond pain relief .
According to the study , presented Thursday at the American Stroke Association meeting in New Orleans , cat owners may actually be less likely to die from heart attack , stroke or other types of cardiovascular disease .
Researchers at the University of Minnesota 's Stroke Research Center looked at 4,435 people , aged 30 to 75 years , who were participating in ongoing national government health research from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Study .
They found that over a 20 - year period , those who had never owned a cat had a 40 percent greater risk of death due to heart attack and a 30 percent higher risk of death due to any sort of cardiovascular disease than previous or current cat owners .
Researchers found no such protective effects for dog owners .
" This study links pet ownership to health consequences , and that 's very new concept that we have n't previously considered , " said lead study investigator Dr. Adnan Qureshi , executive director of the Stroke Center at the University of Minnesota .
Vets , Heart Experts Disagree Over Findings
To many veterinary experts , these findings came as no surprise .
" I have heard an owner with a chronic , debilitating illness say that her cat gives her a reason to get up each day , " said Marla McGeorge , veterinarian at The Cat Doctor in Portland , Ore .
Although the researchers were n't able to pinpoint the reason why cat owners would experience these heart benefits , Qureshi believes it might have something to do with the ability of cats to lower stress and anxiety in their owners .
However , Qureshi admitted to the possibility that these heart benefits might have more to do with the overall personality and lifestyle of cat owners rather than the cats themselves .
" Maybe cat owners tend not to have high - stress personalities , or they are just the type of people that are not highly affected by anxiety or high - stress situations , " Qureshi said .
The researchers were not able to analyze the personality traits of the study 's participants , and therefore could not stratify the individuals based on personality to see how certain personality traits might relate to cat ownership .
Because of this , some experts believe the research should be taken with a grain of salt .
" I believe the kind of person who would own a cat is a nurturing , low - stress individual , " said Nicholas Dodman , director of the Animal Behavior Clinic and professor in the department of clinical sciences at the Tufts Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine in North Grafton , Ma . " Most cat owners I see are very invested in their pet .
The cat becomes a focus of their interests and seems to deflect them from other worries . "
Other experts were even more skeptical .
" If you believe this research , I have a bridge in Brooklyn to sell you at a very good price , " said Dr. Steve Nissen , chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology .
Moreover , some experts pointed to past research on the health benefits of pet ownership which had vastly different conclusions .
A study of heart attack patients published in the American Journal of Cardiology in 1995 found dog owners were six times more likely to survive an additional year than patients who did n't own dogs .
The study found that owning cats , however , actually had an adverse association with survival .
Dr. Robert Myerburg , director of the division of cardiology at the University of Miami , said it makes more sense that dogs would provide more heart benefit to pet owners than cats .
" That [ makes ] sense to me because cats are more allergenic , and [ the ] immune response plays a role in heart attacks , " Myerburg said .
" [ I ] do n't know why this study comes out opposite . "
The Truth About Cats and Dogs ?
However , Lawrence McGill , technical vice - president and veterinary pathologist at ARUP Laboratories in Salt Lake City , Utah , said it might make sense that cats would de-stress owners and present heart benefits that dogs could not .
" I suspect this is due to the type of animal a cat is , " McGill explained .
" The cat is most commonly a lap animal and wants [ to be ] petted .
When being petted , the stress level of the pet and owner goes down , as well as heart rate and blood pressure in most cases . "
In contrast , McGill pointed out that dogs require more hands - on attention than cats , possibly contributing to the stress of the owner .
" When you get home from work , you have to give a dog attention , [ and ] if it is walk time — sorry , you have to do this , " McGill explained .
" They need to be fed on a routine basis .
Dogs require [ more ] attention hands - on and when they want it .
Dogs cannot hide their illnesses as much as a cat … [ and ] to some people , barking dogs are a stressor . "
Still , cat lover Marty Becker , veterinarian at the North Idaho Animal Hospital in Sandpoint , Idaho , and author of " The Healing Power of Pets , " said he 's experienced firsthand the health benefits from owning his five cats .
" I had major surgery around September 2001 because of a slipped disk in my neck and was going through a very hard time , " Becker explained .
" It was right around 9/11 , and all of that sadness and stress was physically debilitating and I felt myself slipping away mentally , but my cats could sense all of this and actually drew nearer to me .
I have experienced the healing power of these animals first hand . "
According to statistics from the American Veterinary Medical Association , there are more than 72 million pet dogs in the United States and nearly 82 million pet cats .
The manufacturing and construction sectors have been hardest hit
The latest US unemployment figures - released on Friday - showed the number of people laid off last month at its highest for five years .
US employers cut 63,000 positions from their payrolls in February , Labor Department figures revealed .
Mr Bush said he hoped consumer spending would " spur job creation " .
The Labor Department figures show the effect the housing and lending crisis is having on US firms , and follows 22,000 job cuts in January .
Now Mr Bush hopes his $ 152bn stimulus package will give the economy momentum .
Mr Bush is clearly worried enough about the state of his country 's economy to be making statements to the media about it , the BBC's Matthew Price reports from New York .
But many in America may be concluding that any economic help may come too late to have any real impact on what looks , every day , like an increasingly desperate situation , our correspondent adds .
' Economy slowed '
The package , recently passed by Congress , includes rebate cheques of $ 600 for individuals , $ 1,200 for couples , plus $ 300 each for dependent children for all but the very richest US citizens .
" We expect they will use it to boost consumer spending and that will spur job creation as well , " he said .
Mr Bush had earlier said that " it 's clear our economy has slowed " .
He added : " Losing a job is painful and I know Americans are concerned about our economy . "
" I know this is a difficult time for our economy , " he said .
" But we recognised the problem early and we provided the economy with a booster shot . "
Government jobs
Analysts had been expecting the US economy to create jobs in February and the fall will heighten recession fears .
Manufacturing , construction and retail were hardest hit by job losses .
A decline of that magnitude screams recession
Paul Ashworth , Capital Economics .
The cuts swamped job creation elsewhere , including in education and health care , leisure and hospitality and by the government .
Analysts highlighted that without a 38,000 increase in government jobs , the figures for February would have been even worse .
" The most striking figure in the whole report is that private sector payrolls shrank by 101,000 last month compared to a modest 26,000 drop in January , " said Paul Ashworth at Capital Economics .
" A decline of that magnitude screams recession . "
Bleak picture
Despite the drop in payroll employment , the unemployment rate fell to 4.8 % , from 4.9 % .
The discrepancy results from the way the figures are calculated - 450,000 job seekers stopped looking for employment , so are not included in the calculation of the unemployment rate .
Minutes before the report was released , the US Federal Reserve announced plans to make more money available to commercial lenders at its money auctions .
The central bank hopes that if the big banks have easy access to funds , it will ease the credit crunch , which is making it more difficult for consumers and businesses to borrow money .
The Fed said it will increase the amount of loans it will auction to banks on March 10 and March 24 to $ 50 bn ( £ 24.7bn ) , up from the $ 30 bn originally planned .
Analysts say that the central bank may also have to lower interest rates when its policy makers meet on 18 March .
The Federal Reserve has already slashed rates to 3 % , from 4.25 % at the beginning of the year to stabilise the world 's biggest economy .
" The Fed is going to ease monetary policy - the question is how often and how fast , " said David Resler , chief economist Nomura Securities International .
Cheney dresses dog as Darth Vader , report says John Byrne
Published : Thursday November 1 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Dick Cheney does n't have to shoot anyone .
He just has to ask his dog to take them out with a lightsaber .
According to ABC News , the Vice President dressed ( or had someone dress ) one of his dogs in a Darth Vader costume in a nod to comedian 's frequent comparisons between himself and the fallen Jedi with stertorous breath .
Photo via ABC News .
The vice president who once led President George W. Bush 's search committee to pick a vice president and ultimately decided upon himself , has entered the political lexicon for frequent comparisons .
Wikipedia has an entire paragraph .
" On June 22 , 2006 U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney called himself the Darth Vader of the Bush administration , " the entry states .
" Discussing the need to vigorously pursue intelligence , he said to CNN's John King , " It means we need to be able to go after and capture or kill those people who are trying to kill Americans .
That 's not a pleasant business .
It 's a very serious business .
And I suppose , sometimes , people look at my demeanor and say , well , he 's the Darth Vader of the administration . "
Notes Wikipedia dryly , " Vader 's name has become a synonym for evil . "
The entry continues : " Jon Stewart put on a Darth Vader helmet to ' talk ' to Dick Cheney as a ' kindred spirit ' on The Daily Show on January 25 , 2007 .
Cheney 's wife Lynne presented Stewart with a Darth Vader action figure on her appearance on the show on October 10 , 2007 .
Both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have referred to Cheney as ' Darth Cheney ' on occasion .
In the satiric cartoon show Lil ' Bush , Dick Cheney 's father is portrayed as being Darth Vader . "
President George W. Bush joked Wednesday that Vice President Dick Cheney , sometimes caricatured as Darth Vader , did not need a costume to play the sinister " Star Wars " villain for Halloween .
Bush 's jibe came as some of the candidates vying to succeed him as president put their own spin on Halloween , and a Senate Foreign Relations hearing was spooked by a " double " of chairman Senator Joseph Biden .
The President enjoyed his jibe at Cheney , who is derided by critics as a malevolent behind - the - scenes influence in US politics .
" This morning I was with the vice president .
I was asking him what costume he was planning .
And he said ' I 'm already wearing it . '
Then he mumbled something about ' the dark side of the Force , ' " Bush quipped .
Cheney himself has repeatedly joked publicly about his portrayal as the black - armored Dark Lord of the Sith , most recently in an October 21 speech to the Washington Institute for Near East policy .
" I 've been asked if that nickname bothers me , and the answer is , no .
After all , Darth Vader is one of the nicer things I 've been called recently , " the vice president said .
It was unclear whether Bush or Cheney 's pop-culture knowledge included the fact that , at the end of the saga , Vader redeems himself and saves his son by hurling the evil emperor Palpatine to his death , at the cost of his own life .
Even Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) recently joined the bandwagon .
In September , Clinton told a New York fundraising crowd , " You can always tell when the Republicans are restless -- because the Vice President 's motorcade pulls into the Capitol .
Darth Vader emerges .
And honestly I 'm not invited to their meetings I do n't know what he says or does . "

Some Finer Points on Handloading / Reloading
Nit -picking and improving accuracy by careful case preparation .
CASE PREPARATION ....
A few years ago , you could shrink your groups 1/ 4 " by just subscribing to Precision Shooting Magazine .
In those days , there were good articles on precision reloading in each issue .
The magazine is now discontinued .
On each of the aspects I have listed below , there would be complete articles and much discussion .
The words Handloading and Reloading have the same meaning and are interchangeable .
FIRST PERSON ....
This page is , for the most part , written in the first person , because it is about what I do in reloading .
I have tried to bring up the major operations and the critical points to achieve maximum accuracy and also briefly explain why I do each step .
For each of the operations that I write about , there are probably better ways , but the best way I have found is described here .
These case preparation steps are not done on factory ammunition and , in doing these steps , I believe my reloads are a cut above merely assembling quality components .
If you have a better procedure for one or more of these operations , please tell me about it .
I am always open for improvements .
I do not discuss or recommend procedures or hardware that I have not personally used .
I refuse to speculate on things where I have no first hand experience .
Thanks for viewing my page and good reading from Varmint Al .
BEGINNING RELOADING ....
I am not qualified to discuss the latest beginner 's reloading packages available on the market .
I only discuss equipment and techniques where I have firsthand experience .
My reloading equipment was purchased for accuracy reloading and not necessarily for economy .
My reloading press is an RCBS Rockchucker .
I purchased a number of presses on the road to ending up with the Rockchucker .
The beginner can save a lot of money in the long run by buying a good press to start with instead of upgrading .
There are good web pages on beginning reloading .
Click on John 's Varmint Den and go to his reloading page .
PRIMER POCKET .... I use the Whitetail Design 's carbide primer pocket tool .
The tool is expensive , but will last a lifetime if you do n't drop it and break it .
On new brass , this tool will cut the primer pocket to the correct depth and remove the fillet radius at the base of the pocket .
This cutting process only needs to be done once to new cases .
For each reloading , the primer pocket can quickly be cleaned with the same tool .
If your loads are hot , you will be able to cut metal at the base of the primer pocket after each firing .
This is an indication that you are yielding the brass case head and setting back the base of the primer pocket slightly .
When you clean the primer pocket this way , you will get a better " feel " when seating the primers ( no variable fillet at the base of the primer pocket ) , and you will not be shooting extra primer residue down your nice shiny barrel .
Note : Dick Wright , the former " Mr. Whitetail " , who made my Whitetail Design 's carbide primer pocket tools , has gone out of business but designated Russ Haydon 's Shooters ' Supply ( now closed ) as his successor for the primer pocket uniformer tools .
They sell his original knurled handle style as well as the same cutters ( Large Rifle , Small Rifle or Lapua ) alone or in the screwdriver handle , which is the Haydon - style .
FLASH HOLE BURR ....
When the brass is formed and they punch out the flash hole , a tiny raised burr is left around the edge of the flash hole where it enters the inside of the case .
The theory is that this burr could cause variable ignition from round to round depending on its size and location .
The K&M's Internal Flash Hole Deburring
Tool is simply a tiny center drill in a mandrel that it will make a cut with a limited depth .
A couple of turns on each new case is all that is needed to remove the burrs and make all of the flash holes uniform .
It sounds like a good thing to do and I perform this operation on all of my brass .
CASE LENGTH TRIMMING ....
For really good accuracy , you need to have all of your case neck ends cut square .
If one side of the neck is longer than the other , it would tend to tip the base of the bullet to the side as it exits the neck .
Also , excessive case neck length can force the end of the case neck into the end of the chamber and " clamp " the bullet in the neck .
The extra force to start the bullet in motion can cause excessive pressure with an otherwise safe round .
I did use an RCBS case trimmer , but now use my Mini Lathe with a dial indicator .
If you cut your case lengths too short , there is a large unsupported gap that the bullet passes by that does nothing for accuracy .
I like to keep this gap approximately 0.010 " to 0.015 " in factory chambers and 0.005 " for my " fitted neck " cases in custom chambers .
This is explained in detail below .
MEASURE THE CHAMBER LENGTH ....
Here is another accuracy aid .
I purchased the Sinclair case length measuring plugs for .17 , .224 , and 6 mm calibers .
These are very simple steel cylinders turned to the bullet diameter , leaving a rim slightly less than the case neck OD .
To use , you merely drill through the primer pocket ( so you can later push the plug out ) on an expendable cartridge case and neck size it .
Trim the case length about 0.100 inch short so the case mouth will not touch the rim of the plug gauge .
Insert the Sinclair plug gauge as if it were a bullet , leaving it long and then chamber the case .
The plug will be pushed deeper into the case neck and when you extract it , you can measure the chamber 's actual length with a dial caliper .
I usually find that the factory recommendations for case length leave a 0.050 inch to 0.070 inch gap between the end of the case and the actual length of the chamber .
This is a factory safety concern and you can get high pressures by forcing a long case into a short chamber .
The factory wants to be on the safe side .
But like everything else , if you want the best accuracy , you can minimize this gap down to 0.005 inch and still be safe .
You will get better accuracy and find that you can use much longer necks , in most cases , than the factory recommendations specify .
The extra case length will better allow you to load the bullet farther out to touch the lands .
I have found that , typically , factory .243 Win brass , is already 0.050 inch too short and there is no way that I can think of to lengthen it .
I do n't trim to the lengths specified in the loading manuals , but use my measurements as a guide .
All of this sounds like a lot of trouble to go through compared to walking into a store and asking for a box of 30 - 30's , but it makes a big difference in the confidence level of your accuracy potential .
If you have a lathe , the dimensions of the plug gauges are given for a few rifle calibers on my Mini Lathe Page .
They are very easy to make .
Check out Fred 's page for more info on making tight - neck and long - neck brass .
POOR MAN'S GAUGE ....
You can make a " Poor Man 's " gauge to measure how long your chamber is .
You will have to sacrifice a piece of brass .
Take a FL - sized piece of brass and drill out the primer pocket with a 1 / 4 " drill .
This is so you will later be able to push the bullet out if you need to .
Cut half of the neck off with a hacksaw .
Make a careful cut and save the piece you saw off .
De -burr and chamfer the new neck opening of the piece of brass and the tiny piece you cut off .
Slit the piece you cut off so it will slide on a bullet with a few pounds of force .
Seat a bullet into the case and chamber the round to make sure the bullet is not seated farther by the lands .
Remove the cartridge case with the seated bullet and slip the tiny brass split ring over the bullet and chamber it again .
Your chamber will slide the piece of brass ring back down the bullet when it hits the end of the chamber .
Carefully remove the cartridge case and measure .
Measure the length from the base of the cartridge case to the top of the tiny ring .
That is your actual chamber length .
You might want to do this a couple of times to be sure of the measurement .
NECK MOUTH CHAMFERING ....
After you trim the case lengths , there will be a burr on the ID and OD of the case mouth .
I use one of the standard inside / outside neck - chamfering tools and make a very light cut on both the inside and outside .
I just want to barely break the sharp corner .
I do n't want to sharpen the end , like I would need to make a cookie cutter .
After these two light cuts , I smooth the case mouth with very fine steel wool , using the Steel Wool Spinner below .
If you look with a magnifying glass , what the steel wool smoothing process does is remove all the tiny burrs on the chamfer cuts at the case mouth .
It does not polish the neck OD or ID .
This smooth mouth is a very important step to make seating the bullets easier and smoother without scratching the bullet .
The smooth case mouth also helps to prevent the Moly Coating from being scraped off when the bullets are seated .
Link :
All about steel wool .
Dick Hatfield made me a very simple Steel Wool Spinner that is a 1/4 - inch diameter steel rod , 2 inches long , hard soldered to a 3/4 - inch copper cap ( solder - type pipe fitting ) .
I place a wad of steel wool inside the copper cap and use the drill motor ( I now use the Mini Lathe ) to spin it and push the mouth of the case into the steel wool for approximately 10 turns .
It works great and the case mouths are very smooth and burr free after this process .
An off - the - shelf nut setter for a power screwdriver works very well to hold the steel wool for smoothing the neck mouths .
NECK MOUTH ....
On the left is a brand new 243 Win brass and you can see the rolled over edges of the mouth do to the hammering that occurs in the polishing process .
Also the hammered area is work hardened and locally , is no longer in the annealed state .
If you have ever noticed a tiny ring of gilding metal scraped off when you seat a bullet , it is this hard rolled over ring of brass that does the scraping .
Even after inside and outside chamfering , there is still a burr left at the edge of the cut surface .
On the right is one of my 23/40 brass cases after the neck has been trimmed square and fired a number of times .
I gave it about 30 revolutions in the Steel Wool Spinner to show how smooth the neck mouth is .
With the smooth annealed neck and no rolled over burr , bullets seat very smoothly without scraping gilding metal of the bullet .
POLISHING BRASS ....
Smooth and uniform case mouths are very important in producing accurate reloads .
Therefore , I do n't polish my carefully prepared brass in a tumbler .
During polishing , the case mouths are hammered against the other cases in the tumbler .
The hammering rolls over a small lip or burr on the ID and OD of each case mouth .
This peening process also locally work hardens the brass .
These tiny rolled - over rings of brass at the case mouths are harder than the rest of the annealed neck .
These rings and tiny peen marks are very obvious on new brass .
If you look at your nice shiny cleaned cases out of the tumbler , you will see the battered case mouths !
I have heard that some people tumble their loaded ammo to clean it and , with a bullet in place , the case mouths would be protected from the hammering .
I have n't tried it .
CAUTION : There is a serious problem with tumbling loaded ammo .
The coating on the powder grains , that controls the burn rate , could be abraded and this would change the powder 's characteristics .
If you were loading ammo near maximum , after tumbling , you might have created a dangerous pressure problem .
I merely wipe each of my reloads clean with a cloth towel to remove all of the grease and dirt .
For my " fitted neck " cases , I polish the neck OD and shoulder with a " Krazy " brand polishing cloth ( any silver or brass polishing cloth would work ) or a bit of Flitz Metal Polish on a cloth before each reload .
I swab out the neck ID with a cotton cleaning swab to remove the carbon and dirt .
Keeping that case mouth smooth can't be over stressed .
FORGET NICKEL - PLATED BRASS ....
I liked the looks and feel of nickel - plated cases , but I do n't load them anymore and here is why .
The cases are strong and it is easy enough to outside neck turn them .
That is not the problem .
The nickel - plating on the case neck ID is like sandpaper .
The only way you might be able to remove this grit is with a case neck ID reamer if you have a " tight neck " chamber and enough neck wall thickness to work with .
If you have a loaded nickel - plated round laying around and do n't believe me , just pull the bullet .
It will look like you pulled it out of a tube of 180 grit wet / dry sandpaper .
If you pull the bullet out of a brass case mouth that has been carefully chamfered and polished with the steel wool spinner process above , it will be essentially smooth like out of the bullet box .
Want copper in the barrel ?
Start by sanding the surface of those nice polished precision bullets .
Try it with a Moly Coated bullet and it is even worse ; the nickel - plated cases scrape off the Moly .
The nickel - plated case neck IDs do n't get any better after you reload them a few times .
They are still like sandpaper .
Think about a few of those nickel pieces of grit imbedding into the copper of the bullet and what they do to your rifle barrel !
I have heard that the nickel is hard enough to score some reloading dies and also wear down the expander ball .
Any metal that hard , should be kept away from your precision barrel .
I have heard that some people have had success in removing the nickel plate from the neck IDs with a stainless steel brush and a drill motor .
I have n't tried it .
MORE ABOUT NICKEL PLATING ....
This is interesting about the mechanical properties of the nickel plating :
Electrolysis nickel plating is a process for chemically applying nickel - alloy deposits onto metallic substrates using an auto catalytic immersion process without the use of electrical current .
... snip ....
Hardness and Wear Resistance
One of the most important properties for many applications is hardness .
As deposited , the micro-hardness of electrolysis nickel coatings is about 500 to 700 HK100 .
That is approximately equal to 45 to 58 HRC and equivalent to many hardened alloy steels .
Heat treatment causes these alloys to precipitation harden and can produce hardness values as high as 1100 HK100 , equal to most commercial hard chromium coatings .
... snip ...
Note that if you anneal your nickel plated necks , you are hardening the nickel plating .
It can be harder than many alloyed steels before you anneal and can increase is hardness as much as 2 fold by precipitation hardening .
I sure would n't want those tiny little hard pieces inside the neck getting embedded in the bullet 's copper surface and then fire lapping my nice shiny barrel .
OUTSIDE CASE NECK TURNING ....
I started to get true accuracy when I began using the Marquart outside neck turning tool to true up my cartridge case necks .
It looks like the Marquart Neck Turning Tool for under $ 50 is now being manufactured by a different company .
They claim the same design , precision , and quality for 21 years .
I have not tried a Marquart tool from the new company , but the info is given below .

If you can't find a Marquart Tool , the K&M or Sinclair neck turning tools are probably just as good , but I have n't personally tried them .
Here is the info to get the K&M Neck Turning Tool directly from the manufacturer :

Neck turning provides a neck with uniform wall thickness , helps to center the bullet on the bore axis , and reduces split necks .
Neck turning also sorts out the cases that have large variations in wall thickness because , once turned , the poorer cases are easily identified and can be tossed into the bone pile .
NECK TURNING FOR FACTORY -CHAMBERED RIFLES ....
Here is how I adjust the neck turning tool for my factory - chambered rifles that usually have a sloppy 0.010 inch of neck clearance .
I pick out 10 new cases at random .
Then , as I always do even with new cases , neck size them , including the expander plug , so the neck ID will be round and tight on the neck turning mandrel .
I also lightly chamfer the ID and OD of the neck mouth to remove the " rolled over edge " from factory case polishing .
The mandrel needs to turn hard inside the case neck even when there is no cutting action .
A tight fitting mandrel is the only way you can really make accurate cuts .
I adjust the depth of cut so it barely cuts any material and then go through all 10 cases .
Usually , there will be one or two cases that clean up practically all the way around and a few that cut heavily only on one side .
I increase the depth of the cut a slight amount and go through the 10 cases again .
I continue this process until about 75 % of the cases clean up about 80 % to 90 % of the neck outside surface .
Caution :
Do not set your neck turning tool so it makes a clean cut on all of the cases , because it will make the necks too thin and you will have ruined all of the cases .
Therefore , with the correct setting , it means I will reject 2 or 3 out of 10 cases to the bone pile .
I have found that Winchester brass usually has thicker necks than Remington brass and appears to last longer .
I keep that setting on the neck turning tool and turn all the cases in that lot of brass .
No more neck turning is required for the life of these cases .
The neck turned cases will improve accuracy by decreasing the group sizes approximately 50 % and get rid of most of the wild fliers .
Another advantage of neck turned cases is the reduction of split necks .
The uniform wall thickness causes uniform stretching of the neck wall during firing and uniform compression during neck resizing .
NECK TURNING FOR CUSTOM -CHAMBERED RIFLES ....
For my rifles with tight - necked custom chambers , I use " fitted neck " cases .
Once made , these " fitted neck " cases need no resizing .
All that is required for reloading is to clean the primer pocket , clean the neck ID , reprime , throw the powder charge , and seat the bullet .
These rifles have chamber neck diameters so small that I can't close the bolt on factory ammunition .
It took a while to figure out how to reliably make " fitted neck " cases and it cost me quite a few good pieces of brass in the learning process .
The first step is to turn the necks on 3 or 4 sacrificial cases so that there is approximately 0.005 inch of neck clearance with a bullet seated .
Load a standard load and fire - form these cases .
Carefully measure the neck diameter of these fired cases and record this diameter .
I call it the " spring back " diameter .
This diameter is actually the diameter the brass neck will spring back from elastically after being forced against the rifle chamber 's neck diameter , including the elastic expansion of the chamber itself .
The difference between the barrel 's chamber neck diameter and this fire - formed case neck 's " spring back " diameter is usually about 0.0013 inch to 0.0015 inch .
This spring back is for the .224 to .243 calibers .
NECK TURNING FOR TIGHT NECK CHAMBERS ....
Instead of using tight neck clearance of the " fitted neck " procedure above , most people neck turn their brass for custom chambers so there is a neck diameter clearance of 0.003 inch to 0.004 inch .
Often standard factory dies will not be able to resize the necks and the Redding bushing dies , or equivalent , are required to neck size to the proper diameter without an expander ball .
FITTED NECK CASES ....
Continuing on , I take another 4 or 5 cases and adjust the neck turning tool so that the neck diameter ( with the bullet seated ) is the same or 0.0001 inch larger than the " spring back " diameter above .
This is a cut and try process and takes some very careful adjustments on the neck turning tool .
After the neck turning tool is adjusted correctly , I load and fire the 5 cases and neck size them and repeat the neck turning without changing the setting on the Marquart tool .
This final neck turning will usually take a slight skimming cut of less than 0.0001 inch .
I load the 5 cases again without doing any resizing and fire them and then clean the neck IDs with a brush and load them .
I feel the neck tension by the force it takes to seat the bullet .
If there is ample neck tension so that I can not pull the bullet out or seat it deeper with my fingers , I have the correct neck turning setting .
I make no further adjustments to the neck turning tool .
At this point I turn all the cases in the lot without changing the turning tool setting .
I fire - form the cases , neck size them , and take the final skimming cut .
At this point , I have " fitted neck " cases for this particular custom - chambered rifle .
These cases give me the optimum in accuracy and I never have to resize them again .
If they start to get the least bit sticky in the chamber ( hard to open or close the bolt ) , I reduce the load and check for accuracy .
The cases should last indefinitely , since , after the first firing , they are only exposed to elastic stress levels .
Most cartridge cases have a limited life because of high stress levels and the plastic deformations of the brass during firing and resizing .
I have given up shooting maximum loads .
They burn out the barrels and do n't give me the reliable accuracy I require when the cross hair is on a critical target .
TURN TO THE SHOULDER ....
I have very carefully dressed the tool bit with a fine diamond hone so that the cut on the outside of the neck looks like polished brass .
I also made a small fillet radius ( approximately 0.010 " radius ) on the leading edge of the tool bit that matches the fillet at the neck to shoulder junction on new brass .
I turn the neck so that the bit cuts slightly into the shoulder approximately 0.002 " to 0.004 " .
I have had no necks separate from the shoulder from doing this and it decreases the chance of developing the " dreaded doughnut " ( a constriction of the neck ID at the neck to shoulder junction ) .
HOT TOOL ....
Here are some other points of interest on the Marquart neck turning tool .
Before I start neck turning or after a delay , I put the Marquart tool in my pocket for 5 or 10 minutes to warm it to body temperature .
Because of the differences in thermal expansion between the aluminum and steel of the turning tool , the cold tool will cut about 0.0001 inch deeper than when it is at body temperature !
Once warm , it stays warm from my hands and neck friction as I use it .
I use a mixture of Butter Flavored Crisco and Teflon Super Lube grease on the mandrel to prevent it from galling inside the case neck .
I have finally purchased tungsten carbide mandrels for .17 , .224 , and 6 mm and these really minimize galling of the brass .
You can minimize galling with the steel mandrels by polishing them with Flitz Metal Polish .
Once the brass does gall on a steel mandrel , you have to stop using it and clean it in Sweet 's 7.62 to get all the brass off and re-polish .
ANNEALING CASE NECKS ....
After 5 to 10 loadings for factory - chambered rifles and the associated neck sizing , the case necks are strain hardened due to the cold working of the brass .
Eventually , if you do n't anneal , you will start to get split necks .
Also , after wildcat case forming from one neck size to another , the necks and shoulders will be hardened .
The necks may be easily annealed to remove the high residual stresses and restore the desired low yield stress and desired annealed ( yield stress of 19,000 psi ) condition .
Here is how I anneal case necks .
I use a Propane Torch that I got at the hardware store .
I stand it up on a table and adjust the flame until the inner blue cone flame tip is about 1 inch long .
I make a case spinner out of a bamboo shish kebab stick .
I cut a piece about 4 inches long and whittle down about 3/8 inch of one end so it will easily fit in the flash hole and slip a small hex nut over the end for a stop .
I put some tape or glue behind the nut to hold it in place .
I fill a big bowl with cold water .
I do the annealing in a black dark place , like at night with the lights off or in a dark room with the door closed and no windows .
I put the stick through the flash hole and , holding the stick , spin the case mouth in the flame while holding the center of the neck right at the tip of the blue center cone of the flame ( at the location of the red dot in the picture ) .
When the neck just becomes a visible dull red ( about 750 °F ) , I drop the case in the bowl of water .
The neck and most of the shoulder are now stress free in an annealed condition and my case neck is in the " like new " condition .
Do not anneal the necks in a lighted room .
You wo n't be able to detect the dull red color and by the time you see red , the brass is already too hot .
This burns out the zinc , ruining the brass .
Caution :
Do not anneal any other part of the case .
An annealed case head does not have enough strength to support the high gas pressures and would probably rupture .
After annealing , I put the cases in a bowl and dry them with a hair drier .
Do n't get them so hot that you can't pick them up .
I blow dry them and wait 30 minutes or so and give them another blow dry .
If you are more patient , you can let them air dry overnight .
ANNEALING AND NECK TENSION ....
Uniform neck tension is another reason to anneal your case necks .
Each time you neck size and then the expander ball opens the neck up to the correct diameter , the brass ' yield strength increases .
It is called strain hardening .
As the yield stress increases , there is more spring - back ( to a smaller neck ID ) after the expander ball opens up the neck .
This effect increases the neck tension .
A new annealed neck will have less neck tension than a case that has been fired and neck sized a number of times .
Cartridge brass is 70 % copper and 30 % zinc and its yield stress and strength is increased by cold working .
Annealed cartridge brass has a yield stress of 19,000 psi .
¼ hard cartridge brass has a yield stress of 40,000 psi .
½ hard cartridge brass has a yield stress of 52,000 psi .
So the neck tension on a ¼ hard neck will be twice that of a freshly annealed neck .
If your rifle 's chamber neck clearance is large , then you could easily get to the ¼ hard condition in 5 or 6 reloading cycles .
It would take more cycles if your chamber neck is close fitting .
DANGEROUS TO ANNEAL THE CASE HEAD ....
I have done a Finite Element Analysis of the 243 Win brass case for the full hard condition and in the annealed condition , if someone were to inadvertently anneal the case head .
Here is a view of the brass deformations after a standard load has been fired that developed 55,000 psi .
The annealed case head would most likely rupture and vent gas into the action and destroy your rifle .
The calculation did n't allow for actual rupture , but allowed for the brass to stretch .
But , you can see the deformations just before the brass ruptures .
Notice how much the primer pocket expands .
The red dots show the original un - deformed outline .
A normal case head in the full hard condition is shown for comparison .
For more information on the FEA model of the 243 Win brass , primer , barrel , and bolt face , click here .

BRASS AND STEEL ARE DIFFERENT ....
To harden carbon steel , it is heated and then rapidly cooled or quenched .
This process locks the carbon in the crystal lattice and increases its strength by blocking crystal dislocations from easily advancing .
To anneal steel , it is heated and cooled slowly so the carbon atoms are stored " out of the way " , so to speak .
ONLY WORK WILL HARDEN BRASS ....
Cartridge brass is only hardened by cold working .
The crystal dislocations caused by the cold working lock the crystal lattice and make it harder and more difficult to form more dislocations thus increasing it strength .
When brass is heated , new crystals nucleate at the dislocations and the new crystals are small .
If the brass is quenched at this point , the brass retains the small crystals and is annealed with very few dislocations and is stress free .
This is the condition you want for your case necks .
If the brass is slowly cooled , the small crystals begin to coalesce and grow into larger crystals and the properties suffer because the large crystal boundaries are not strong .
Also stress corrosion cracking can more easily occur at the larger crystal boundaries .
SPLIT NECKS ....
Finally , the high stress with the hardened neck is what leads to split necks .
It is a process called stress corrosion cracking .
Increasing the stress level increases the initiation of cracks and crack propagation .
Split necks are not hazardous , but they are a problem that can be prevented by annealing .
It is easy to just buy some new brass when you start to see some cracked necks and do all the case prep on the new brass .
If you mix old and new brass , your neck tensions will be different and this is detrimental to good accuracy .
POLISH THE DIES ....
I polish the inside of my rifle reloading dies .
Most die manufacturers leave the die bores smooth but not polished .
A polished die will resize with much less axial force than one in the as - received condition .
I disassemble them and put a little Flitz on a cotton bore mop held in a drill motor and polish each one for 30 seconds or more at a 300 to 600 rpm speed .
Sometimes I have to wrap a paper towel around the swab to get a good fit .
Then I clean all the polish out with hot water and dry with a paper towel wrapped around a clean cotton swab .
The polishing process does not remove a measurable amount of material , but results in smoother operation , minimizes the scratching or scoring of the brass , and minimizes crumpling problems when I use them while forming wildcat brass .
Flitz is slightly more aggressive than JB .
I took a piece of mild steel with a reasonably smooth finish and polished it with Flitz and JB .
The left end was polished for about 2 minutes at 500 rpm with Flitz and the right end for about 2 minutes with JB .
There is no detectable decrease in the diameter on either end measured with my high - precision Mitutoyo Micrometer .
It was a very easy test .
Try it for yourself .
WHY POLISHED DIES HELP ....
When you are resizing brass , there are combined forces involved .
In necking down a diameter , there is a radial force moving the metal toward the center and an axial force , produced by friction , that tends to shorten the column length .
For larger changes in diameter , the radial force increases .
Since the axial force is equal to the friction coefficient times the radial force , a corresponding larger axial force is produced .
High axial forces can crumple the brass when its critical buckling load is exceeded .
How do you minimize the axial force ?
You can reduce the axial force by reducing the radial force when the reduction in diameter is taken in smaller steps .
But this takes a series of separate dies and costs more .
If you have only a few dies at your disposal , you can also reduce the axial force by reducing the friction coefficient .
The inside of the die can be polished with a metal polish like Flitz and used in conjunction with a thin film of lubricant .
This will greatly reduce the axial forces and minimize possibility of buckled cases .
NECK SIZING ....
I achieve better accuracy and case life by only neck sizing my brass instead of full length resizing for each reload .
I usually buy the 3 die sets that have a Full Length , Neck Size , and Seating die .
Fire - forming your brass customizes it for your rifle .
When you fire a round in your rifle , the brass expands to fit your chamber .
Then when the pressure is relieved , it springs back elastically a small amount and is then customized to fit your chamber .
From then on , if you only neck size , about 3 / 4 or so of the neck , the reloads will fit your chamber much better than new brass .
Usually 3/4's or so of the neck gripping the bullet is sufficient to hold the bullet in place , especially if you shoot varmints and load one round at a time .
If you do n't have the neck sizing die , you can do almost the same thing with your full length die .
Set the die so only about 1 /2 of the neck is resized .
Because of the tapered case , very little full length resizing will occur .
Jim Herbold had a good idea .
Leave your Full Length die set for full length sizing and use the 357 Magnum to .38 Special spacer ring to back off the die for neck sizing .
One disadvantage is when you only neck size , you cannot mix the ammo between rifles of the same caliber .
Also , for your hunting ammo , you should safely , try each round in your rifle to make sure the bolt closes easily on it .
For big game or dangerous game it may be safer to take the reduced accuracy and full length resize all your brass .
COMPETITION SEATING DIE ....
If you want a bullet seating die designed for straightness , the Redding Competition Seating Die is the way to go .
This seating die has an internal cylinder that the case fits into with the bullet merely sitting on top of the case mouth .
Then while you seat the bullet , the cylinder completely supports the case and holds the bullet in line as the seating plunger seats the bullet .
The bullet is held straight , starts straight , and is seated straight .
The tolerances on these dies are very closely held .
The sliding cylinder fits the die so well , that if you tighten the set screw a little too hard on the locking ring , the cylinder will bind .
I am partial to Redding dies for their precision and finely machined surfaces .
Using these seating dies , the bullet run -out will be held to a minimum .
The die also has a micrometer thimble on top so you can adjust the Over All Length ( OAL ) to within 0.001 inch .
PRIMER TO USE ....
All primers are about the same except when loading the 17 calibers .
There appears to be a very high pressure spike inside the primer for the three 17 calibers I reload .
I have had problems and others have had similar problems with CCI and Winchester primers .
I now use only Rem 7-½ Benchrest primers .
These primers have the strongest primer cups that I have used and do not easily crater or worse , punch through .
With the 17 Rem and the 17 Mach IV , I have had the Winchester primers either crater around the firing pin or leak at the outer edge through a tiny hole .
Once this happens , it erodes a depression on the bolt face and then the problem only gets worse .
I suggest use of only Rem 7-½
Benchrest primers when reloading for the 17's .
See James Calhoon info on primers .
POLISHING MY CHAMBERS ....
When I got my 223 Ackley Improved Virgin Valley ( no longer in business ) barrel , it had a very rough chamber .
The fired brass had marks I could see where it had been gripped by the chamber and then slid backwards a tiny bit until stopped by the bolt face .
It looked almost sandblasted .
There were protruding primers on some of the fired rounds .
When the firing pin hits the primer , it pushes the primer and the new case forward in the chamber .
When ignition occurs , the pressure expands the walls of the brass .
The rough chamber , with its high friction , grabs the case at the forward position and the gas pressure first pushes the primer back against the bolt face .
As the pressure builds , the brass case is stretched until the case head is pushed back against the bolt or the case supports the total load .
If the case head is pushed against the bolt face , it would produce a flat primer , but flush .
If the load is light , the case does not stretch so much and leaves a gap between the case head and the bolt face , but the primer is still against the bolt face .
This produces the protruding primers .
CONTROVERSY OR GOOD ENGINEERING ....
Now some controversy .
I polish my chambers with Flitz .
I do n't want excessive friction between the brass and the chamber wall .
Some are going to argue with this , but I have thought long about this .
I have tried it and it works and is good engineering .
I polished the chamber in my new Virgin Valley ( no longer in business ) barrel and it has made quite an improvement .
With a polished chamber , the friction coefficient is much less between the brass and the polished stainless steel chamber .
The pressure is able to force the case head against the bolt face before the case walls grab the chamber .
First , this lets the primer ( on the first shot with new brass ) protrude , but be immediately reseated in the primer pocket as the case head is pushed back .
The brass does not stretch nearly as much as it would in a rough chamber .
Now some will say that a polished chamber will increase the force of the bolt face ( frame face on the Encore ) and that is bad .
WRONG !
That is faulty logic .
The force is increased on the bolt face , but that is where it belongs .
As all modern rifles , the barrel and frame of the Encore are designed for strength .
They are strong enough to support large diameter Magnum - belted calibers .
The force from the much smaller area of the .223 case head is easily supported by the frame face .
The brass case is designed to act as a bladder and encase the gas pressure .
Trying to use the weaker brass to lighten the load on the action and bolt face of a rifle by having the brass grip the chamber is analogous to using a car 's radiator to protect the bumper in a front - end collision .
A polished chamber minimizes case stretching , reduces case head separation , and increases case life .
More information on chamber finish here .
To polish a chamber , I put Flitz on a cotton bore mop and a piece of cleaning rod long enough to be held in a drill motor .
I polish for about 30 seconds or more at a 300 to 600 rpm speed .
Sometimes I have to wrap a paper towel around the swab and put Flitz on it to get a good fit .
Be sure that the end of the bore mop 's metal part is much smaller than the bore and covered so it will not damage the rifling in front of the chamber .
FORMING 17 ACKLEY HORNET BRASS ....
The 17 Ackley Hornet is formed from 22 Hornet brass .
The first thing I do is remove the flash hole burr with my 22 - caliber flash hole tool .
See the section on " Flash Hole " .
This only needs to be done once .
It is not possible to do it with a 22 - caliber tool after the neck diameter is reduced .
Next , I uniform the primer pocket and then I chamfer the neck ID and OD with a very light cut to remove the rolled over edge caused by the polishing process when the brass was manufactured .
I then neck turn the brass and , since my chamber has a " standard neck diameter " , I use the procedure described for " Factory chambers " to set the depth of cut .
I neck turn nearly all the way to the shoulder on the 22 Hornet brass .
The end of the cut will land halfway up the shoulder on the finished brass .
This gives a uniform wall thickness at the junction of the neck and shoulder .
I prefer Winchester brass because it has thicker necks than Remington brass and will give a closer fitting neck on the finished brass .
NOTE : It is important to polish the inside of all the forming dies with Flitz Metal Polish or equivalent .
Rough dies will often crumple or fold the brass , where smooth dies will not .
The Flitz Metal Polish will not measurably change the dimensions of the dies .
DON'T FIRE FORM BRASS WITH A MUZZLE BRAKE ....
Brady S. Clinger writes :
The one thing you never want to do is to fire form a case with Bullseye , a cloth wad AND a muzzle break .
I was fire forming some 7x57 Ackley Improved cases and blew out the end of the muzzle brake .
As soon as the cloth leaves the barrel it opens up and hits the end of the muzzle break with tremendous force .
After I removed the muzzle break the fire forming worked great .
NECK SIZING DOWN IN SMALL STEPS ....
The next operation is to spray a light coat of RCBS Case Slick spray lube on my case lube pad and rub it in and let it dry for a few minutes .
I roll the cases on the pad to lightly lube them .
Too much lube causes problems .
Then I run the cases through the Redding 17 Ackley Hornet Form die and that decreases the neck diameter to about 0.220 inch .
Next I run the cases through the 17 Ackley Hornet Trim die and that reduces the necks down to about 0.197 inch .
For this process , you will need an extended shell holder , because the die is so short .
You can skip the trim die , but if you have it available , it is better to reduce the neck diameter in as small as possible steps .
I next anneal the necks with the process described on this page .
See " Annealing Necks " .
The final forming I perform with the Full Length 17 Ackley Hornet die .
I remove the expander ball and run the cases through the FL die .
The brass can now be chambered for fire - forming , but NOT with a bullet .

FIRE FORMING WITHOUT A BULLET ....
I prime the cases with any old odd lot of primers I have around the place and load 6 gr. of Bullseye with a tiny piece of paper towel or cotton wad stuffed in the end of the case to keep the powder from falling out .
DO NOT load a bullet !
I go outside where the noise wo n't bother anyone and I fire - form the cases .
The 6 gr. of Bullseye will form the cases about 95 % and not split any shoulders .
The pressure produced by Bullseye with no bullet back - pressure is remarkable .
It is truly a " fast " and energetic powder !
NECK SIZING WITH A FL DIE ....
I do n’t have a neck sizing die in 17 Ackley Hornet , so I set up the Full Length die so that it sizes about ½ of the neck .
I neck size the cases and load about a case full of VihtaVuori Oy N - 133 ( approx . 12.5 gr. ) and the 20 gr. Berger MEF Moly Coated bullets and go squirrel hunting .
I recommend using Rem 7 -½ primers .
They have a stronger cup than the other brands .
You wo n't get your best accuracy with this first loading but it will still be very good .
After firing , the cases will be fully formed and the last process is to trim the case length .
I do n't trim off any more than necessary to clean up the neck ends all the way around .
Then I remove the burr with the ID and OD chamfer tool followed by the steel wool smoothing .
See " Neck Chamfering Tool " .
That ’s it .
The brass is finished and ready for reloading and shooting .
With a case full of N - 133 ( approx . 12.5 gr. ) , the pressures are mild in my rifle and it burns extremely clean .
I get about 3300 fps with the 20 gr. Berger bullets .
I lightly tap the side of the case with a screwdriver while it is still under the powder measure to settle the powder in the case .
Be sure and start with a lighter load and work up , looking for excessive pressure signs in your rifle .
I am up to 20 + reloads on my brass and they are still going strong .
If you load the 25 gr. bullets , you will have to back off on the load and work up to a good accurate load .
The 25 gr. bullets perform better for me in the 17 Mach IV , but I still like the same 20 gr. Berger MEF in the 17 Mach IV too .
One of these days , I will include a picture of the 17 Mach IV at each step in the forming process .
I have found that a better load , for my 17 Ackley Hornet rifle , is the 20 gr V - Max bullet and about 12 gr of AA - 1680 .
Here are three groups shot with the 17 Ackley Hornet with the 20 gr. Berger MEF
Moly bullets using the new Nikon scope .
They are not benchrest quality , but will stay on a ground squirrel out to 200 yards if the wind is mild .
The outside of the square aimpoint is 1 inch on a side .
Here is a picture of the Contender Carbine in 17 Ackley Hornet , my binoculars , my Bi-Fur - Pod and a couple of nice ground squirrels .
FORMING 17 MACH IV BRASS ....
I have formed hundreds 17 Mach IV brass from 223 military brass .
The advantage is that the necks are thick and can be neck turned to better fit your chamber and the necks can be left longer than one can achive with 221 Rem brass .
Here are the steps I have written down in my reloading manual .
The inside of all the dies were polished with Flitz .
Before I polished my dies , I had some crumpled cases .
The cases were very lightly lubed with the RCBS lube and then lightly wiped clean with a towel .
Form with a .222 Rem trim die Form with a .221 Rem trim die Full length size with a .221 Rem FL die with the expander ball assembly removed Flash hole de-burred while it is still 22 dia neck diameter Back off the .221 Rem trim and saw off the excess neck leaving it about 75 mils too long Reduce the neck diameter with the .17 Mach IV form 1 ( double end die ) die ( just reduces the neck )
Reduce the neck diameter with the .17 Mach IV form 2 end of the die Form with the .
17 Mach IV trim die Anneal necks Form with the 17 Mach IV FL die without expander plug Expand the neck with the Sinclair expander plug ( for neck turning ) Neck turn Trim the length to about 0.005 " clearance on the chamber length of neck Very lightly chamfer the inside and outside of the neck Smooth the neck 's mouth with the steel wool spinner Load with your fire forming load
Go out and do some ground squirrel or ground hog abatement work Trim to your desired length ( I like about 0.010 " of clearance )
This might seem a bit complicated , but it made some very good 17 Mach IV brass .
HOW NORM FORMS 17 MACH IV BRASS .... Forming 17 Mach IV brass from 223 Rem brass .
Does that make me an expert , not even close , but here 's how I 've done it and mine are really nice and shoot well too .
The last batch which was 400 pieces came out excellent , in my opinion , here 's exactly what I did .
I started with once fired Winchester brass .
Tumble cleaned them very well
Neck sized to decap and make the necks perfectly round
I used Imperial wax for all sizing , VERY sparingly .
Ran them through a set of Redding 223 to 221 dies but left them full length
Ran them through a Redding 17M4 form die
Cut them off to 0.010 " LONGER than my chamber ( you need to know your chamber 's length for this )
Full length sized cases
Turned neck diameter to 0.001 " clearance ( you need to know your chamber 's neck diameter for this )
Annealed all case necks and shoulders
Neck sized cases
Trimmed to 0.005 " UNDER for over all length
Loaded and shot
Cleaned and neck sized
Turned the necks once again with the original setting just to clean them up
Was it a lot of work ?
Yep but I 'll do it again when I need brass .
That 's why I made a huge amount at one time .
I will add this , I 've not loaded and shot all 400 of the last batch yet , just the first 100 .
They 're really nice though and I have brass that is custom fitted to my chamber , I can seat 20 grain bullets at .005 away from the lands and have lots of bullet in the neck for good , consistent tension .

ENCORE 22-250 Imp/40 º RIFLE ....
Way back in September 1997 , I ordered a 22 - 250 Imp/ 40 º
Match barrel for my Encore from Bullberry .
It was to be 25 - 3/ 8 inch long full bull stainless steel with an integral muzzle brake .
It arrived and everything was as ordered except it was NOT a Match neck chamber .
The neck was supposed to be 0.243 inch dia and the chamber measures 0.2556 by my estimations .
Well , I had waited so long , I decided to keep it and make the brass fit the chamber .
Here is the saga :
The machine work on the barrel is excellent !
The chamber is very smooth and the barrel fits my Encore frame perfectly .
The Epoxy finished forearm and buttstock out of " utility wood " are beautiful .
Too beautiful to paint camo !!
I have developed a procedure to make the brass for it that are full length and " fitted - neck " .
It is too high a quality piece of gear to send back and go back into the waiting pattern for .
I fire formed about 35 brass today .
When I drove into the field where I could use ground squirrels for fire forming , I saw a coyote right in the middle of a bunch of cows .
I did n't trust the 22 -250 Imp / 40 º yet and got out the trusty old Sako 243 and popped him at about 150 yards .
The cows charged the coyote and I had him down , but he was not dead yet .
I could n't shoot again with the cows right there mauling him .
I walked over and finished him off with the 22 -250 I mp/40 º .
By the way , nowhere on my barrel or the dies is the word Ackley printed , so I do n't know if it is the Ackley Improved , but I suspect it is very close to those dimensions .
There are about 30 ground squirrels that would have rather I sent the barrel back .
It was shooting off a tad , but I could see the impact point and quickly got it right on with a few scope adjustments .
Seeing the impact is a distinct advantage of the muzzle brake reducing recoil .
By the way , I did like the BSA 6 x - 24 x by 44 mm scope at first !!
Note : I have since replaced the original BSA scope with a Leupold 6.5x20 VariX III .
The BSA would not maintain zero from trip to trip .
There is an unexpected problem with watching my point of impact .
The recoil is extremely low due to the muzzle brake , but the pressure wave hits my face and makes me blink just at the critical moment !!
I had n't thought of the blink effect .
This is my first muzzle brake .
I concentrated better on the target and was able to overcome the blinking reflex after a while .
All in all without having it on paper yet , the rifle works very well .
It sure feels powerful compared to the 223's or 17 Mach IV's !
I have since gotten used to the pressure wave and do not blink anymore .
It only took a few times out with the 22 -250 Imp / 40 º to overcome the blinking .
NOT FOR EVERYONE ....
This is only for people who have too much time on their hands and like to tinker and fuss with their reloading .
Here is my procedure for forming the 22 -250 Imp/ 40 º " fitted - neck " brass .
It is a bit long - winded , but it will be interesting if you are into this sort of stuff .
FORMING 22-250 Imp/40 º BRASS ....
The rifle chamber neck was measured on a fire - formed 22 - 250 brass .
The case neck measures 0.2543 inch neck .
That is the spring - back position .
The neck dimensions in the chamber must be about 0.0013 inch larger than that .
My estimate of the chamber neck diameter is 0.2556 inch .
The measured chamber length is 1.9475 inch as new and unfired .
After about 35 rounds it measures 1.9480 inch with the plug gauge from Sinclair .
These lengths are for my chamber .
Your chamber will be different and you should have no less than about 0.008 inch clearance for safety reasons .
THE BRASS .... I start with 243 Win brass ( Winchester brand ) so that I can get thicker and longer necks than I could with standard 22 - 250 brass .
THE TOOLS ....
Below is the list of tools .
NOTE : It is important to polish the inside of the three dies listed below with Flitz Metal Polish or equivalent .
Rough dies will often crumple or fold the brass , where smooth dies will not .
The Flitz Metal Polish will not measurably change the dimensions of the dies .
22-250 Imp/40 º Trim Die
22-250 Standard Trim Die
Anneal Equipment
Sinclair Neck Turn Double End Expander .224 Caliber
Carbide Expander Ball .224
Case Trimmer
22-250 Imp/40 º Full Length Die with a Carbide Expander Ball
Marquart Neck Turning Tool
Neck Mouth Chamfer Tool
Steel Wool Spinner
THE LUBE .... I use the RCBS CASE SLICK spray lube .
I spray it on the lube pad and rub it in .
I wait about 10 min for the solvent to evaporate .
I roll the cases on the pad and wipe the neck and shoulder area with my fingers .
Too much lube here and the neck or shoulder will develop grease grooves or dents .
BATCH OPERATION ....
Do each of the following operations ( on the complete batch of cases ) in the order shown below :
Operation 1 . Bump back the shoulder and resize the neck to 22 cal with the 22 -250 Imp / 40 º trim die .
Bump it back enough to just start a noticeable bulge at the junction of the shoulder and the case cylinder .
Do n’t worry about the slight bulge ; it will straighten out on the next operation .
Operation 2 .
Use the 22-250 standard trim die and screw it down to allow about 0.100 inch of clearance between the die and the shell holder .
Note : I crumpled a number of cases trying to go all the way in one operation .
Operation 3 . Use the same 22 - 250 standard trim die and have it just touch the shell holder .
Be sure and wipe the shoulder free of grease to prevent grease grooves .
Hit this operation fast with the press .
I had to polish the die ID with Flitz so this operation would not cause folding in the shoulder region .
Operation 4 . Anneal the neck by holding the point of the 1 inch long center blue cone of the flame right at the junction of the shoulder and the case body .
When the neck just begins to show red in a dark room , drop it into cold water .
See the Annealing Procedure for more information on annealing .
Operation 5 . Open the neck up with first the Sinclair Neck Turning double end expander die .
Then follow with the carbide expander ball for a second opening operation .
Operation 6 . Length trim to 1.970 inch the lathe .
I Have to take off about 0.1 inch .
The lathe makes it easy .
Use the collet to hold the brass centered and the same distance on a shoulder for each piece of brass .
There is a picture of this on the Mini Lathe Page , but any case trimmer will work .
Operation 7 . Lightly chamfer the neck ID and OD and run through the 22 -250 Imp / 40 º full length die .
Use the carbide expander ball .
It will cause a slight bulge at the shoulder that decreases the amount of neck shorting on fire forming .
Operation 8 . Neck turn ( using the Marquart tool ) to 0.2548 inch OD using the carbide mandrel .
Measure without the mandrel in place .
Neck turn all the way to the junction with the shoulder .
Operation 9 . Length trim to 1.948 inch with the hand tool .
Operation 10 .
Chamfer ID and OD with the chamfer tool .
Then use the Steel Wool Spinner to smooth the neck ID and OD chamfer .
Operation 11 . Load 40 gr. Nosler BT 's Moly coated with 33 gr. H322 for a fire - forming load .
With the muzzle break it really works well on ground squirrels and it FEELS POWERFUL compared to the 17 Mach IV !!
It also exhibits G.S. loft !
Operation 12 .
After fire forming , I open necks with the carbide expander - ball , trim the lengths to 1.940 inch and chamfer ID and OD , and do the Steel Wool Smoothing process .
After firing , the lengths range from 1.945 inch to ~ 1.942 inch .
This will give a 0.008 inch gap the bullet must jump across .
Finally , I uniform the primer pocket and de-burr the flash hole and that is it !
The brass is done .
More to follow as I find out more about the brass .
Note , these are " fitted - neck " cases and do not need to be resized or neck sized as long as reasonable loads are used .
Merely de-prime , clean the primer pocket and re-prime .
Then clean the neck ID and charge with powder and seat the bullet .
Making this type of brass is difficult , but reloading is a snap !!
I checked a load of 38 gr. Varget and 40 gr. Nosler Ballistic
Tip and no pressure signs .
Got one ground squirrel at an estimated range of 320 yards .
I need one of the range finders to keep me more honest ! ;-)
FAVORITE POWDERS ....
I do n't want to recommend any specific loads .
I believe you will achieve better reloads , in your rifle , by starting with the minimum charge and working up to an accurate load .
I do have some favorite powders that have worked very well for me in several different rifle calibers and here is my list :
17 Ackley Hornet .. Accurate AA1680 and VihtaVuori Oy N - 133
17 Mach IV ........
Accurate 2015 BR and Hodgdon H322
22 K-Hornet .......
Hodgdon H110
221 Rem Fireball ..
Accurate AA1680
223 Rem ........... Hodgdon H322 and Winchester W748
223 Ackley Imp .... Hodgdon H322
22-250 Ackley Imp. Hodgdon Varget
243 Win ........... Hodgdon H414 and H4831
7 mm Rem Mag ......
Hodgdon H4831
SOME OF THE CALIBERS I RELOAD ....
Here is a picture of some of the calibers that I reload .
It pretty well covers the spectrum of small varmint calibers .
My first 17 caliber was a Rem 700 BDL in 17 Rem and it was so much fun to work with , that I had to have the 17 Ackley Hornet and the 17 Mach IV .
The workhorse caliber is the 223 Rem and it can be improved some by going to the 23/40 with a straight case and 40° shoulder .
The 22 -250 Imp/40° easily gets the velocities up to the 4000 fps range .
My 243 Ackley Improved is on a Mauser action that is nearly 40 + years old .
It shoots very well , but most of the time it is just too much for ground squirrels .
Then again , I have used the 7 mm Rem Magnum on ground squirrels a few times just for effect !
17 Ackley Hornet -- 20 gr. Berger MEF Moly
17 Mach IV -- 20 gr. Berger Moly
17 Rem -- 25 gr. Hornady
22 K- Hornet -- 40 gr. Nosler Ballistic Tip
223 Rem -- 33 gr. Hornady V - Max Moly
23/40 -- 40 gr. Nosler Ballistic Tip Moly
22-250 Imp/40° -- 40 gr. Nosler Ballistic Tip Moly
243 Win -- 95 gr. Nosler Ballistic Tip Moly
243 Ackley Improved -- 60 gr. Sierra HP
7 mm Rem Mag -- 150 gr. Nosler Ballistic Tip
Notice that I only neck size about ½ of the neck length on the first five .
I use single shots and this is sufficient neck sizing to hold the bullet in place for single loading .
The 23/40 , 22-250 Imp/40° , and 243 Win are fitted necks and no neck sizing is required .
The last two are for factory chambers and require neck sizing .
You can still see the evidence of the neck anneal on the middle four .
It is also obvious that I do n’t polish my brass in a tumbler .
COMPRESSED LOAD--MAYBE NOT ....
If you are using one of the slower burning powders that fills the case and end up with a compressed load that shoots the best , it might not really be a compressed load .
Here is a trick to get two pounds into a one pound bag .
Do n't use a loading block when you charge the cases with powder .
Merely hold the case in your fingers under the powder measure .
After throwing the charge , continue to hold the brass with the neck still in the drop tube and tap the side of the brass lightly with the shaft of a small screwdriver eight to ten times .
You will find that the tapping will settle the powder an 1/8 inch or more and maybe enough so it wo n't be a compressed load after all .
It works much better than the long drop tubes , but takes a little extra time .
Try the experiment below .
DO THIS EXPERIMENT ....
To see how the tapping technique can compact powder , do this simple experiment .
Take a case and set it up in a bowl to collect the excess power .
Then place a funnel over the case mouth and with a spoon fill the case , until it is over full , with the powder you want to test .
Then lift off the funnel and wipe across the top of the neck to remove the heaped up powder .
Put the funnel back on the case mouth and pick up the case and funnel and lightly tap the side of the case eight to ten times with the screwdriver shaft .
Remove the funnel and see how far down the powder has settled .
MINI LATHE ....
I have recently purchased a Mini Lathe for my reloading bench .
It has a 7 inch swing and is 10 inch between centers and only takes up 24 inches of space on the reloading bench .
It is small , but has a 0.813 inch hole in the headstock and will do some barrel work on smaller diameter barrels .
Click here for more information on the Mini Lathe , including the tooling and pictures .
Case Head Expansion vs Peak Chamber Pressure
CASE HEAD EXPANSION ....
Some reloaders measure the expansion of the unsupported area of the case head with a micrometer .
This allows them to determine the maximum load for a particular bullet and powder combination in their rifle .
I used the Model 7 action with the 243 Win caliber brass to calculate case head expansion for increases in peak chamber pressure .
LS - DYNA 3D model of the Remington Model 7 action and the 243 Winchester caliber .
NODES SELECTED TO PLOT ....
To determine the amount of permanent case head expansion , node 21905 was selected and the increase in diameter at this location is plotted .
The plots show the case head expansion during firing and finally , the permanent increase in diameter after firing .
The location at node 20260 typically has about 0.0005 " less expansion .
CHANGE IN DIAMETER ....
This plot shows the case head diameter increase as the pressure rises and then the spring back as the pressure falls off to zero .
The permanent diameter increase is at the final time when the pressure is zero and the contact surfaces are removed to simulate a free standing piece of brass .
The conditions of this series of calculations were as follows :
Peak chamber pressures ranging from 35,000 to 65,000 psi as indicated
Crocus Cloth chamber finish with a friction coefficient of u=0.27 ( This number if from the friction tests that Dick Hatfield ran ) .
243 Winchester brass ( only difference ) .
Extra Hard Brass at Case Head .
Half Hard Brass forward to the shoulder .
Annealed Brass for the neck and shoulder .
Stainless steel 416 for the barrel
Action is a Remington Model 7 .
Same bolt lug configuration as a Remington Model 700 .
Bolt and Action 4140 steel
Approximately 0.003 " initial clearance between the bolt face and brass head to simulate new brass that has not been fire formed .
MORE DETAILS ....
See the complete Remington Model 7 analysis here .
ENGINEERING ....
Here is an example 3D Finite Element Analysis result of a Stolle Panda benchrest rifle action and bolt using John Hallquist 's NIKE3D Finite Element Code .
The stress levels for the 6 - PPC caliber bolt face are displayed ( red is the highest stress level ) .
There are more details on my Engineering Page and examples of other calculations .
MY DREAM RIFLE ....
This is my Stolle Panda in 23/40 built by Kelbly .
It is an extremely well built , no compromise , rifle with its fluted bolt , fluted stainless steel barrel plus the beautifully finished benchrest thumbhole stock .
The machine work , fit and finish are perfect .
It is built like a fine Swiss watch and is as smooth as silk .
It just " feels good " to open and close the bolt .
The trigger is a Jewell Trigger at about 4 ounces .
I increased the resolution on the picture so you can better appreciate these fine qualities and dream .
Note : NO camo paint here !!!
NEW SCOPE ....
I had just mounted one of the new Sightron 4- 16x42 Stainless Steel scopes on the rifle and the scope seems to also work very well after one day of testing .
The Sightron scope has a 1/2 - minute dot reticule with very fine crosshairs and 1/8 - minute click adjustments .
I generated the target with AutoSketch .
It works better with the dot reticule than the standard benchrest targets .
It is easier for me to center the dot in the white circle than in a white square .
The actual size of the square is 1 inch on a side .
GROUP IN LOW 3'S ....
Here is a 100 - yard 5 shot group using bullets sprayed with the " Ms Moly " Molybdenum Disulfide coating .
The load for the 23/40 ( a straight - cased 223 with a 40° shoulder ) was the 40 gr. Nosler Ballistic
Tip bullets and my standard load of 25.3 gr. of H322 , giving a velocity of approximately 3500 fps .
The group , in the low 3's , is not exceptional , but not bad either .
It was fired after about 40 rounds through the barrel , all with Moly - coated bullets and no cleaning .
This accuracy level is good enough for most ground squirrel shooting .
I later fired another 30 Moly - coated rounds through the barrel at ground squirrels .
When I cleaned it , there was no evidence of copper in the barrel after 70 rounds .
So far , it looks like the " Ms Moly " works very well .
HOW TO APPLY Ms MOLY ....
The spray - on Ms Moly is probably not as good as the Moly coating applied by the complicated Neco technique .
But , it works very well in spite of the ease of application .
I have used it on about 1000 bullets so far and it has essentially stopped copper fouling .
I found that it sticks best to jacked bullets if I preheat them with a hair drier first .
So you wo n't blow the bullets over , when you first direct it toward the bullets , put your hand over the intake of the hair drier to reduce the flow .
Once you are directly over them and blowing downward , you can remove your hand and allow the full flow and the bullets will still stand up .
After about 1.5 minutes of heating I immediately spray them from four sides .
Then another two minutes with the hair drier .
I let them set for about 20 minutes and finally put them back in the boxes .
The coating is still soft for about a day .
It is best if you wait a day or so before you load them .
HOW TO GET Ms MOLY ....
A number of people have asked me where you get Ms Moly .
The phone number is 800-264-4140 .
For about $ 30 you get two 16 - ounce spray cans and two foam templates to help you stand up the bullets for spraying .
MIDWAY MOLY .... I got the Midway Moly kit with the 1292 Tumbler , two extra bowls and 8 ounces of Moly powder .
I put it on the shelf because I had plenty of coated bullets that Dick was so gracious to process for me with his Neco kit .
Since I was running low on coated bullets , I got the Midway kit out and first checked to find out if the tumbler was not subject to the recall for overheating and it was the new model .
I got two plastic vitamin pill bottles ( 250 ml size with plastic lids ) and put about 350 each of the 40 gr.
Nosler BT bullets in each bottle .
I used two pill bottles so that the bowl would be somewhat balanced .
I added a heaping screwdriver load ( approximately 1/ 4 of a teaspoon ) of Moly to each pill bottle .
I put the tumbler in the other room and fired it up .
After 90 minutes , I shut it off and opened one of the pill bottles .
The bullets were very well coated .
I poured out the bullets on a shop rag and rubbed most of the extra Moly powder off and put the bullets back in the boxes .
I do n't know how it could be any easier to do and it works very well .
I used no steel balls and did n't clean the bullets .
I just put the pill bottles in the tumbler bowl without any medium .
Next time I will use some medium in the bowl because I could see wear spots on the bowl caused by the bottles .
I checked a number of the bullets and I can't wipe off the Moly coating .
A STUPID CORROSION TEST ....
A few months ago , I got castigated for doing a " stupid test " on the corrosion of steel by Moly and water .
I still have the info and will post it here .
You do n't have to believe it or agree with me but , if you are interested , you can easily repeat the test to see if you get the same results .
MOLY / WATER AND CORROSION ....
I have performed a Moly / Water Slurry corrosion test on one of my Contender carbine barrels .
The picture shows the etched spot on the underside of the barrel just forward of the forearm hanger .
I sanded the bluing off of the area and placed the mixture on the spot and waited 1 day .
The surface was etched and is rough to the touch .
When I get a chance , I will try to measure the surface height with a dial indicator .
I am not sure if I have the accuracy with my cheap indicator to do the job .
You can test any barrel that you might be concerned about to see if there could be a problem .
I would suggest that if you shoot Moly bullets in a regular Chrome - Moly ( 4140 ) steel barrel in wet weather , that you clean and oil the barrel the first chance you get .
A similar test on my Encore 22 - 250 Imp/40° stainless steel barrel showed no corrosion attack at all .
CONDENSED MOISTURE ....
I did another test to simulate a cold rifle being carried into a warm room .
I took my piece of mild steel and machined a new surface and polished it .
Then I put some powdered Moly on a piece of paper and rubbed the steel on the Moly powder until it was well coated .
I took a cloth and wiped vigorously all the Moly off I could , but it was still well coated and shiny Moly .
I left the piece of steel for one week and it stayed as shiny Moly as at first .
No corrosion or attack of any kind .
Next , I put the piece of steel in the freezer for 30 minute and than took it out and let it set in open air .
A thin layer of moisture condensed on the steel .
Two hours later it was etched where the Moly shiny surface was and also rust was present .
( On earlier tests with the Moly / water slurry , there was NO rust .
I suspect that there was sulfuric acid present that dissolved the iron oxide to form iron sulfate and no brown rust was evident at all . )
So the condensed moisture on the Moly caused both etching and then it proceeded to rust the steel .
There was not enough sulfuric acid IMHO to convert the rust to iron sulfate .
( This is speculation . )
Another very important part of the condensed moisture test was that the areas not coated by the Moly showed no rust or any other corrosion attack by the thin layer of moisture .
Remember , that if you have stainless steel barrels , there are none of these corrosion problems .
In my book , it sure makes me want to buy only stainless steel barrels from now on , not only because they last longer , but because of their resistance to corrosion .
KROIL PROTECTS THE STEEL .... I performed another test .
I used the same piece of mild steel and machined a fresh surface .
I rubbed in the Moly and after a few hours , rubbed it with a cloth wetted with Kroil to simulate a cleaning patch going through the barrel .
I rubbed it dry with a second cloth .
I let this set for another few hours and then I put the steel in the freezer for 30 minutes and removed it to the room .
Moisture condensed on the surface .
The Kroil - treated Moly surface did NOT rust or etch .
It appears that the Kroil prevents the condensed moisture from attacking the Moly / steel surface .
This needs more testing , but it appears that cleaning a blued steel barrel with patch wet with Kroil would protect the barrel in cold or wet weather from the Moly / Water corrosion problems .
There are probably other oils and cleaning agents that would also work as well as Kroil , but I had it available for testing .
Also , the ammonia and the basic nature of Sweet 's 7.62 would probably neutralize any acid effects of the Moly / Water combination .
FIVE POINTS TO CONSIDER ....
Here are the five points that can be made about this set of crude experiments :
Point 1 . Stainless steel ( 416 ) is not attacked , corroded , or etched with a mixture of Moly and tap water applied directly to an unprotected surface in 24 hours .
Point 2 .
If one has a stainless steel barrel and shoots
Moly - coated bullets and shoots in wet or cold weather , there is probably not a corrosion concern with that barrel even though small amounts of water could come in contact with the Moly in the barrel .
Point 3 . Chrome - Moly ( 4140 ) steel is attacked and etched with a mixture of Moly and tap water in as little time as one day and probably less .
The etched surface is rough to the touch and is not a surface I would want in the bore of any of my rifle barrels .
Point 4 .
If one has a Chrome - Moly ( 4140 ) steel barrel and shoots
Moly - coated bullets and shoots in cold or wet weather , there could be a problem with corrosion if moisture condenses on the Moly surface .
If you have a concern , you can easily test your own barrel steel on a small area somewhere hidden on the bottom side to see if there is actually a corrosion problem .
Point 5 .
If you are shooting a Chrome - Moly ( 4140 ) steel barrel and Moly - coated bullets in cold and / or wet weather , you should clean and oil the barrel right after you return from the range .
I SHOOT MOLY - COATED BULLETS ....
I shoot Moly - coated bullets and will continue to do so .
They are great and shoot very well without cleaning after a few shots .
This is very important in the small calibers like the 17's .
I used to have to clean to preserve accuracy after 20 or so rounds , but can now , in most cases , shoot five times that many rounds before a noticeable reduction in accuracy occurs .
I sure am going to clean and oil my blued steel barrel after shooting Moly bullets in wet or cold weather .
I do n't own any Moly stock and am not being paid by any Moly company , nor have I been given any free samples .
I hope I am not frightening anyone into not using Moly - coated bullets .
They work very well for me and I will continue to use them .
If I help prevent someone from ruining a barrel by neglecting it after a wet weather hunt , then that is a plus .
That 's my payoff .

The serious benchrest shooter and varmint hunter knows that a clean barrel is essential to achieving both precision and accuracy .
The benchrest shooter will often vigorously scrub a barrel with all sorts of potions after as few as 10 shots to assure his gun will precisely place shot after shot in the same spot .
The varmint hunter , on a good day , may not be able to clean so often and will see accuracy significantly deteriorate as copper builds up in his barrel in shot after shot .
In my Thompson Contender Carbine with a 17 Mach IV Bullberry barrel , I find that ½-inch groups at a 100 yards open up to over 1 inch after as few as 25 shots .
A thorough cleaning that removes all traces of copper brings back the small groups .
Obviously , if one could stop the copper deposition , the loss of precision would go away .
The good people at Nostalgia Enterprises Company NECO in Benicia , CA ( see info below ) studied this problem and developed a process whereby the well - known lubricant molybdenum disulfide ( Moly ) could be mechanically " plated " onto a bullet .
With a properly Moly - coated bullet , the galling of the copper alloy bullet jacket with a steel barrel is essentially eliminated along with the necessity to clean every few rounds to maintain shooting precision .
My 17 Mach IV will easily go 50 rounds or more with no loss in precision or accuracy when I use Moly - coated bullets .

The NECO process is centered around using a tumbler - type case polisher and small , stainless steel balls and very , very finely divided Moly .
Bullets are cleaned using corncob polishing medium ( Not walnut .
That leaves an oily coating . ) and then allowing the tumbling action of the stainless balls to impact impregnate the Moly into the bullet ’s copper alloy jacket .
Powdered molybdenum disulfide is a black , messy material and will get all over everything including your fingers during the reloading process .
Hence NECO recommends a slight coating of carnuba wax to cut down on the mess , again using steel balls as the mechanism to do the coating .
( NECO offers a kit with all the necessary materials to do your own coating . )
Rotary tumblers are expensive and many of us have chosen to use instead vibratory polishers , such as the Midway Model 1292 .
NECO states that the vibratory polishers will work as well as the tumbler type , but tend to take longer .
I personally struggled with vibrator - type polishers as a Moly - coating device and found , following the NECO instructions , it often took up to 8 hours to do a good Moly - coating job .
Then in the June 1997 issue of Precision Shooting magazine , Mr. Dave Beisner published an article offering a modified approach using vibrator machines .
I have followed his approach many times now and it works very well .
( Thank you Mr. Beisner ! )
The following summarizes his process :
There are three basic steps to the Moly - coating process .
One , clean the bullets of the oils and grease used in the manufacturing process .
Two , mechanically impregnate the bullets with Moly .
And three , apply a thin coat of carnuba wax .
For the process to work properly , CLEANLINESS is ESSENTIAL !
Separate polishing bowls must be used for each of the three steps ; a separate strainer and pan must be used between the initial bullet cleaning and the Moly - coating step .
Do not touch the bullets with your hands between steps .
Step One : Put about 2 - 3 cups of untreated corn -cob polishing medium in one of the bowls and mark that bowl for cleaning only .
Add up to about 8,000 grains of bullets .
( Mr. Beisner says to keep the amount of bullets to under 5000 grains , but I have had good success with nearly twice the amount . )
Vibrate for 20 minutes .
Pour the bullet / corncob mixture through a strainer ( I found a steel mesh cooking strainer at Wal - Mart that is just perfect . ) into a clean plastic pan .
( I use an inexpensive dishpan . )
The corncob goes back in its marked bowl and the bullets on to :
Step Two : Load about 3 pounds ( a little more than half of a NECO bottle ) of the steel balls into a new bowl ( mark the bowl ) along with about one teaspoon of Moly and run the vibrator for some 20 minutes the first time to coat everything .
Now add the clean bullets from Step One . ( I usually just leave them in the strainer so I do n’t touch them . )
Vibrate for an hour and a half .
Check that you have a good , uniform coat of Moly .
Use a paper towel to pick up one of the bullets and rub the surface with the towel .
You should not be able to remove the coating with a few rubs .
For future coating add only a very small amount of Moly ( generally less than a quarter teaspoon ) .
Strain out the balls with a separate strainer into a different plastic pan .
Step Three : Load a third bowl with about 3 cups of corncob medium and a teaspoon of carnuba wax .
Run this mixture for about 20 minutes without the bullets the first time to coat everything .
Now add the bullets and run for another 20 minutes .
Strain out the corncob ( you can use the same post Moly - coating strainer / pan combination ) and you are done !
If you wish to wipe the corncob dust off , dump the bullets on a terry cloth towel ( not your good ones ! ) and gently roll the bullets around until clean .
Moly - coated bullets are obviously lubricated and hence you may notice slightly less force is required to seat the bullets in the cartridge case .
There have been some claims that Moly - coating actually improves the precision of your shooting over that of the original clean barrel .
An interesting theory has been proposed for this .
In the normal state of affairs , the copper alloy bullet jacket galls as it passes down a barrel .
This tearing of the metal leaves slight , non-uniform " tails " or " fins " of metal extending beyond the base of the bullet .
These " fins " cause the bullet to wobble slightly until spin allows the bullet to stabilize or " go to sleep " .
With the Moly lubricated bullet , galling does not take place and the copper alloy is extruded around the barrel lands and no " fins " are developed .
Hence the bullet stabilizes or " goes to sleep " earlier and yields increased precision .
The degree to which this happens , obviously will depend upon the individual barrel / bullet situation .

Velocity Change With Moly - coated Bullets Vs Moly - coated Barrel
by Dick Hatfield , July 14 , 1998
Recently I became aware of a product called Spica Gold manufactured by the Parsec Group in Columbia , South Carolina .
( Note :
This product is now available as " Plate + " from Sprinco , USA , the authorized distributor for shooter materials from Parsec .
Any questions or comments should be directed to Sprinco not Parsec . )
This product is a colloidal suspension of extremely finely divided ( less than 0.5 microns ) Molybdenum Disulfide , or " Moly " , in a light oil with various proprietary inhibitors .
According to Parsec / Sprinco , one could use the product to coat the inside of a gun barrel and increase the corrosion resistance of the barrel and not have to use Moly - coated bullets to get the benefits of reduced galling or copper deposition .
Being able to coat the barrel offered the chance to compare various combinations of bare and coated barrels and bare and coated bullets .
I have a sporterized Model 1903 Springfield with the original military 30 ’ 06 barrel ( well used ) that had never had Moly - coated bullets fired in it .
Although not an accurate gun , it would work nicely for a set of velocity experiments .
I cleaned the barrel thoroughly with a chemical copper remover ( Barnes C - 10 ) until there was no sign of copper and followed this with JB ( a very , very mild abrasive ) and finally a fine polishing compound used on plastics .
I then loaded up 100 rounds using military brass , Remington 150 gr. soft points and H414 powder with a load that had worked well in the past .
All 100 rounds were as alike as possible .
Fifty of the bullets were Moly - coated using the NECO tumbling process .
The bullets were 0.065 inch from touching the lands in order to keep the overall length short enough to feed through the magazine .
The experiment first consisted of firing 25 rounds of noncoated bullets through the clean barrel .
As expected , there was considerable evidence of copper in the bore .
I again cleaned the barrel of all signs of copper using the above process .
I then fired 25 rounds of Moly - coated bullets .
There was some copper on the lands following the firing , but not nearly as much as with the bare bullets .
( Remember , this is a rough , used , military barrel .
A modern , lapped barrel would probably show no copper . )
Cleaning was easier and followed the above procedure until there was no copper .
The barrel also had no apparent sign of Moly , as it appeared shiny like fresh steel .
Following the Parsec / Sprinco instructions , I corked the barrel , filled it and soaked it in Spica Gold / Plate + for 5 days ( 48 to 72 hours recommended ) then cleaned with a few dry patches .
I observed a dull gray coating on the bore .
I then fired 25 rounds of bare bullets in the Moly - coated barrel .
I observed some copper fouling on the lands .
I judge that it was about the same as that following the Moly - coated bullet firing .
I then ran a few patches through the barrel and made no attempt to clean it .
The last test was with Moly - coated bullets in the Moly - coated barrel .
Again there was some copper fouling , some of which was left over from the previous test .
But I could n’t see particularly more than before .
The velocity ( in feet per second and the group sizes are in inches ) results were as follows :
Test Bullet Barrel High Velocity Low Velocity Mean Velocity Max Spread Std Dev Group Size 1 Bare Bare 2777 2719 2747 58 13 3.8 2 Moly Bare 2735 2665 2701 70 19 3.4 3 Bare Moly 2819 2773 2789 46 13 4.7 4 Moly Moly 2796 2726 2753 70 18 4.2
Conclusion ....
Moly - coated bullets do cause the velocity to drop as reported in the literature .
A Moly - coated barrel will give increased velocity as reported by the Parsec / Sprinco .
A combination of the two cancels and gives essentially the same results as no Moly at all .
Note that the standard deviation for Moly - coated bullets was over 45 % greater than with bare bullets .
I do n’t understand why .
There was no apparent effect on group size , but this is no benchrest gun either .
How long will the coating on the barrel last ?
I do n’t know .
Parsec / Sprinco suggest running a patch with the Spica Gold / Plate + through the barrel after each firing string , i.e. , when you would normally clean it , and you should get 500 to 1000 rounds before a re-soak is needed .
We will see .
Frankly , coating the barrel seems to have some advantages : no fuss with Moly - coated bullets , a slight gain in velocity , and a corrosion - resistant coating in the barrel .
I have done some reading of the scientific literature on Moly and there is repeated evidence that Molybdenum Disulfide plus water ( in the air ) plus oxygen ( also in the air ) will yield a bit of sulfuric acid , which is not good on either your bullets or your barrel .
I would like to see some more experimenting along the lines of the above .
If you are interested in such experiments , contact Sprinco USA , Inc. , in Chandler , Arizona ( www.sprinco.com or 800-397-9530 ) , who now offers small amounts of Plate + for the shooter .
Happy shooting with Moly - coated bullets or Moly - coated barrels or both !

Friday may mark a significant milestone in the RIAA 's legal campaign against file - sharing , as it is the deadline for exonerated RIAA defendant Tanya Andersen to refile her malicious prosecution lawsuit against the record labels .
Soon afterwards , discovery will begin , and all sorts of unsavory details about the RIAA 's legal campaign against suspected file - sharers are likely to emerge .
Andersen is a single mother living in Oregon who was sued by the record labels in February 2005 .
She eventually filed a counterclaim against the RIAA , and when the labels voluntarily dismissed their case against her last June , she filed a malicious - prosecution lawsuit .
In it , Andersen accuses the RIAA of fraud , racketeering , invasion of privacy , libel , slander , deceptive business practices , and violations of the Oregon state RICO Act .
Last month , a federal judge dismissed Andersen 's original complaint , saying that she had " not adequately stated claims for relief , " but gave her a one - month window to refile .
Her attorney , Lory Lybeck , told Ars that he plans to file a new 80 - page complaint tomorrow .
" The focus of the amended complaint is essentially the sham litigation and abuse of the federal judiciary to operate this criminal enterprise that has harmed Tanya Andersen and thousands of other people , " Lybeck said .
With a new complaint , the case is certain to move forward into the discovery phase , as the judge has told both sides that she would not entertain any further motions to dismiss this case .
It 's an uncomfortable place for the RIAA to be in .
" Usually , the parties are entitled to liberal pretrial discovery of anything related to the subject matter of the case , " copyright attorney Ray Beckerman told Ars .
" So the scope of the amended complaint will have a big impact on what is and what is not discoverable . "
Tanya Andersen
Lybeck tells
Ars that he 'll be digging into agreements between the RIAA , RIAA member companies , MediaSentry , and the Settlement Support Center .
Part of that will involve looking at compensation , like how much MediaSentry gets from each settlement .
" I 'd love to know what kind of bounty MediaSentry got paid to supply erroneous identities to the RIAA , " Lybeck says .
One of the allegations in the amended complaint will involve MediaSentry 's status as a private investigator .
" MediaSentry claims it is able to gain access to people 's hard drives without their permission and collect information , " notes Lybeck .
" It 's illegal because they 're not licensed to do that work . "
The amended complaint and subsequent discovery will also focus on what Lybeck calls the " flawed nature " of the RIAA 's investigations .
" We know [ the RIAA ] cannot identify individuals , " he says in response to a question on false positives .
" We want to know how many dolphins the RIAA is catching , " referring to a former RIAA spokesperson 's 2003 comment about accidentally catching a few dolphins when fishing with a net .
The RIAA is likely to fight the discovery process tooth and nail , however , as the information that is unearthed could prove to be extremely embarrassing , if not problematic .
" They 've operated in this zone of secrecy for five years now , and we hope to put a stop to that , " Lybeck stated emphatically , " because it will become obvious that their conduct is illegal an their whole scheme is flawed at its basic core . "
RIAA lead counsel Richard Gabriel
after the Jammie Thomas trial
So far , the RIAA 's attorneys have been uncooperative on discovery issues , according to Lybeck .
He says that he has reached out to RIAA lead national counsel Richard Gabriel , who was argued the labels ' case in the Jammie Thomas trial , in order to move the process forward .
" He 's refused , " Lybeck said .
" I assume we 're going to run into the same stall and delay tactics . "
Gabriel took issue with Lybeck 's characterization , accusing him of making " false statements " about his conduct .
" As I discussed with Mr. Lybeck , the Court dismissed all 13 of his client 's claims , " Gabriel told Ars .
" As a result , there are no claims pending at the moment , and his request to schedule discovery is premature .
We are eager to resolve all outstanding issues in this case and look forward to doing so in a rational way that follows the process outlined by the Court . "
The judge has barred further motions for dismissal , so unless the RIAA decides to settle — a move Lybeck believes is in the group 's best interest — the case will proceed through discovery and to trial .
Unlike the thousands of lawsuits filed so far , the RIAA does not have the luxury of walking away from this case if there 's a real chance of embarrassing information being released .
" Once discovery happens in the cases the RIAA brings , they run , " Lybeck says .
" This is our case now , and they can't run . "

Katie Holmes Auditioned to be Tom Cruise 's Wife
Ex-scientologistis saying thatheld auditions for his future wife .
Poor Kate , she was n't his first pick .
But luckily the other 3 wanted nothing to do with Tom .
Headly , who previously produced promotional videos for the Scientology organization , spoke with Britain 's News of the World about Tom .
He said that Cruise admitted to having trouble meeting the right woman after his split from Penelope Cruz in 2004 .
So the group stepped in to help Tommy out .
And what else could possibly make sense than to hold a casting call for an " upcoming " Cruise movie ?
There were a few guidelines though , you had to be pretty , single and in your twenties .
Tom 's picks : Jennifer Garner , Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba , in that order .
Although Jennifer and Jessica did n't take the bait , Johansson did until she realized that the meeting was going to be at the Scientology Center and refused to go .
You know the saying - save the best for last .
Well that is what they must have done .
Katie Holmes jumped at the chance to meet her teenage crush .
Kate was once quoted as saying that she dreamed of marrying Cruise as a young girl .
After their first meeting Cruise told Marc , " I knew immediately she was the one . "
Does n't this story just give you warm fuzzies ?

Mauna Kea Shadow Play
Credit & Copyright : Alex Mukensnable
Explanation : Just opposite the setting Sun , the already - eclipsed Moon rose over the Hawaiian Islands on February 20 .
A view near the 14,000 foot peak of volcanic Mauna Kea on the Big Island , a popular spot for astronomers , offered this remarkable play of shadows and sunlight .
With snowy cinder cones in the foreground , the Moon lies within the shadow cast by the mountain -- a shadow extending across a lower cloud deck and on through Earth 's dense atmosphere .
As the lunar eclipse is drawing to a close , the curved shadow of the limb of planet Earth itself can also be traced across the Moon 's surface , some 400,000 kilometers away .
Researchers have solved the structure of a DNA - protein complex that is crucial in the spread of antibiotic resistance among bacteria .
Knowing this structure also provides fundamental insight into how cells successfully divide into two new cells with intact DNA .
The report in the Dec. 20th issue of Nature focuses on how DNA separates and maintains its integrity when a cell divides .
Using X - ray crystallography , the team led by structural biologists at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson , with colleagues at the University of Sydney , Australia , produced clear 3 - D images of the structure that results when two proteins connect with a DNA site to " segregate " DNA during cell division .
" We solve structures to answer questions about how molecules carry out their biological functions .
Without knowing the structure , you can't understand molecular mechanisms at a detailed level , " says lead author Maria Schumacher , Ph.D. , associate professor in M. D. Anderson 's Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology .
In this case , Schumacher and colleagues answer a basic science question and flag a possible target for clinical attack on antibiotic - resistant Staphlococcus Aureas , a tenacious and often lethal staph infection .
" The plasmid segregation system we are working on , called pSK41 , is found in S. aureus and confers resistance to multiple antibiotics , including the drug of last resort , vancomycin , " Schumacher says .
" Because the segregation systems are essential for the retention of these multidrug resistant plasmids , they represent wonderful drug targets . "
Plasmids are additional strips or circles of DNA found in bacteria that provide the bacterium with some mechanism of defense - in this case , protection against antibiotics .
Plasmids can be transferred from one type of bacteria to another through a number of mechanisms .

Plasmids are also a great model for understanding cell division and segregation , Schumacher says , because plasmid segregation is relatively simple : two proteins connect to one DNA site to launch the process .
Cells divide to multiply and it's crucial for this split to go smoothly so each daughter cell ends up with the DNA it needs to function .
" If these plasmids do n't divide and go to the next generation of cells , those bacteria cells lose their drug resistance , " Schumacher notes .
In the Nature paper , the scientists capture the first structure ever solved of a segrosome complex that partitions and divides DNA .
A protein called ParR connects with a centromere DNA site , a round string of DNA repeats in the plasmid , to form the segrosome complex , which then completes itself by attracting filaments of another protein called ParM .
The ParM filaments grow , literally pushing the two replicated plasmid segrosomes apart , resulting in two copies of the plasmid with intact DNA .
" An important question in segregation biology has been ' what structure does the segrosome adopt " '
Our segrosome structure answers that question .
We now have a molecular model for the segregation of DNA , " Schumacher says .
advertisement
Solving the structure is necessary to understand how these molecules function .
" If we know these details we can design highly specific drugs to disrupt their actions , " Schmacher notes .
The researchers used a technique called X - ray crystallography to discern the structure of both proteins connecting to the plasmid DNA .
This technique first requires purification and crystallization of the protein or , in this case , the more challenging DNA - protein complex structure .
These are usually the most difficult steps of the process .
Next , the crystal sample is mounted on a tiny loop in an X - ray diffractor and X - rays are beamed through it .
Bending around the lattice of atoms in the crystal , the X - rays produce a diffraction pattern , which can be seen as a dot pattern on a monitor .
A state - of - the - art X - ray diffractor shoots a different angle of the crystallized protein every few minutes .
Taking between 180-300 images will produce 100,000 to 300,000 data points .
Mathematical analysis of those points reveals a three - dimensional structure .
The first image is an electron density map , which illustrates a protein's hills and valleys based on the position of the electrons of the atoms that compose the complex .
This leads to the more exotic ribbon diagram , a spiraling , looping almost skeletal representation of the complex 's crucial components .
The researchers used the Advanced Light Source ( ALS ) synchrotron at the U.S. Department of Energy 's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory a fast , powerful diffractor that shoots a new diffraction pattern every half second , to solve this structure .
Co-authors with Schumacher are Tiffany Glover and Thomas Dunham , also of M. D. Anderson 's Department of Biochemistry and Molecular biology ; and Anthony J. Brzoska , Slade O. Hensen , Ronald Skurray and Neville Firth , all of the University of Sydney .
The research was supported by a Burroughs Wellcome Career Development Award , an M. D. Anderson Trust Fellowship , a National Institutes of Health grant , an Australian Research Council Grant and an Australian National Health and Medical Research Council Project grant .

It ’s subtle , but important .
AP , in reporting about the Internet effort to slime Obama by falsely claiming that he ’s Muslim , did n’t bother actually SAYING that the rumors were false , that the campaign was clearly misinformation .
Note how AP refers to the false rumors as simply “ concerns “ :
The Illinois senator also sought to ease lingering Internet - fed concerns about his religion , in particular whether he was a closet Muslim .
“ I am a devout Christian .
I have been a member of the same church for 20 years .
I pray to Jesus every night , ” he declared at an earlier appearance in the rural southern Ohio town of Nelsonville .
He said he wanted to halt “ confusion that has been deliberately perpetrated . ”
Now , AP knows this is untrue .
They know that the allegations are n’t just lingering Internet - fed concerns about his religion – they ’re a bigoted online campaign intended to slur , to Swift Boat Obama , with something everyone knows is false , and racist to boot .
These are n’t “ concerns . ”
Who has concerns about Obama ’s religion ?
It ’s all smoke and mirrors , and AP knows it .
And while AP quotes Obama as saying it is n’t true , that ’s not the same thing as AP acknowledging in its own editorial voice that these rumors are n’t true , that there are n’t lingering “ concerns ” about Obama ’s religion at all .
The story should have called them “ false rumors , ” and not “ Internet - fed concerns . ”
AP should have said they independently confirmed that Obama has always been a Christian , that he has in fact attended that church for twenty years .
But they did n’t , even though they know that this “ Internet - fed rumor ” is part of a huge effort to defame Obama .
It ’s a slight nuance , but an important one .
The media was happy to aid and abet the Swift Boating of John Kerry in 2004 by reporting on the he - said - she - said of the Swift Boat allegations as if they were news , as if they were real ( when everyone in the media knew the allegations were trumped up ) .
Rather than writing process stories about how ludicrous the attacks were , and how interesting it was that the Republicans were willing to go this negative , the media kept asking John Kerry if he really did steal his purple heart .
We ’re not going to let if happen again .
When you write about Obama being Swift Boated , say it .
Do n’t report it as a he - said - she - said , as something that might just be true , so let ’s get Obama ’s side and present both .
Call it what it is – a lie .
False .
Untrue .
Do n’t just quote someone claiming it ’s not true , say it ’s untrue .
Otherwise , you ’re simply feeding the lie .
Tate has acquired Louise Bourgeois 's celebrated sculpture of a giant female spider , Maman 1999 .
The work is a gift of the artist and an anonymous benefactor .
A bronze version of Maman is currently on Bankside .
Photo by Jenny Davell .
Maman , which stands more than nine metres high , is a steel and marble sculpture from which an edition of six bronzes were subsequently cast by the artist .
The sculpture proved a hit with visitors when it was displayed in Tate Modern 's Turbine Hall when the gallery first opened eight years ago .
Long after it had been removed , gallery attendants still fielded queries from visitors looking for the spider .
It made a return visit to the Turbine Hall in 2004 .
A bronze version of Maman is currently on display on the Bankside riverside outside Tate Modern as part of the major Louise Bourgeois retrospective which runs until 20 January .
Maman is the largest spider sculpture ever made by Bourgeois .
This spectacular arachnid alludes to the strength of the mother with metaphors of spinning , weaving , nurture and protection .
" To acquire Maman , one of Louise Bourgeois 's best - known and seminal works , the largest of her Spider sculptures , is an historic moment for Tate , " says Tate Modern director Vicente Todoli
" This work significantly enhances our holdings of the work of one of the world 's greatest living sculptors . "
Bronze casts of Maman are on permanent display at the Guggenheim Museum , Bilbao , Spain , Samsung Museum of Art , Seoul , Korea , MoriArtCenter , Tokyo , Japan and the National Gallery of Canada , Ottawa , Canada .
There are 28 works in the Tate Collection by the 96 - year - old artist .

... changed my life .
It was a couple of days before Christmas and I was shopping at the Vancouver Costco .
I could n't help but notice how " un-Christmas " the atmosphere was ... parents yelling at their kids to hurry up and do n't touch this or that ... or worse , some kids were just being ignored and crying for attention .
Civilized adults being rude to each other ... and I remember thinking how pitiful it all was .
I was in the store looking for a Wii - somebody told me they might be available there .
I asked a clerk who very nicely told me I was out of luck - see I only had a vague idea of what a Wii is and no idea of how popular they were - making them scarce .
Another Costco " customer " heard me ask and after the cleck left he approached me and offered to sell me one - for $ 500 .
After talking to this " gentleman " - it turns out he somehow managed to buy 10 or so units ( not sure if they were from Costco or not ) and was just hanging out at Costco to find people looking for these games so he could sell them one .
He actually said things like " you 'd better do this because I am your only hope " and " your kids will hate you if they do n't have a Wii on Christmas morning . "
I suddenly felt really sad because I know for some people he was telling the truth .
On my way out I decided to get a Costco hotdog special .
That 's when I got the Christmas Spirit again .
I was just looking around at all the people hustling , bustling , ignoring , yelling , pushing , shoving and then I saw her and her little boy .
At first , I did n't take it all in - all I noticed was this woman 's happy smile .
And then I noticed her son was handicapped .
He could n't sit up by himself very well .
He could n't eat by himself and when he had food in his mouth , it would come back out .
But at first glance you would n't know it .
This Mom was using one hand to hold him up .
She was breaking his food into small bits and feeding it to him and wiping his mouth every few seconds .
She did this while she was eating her own lunch , whispering conversation to him and gently kissing his head now and then - and smiling both full of happiness and pride the whole time .
I found that amazing especially in contrast with what was surrounding them .
They were most definitely in their own peaceful and loving world .
I watched them for a few minutes and reluctantly went on my way .
Her love and peace had touched me , but I knew if I stayed longer and watched , they may have spotted me watching them and it could have made them uncomfortable or somehow taken away from their time there .
Now it 's just over 2 months later and this is still on my mind - as it is everyday .
I am more thankful for my kids and I am more at peace and more accepting of things when they do n't work out the way I want .
I try hard to be more gentle and kind towards others .
I want to smile the way I saw this woman smile .
I want that peace and contentment .
I want to be able to love unconditionally .
I have heard that before - but it does n't really have meaning until you see it .
It 's a 100 million to one chance that the person who I am talking about sees this , but I need to say thank you .
I want you to know that you made a difference in my life .
Thank you .

Gascoigne was capped 57 times for England
Northumbria Police said a 40 - year - old man was detained at Gateshead 's Hilton Hotel on Wednesday evening when concern was raised about his behaviour .
Mr Gascoigne had been asked to leave Newcastle 's Malmaison Hotel earlier that day after a disturbance .
Police said he was not in custody and was now receiving medical treatment .
Mr Gascoigne is understood to have moved to the Hilton Hotel after leaving the Malmaison in the early hours of Wednesday .
Northumbria Police confirmed a 40 - year - old man had been detained under the Mental Health Act .
Alcohol problems
A Hilton spokesperson said : " We can confirm that the guest in question checked into the hotel early on Wednesday 20 February .
" While there was no disturbance caused ( at the Hilton ) , we did receive a phone call from the police later that day .
" Since then we can confirm that he was escorted calmly from the hotel and we are continuing to co-operate with the police . "
Mr Gascoigne has battled for some time with alcohol and health problems .
In January 2005 , he was hospitalised with pneumonia and last year he underwent emergency surgery for a perforated stomach ulcer after being taken ill as he was celebrating his 40th birthday .
He was arrested for an alleged assault on a photographer outside a Liverpool city centre hotel in 2005 .
The charges were later dropped .
A former player with Newcastle United , Tottenham Hotspur , Lazio , Glasgow Rangers and Middlesbrough , he was sacked after 39 days as manager of Kettering Town in 2005 .
He was capped 57 times for England .
Who knows how long the Rev. Jeremiah Wright brouhaha will play out , but revelations of Barack Obama 's pastor 's objectionable sermons have apparently eroded public perceptions of Obama , according to a fresh analysis by the Rasmussen Report tracking poll .
With the Wright episode playing out over the past few days , the poll found Obama 's favorable rating nationally had dropped five points to 47 % since Thursday , and his unfavorable rating had risen from 44 % to 50 % .
Among white voters , the unfavorable numbers jumped to 54 % .
The poll also found John McCain leading both Obama and Hillary Clinton in head - to - head national matchups , whereas a week ago they they were essentially tied .
Of course , the Democrats have to pick between Obama and Clinton before the head - to - head matters , which is as unresolved as ever .
This is beginning to feel a little bit like Florida 2000 , when the nation suddenly learned the meaning of arcane terms like " hanging chad . "
This time around , we 're becoming experts on Democratic superdelegates , while trying shake off images of well - fed Democrats in tights and capes .
The folks at MSNBC's First Read point out that although Hillary Clinton leads Barack Obama in superdelegates -- something we dissected earlier today day -- she has n't picked up any fresh superdelegates since Super Tuesday .
In fact , First Read 's count shows Obama gained 47 superdelegates since then while Clinton lost seven -- including former New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer .
So , what does that mean ?
Uncertainty about Clinton by party insiders while Obama was running up a dozen victories in a row ?
A desire to wait and see if a wind is blowing in any discernible direction by convention time in August ?
A look over in the other lane at McCain 's taillights ?
Hard to say .
But what is intriguing is how the narrative of the campaign has inverted itself .
Remember when the Republicans were splintered and unhappy with their candidates , and the Democrats united in their confidence of winning the White House ?
Now the Democrats are split , the tone has become nastier , and with war sputtering on and the economy causing all sorts of indigestion , the political discourse is being dominated by race and gender .
Who says politics is boring ?

Dean Acheson , the distinguished American statesman , famously opined in a speech at West Point in 1962 , " that Great Britain has lost an empire and has not yet found a role . "
Forty years later , in 2002 , Tony Blair and fellow dreamers thought the tragedy of 9/11 provided them with the opportunity once again to play a determining role on the world stage .
The notion that Britain was to America as Greece had been to Rome  implying that Britain was going to be the " brain " and America the " brawn "  became a fashionable topic of discourse in the British media .
No matter how deluded this may have been when viewed objectively , Blair and his acolytes clung to the idea .
They hoped to use the Anglo - American " special relationship " as the vehicle for achieving Britain ’s neo-imperial dreams .
However , the United States continued to view the relationship differently , and Blair ’s efforts to shape American policy through close ties to Washington failed , as has now been revealed by numerous retired senior British officials .
Nevertheless , still hoping to gain a place at the top table of decision making , and thereby try and shape future events , Blair committed Britain ’s forces to fight battles in two countries where Britain had a colonial past : Afghanistan and Iraq .
London thought that its colonial era experience in both countries would enable it to claim superior knowledge and expertise , thus giving British policy proposals inordinate weight , thereby influencing the political and economic shape of the post - conflict era in both countries to British advantage .
However , this ambition has already been thwarted in Iraq and is at the point of being thwarted in Afghanistan .
In Iraq , with the formation of the Coalition Provisional Authority ( CPA ) , it soon became clear that the U.S. ’s representative Paul Bremer was in charge at the CPA .
Consequently Britain ’s man , Sir Jeremy Greenstock , supposedly equal in status to Bremer , was withdrawn and was replaced by a low level diplomat as Britain ’s token representative at the CPA .
British pique at this reverse in fortunes took the shape of press leaks condemning the American handling of the military and political situation in Iraq .
In Afghanistan , Britain ’s initial efforts to determine the course of Afghan events were more successful than in Iraq : ISAF , a British project which initially consisted of only British forces , was in charge of Kabul .
The Northern Alliance , whose Tajik faction has close ties with London , formed the government .
Hamid Karzai , the subservient nominal Pashtun , was ennobled and served as a sop to Pashtun demands for representation in any future Afghan government .
Whether or not British inspired , the proposal that the ISAF mission should be transformed into a NATO mission was of enormous benefit to Britain ’s ultimate objective of " destroying " the Pashtun Taliban , because Britain was fully aware that it neither had the men nor material to achieve its objectives alone  NATO forces were meant to serve the same purpose now as Britain ’s colonial native contingents had done in the past , and other countries were going to share the cost of avenging Britain ’s past military defeats in Afghanistan  Brilliant !
As I have written in a previous article , nationalistic jingoism was at fever pitch prior to the deployment of British forces to the Pashtun dominated south of Afghanistan .
Then , the British dream encountered the Pashtun reality and became a nightmare .
There was plenty of recrimination : the British army blamed MI6 for misrepresenting the situation in the South .
The RAF ’s contribution to battles was severely criticized 
British troops on the ground referred to it as " The Royal Air Farce . "
Tony Blair and his crew received well - deserved public criticism from officers in the field , some of whom resigned .
The British government naturally blamed fellow NATO allies for Britain ’s reverses 
Germany especially came in for particular opprobrium for restricting its forces to peacekeeping duties in the North .
Britain ’s military failure in Helmand last year , and the public pronouncements of high - level American officials , that there was no military solution to the problems in Afghanistan , convinced London that British chicanery might succeed where British military forces had failed .
So , MI6 operative Sir Sherard Cowper - Coles was named HMG ’s ambassador to Kabul , supported by a team of 250 of his fellow colleagues .
However , it would appear that Sir Sherard has not been able " to cut the mustard , " and Britain is pushing hard for another MI6 officer to be named as Britain ’s " Viceroy " in Kabul : Lord Paddy Ashdown , affectionately dubbed by the tabloids as " Paddy Pantsdown " because of his weakness for the charms of a female member of his staff .
Lord Ashdown , an Ulsterman , ( Ulster being a Northern Ireland British province which has contributed more than its fair share to imposing harsh British colonial rule throughout the British Empire ) was born in Delhi during the declining days of British rule in India  his father was a Captain in the Indian Army .
After finishing secondary school at aged 18 , he joined the Royal Marines .
During his time in the marines he learned Malay and Chinese , presumably to equip him for serving in British forces then engaged in counter - insurgency operations in British Malaya .
His subsequent career was ostensibly at the Foreign Office , but in fact he was an MI6 officer and served in Geneva under the cover of being the First Secretary at the U.K. Mission to the U.N .
So , clearly Paddy Ashdown has all the qualifications the British deem necessary to implementing Britain ’s neo-imperial agendas in Afghanistan , and Britain ’s return to playing the " Great Game " in Central Asia .
But whether the international community will accord him the extensive powers , akin to being named " Viceroy of Afghanistan , " which Lord Ashdown is demanding as a precondition to accepting the job of " chief international coordinator , " is both undesirable and unlikely  amalgamating the posts of Head of NATO , Head of U.N. and Head of EU missions in Afghanistan may be a hat trick which even the web - spinners in London may be unable to achieve .

' West Wing ' Executive Producer Lawrence O'Donnells wrote an obnoxious piece in the Huffington Post on why John Edwards is supposedly ' A Loser ' ( apparently because he has n't become president yet ) , highlighting the fact that John Edwards is getting royally screwed by the liberal press .
With plummeting poll numbers , the Senator from North Carolina cannot compete with the enormous dollars rolling in to media darling Barack Obama 's campaign , or that of the name established Hillary Clinton .
This , according to Donnell and much of the liberal establishment , proves Edwards is no good as a politician , or even as a man .

Read Johann
Hari's excellent piece in the Independent countering this
appalling trend , and explaining why Edwards is still the best candidate
left :
" The world is gaping with awe – and disbelief – at the prospect of a
black or female President of the United States .
If George Bush
symbolises everything we hate about the United States , Barack Obama
seems to symbolise everything we love about the country : its warm
openness to immigrants , its shimmering civil rights movements , its
idealism .
So it feels strange to say it , but reader , it 's time to look
away from the woman and the black guy towards the white man from the
Deep South – because he is more left - wing , and more electable , than
either of them .

You might remember John Edwards as the plastic vice - presidential candidate
standing at John Kerry 's wooden side in 2004 .
Back then , he offered anodyne
Clintonian soundbites and centrist platitudes – but losing to Bush yet again
did something strange to him .
It turned him into an angry whistle - blower ,
exposing the corruption consuming both of Washington 's parties .
He explained : " I have seen the seamy underbelly of what happens in
Washington every day .
If you 're Exxon Mobil and you want to influence what 's
happening with the government , you go and hire one of these big lobbying
firms .
This is what you find .
About half the lobbyists are Republicans , and
about half the lobbyists are Democrats .
If the Republicans are in power , the
Republican lobbyists take the lead , passing the money around .
If the
Democrats are in power , the Democratic lobbyists take the lead .
They 're
pushing the same agenda for the same companies .
There 's no difference . "
He announced that " the system in Washington is rigged and our
government is broken " .
The failures of US politics – not just under
Bush , but under Bill Clinton too – can only be understood as a result of
this endemic corruption .
Global warming ?
It will never be dealt with while
presidents and senators have to suck at the oil pump for campaign
contributions .
Forty - seven million Americans without health insurance ?
Thank
the lavish campaign contributions of the drug and medical companies .
Iraq ?
Look again to the oil donors , the defence donors , the " private military
contractor " donors .
And on , and on .
Edwards adds , " This is
personal for me .
When I see the lobbyists all over Washington taking our
politicians to cocktail parties , the picture I get in my head is of my
father and my grandmother going to a mill in South Carolina every day .
Where
is their voice in this democracy ? "
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - Celebrities Demi Moore , Ashton Kutcher and Madonna are among hundreds of patrons of a New York bar being urged by New York health officials on Thursday to get a Hepatitis A vaccination after a bartender was found to be infected .

The city health department issued a statement , warning anyone who visited Socialista in Manhattan ’s West Village on February 7 , 8 or 11 to get a vaccination .
Local media reports said Moore hosted a 30th birthday bash for her husband Kutcher at the venue on February 7 after a star - studded dinner at Gemma restaurant .
Entertainment photo agency WireImage showed guests at the Socialista event , including Madonna , Gwyneth Paltrow , Ivanka Trump , Liv Tyler , Catherine Keener , Lucy Liu and Salma Hayek .
Other celebrities reported at Socialista were Javier Bardem , nominated for a best supporting actor Oscar , Eric Dane , Rebecca Gayheart and fashion designer Roberto Cavalli .
Socialista was not immediately available for comment , nor were representatives of Moore , Kutcher or Madonna .
“ Any patron who visited the establishment after 8 p.m. on February 7th or 8th , or after 10 p.m. on February 11th ( the times the infected person worked after becoming infectious ) , is considered to be at risk and needs a preventive shot , ” the health department said .
It said the bar owners were cooperating fully and estimated between 700 and 800 people had visited the bar on those nights , but added that no cases of illness had yet been identified .
Hepatitis
A is a liver disease caused by a virus and is spread from person to person by putting something in the mouth that has been contaminated with traces of fecal matter from an infected person , the department said .
Symptoms include jaundice , fatigue , abdominal pain , nausea , and diarrhea .

The National Security Agency 's eavesdropping program set off heated legal concerns and silent protests inside the Bush administration within hours of its adoption in October 2001 , according to current and former government officials .
In making its case to Congress for broadened spy powers , the White House has emphasized the firm legal foundations of the program conducted after the Sept. 11 attacks .
It has even taken the unusual step of giving lawmakers access to classified presidential orders from 2001 and early legal opinions to try to show that the program was on sound legal footing from the start .
But many of the tensions that were roiling the administration at the start of the program have never become public .
In one previously undisclosed episode , then - Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson refused to sign off on any of the secret wiretapping requests that grew out of the program because of the secrecy and legal uncertainties surrounding it , the officials said .
He was not given access to details of the NSA operation , and was so uncomfortable with the idea of approving this new breed of wiretap applications that he had a top adviser write a memorandum assessing the legal ramifications .
The adviser warned him not to sign the warrant applications because it was unclear where the wiretaps were coming from .
FBI bumps into it
Inside the FBI , technicians stumbled onto the NSA program accidentally within 12 hours of its inception , setting off what officials described as a brief firestorm of anxiety among senior officials .
Some who had not been told about it were concerned that the agency was violating laws that required a court order for the singling out of Americans in wiretaps , and they immediately alerted higher - ups as to what they had discovered .
" What 's going on here ?
Is this legal ? " one FBI official asked after learning of the NSA operation on American soil .
FBI Director Robert Mueller assured nervous officials that the program had been approved by President Bush , several officials said .
But the presidential approval , one former intelligence official disclosed , came without a formal legal opinion endorsing the program by the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department .
At the outset of the program , then - Attorney General John Ashcroft signed off on the surveillance program at the direction of the White House with little in the way of a formal legal review , the official said .
Shoved in front of Ashcroft
Ashcroft complained to associates at the time that the White House , in getting his signature for the surveillance program , " just shoved it in front of me and told me to sign it . "
Aides to Ashcroft were worried , however , that in approving a surveillance program that appeared to test the limits of presidential authority , Ashcroft was left legally exposed without a formal opinion from the Office of Legal Counsel , which acts as the legal adviser for the entire executive branch .
At that time , the office had already issued a broad , classified opinion declaring the president 's powers in the abstract in wartime , but it had not weighed in on the legality of the NSA program or the specifics of the surveillance operation , officials said .
The nervousness among Justice Department officials led the administration to secure a formal opinion from John Yoo , a deputy in the Office of Legal Counsel , declaring that the president 's wartime powers allowed him to order the NSA to intercept the international communications of terror suspects without a standard court warrant .
Still classified
The opinion remains classified and has not been made public .
It was apparently written in late 2001 or early 2002 , but it was revised in 2004 by a new cast of senior lawyers at the Justice Department , who found the earlier opinion incomplete and somewhat shoddy .
Yoo declined to discuss the issue .
Even after the final legal opinions were written , lawyers at the National Security Agency were not allowed to see them , officials said .
Justice Department officials declined comment for this article , saying they would not discuss internal deliberations on a classified program .
The White House , which also declined to comment , is now at an impasse with the House over Bush 's efforts to secure broader spy powers for the NSA as well as retroactive immunity for the phone companies that helped in the warrantless wiretapping program .
The Senate has agreed to give immunity , but the House has refused .
In the past , the White House has said there was widespread agreement among administration officials over the president 's authority to order warrantless surveillance inside the United States .
Former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told Congress that there was never any disagreement within the administration over the issue .
After it was disclosed that senior Justice Department officials had threatened to resign over aspects of the program in 2004 , lawmakers attacked the truthfulness of Gonzales ' remarks .
At the insistence of Vice President Dick Cheney , knowledge of the program was restricted to a tight circle of top officials and congressional briefings were unusually limited .
But several current and former officials involved in the program said they believed the intense secrecy was to blame for much of the early nervousness among other senior officials who had integral roles in intelligence operations yet were not allowed to know the full details of what was happening .
We 've learned to be extra cautious whenever some company tosses out that " world 's thinnest " claim , and while this one is n't an outright lie , it 's not exactly as impressive as Super Talent would have you believe .
Yeah , the outfit 's 256GB FSD56GC25H SSD actually is the slimmest on the market today at this capacity , but the 12.5 - millimeter height makes it incompatible with a slew of laptops that can only handle drives that are 9.5 - millimeters thick .
Nevertheless , those with the room to spare can look forward to 0.1 - millisecond access times , 65 MB / sec sequential read speeds and 50 MB / sec sequential write speeds ( maximums ) , and a lightweight aluminum enclosure .
Per usual , pricing information is available only upon request -- but no , it wo n't be cheap .
A US General has thrown out the conviction of the sole US officer charged over the abuse at Baghdad 's Abu Ghraib jail , the US Army says .
After a week - long court martial in August , Lieutenant Colonel Steven Jordan , 51 , who oversaw the Abu Ghraib interrogations centre from September to December 2003 , was acquitted of the most serious charges of mistreating prisoners and dereliction of duty .
He walked free with just a fine and a judicial reprimand for disobeying an order not to discuss the scandal with any colleague .
On Tuesday , however , General Richard Rowe , commanding general of the US Army Military District of Washington , who headed the court martial of Jordan , " disapproved the guilty finding and the sentence , " an Army statement said .
" In light of the nature of the offence Jordan had been found guilty of committing and the substantial evidence in mitigation presented at trial and in post - trial matters submitted by defence counsel , Rowe determined that an administrative reprimand was a fair and appropriate disposition of the matter , " it added .
An administrative reprimand , unlike a judicial reprimand like Lieutenant Colonel Jordan had previously been given , leaves no written judicial record of the case .
General Rowe 's decision effectively closes the book on the Abu Ghraib prison scandal that so outraged the world after photographs of US soldiers abusing Iraqi detainees at the prison outside of Baghdad were published in April 2004 .
After several investigations and years of hearings and military trials , only 11 soldiers - those in the photographs - were found guilty and given sentences that ranged from the equivalent of a slap on the wrist ( a few hours of community service ) to up to 10 years in prison .
A handful of their superiors were reprimanded , and a brigadier general was demoted to colonel .

The Hill Times this week includes an astonishingly misleading and factually incorrect article on Canadian copyright written by Microsoft .
The most egregious error comes in the following paragraph which attempts to demonstrate why Microsoft thinks reform is needed :
Imagine you 're an aspiring author who decides to self - publish on the internet in hopes of supporting yourself and catching the eye of a publishing house .
Now imagine someone hacks into your website and accesses your work and begins using the ideas expressed in your work for their own commercial benefit .
You should be protected , right ?
In Canada , you are not .
Actually , you are protected .
Copyright law would clearly protect an author whose work was used without permission for commecial benefit .
In fact , the infringer would face the prospect of significant statutory damages .
But do n't take my word for it .
One year ago ( almost to the day ) , Microsoft issued a press release trumpeting a win at the Federal Court that led to one of the highest statutory damages awards in Canadian copyright history – $ 500,000 in statutory damages and an additional $ 200,000 in punitive damages .
Funnily enough , the company did n't argue that it was n't protected in that case ( update : note that if Microsoft is claiming that there is no protection for the ideas rather than the expression of the ideas , then this is correct , though it 's true for all countries since copyright protects the expression , not the ideas themselves ) .
The column then continues with this gem :
If we take our self - publisher as an example – that person is looking for innovative distribution channels to share their work .
If digital distribution methods are not protected , what incentive is there for that person to seek other , even more innovative ways to distribute and commercialize their creations ?
Actually , there are lots of incentives .
In fact , Microsoft just bid $ 44.6 billion for a company ( Yahoo ) that is one of the most vocal proponents of distributing music without such protections and owns Flickr ( itself formerly a Canadian company ) , one of the most successful online photo sites where over two billion photos have been posted without protection .
Finally , the column concludes by acknowledging that :
Critics of the proposed law often raise concerns about how to provide for fair dealing .
The existing Copyright Act already provides exceptions for research , study , the disabled , and more .
Yes it does .
The problem with the laws that Microsoft is seeking is that those exceptions would be trumped by the combination of content that is locked down and the Prentice Canadian DMCA .
But then Microsoft ought to know that , since it is the company selling the digital locks .
Patrick Swayze , who glided across a big - screen dance floor to superstardom in 1987's Dirty Dancing and uttered the classic phrase " Nobody puts Baby in a corner , " has been diagnosed with a deadly cancer .
Late Wednesday afternoon , Swayze 's publicist , Annett Wolf , issued a statement confirming that the actor is being treated for pancreatic cancer .
CANCER EXPERTS : Swayze has difficult road ahead FORUM : Cancer patients , survivors and loved ones share their experiences
The disease is often considered a death sentence , but Wolf 's statement included comments from Swayze 's Stanford Cancer Center physician , George Fisher , indicating a far less dire prognosis : " Patrick has a very limited amount of disease and he appears to be responding well to treatment thus far . "
Swayze 's publicist added : " Patrick is continuing his normal schedule during this time , which includes working on upcoming projects .
The outpouring of support and concern he has already received from the public is deeply appreciated by Patrick and his family . "
The actor has been busy shooting a pilot for A&E .
Dan Silberman , the network 's vice president for publicity , released a statement late Wednesday saying that the network recently completed a pilot with Swayze called The Beast .
The show " is in contention to become one of the new drama series on the network , " he said .
" However , at this time all of our thoughts are solely with Patrick and his family .
We are all wishing for a speedy recovery to a truly gifted actor . "
Swayze and his wife , Lisa Niemi , have been married since 1975 and met when she was a student of his mother , Patsy , a choreographer .
His actor brother Don is expected to co-star with him in the movie drama Powder Blue , scheduled for release this year .
Many of Swayze 's roles have capitalized on the classically trained dancer 's physique and stamina .
He has portrayed a bouncer ( 1989 's Road House ) , a surfing and skydiving bank robber ( 1991 's Point Break ) and a voluptuous drag queen ( 1995 's To Wong Foo Thanks for Everything , Julie Newmar ) .
Even his role as a spirit in 1990's Ghost opposite Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg was physically demanding .
The confirmation follows an Internet report that first appeared Wednesday morning from the National Enquirer .
The early report said that Swayze only had five weeks to live .
Enlarge Ghost :
His role in the 1990 film with Demi Moore helped solidify his stardom .

The Saudis have been under pressure to encourage tolerance
Details of the plan were revealed in the influential Saudi newspaper Al - Sharq al - Awsat .
The plan is part of a wider programme launched by the Saudi monarch a few years ago to encourage moderation and tolerance in Saudi society .
The ministry of religious affairs and new centre for national dialogue will carry out the training , the paper said .
The centre was created five years ago to disseminate a moderate interpretation of Islamic tradition .
There is growing awareness in Saudi society that security measures alone are not enough to counter the threat of Islamic militancy .
Scepticism
Saudi clerics have long been accused of encouraging Saudi youth to join global jihad and of inciting hatred of non-Muslims .
Nearly 1,000 imams have already been sacked over the past few years .
The Saudi royal family has come under increasing pressure - mainly from Washington - to change religious textbooks and to rein in militant clerics .
But critics are sceptical about whether such initiatives would work as long as the powerful , and ultraconservative , religious establishment in Saudi Arabia continues to exert enormous influence over society .
Only last week , a prominent cleric called for the beheading of two liberal writers who had questioned the orthodox view that Muslims can not change their religion .
White House spokeman has ' contentious ' battle with CNN reporter over alleged Iranian ' meddling ' in Iraq David Edwards and Ron Brynaert
Published : Tuesday February 13 , 2007 Print This Email This White House spokesman Tony Snow 's press briefing turned " contentious " this afternoon , CNN reports , after correspondent Ed Henry asked if the Bush Administration and the US Military were both " on the same page " with regards to accusations that Iran is " meddling " in Iraq .
" You know , this past weekend , US Military officials in Baghdad laid out what they claim to be evidence of Iranian meddling in Iraq , " Henry reported on CNN .
" Specifically , providing bomb - making materials to insurgents in Iraq who were , in turn , using those materials to kill US soldiers and Marines . "
Henry noted that the allegations were " being met with skepticism in part because so many claims the Bush administration made in advance of the Iraq war turned out to be false . "
" The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Pace , is now saying , in fact , while these explosive projectiles are , in fact , manufactured in Iran , ' I would not say but that I know , that the Iranian Government clearly knows or is complicit , ' " Henry continued .
" It sounded to some , including me , that perhaps the US government is not on the same page here . "
So Henry said to Snow , " General Peter Pace is now saying that he was not aware that this briefing was going ahead in Baghdad where military officers were talking about Iran 's influence in Iraq , this past weekend .
How could the chairman of the Joint Chiefs not know that military officers would be briefing in Baghdad ? "
The White House press secretary said that he'd " refer that back to General Pace , frankly , " before accusing some in the media of trying to " whomp up " controversy .
" Let me tell you what -- I think a lot of people are trying to whomp up a fight here that does n't exist , " Snow said .
" I spoke with General Pace a bit this morning as well . "
Henry interjected , " With all due respect , it 's General Pace 's comments , not anyone 's else 's . "
After some more words were exchanged , Snow said to Henry , " Ed , calm down .
I know you 're excited .
Your voice is rising , your pace is increasing --" But Henry pressed on , attempting to get Snow to admit that there was some difference in Pace 's public statements and what the Administration has been alleging , about whether or not there was strong evidence connecting the bombs to the Iranian government .
Snow said , " Well , I think what General Pace may have been saying -- in fact , I know he -- he -- and this is where we get to the rhetorical question I was asking you before .
Do we have a signed piece of paper from Mr. Khamenei or from President Ahmadinejad signing off on this ?
No .
But are the Qods Forces part of the army -- part of the government ?
The answer is yes .
So the question is , I think this ends up being a semantic dispute about senior levels of the government or the government , and the fact is , the government knows about it . "
" But is n't it really a question about whether or not you have strong evidence ? "
Henry asked .
" When the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff seemed to be saying something different than the White House , does that raise questions about how solid this evidence is ? "
On CNN , Henry added that " another curious aspect of this is how the information was delivered this past weekend . "
" It was delivered by US officials on ' background , ' meaning they would not have their names used , " Henry said .
" It was also done off - camera .
That 's raising questions about whether or not those US officials wanted to be on camera , whether they were concerned about this evidence being shaky . "
Henry continued , " I put that to Tony Snow as well .
He insisted that is not the case .
It 's not because he felt the evidence was shaky .
And , finally , Tony Snow also said in this briefing that he had just recently , in the last hour or so , gotten off the phone with General Pace and insisted that General Pace is saying privately that they 're on the same page .
There 's really not a difference here .
The problem , though , is that General Pace is now , apparently , on an airplane coming back from Australia or Indonesia and -- bottom line -- we 're not going to be able to get to him for another day to get his side of the story . "

Transcript : Kyra Phillips : Let 's go straight to White House correspondent Ed Henry who just came out of a briefing with Tony Snow .
Ed , it was pretty interesting .
You and Tony Snow , it got a little contentious between the two of you .
Henry :
That 's right , Kyra .
You know , this past weekend , US Military officials in Baghdad laid out what they claim to be evidence of Iranian meddling in Iraq .
Specifically , providing bomb - making materials to insurgents in Iraq who were , in turn , using those materials to kill US soldiers and Marines .
These claims being met with skepticism in part because so many claims the Bush administration made in advance of the Iraq war turned out to be false .
The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , General Pace , is now saying , in fact , while these explosive projectiles are , in fact , manufactured in Iran , ' I would not say but that I know , that the Iranian Government clearly knows or is complicit . '
It sounded to some , including me , that perhaps the US government is not on the same page here .
So I put that question to Tony Snow ... "

Henry : Tony , on Iran .
General Peter
Pace is now saying that he was not aware that this briefing was going ahead in Baghdad where military officers were talking about Iran 's influence in Iraq , this past weekend .
How could the chairman of the Joint Chiefs not know that military officers would be briefing in Baghdad ?
Snow :
Well , I 'll refer that back to General Pace , frankly .
But I 'll tell you , what General Pace -- Henry : Did n't you loop him in ?
Did you -- did the White House loop in the chairman of the Joint Chiefs ?
Snow : I believe that this was a Pentagon briefing .
So again , it typically is something that when the Pentagon 's doing it , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs knows about it .
Let me tell you what -- I think a lot of people are trying to whomp up a fight here that does n't exist .
I spoke with General Pace a bit this morning as well .
And there is a core of information that everybody agrees upon .
Number one , there 's weaponry that is of Iranian manufacture that 's in Iraq killing Americans .
There are Iranians involved .
There are Iranians on the ground .
Our intelligence indicates that the explosively formed penetrators , the EFPs , in fact are directly associated with Qods forces , which are part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , which are part of the government .
The Qods force is , in fact , an official arm of the Iranian government , and as such , the government bears responsibility and accountability for its actions , as you would expect of any sovereign government .
And I think that 's pretty clear .
I mean , General Pace , again , if you go through his -- Henry : ( Off mike . )
That 's where -- you said people are trying to whomp up a fight .
With all due respect , it 's General Pace 's comments , not anyone 's else 's .
Snow :
No , if you go back to -- Henry : Well , he said -- let me just say he said , quote , " It is clear that Iranians are involved and it's clear that materials from Iran are involved , but I would not say by what I know that the Iranian government clearly knows or is complicit . "
Are you saying that you from this podium know more than the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff ?
Snow : I am telling you that -- I am telling you what the intelligence indicates .
Henry :
Is he not in the loop ?
I 'm just trying to understand why there 's a contradiction -- Snow : I 'll tell you what -- Henry : -- where the chairman of the Joint Chiefs -- Snow : I just know that there 's -- Ed , calm down .
I know you 're excited .
Your voice is rising , your pace is increasing -- Henry : I 'm telling you that -- I 'm telling he is saying this , I 'm not .
Snow :
Well , I 'm telling you I talked with him .
Okay ?
And I talked with him since he said -- Henry : Well , we 'll follow up with him as well .
Snow :
You better , because I think you will find out that the intelligence does indicate , as he said , this stuff was in -- let me pose you with two possibilities .
First , the intelligence indicates that the Qods forces , which are part of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard , are associated with this .
Now , let me ask a second question to you .
I do n't know what 's more frightening , the fact that the Qods forces would be operating with the knowledge of senior officials or without the knowledge of senior officials .
What is beyond dispute and what is of primary importance here -- and General Pace has n't disagreed with it , we do n't disagree .
And frankly , again , I think you 'll find upon further conversation -- he 's going to be in the air for about 23 hours , so give him a day -- that in fact you 're going to find that we generally agree on -- we agree on the basics of the situation here , which is there are armaments that have made their way from Iran into Iraq ; there are Iranian forces in Iraq ; these weapons are being used to kill Americans ; and we 'll do everything we can to protect our people .
Henry :
On the substance of it , the briefers over the weekend said that these parts are sent to Iraq with the approval of senior Iranian officials , and the bottom line , he seems to be contradicting that .
Snow :
Well , I think what General Pace may have been saying -- in fact , I know he -- he -- and this is where we get to the rhetorical question I was asking you before .
Do we have a signed piece of paper from Mr. Khamenei or from President Ahmadinejad signing off on this ?
No .
But are the Qods Forces part of the army -- part of the government ?
The answer is yes .
So the question is , I think this ends up being a semantic dispute about senior levels of the government or the government , and the fact is , the government knows about it .
Henry :
But is n't it really a question about whether or not you have strong evidence ?
When the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff seemed to be saying something different than the White House , does that raise questions about how solid this evidence is ?
Snow :
No , because you 've got -- you have explosively formed penetrators .
He says they exist ; correct ?
Henry : I did n't see that in this particular quote .
But I -- Snow :
Well , no , no .
He said that there are weapons that are coming from Iran .
Henry :
He said that there are projectiles manufactured in Iran , yes .
Snow : Okay .
All right .
So okay , so there 's no doubt about that , correct ?
Henry : Right .
Snow :
There are Iranians in Iraq .
There 's no question about that ; correct ?
Henry : Sure .
Snow :
All right , so where 's the credibility problem in terms of -- are you saying -- Henry :
In terms of the Iranian government being behind it .
That 's not -- Snow : That 's --
Henry : -- no one is disputing whether they 're manufactured in Iran .
That 's what you keep changing what my question is .
Snow : No , no .
I 'm trying to clarify your question because I think this is --
Henry :
Well , I do n't need it clarified .
I 'm trying to tell you -- I know what my question is .
And basically , he 's saying that he does n't see evidence that the Iranian government is clearly behind it .
Snow : I think --
Henry :
That 's why -- I 've asked that three our four times .
You have n't answered that .
You 're saying the Iranian government is behind it .
Snow : Okay , let me put it this way .
I 'll say it one more time .
The Qods Force is part of the Iranian government .
The Qods Force is behind it , is associated with it .
[ END VIDEO CLIP ]
Henry : Another curious aspect of this is how the information was delivered this past weekend .
It was delivered by US officials on " background " , meaning they would not have their names used .
It was also done off - camera .
That 's raising questions about whether or not those US officials wanted to be on camera , whether they were concerned about this evidence being shaky .
I put that to Tony Snow as well .
He insisted that is not the case .
It 's not because he felt the evidence was shaky .
And , finally , Tony Snow also said in this briefing that he had just recently , in the last hour or so , gotten off the phone with General Pace and insisted that General Pace is saying privately that they 're on the same page .
There 's really not a difference here .
The problem , though , is that General Pace is now , apparently , on an airplane coming back from Australia or Indonesia and -- bottom line -- we 're not going to be able to get to him for another day to get his side of the story .
Phillips : Tony
Snow was saying that the Quds are behind this , because there 's three parts to the Iranian government : the president , the radicals , the Qods , and the Clergy , which is the Ayatollah .
So he 's saying it's that part of the Iranian government that he believes is behind these weapons ?
Henry :
He 's saying that directly .
One of the questions that 's out there is these briefers over the weekend in Baghdad , these US Military officials were saying that it went to the highest level of the Iranian government .
There 's some question about exactly what that means .
Are they on the same page there as well ?
Does this really go to the highest levels of Iranian government or not ? #

There is a cultural preference for male children
The scheme is hoped to discourage the widespread practice of aborting female foetuses , which has led to a gender imbalance in parts of the country .
India outlawed gender selection and selective abortion in 1994 , but the practice still continues .
British medical journal Lancet says 10 million female foetuses have been aborted in India in the past 20 years .
Under the new scheme , poor families in seven Indian states will be paid cash at the birth of a daughter and again at different stages throughout her childhood up to the age of 18 years .
' Not poor alone '
India 's Women and Child Development Minister Renuka Choudhury said she hoped the scheme would encourage families to look upon girls as an asset rather than a liability .
One women 's rights activist welcomed the scheme , but said it was not just the poor who should be targeted .
FACTS AND FIGURES
Female infanticide occurs in 80 % of states Worst - affected states include wealthiest areas 927 girls born for every 1,000 boys Infant mortality rate : 60/1,000 Source : Unicef
" The problem of sex selective abortion is mostly with those who are above the poverty line , " said Vijayalaxmi Nanda .
" I think it is the urban , the middle class , the prosperous who are doing so .
" The pressures are myriad ... a kind of cultural preference , like dowry , like female right to inheritance , to land , to property and to other things .
These are the basic areas that need to be looked at , " Ms Nanda said .
Female foeticide is a particular problem in the wealthy northern state of Punjab - where just 793 girls are born for every 1000 boys .
Activists have called on the government to promote grassroots schemes to tackle ingrained attitudes towards women - and to elevate their status so they can also benefit from India 's rapid development .

A Houston police officer used his Taser on , then fatally shot a combative , naked 29 - year - old man Thursday afternoon in northwest Houston , police said .
The man , identified by relatives as Raymond Smith Jr. , stopped his pickup next to the officer 's cruiser in a median in the 6000 block of T.C. Jester near DeSoto .
The officer , identified today as five - year veteran Brian Bueno , had just ticketed another motorist .
Activist Quanell
X said he had talked to an eyewitness whose account of the incident differed from that of police .
According to Houston Police Department spokeswoman Johanna Abad , Smith shouted at Bueno and began to take off his clothes .
Bueno told Smith to get back into his truck and leave .
Bueno called for backup about 1 p.m. before getting out of his car and trying to subdue the man .
The officer 's Taser had no effect on Smith , Abad said .
Smith then ran into a nearby wooded area .
" The male is undressed completely , turns around and starts chasing the officer , " Abad said .
" The officer at this time begins retreating and as he is running backward , as he is retreating and seeing the guy come at him , he discharges his weapon . "
Abad said she did not know how many times Smith was shot or where he was wounded .
She also said she did not know if he was armed .
" The suspect gets up after being shot , " Abad said , " and goes into the patrol car attempting to leave ...
The officer receives backup and is being assisted in getting the suspect out of his car and in custody . "
Two other Houston police officers and a deputy constable had arrived on the scene , Abad explained .
" The suspect gets up and runs into the woods and this is where he expires . "
Hans Marticiuc , president of the Houston Police Officers Union , said Smith was shot twice , but continued to struggle with officers and was Tasered again .
Police account disputed
Family members and others at the scene questioned the version of events Abad related to reporters .
" You 'll need to come up with a better story than that ! " one person shouted .
" Why did they have to shoot him ? " another person said .
Later Thursday , Quanell X held a news conference where he produced an eyewitness , Rhonda Kersee , who he said told him she had given police a different version of the events .
It could not be confirmed late Thursday if police had taken such a statement .
Kersee , who lives nearby , told police that Smith was pulled over by Bueno , who made Smith get out of the truck and patted him down , Quanell X said .
Smith did not disrobe , but his pants may have fallen down during the search , Quanell X said the woman told him .
Kersee said Smith was brought out of the woods , handcuffed , to the officer 's car , where he may have been shot again because " there was some smoke , " Quanell X said .
HPD and the Harris County District Attorney 's Office will investigate the shooting , as is routine in such incidents .
The Harris County Medical Examiner 's Office will conduct an autopsy to determine the cause of death .
Relatives at the scene Thursday afternoon were skeptical of Bueno 's version of events .
Smith 's father , Raymond Sr. , said he could not explain his son's behavior as it was described by police .
He said that his son did not have a history of mental illness and was not on any medication .
Court records show Smith had a criminal record dating back to 1995 — eight convictions , half of them on drug charges .
The most recent charge was in 2003 .
He pleaded guilty in June of that year to the manufacture and delivery of less than a gram of a controlled substance and served almost all of a two - year prison sentence , records show .
Father of two daughters
In 2001 , Smith pleaded guilty to possession with intent to deliver a controlled substance and was sentenced to four years in prison , serving two .
In 1999 , he pleaded guilty to possession of a controlled substance and received a three - year sentence .
He served one year .
He also was convicted of evading arrest , auto theft and other drug offenses .
Smith , known to relatives as " Tukey , " was a longshoreman at the Port of Houston and the father of two daughters .
" Every time you saw him he had a smile on his face and he always wanted to give you a hug , " said Evelyn Swan , the slain man 's cousin .
" He is not a rowdy person . "
Other family members at the scene included Smith 's brother and mother , whose car was parked near the cordoned - off police scene .
His mother , Patricia , sat in her car and wailed , " My baby , my baby ! "

Upon seeing the tear in the painting , I shed a tear .
I had to subject the subject to a series of tests .
How can I intimate this to my most intimate friend ?
Let 's face it , English is a crazy language .
There is no egg in eggplant , nor ham in hamburger ; neither apple nor pine in pineapple .
English muffins were n't invented in England nor French fries in France .
Sweetmeats are candies while sweetbreads , which are n't sweet , are meat .
We take English for granted , but if we explore its paradoxes , we find that quicksand can work slowly , boxing rings are square and a guinea pig is neither from Guinea nor is it a pig .
And why is it that writers write but fingers do n't fing , grocers do n't groce and hammers do n't ham ?
If the plural of tooth is teeth , why is n't the plural of booth , beeth ?

If you have a bunch of odds and ends and get rid of all but one of them , what do you call it ?
Sometimes I think all the English speakers should be committed to an asylum for the verbally insane .
In what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital , ship by truck and send cargo by ship , have noses that run and feet that smell ?
How can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same , while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites ?
You have to marvel at the unique lunacy of a language in which your house can burn up as it burns down , in which you fill in a form by filling it out , and in which an alarm goes off by going on .
English was invented by people , not computers , and it reflects the creativity of the human race , which , of course , is not a race at all .
That is why , when the stars are out , they are visible , but when the lights are out , they are invisible .
PS . – Why does n't Buick rhyme with quick ?
You lovers of the English language might enjoy this :
There is a two - letter word that perhaps has more meanings than any other two - letter word , and that is UP .
It 's easy to understand UP , meaning toward the sky or toward the top of the list , but when we awaken in the morning , why do we wake UP ?
At a meeting , why does a topic come UP ?
Why do we speak UP and why are the officers UP for election and why is it UP to the secretary to write UP a report ?
We call UP our friends .
We use something to brighten UP a room , polish UP the silver , warm UP the leftovers , and clean UP the kitchen .
We lock UP the house and some guys fix UP the old car .
At other times the little word has real special meaning .
People stir UP trouble , line UP for tickets , work UP an appetite , and think UP excuses .
To be dressed is one thing but to be dressed UP is special .
And this UP is confusing : A drain must be opened UP because it is stopped UP .
We open UP a store in the morning but we close it UP at night .
When it threatens to rain , we say it is clouding UP .
When the sun comes out we say it is clearing UP
When it rains , it wets the earth and often messes things UP
When it does n't rain for awhile , things dry UP
We seem to be pretty mixed UP about UP !
To be knowledgeable about the proper uses of UP , look the word UP in the dictionary .
In a desk - sized dictionary , it takes UP almost 1/4th of the page and can add UP to about thirty definitions .
If you are UP to it , you might try building UP a list of the many ways UP is used .
It will take UP a lot of your time , but if you do n't give UP , you may wind UP with a hundred or more .
We could go on , but I 'll wrap it UP , for now my time is UP ; so : Time to shut UP !
Oh … one more thing :
What are the first thing you do in the morning and the last thing you do at night ?

Joe wrote earlier today about how Senator John Warner and the Pentagon are trying to Swift Boat Obama by claiming that the American soldier in Afghanistan , who complained about insufficient support from the Pentagon , does n’t even exist .
Only problem ?
NBC and ABC have interviewed the guy .
But do n’t let facts get in the way of the Pentagon ’s and John Warner ’s efforts to put another Republican in the White House .
Here is what a Pentagon spokesman said about this :
NBC quoted Bush appointee / Pentagon flack Bryan Whitman : “ I find that account pretty hard to imagine , ” Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters .
“ Despite the stress that we readily acknowledge on the force , one of the things that we do is make sure that all of our units and service members that are going into harm ’s way are properly trained , equipped and with the leadership to be successful , ” he said .
Properly trained , equipped and with the leadership they need ?
Huh ?
On leadership , they had George Bush and Donald Rumsfeld – how did that work out for you ?
On equipment , we found out just this week that hundreds of Marines are dead and wounded because the Pentagon did n’t give them the armor they needed .
Hell of a lot of nerve to make this claim the same week the Pentagon ’s own study blames them for killing our own Marines .
And finally , there ’s John Warner .
You remember him , the guy heading up the Senate Armed Service Committee , doing no oversight whatsoever , while the Pentagon was killing our Marines , and refusing to give our injured troops the medical attention they needed at places like Walter Reed .
John Warner ’s negligence killed our troops and harmed our injured .
He is the last person who should be talking about whether our troops are getting what they need .
The media needs to stop playing Republican - suck - up .
This story has now been disproven .
It ’s time to do an analysis on why the Pentagon is lying in order to influence the elections , and how John Warner is the last person who should be trusted when it comes to the safety of our troops .

This is truly amazing !
No designer involved but it ’s all about design , nevertheless !
Eliphante was created near Sedona , inover 28 years by Michael Kahn and his wife , Leda Livant .
The Residence that drew my attention through its originality was built until a progressive brain disease killed Mr. Kahn this December ( 71 years old ) .
Eliphante , The Handmade Home has a 25 - foot ceilings and incorporates rocks and scraps from construction sites , stained glass , pottery and wood and it was turned into a nonprofit arts organization in the late 1980s .
And it ’s not only the Eliphante with the fascinating history .
The couple who built it also has one .
Ms. Livant was 45 years old , married with two children and living in Westport when she met Mr. Kahn .
My husband and I went for a vacation on Cape Cod , and I met Michael , who was an artist there .
He showed me one of his large canvases , a dark blue abstract painting with a small rectangle of light .
What I saw in that particular painting was an image that invoked fear in me .
I thought , there ’s another world I have to explore .
I knew I had to open my eyes to the rest of my life .
Three months later , Ms. Livant left her family and went to live with Mr. Kahn .
People said , ‘ Leda must have gone crazy , ’.
It was n’t craziness , it was like a rebirth .
Within three weeks of my moving to Cape Cod , I got pneumonia and almost died , I was in such mourning for my family and so vulnerable , and the sadness of having left my kids has never left me .
Nine years later , the couple moved to Sedona , where two business people offered them three acres rent - free .
The lack of money never disarmed the two artists who added Hippodome to Eliphante , as the residence of Ms. Livant .
The main concern is the endangered Eliphante that ’s being planed to deed by her landlords .
Even if the original couple had a Smithsonian evaluation for conservation purposes , they never received the $ 28,000 calculation .
I guess that makes Eliphante a uniquely styled mansion handmade by two lovers connected beyond ordinary understanding endangered by very ordinary reasons – money .
Why does art in its pure form must disappear like that ?
Ca n’t we do something ?
At least have an opinion ?

If you 've rewritten that résumé several times and sent out dozens of applications but your job search still shows no promise , you might not be the problem .
One frequently overlooked but critical factor in finding a new job is your state 's unemployment rate .
You can have the experience and skills of an employer 's dream , but they wo n't do you any good if there just are n't enough jobs available .
The unemployment rate is the percentage of job seekers in the work force who are still looking for work .
The higher the percentage , the more difficult it is to find a job .
The national unemployment rate is 5 percent , based on the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics ( BLS ) .
If you 're looking for a job , you should see how your state compares to the rest of the country .
Here are the 10 worst states to find work ranked by their unemployment rates .
1. Michigan
Unemployment rate : 7.6 percent
Population : 10,071,822
Mean annual wage : $ 41,230
Top industry : Trade , transportation and utilities ( 18.4 percent ) ***
2. Mississippi

Microsoft is hoping more users will switch to Vista
Although no exact date has yet been given , Microsoft said price cuts would be introduced in 70 countries .
In the US , the cost of the most expensive version , Vista Ultimate , will be reduced to $ 319 ( £ 161 ) from the current retail price of $ 399 .
Analysts said Microsoft was aiming to boost the number of customers upgrading to Vista , which was introduced in 2007 .
' Greater opportunities '
The price cuts apply to the packaged versions of Vista , which account for less than 10 % of its sales .
By contract , 90 % of Vista sales are to PC manufacturers , where the operating system is pre-installed on their computers .
" We anticipate these changes will provide greater opportunities ... to sell more stand - alone copies of Windows , " said Brad Brooks , a Microsoft corporate vice president .
Microsoft says it has now sold 100 million Vista licences since it was launched .

Foreword
It is a great personal pleasure for me to offer these brief remarks by way of preface to a work composed by my colleagues at the Software Freedom Law Center .
As the founding director of the organization , I feel both proud of the lawyers and “ laymen ” who work at SFLC , and immensely respectful of their achievements .
Like every hacker whose late - night solo adventure has attracted a community of programmers doing every year what the originator could not have achieved in a lifetime , I am moved by the experience of becoming merely one among many — another of the minds and hands drawn to the work of inventing a better world .
I hope that as you read what follows you too will see some reflection of that basic miracle of sharing , teaching , and growing .

Chapter 1
Introduction
We at the Software Freedom Law Center are extremely fortunate because we get to provide legal assistance to some of the world ’s leading free and open source software ( FOSS ) projects .
We are inspired by the hard work and commitment of FOSS developers to produce code that can be freely shared and modified , and it is our mission to help make sure that those developers have a legal environment which allows their work to flourish .
Our intended audience for this Primer is any person interested in a basic understanding of the legal issues that impact FOSS development and distribution .
In particular , this Primer , like most of our other public work at SFLC , is addressed to two constituencies .
First , we provide creative , productive hackers insight on how to interact with the legal system — insofar as it affects the projects they work on — with a minimum of cost , fuss and risk .
Second , we present a starting point for lawyers and risk managers for thinking about the particular , at times counter - intuitive , logic of software freedom .
While these are the primary audiences we intend to reach , we hope others will benefit from this Primer as well , and we have purposefully given it a non-lawyer style of communication ( for example , by intentionally omitting dense citation of judicial or other legal authority that is the hallmark of lawyers writing for lawyers ) .
While FOSS development can raise many legal issues , a few topics predominate in our work ; these are the issues most integral to FOSS projects .
This Primer provides a baseline of knowledge about those areas of the law , intending to support productive conversations between clients and lawyers about specific legal needs .
We aim to improve the conversation between lawyer and client , but not to make it unnecessary , because law , like most things in life , very rarely has clear cut answers .
Solutions for legal problems must be crafted in light of the particulars of each client ’s situation .
What is best for one client in one situation , may very well not be best for another client in the same situation , or even the same client in the same situation at a later date or in a different place .
Law cannot yield attainable certainty because it is dynamic , inconsistent , and incapable of mastery by pure rote memorization .
This is why we do not provide forms or other tools for “ do it yourself ” lawyering , which are almost always insufficient and , in fact , can be very harmful to a project ’s interests .
The specific topics addressed herein are :
copyrights and licensing , organizational structure , patents , and trademarks .
They are presented in this order because that most closely aligns with the life - cycle of the legal needs of a typical FOSS project .
When code is written , copyrights immediately come into being .
The terms under which the owner of those copyrights allows others to copy , modify and distribute the code determine whether it is considered “ free ” and / or “ open source . ”
Once a project gains speed , many benefits can be achieved by the creation of an organizational entity for the project that is separate from the project ’s individual developers .
After successful public release of a project , patent and trademark issues may arise that need attention .
Thus , this Primer proceeds in what is , to us , a very logical order .
In closing , we are extremely pleased and honored to present this Primer and hope that it will benefit both those FOSS projects we already know and those we look forward to meeting in the future .
Chapter 2
Common Copyright Questions
Many FOSS projects face similar copyright issues .
Proper understanding of these issues when the project is young can help avoid problems later .
In this chapter , we address some of the common early copyright questions posed by FOSS projects .
Because we do not know the specifics of your project , this document provides general information , and not legal advice .
If your FOSS project has a specific need for legal advice , please contact the Software Freedom Law Center or seek other legal counsel .
All software is subject to copyright law .
The moment you save code to a file , copyright law gives you certain rights to control what other people can do with your work .
Because almost everybody who contributes code to a software project has rights with respect to their code , understanding the basics of copyright is essential to running a FOSS project .
A software copyright is the exclusive legal right to control the rules for copying , modifying , and distributing a work of software .
A person ( or company , foundation , trust , or other legal entity ) who has these exclusive legal rights is called a “ copyright holder ” .
Legal rules prohibit non-copyright holders from copying , modifying or distributing copyrighted works without permission from the copyright holder .
Copyright holders can permit other people to copy or modify their software .
That permission ( called a “ license ” ) can be as simple as a perpetual , unconditional and universal grant of permission to do any of the acts that are exclusive to the copyright holder .
Other licenses are conditional .
They allow people to copy or modify software only if certain conditions are met .
If you do n’t meet the conditions , you do n’t have permission to copy or modify the software .
If you make copies or distribute modified versions of the software without satisfying the conditions ( i.e. without permission ) , you infringe the copyright , which gives the copyright holder access to certain legal remedies .
In particular , the copyright holder can sue you for damages or ask a court to order you not to make or distribute further copies .
It is important for projects to understand the conditions in their licenses as well as those in the licenses of code they link to and code they incorporate into their project .
Complying with the conditions in the license is essential to avoiding copyright infringement .
If you have general questions about copyright , a good source of information is the U.S. Copyright office ’s Copyright FAQ .
2.1 Copyleft
One important copyright concept that originated in the world of FOSS licensing is “ copyleft ” .
“ Copyleft ” is a play on the word “ copyright ” .
Whereas copyright law has traditionally been used to withhold permission to copy , modify or distribute software , some licenses instead use copyright law to require that such permissions be granted .
Copyleft licenses are conditional licenses .
One of the conditions you must satisfy before distributing copylefted software is that any changes you make to that software be likewise released under the copylefted license .
A copyleft license ensures that all modified versions of your project remain free in the same way .
Such licenses are said to keep code “ forever free ” .
FOSS licenses can have stronger , weaker or no copyleft provisions , but they all share a common effect : creation of a large pool of software that can be combined and built upon to create new works .
Copyleft licenses require that those who take material from the common pool give something back as well .
2.2 Choosing A FOSS License
There are many FOSS licenses .
No one license meets everybody ’s needs .
Circumstances vary because licensing decisions can affect which software libraries you can use as well as the size and character of the community that gathers around a project .
Licensing decisions must be made in the context of a project ’s goals , resources , community and philosophy .
Each FOSS license balances different concerns and attempts in its own way to foster a development community that meets the licensor ’s needs .
For example , strong copyleft licenses like the GPL prioritize ensuring that all downstream recipients receive source code and permission to modify the software .
By contrast , the licenses we call “ permissive licenses ” guarantee the availability of their permissions only for the first generation of the software ; they are generally understood to permit recipients to release modified versions under more restrictive terms ( including both proprietary and copyleft terms ) .
Some licenses address issues concerning patents , demand acknowledgments of prior authors , or require recipients to take other kinds of actions .
Despite their differences , the most widely - used FOSS licenses share a common goal : creation of a large pool of software that can be combined and built upon to create new works .
When starting a new project , you should give particular consideration to the license commonly used by your peers .
Many Perl and PHP developers , for example , choose to distribute their code under the same licenses as Perl and PHP themselves .
Authors of Linux drivers usually choose GPL version 2 . OpenBSD developers often favor the ISC license .
By choosing the same license as their peers in related projects , these developers make it easier to share code and create copyright policies that are standard throughout a development community .
Most importantly , when choosing a license for your work , you must carefully consider the licenses of the existing libraries and other code which your work incorporates , adapts , or depends on .
Most FOSS licenses place some requirements on the distribution of modified versions or derivative works .
Your choice of license for your work may be constrained by the licenses of those existing works .
This becomes a practical issue most often when you wish to use a version of the GPL for your work but the license of an upstream work which your work incorporates or depends on may be considered “ incompatible ” with that version of the GPL .
Aside from these more practical concerns , you will actually adopt more than just terms of distribution when you select a license .
A license also signifies a community structure and reflects the developers ’ own histories and personal convictions .
Indeed , a license choice is often the most significant factor in predicting which developers will later be drawn to contribute to the project .
Large communities have grown up around specific licenses .
Each of these communities has its own customs , beliefs , and personalities .
Sometimes choosing a license means choosing the community that embraces that license .
Finally , we cannot stress enough the importance of picking a license that is already widely used by the FOSS community .
A familiar license makes user and developer adoption quicker and easier .
Also , if you choose a license already in wide use , there is often substantial licensing knowledge and support available to your projects .
Indeed , many licenses are shepherded by specific organizations ( e.g. , the Apache Foundation ’s stewardship of their license and the FSF ’s stewardship of the GPL ) .
Choosing a license with organizational infrastructure behind it can help foster adoption of your software and provide you and your development team with insight into how the licensing models work .
Although it is possible for you to write a new license for your code , it is inadvisable .
Each existing FOSS license was crafted to address the specific needs of a particular part of the FOSS community .
With so many licenses developed over so many years , it is extremely likely that an existing license meets the needs of your project .
If you find yourself feeling the urge to write a new license , it ’s a good sign that you might need to reconsider your approach .
Below we present several well - known licenses , or categories of licenses , that you might wish to consider for your project , depending on the specifics of your project and its goals .
This list is illustrative only , and will be expanded in future editions of this document .
2.2.1 The GNU General Public License
The GNU General Public License , version 2 ( GPLv2 ) , is the most widely used FOSS license .
Prior to 2007 , GPLv2 was the only license in common use that implemented a strong copyleft .
In 2007 the FSF published GPL version 3 ( GPLv3 ) , the first update of the GPL since 1991 .
GPLv3 has been adopted by a significant number of projects .
The vast majority of FOSS projects license their works under either a version of the GPL or a version of the GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) , which can be regarded as a more permissive variant of the GPL .
Without knowing the specifics of your project and its goals , it would be impossible to give you a definitive answer as to which license is best for your project .
However , because of its prominence , every project should at least consider a version of the GPL .
The GPL enjoys several practical advantages over other licenses and approaches licensing from a different philosophical position as well .
Most of these differences and advantages stem from the wide acceptance of the GPL and the fact that it is the only license in common use that implements a strong copyleft .
Because so many projects release under the GPL , there is a large community of code that is licensed under the GPL or at least on terms that permit combining that software with the GPL .
If your project wants the benefit of using many existing libraries or you plan to recycle a lot of found code , there ’s a good chance much of that code will be GPL - licensed .
In order to take advantage of that existing code , you ’ll need to use the GPL or a license that permits combinations with GPL - licensed software .
The popularity of the GPL provides another advantage to projects because a familiar license makes adoption easier .
Not only are people generally familiar with the license , but there is a lot of knowledge and support available for projects that use the GPL .
The Free Software Foundation ( FSF ) , which wrote and maintains the license , offers some support for developers .
They have experience in managing and enforcing GPL copyrights .
They publish material that helps people understand how to comply with the GPL .
They also operate a compliance lab to help with GPL compliance .
The strong copyleft provision is another key factor .
Most developers who get involved in FOSS enjoy the freedom to build on existing work and want to preserve that freedom for others .
These developers seek to keep enhancements to their FOSS code free from proprietary restrictions and “ forever free ” .
Please see the discussion on copyleft in § 2.1 .
There is a large community of developers who care deeply about copyleft , and many of them are more likely to devote their energy to GPL - license projects than non-GPL ’d projects .
Using the GPL can help in attracting a large development team of existing FOSS authors to a project .
Even if you do n’t choose the GPL , there are strong arguments for choosing a license that is understood to permit combination with GPL - licensed software ( i.e. , a license which the FSF , authors of the GPL , call “ compatible ” ) .
FOSS development flourishes when different codebases can be brought together ; licenses that allow such combinations are the most successful .
Code licensed under terms that do not permit such combinations are difficult to combine in the same project .
2.2.2 BSD - Style or Permissive Licenses
There are many licenses commonly referred to as “ BSD ” or “ BSD - style ” licenses .
Most of these licenses differ from each other in only minor ways , which is why they can be grouped together and described generally as “ permissive , non-copyleft ” licenses .
These licenses are permissive in that they place the bare minimum of restrictions on subsequent development and distribution .
Using these licenses is as close to releasing into the public domain as FOSS licenses get .
These are not copyleft licenses — they do nothing to preserve free software rights in downstream versions .
Moreover , these licenses do not require source code distribution .
If you choose a permissive license , other developers can incorporate your permissive - licensed code into their closed - source , proprietary product , and they can effectively conceal the modifications they made to your code .
The advantage of these and similar licenses ( i.e. the ISC License ) over more restrictive licenses like the GPL is that they are very tolerant of redistribution under a variety of licensing conditions , including under proprietary licenses .
For some projects , having their code included in proprietary software is desirable .
Many developers believe this may facilitate wide and quick adoption of the technology by both proprietary software distributors and FOSS projects .
Other people are troubled by the lack of a copyleft in BSD - style licenses .
If you object to the prospect of downstream modifications to your code disappearing inside proprietary projects , consider a license with copyleft provisions .
Here is a “ three - clause BSD - style ” license :

Finally , developers who are combining code from permissive - licensed projects with code licensed under GPL or LGPL are encouraged to read the guidance on this issue that SFLC has published .
2.2.3 The GNU Lesser General Public License
The GNU Lesser General Public License ( LGPL ) is sometimes classified as a weak copyleft .
It is much like the GPL , but it allows distribution of works forming certain types of combinations with proprietary , closed - source software that are generally assumed to be impermissible under the ordinary GPL .
In particular , the copyleft requirement in the LGPL does not extend to works that link against your work .
The LGPL is sometimes considered a “ halfway ” point between the GPL ( discussed in § 2.2.1 ) and permissive licenses ( discussed in § 2.2.2 ) .
The most widely - used version of the LGPL is version 2.1 .
In 2007 the FSF accompanied its release of GPLv3 with version 3 of the LGPL , which is explicitly written as a list of exceptional permissions added to GPLv3 .
Although the LGPL was originally aimed at libraries , you should not adopt it merely because your project is a code library , nor should you dismiss it because your software is not a library .
If enabling proprietary software to combine with your software is important to the goals of your project , the LGPL may make sense regardless of the type of software you are writing .
2.2.4 The GNU Affero General Public License
The GNU Affero General Public License , version 3 ( AGPL ) , is a variant of GPLv3 published by the FSF in late 2007 .
Like the LGPL , it can be understood as a modified version of the GPL , but whereas the LGPL provides additional permissions allowing you to use code in more circumstances , the Affero GPL contains an additional requirement that must be met if you include Affero - licensed code in your project .
This additional requirement involves network deployments of modified versions .
In general , the GPL ’s source code provision requirements apply only when software is directly distributed in object code form to a user .
If you do not distribute the software , you have no obligation to distribute source code .
Therefore , if people interact with your software in a way that does not require them to have a copy of it , most of the GPL ’s source - code provision requirements do not apply .
The most common example of such interactions is online or networked applications in a client / server environment .
For example , when a browser sends a request to a website to perform an operation ( such as database entry that occurs by way of a CGI script ) , the web server performs the operation on the client ’s behalf .
The client does not require a copy of the software to perform the operation ..
The GPL imposes no requirement to provide users who visit your website with a copy of the software that runs on your server , even if your server software is GPL - licensed software that you have modified .
In a lot of cases , this makes sense .
Servers and clients interact in a lot of circumstances , and offering source code to every client that interacts with every server would be cumbersome .
In many instances , it would be impossible .
In some cases , though , offering source code would be trivial , and yet significant improvements are made to server - side software that never get contributed back to the community .
For example , because the GPL does not require it , people rarely make the code behind their websites available to users of the site .
It is in these cases that the Affero GPL can help .
The AGPL requires that you offer corresponding source code to users who interact with your modified version of AGPL - licensed software over a network .
Therefore , if you build a server based on improvements to AGPL - licensed software , those improvements must be made available to all who use the software via the network .
Some copyleft advocates regard the AGPL as the next logical step toward software freedom .
As more and more software is delivered as a service instead of as copies of software packages , the Affero GPL can ensure that freedom endures even as distribution dwindles .
The Affero GPL is not right for everybody .
Some communities do not want the added burden of packaging their code for release to network clients .
The Affero GPL creates code distribution requirements for a class of people the FOSS world has traditionally treated more as end -users than developers .
Even though some end - users are now sophisticated enough to customize their installations of open source server software , your project might not want to require them to publish those custom changes .
Moreover , there are many individual developers as well as corporate commercial users who believe that AGPL takes the idea of copyleft too far .
If you think the Affero GPL is the license for your project , visit the FSF website for a copy of the license and some instructions on how to use it .
2.3 Copyright Assignment and Unification
With so many developers generating new copyrights almost constantly as they develop software , most FOSS projects need a process to manage , and perhaps centralize , copyrights .
Some FOSS projects require developers to transfer copyright ownership to the “ project ” ( either by assigning to the founder of the project , or to some legal entity that represents the project ) before new code is permitted into the official distribution .
Other projects instead leave individuals ’ copyrights in the hands of each contributor .
Still others require contributors to “ disclaim their copyright interest ” ( placing the contribution into the “ public domain ” ) , so that the contribution can be included under the main copyright of the work .
( The latter of those is usually done for very small contributions . )
These are all valid options , and each has its benefits and drawbacks .
The right solution for you will depend on the specifics of your project , and the specifics of each particular contribution .
Centralizing copyrights via direct copyright assignment provides some compelling advantages if developers are willing to do so .
The mild overhead of receiving such assignments is usually made up for by the legal certainty it gives the software .
In general , the most important reason to contribute copyrights to the project is to enable the project to enforce the license .
Unifying ownership of the copyrights gives the project indisputable enforcement power that is both simple and clear .
If copyright ownership is scattered throughout a developer community spanning many countries and years , enforcement efforts face additional barriers .
With a diluted base of copyright holders , enforcement efforts are hindered by figuring out which pieces were copied , tracking down the developers who contributed those pieces , and then getting them involved in the enforcement action .
Especially in cases where it is unclear how much or which code has been copied , the project needs to avoid quibbling about whose copyrights are at stake .
Another reason to unify copyrights is to avoid and prevent later competing copyright claims , such as claims that could be made by employers or developers of proprietary software .
A project ’s copyright assignment process should include questions and instructions designed to identify code with ownership issues , and the code intake process should include mechanisms for dealing with such issues .
For example , each contributor should be asked about her employment situation , and whether or not she is ( a ) working on the software with her employer ’s equipment or time , and ( b ) if an agreement exists between the contributor and employer regarding rights to code developed off the employer ’s premises on the contributor ’s own time and equipment .
Many contributors may not realize ( or remember ) that their employment agreement gives their employer a copyright interest in software worked on at home on their own equipment .
Asking such questions early as part of a copyright assignment process can expose these problems before the contribution is put into the code repository and becomes a difficult copyright infringement issue for the project .
If your project decides to unify copyrights , developers need not give up their rights to use that code in other projects , even proprietary ones !
The copyright assignment can include a license back to the author which grants the author the same benefits as a copyright holder .
This includes rights not granted by the project ’s FOSS licenses , such as permission for proprietary relicensing .
The author can thus do anything with the code that she was able to do before she assigned it to the project ( except for granting an exclusive assignment to somebody else ) .
2.4 Copyright for Documentation , Websites and Supporting Material
The easiest way to approach licensing issues for documentation and other non-code materials related to your project is to consider them as interrelated and sometimes integrated parts .
Because they are often distributed together , it is a good idea to have similar rules apply to both your software and the related materials .
Good software should include documentation , and good documentation sometimes includes bits of code .
For the sake of simplicity , many projects release their documentation under the same license as their code .
Because of this , we are often asked whether the GPL is a suitable license for documentation .
It is , although it is not ideal .
The licensing questions for documentation and websites are different from those questions in relation to code .
Keep in mind that the licenses discussed above were specifically designed for software projects and sometimes have strange and confusing implications when applied to non -software works .
We encourage you to investigate carefully the plethora of documentation licenses available in the FOSS world , which include the GNU Free Documentation License and the Creative Commons Attribution - ShareAlike License .
2.5 Copyright Enforcement
Sometimes FOSS licenses are violated .
This generally occurs when somebody distributes copylefted FOSS code as part of non-free , closed - source , proprietary products .
Often , it is merely because of some confusion about the copyleft terms of distribution ( although other forms of violation , such as failure to attribute authors , also occur ) .
If this happens to your project , there are several things you can do about it ; but get organized before you act :
2.5.1 Gather the facts
Verify that your copyrighted code is being distributed or copied in violation of your license .
Exactly what code is copied in what product , and who holds the copyright to that code ?
Who , exactly , is violating the license and of what does that violation consist ?
If you can , use software tools available for analyzing binary files ( such as , on GNU / Linux systems , strings and strace ) to confirm that your software is in the product .
2.5.2 Familiarize yourself with the license
Know what licenses apply to the code , who holds the copyrights and what those licenses say .
Pay attention to license versions .
There are multiple versions and variations of numerous licenses , including the GPL , BSD - style licenses , the PHP license and the Apache license .
You should truly and completely understand the obligations imposed by the license before you can explain to a violator how to comply .
The GPL in particular is a lengthy license with a lot of requirements .
If you cannot explain the GPL , it will be hard to convince a violator to comply .
If you have questions , you can consult the Software Freedom Law Center website and the Free Software Foundation website .
These sites have a lot of information that will help you understand the GPL and explain it to others .
2.5.3 Contact other copyright holders
Aggregating claims increases leverage .
Groups of copyright holders should designate one point - person to handle communication with the violator .
Other members of the group should avoid making statements about the matter ( whether to the violator , in public or in private communication ) and refer all inquiries to the point - person .
2.5.4
Ask the violator to fix the problem
Be polite but firm .
It is often the case that license violations are inadvertent and easily fixed .
Offer to help the violator take whatever steps are needed to achieve compliance , and avoid threats of publicity and lawsuits for as long as possible .
Make sure the violator understands that your primary concern is the issue of freedom , not a large financial settlement ..
Once you convince them of that point , they are likely to respond more positively even if they were initially unresponsive .
The best way to ask the violator to fix the problem is to send a letter , via as many different methods as possible ( at least by email , courier service , and fax ) .
Below is some text you might include in a sample letter that can help start a conversation about fixing the problem .
Although it specifically mentions the GPL , you should adjust it to the specifics of your license and the violation in question .

2.6 Copyright Registration
Projects sometimes ask us about registering their copyrights .
You do not need to register in order to have a valid copyright .
You do not need to register to enforce your copyright .
However , registration can provide a project with better options and an increased ability to enforce its copyright license against violators .
If you want to register your copyright , you can download the copyright registration form from the federal Copyright Office as well as instructions on how to fill it out .
Chapter 3
Common Organizational Issues
This chapter addresses the common legal organizational issues facing FOSS projects .
It is intended to give these projects background nonprofit corporate and tax information to assist them in the process of evaluating how best to form and manage their organizations and activities .
If your free software project has a specific need for legal advice , please contact the Software Freedom Law Center or seek other legal counsel .
Social organizational issues , such as how to maintain your project , manage contributions and build community , while very important , are not addressed in this guide .
3.1 Corporate Form
There are a number of different ways to organize a free software project : as an unincorporated organization , as a nonprofit corporation , as part of an umbrella organization or as an individual acting independently , for example .
A threshold question to ask is whether or not the project would benefit from adopting a formal organizational structure .
Advantages to adopting a corporate form include some protection from liability and having a vehicle for handling assets for the project .
A formal corporate entity can also be useful to provide continuity to a project , since the corporate form and identity remains as the individual developers and maintainers increase and decrease their involvement in the project .
Individual Liability
Developers working alone , apart from any corporate form , are not shielded from personal liability for project - related activities .
If a developer takes donations or otherwise receives money for working on a solo project , the developer must report that compensation as personal income and pay income taxes on it .
Likewise , all legal liability to third parties will fall to the developer .
For example , the developer may be liable to users for breach of any express warranties made regarding the software , or any implied warranties that are not effectively disclaimed .
Claims by other software producers for copyright , patent , or trademark infringement could also be brought directly against the developer .
While there may be advantages to one - developer projects , it is important to realize that the personal assets of the developer could be completely exposed .
Formal legal structures , while not a panacea , can help developers to manage their liability and risk .
3.1.1 Unincorporated Associations
Unincorporated associations are groups of individuals acting together as an association without incorporation , and often without undergoing the formalities of formation .
Unincorporated associations can be organized with a constitution and bylaws .
They generally do not have to register with or report to a state , but will be held liable for federal and state taxes if they do not obtain the appropriate exemptions .
In some states , unincorporated associations cannot hold real property , but they usually open a bank account and otherwise hold assets .
For unincorporated associations , there is no liability shield against individual liability .
The associations can only be sued when the plaintiff has a cause of action against all of its members , but individual members can be held liable for acts they ratify or participate in .
While there are some benefits to unincorporated organizations , the rules governing unincorporated organizations vary state to state and often the organizational obligations of unincorporated associations approach that of incorporated ones .
This guide primarily discusses the issues raised in forming and running incorporated organizations .
3.1.2 Nonprofit Corporations
Since legally a corporation is usually treated as a “ person , ” the corporation bears the liabilities and receives the benefits of the corporation ’s actions , rather than the individuals who are involved in the organization ’s operations .
While this is a clear benefit to organizing a corporation , a court could “ pierce the corporate veil ” and disregard the corporate entity if the individuals involved commingle their funds with those of the corporation or fail to maintain the appropriate corporate records ( like minutes of board meetings , for example ) .
If this should occur , the individuals involved would be personally liable for the responsibilities of the corporation .
Additionally , individuals could be personally liable for negligent behavior or illegal activities .
Creating and maintaining a corporate form is a lot of work , as we discuss below , and may not be the appropriate organizational structure for a FOSS project .
If the project does not consist of more than a few individual developers it may make sense to continue to work in an individual capacity .
3.1.3 Umbrella Organizations and Fiscal Sponsors
Another option available to free software projects is to join an already existing nonprofit organization .
There are several tax exempt organizations that act as an umbrella organization and provide fiscal sponsorship to the free software projects that join them .
The key advantage to joining an umbrella organization is that new projects do not have to bear the expense or administrative burden of incorporation .
Umbrella organizations establish their own board of directors , keep the books for the organization and ensure that the entire organization conducts its activities in accordance with the appropriate state corporate laws and the federal and state tax laws .
Software Freedom Conservancy
Because many of its clients could benefit from the protections of having a legal entity as well as tax exemption status , but were reluctant to pay the fees associated with formation or dedicate the time necessary to start and maintain a tax exempt nonprofit , the Software Freedom Law Center has established The Software Freedom Conservancy .
Since its launch in 2006 , the Conservancy has grown to include free and open source software projects active in a wide range of fields .
Projects that wish to join the Conservancy must apply to be evaluated by the Conservancy ’s Project Evaluation Committee .
Once a project joins , it can receive donations that are deductible to donors under U.S. tax law and benefit from financial and administrative services that the Conservancy offers .
The Conservancy has chosen not to charge administrative fees to its member projects and to rely on donations to support its activities at the umbrella level .
It does not require that projects assign their copyrights to the Conservancy , nor does it require that they choose any one particular free software license .
Other umbrella organizations
There are several other umbrella organizations organized specifically for free software projects .
Each of these organizations has its own rules about joining .
Some projects require the assignment of all of the project ’s copyrights while others do not .
Different organizations allow their member projects to have different levels of control over their finances and operations .
Examples of such free and open source software organizations are :
The Apache Foundation , which has a project called Incubator , created to help new projects to join the foundation .
The Free Software Foundation acts as an umbrella organization for its projects .
The FSF ’s model has a philosophical component and its projects must meet certain requirements prior to joining .
Software in the Public Interest was originally formed as a corporate structure for Debian and has expanded to include a number of other free software projects .
SPI is in the process of developing guidance for new projects interested in joining .
3.2 Incorporation
The first step in establishing an independent nonprofit is to create a legal entity .
While it is not necessary to retain a lawyer to assist you with your incorporation , it can be helpful to have the assistance of one to help you through the process and to make sure that the organization complies with all of the relevant state and federal laws .
This description of the steps towards corporate formation should be used as only a guide .
You should consult with a lawyer and / or examine all state and federal rules closely throughout the formation process .
3.2.1 Where to Incorporate
The process for incorporating varies by state , so you will need to inquire as to the requirements in your home state ( or any state in which the organization has offices or is conducting its business ) .
Generally , the incorporator can choose which state should be the nonprofit ’s home state .
Nonprofits often choose to incorporate in Delaware , where there are fewer administrative hurdles to incorporation and the process is quick ( Delaware has expedited same day incorporation for a fee ) .
A potential pitfall , however , is that some states have requirements for corporations formed elsewhere that are conducting activities in the state which could make it more advantageous to keep the incorporation local .
For example , corporations organized outside of New York are considered foreign corporations by the state of New York and are required to pay fees and be subject to New York regulations if they conduct a significant amount of their activities or have an office within the state .
For this reason , it usually does not make sense for an organization primarily located in New York to incorporate elsewhere .
Many other states have requirements that corporations register as foreign corporations doing business in that state which could incur additional fees and administrative burdens to the organization .
In states where the organization does not have a presence in the state that has been chosen for incorporation ( for example , having a key director or officer residing in that state ) , an agent for service of process may need to be appointed .
This ensures that there is someone present in the state to receive legal notices and other official documents .
There is an entire industry that has formed around this requirement and there are many for - profit companies that can be hired to perform this function .
To appoint an agent , a project will generally need to sign a letter of appointment and also pay an annual fee .
Many agents will offer other services , such as handling incorporation and annual reporting which may be expensive but can also ease the burden of handling the paperwork directly .
Many states maintain websites that often provide links to forms and other information regarding incorporation , including California , Delaware , and New York .
3.2.2 Choosing a Name
Some states allow organizations to reserve their name in advance of incorporation .
If there is some reason for delay in incorporation , using these procedures to reserve a name could be helpful if it is likely that another nonprofit organization or company would be interested in using the same name ( See § 5 for a discussion of trademark concerns that may arise in this process ) .
The organization ’s name should be unique and descriptive .
Some states have restrictions on using certain words within the name of the organization .
For example , words that imply a certain kind of government office , savings and loan reference or professional license may not be permissible names of the organization without special permission .
Examples of this could be “ State Police , ” “ Bank , ” “ Lawyer , ” or “ Trust . ”
Some states also require that the words “ corporation ” or “ incorporated ” be used in the name of the organization .
In these cases , it will be necessary to include “ , Inc ” after the name of the nonprofit , even though the corporation is a nonprofit corporation .
This might have the result that the name of the organization looks like “ FOSS Project Foundation , Inc. ” , but this requirement will be uniform for states that require it .
Some states do not have this requirement and the organization can be named without the corporate indicator .
3.2.3 Formation Documents
There are a number of documents that are necessary to prepare during the formation process .
Many existing free software organizations keep this corporate documentation available on their websites and are a good resource to understand the different ways that these documents can be drafted .
A nonprofit ’s certificate of incorporation is the first document that the organization will have to create .
The corporate divisions of many states provide forms of their certificate of incorporation on their websites .
The certificate of incorporation is a standard document , describing the basic ways in which the nonprofit will be formed .
Most nonprofits will organize as non-stock nonprofit corporation , meaning that there are no owners of the corporation .
The corporation is created in the public interest so there can be no shareholders or other owners that have a stake in the corporation .
The certificate of incorporation states the project ’s address and states the purpose of the organization .
Generally , it is advantageous to state the nonprofit ’s purposes as broadly as possible in the certificate of incorporation so that the description encompasses all of the activities that the organization might engage in over the life of the organization .
The certificate of incorporation must also include certain provisions if the organization intends to apply for federal tax exemption .
The corporate workings of the organization are set forth in the nonprofit ’s bylaws .
The bylaws describe whether or not the nonprofit will have members , how many directors there will be and what their powers are , what officers will be appointed or elected and it can also state financial controls and procedures .
The bylaws are adopted by the board of directors , but free software projects have a great deal of flexibility about how that document can be developed .
Some projects merely adopt generally applicable bylaws , leaving the directors with significant flexibility in managing the organization .
Others create a public commenting process to ensure that the needs of the community are codified in detail in the document .
Meetings of the directors must be recorded in the board ’s minutes that should be kept in the organization ’s corporate records .
Most important decisions about the organization will be decided at these meetings , and the minutes comprise the paperwork support of these decisions .
Where it is not possible to organize a meeting time that is sufficient for a quorum of directors , directors can also sign consents in lieu of a meeting ( meetings , which generally are required to take place at least once annually , can be by phone or in person ; it is not clear in most states whether electronic meetings without any telephony component are sufficient ) .
Consents simply set forth the decision that the directors agree to , and can be signed by each director separately with binding effect on the whole upon signature by the proper number of directors .
Organizations should also apply for an EIN , or an employer identification number , from the IRS .
As the name suggests , this number is required by federal law if the organization has employees , but it is necessary to have if the organization intends to open a bank account and can be useful to help the nonprofit transact business .
An EIN is is analogous to a social security number for corporate entities .
The process to obtain an EIN is simple and can be done by phone or online .
3.3 Governance
A project that forms its own independent legal entity must form a board of directors who are responsible for the overall management of the organization .
Laws differ from state to state , but many states require a minimum of three directors .
Depending on how the project is organized and maintained , a different number of directors might make sense .
If the project already has an advisory council or small group of project leaders , those individuals could assume the duties of director .
Projects might want to consider including directors that are not directly involved in the development of their software , but have free software project management or nonprofit organizational experience .
It can be helpful to have directors with a wide perspective on the board .
An odd number of directors can help avoid an even split of votes on contentious issues .
Becoming a director of a nonprofit organization is a serious responsibility and can be quite time consuming .
Directors are bound by both a duty of care and a duty of loyalty to the organization .
To satisfy their duty of care , directors must act with the same care that an ordinary , prudent person would exercise in a like position or under similar circumstances .
The duty of loyalty requires that directors act in good faith , be faithful to the organization and pursue the organization ’s best interests .
Directors also have an obligation to act in accordance with the mission , rules and policies of the organization .
To satisfy these obligations , directors must stay informed about the activities of the organization so that they can make informed decisions and stay independent .
They must promote the organization ’s mission and avoid acting in self interest .
Where potential conflicts of interest arise , directors must disclose the conflicts as soon as possible to the board , avoid influencing other board members and , depending on the nature of the conflict , recuse themselves from voting on that issue .
Directors should be particularly vigilant to avoid conflicts relating to contracts and relationships established between the organization and the director as an individual , or with another organization or company in which that board member has influence .
Organizations should consider creating a document setting forth directors ’ obligations to the organization for potential directors to read and agree to in advance of becoming a director in the organization .
This could help avoid confusion over the life of the organization and help the directors to be aware of and remain focused on their duties to the organization .
3.4 Bookkeeping
It is important that nonprofit organizations keep good books and records of their financial activities .
This is necessary to be able to present appropriate back - up in the case of an audit or other inquiry later in the organization ’s lifetime , but also to ease in the preparation of state and federal filings .
Additionally , keeping good financial records of the nonprofit ’s activities assists the organization with continuity and eases any future transition of personnel .
For example , in the case where an organization ’s volunteer treasurer realizes that the obligations of the position are too great and chooses to resign , the transition to a new treasurer is much more likely to be a smooth process if the books are organized and complete , allowing the new treasurer to assume the responsibilities of the position easily .
Ideally , financial transactions will be recorded using accounting software , such as GNU Cash .
Nonprofits can also employ an external professional bookkeeper to assist with the books .
Professional bookkeepers are useful in helping new organizations start running their operations in an organized manner , and can help make it easier to avoid problematic uses of funds such as the commingling of moneys .
3.5 Tax Exemption Recognition
One of the advantages to forming as a nonprofit organization is that the project may be eligible for federal tax exemption as a charitable organization under § 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) of the Internal Revenue Code .
In addition to an exemption from some taxation by the federal and state governments , tax exempt organizations can receive donations for which the donors can take deductions on their own taxes .
The IRS has regularly recognized organizations created for the promotion of free and open source software projects as having charitable purposes .
To initiate the process towards recognition of tax exemption , nonprofits must complete the IRS ’s Form 1023 .
The form gives basic information about the organization and requires the organization to submit a detailed description of its activities , including the percentage of the organization ’s activities that are spent on each particular activity .
The form also requires that the organization provide three years of financial history or , if the organization has recently been created , a budget of what the organization expects to receive in donations and income and what and how it expects to spend its money .
The IRS publishes detailed instructions that provide guidance as to how to properly complete the form .
Organizations that receive recognition of tax exemption are obligated to make their applications available on request , which can be a useful resource if another nonprofit that has similar operations has already obtained its recognition .
Nonprofits now have ( with extensions ) 27 months from formation to achieve tax exemption recognition that applies retroactively to formation .
The tax exemption recognition process will take several months , even if the IRS has no objection to the filing .
If the IRS has any concerns about the application , the reviewer will contact the organization and provide a list of questions that he or she will give the organization the opportunity to address .
3.5.1 Restricted Activities
Once a nonprofit achieves 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax exempt status from the IRS , there are certain restrictions preventing the organization from spending money or conducting certain activities .
Some specific activities that are restricted ( and can jeopardize the organization ’s tax exempt status ) include lobbying activities and spending money in ways other than are consistent with the charitable purposes of the organization .
Also , none of the organization ’s earnings may inure to any private individual .
Lobbying
A 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) nonprofit may not attempt to influence legislation as a substantial part of its activities and it may not participate in any campaign activity for or against political candidates .
The law offers no clear test for what amounts to a substantial amount of legislative activities .
While one court opinion indicated that lobbying expenditures of less than five percent of an organization ’s resources did not represent a substantial part of its activities , courts differ in their opinion and others recommend that no more than 15 % of an organization ’s total expenditures be for lobbying .
The IRS offers an alternative test called the Expenditure Test which examines certain permissible and impermissible expenditures in an attempt to provide clearer rules for organizations that engage in some lobbying .
If your organization is engaging in more than a trivial amount of lobbying activities or resource allocation you should seek legal advice from an attorney .
3.5.2 Public Support Test
The IRS classifies charitable organizations by the ways in which their funding is received .
Organizations that are broadly funded by the public are considered to be publicly supported and organizations that received most of their income from a few sources are considered to be private foundations .
Private foundations have strict rules and regulations about their use of funds and dealings with contributors that are not applicable to publicly supported organizations .
The IRS has established a test to determine whether or not a nonprofit ’s funding can be considered as “ public support . ”
In making the calculation , organizations tally the amount of money received from public donations , where the amount from any one contributor can only be included up to two percent of the total amount of the organization ’s funding .
This amount is then divided by the total amount of funding that the organization received in that year .
To be considered publicly supported , organizations must have received over a third of their funds from “ public support . ”
There is also a “ facts and circumstances ” test , applicable where the organization has received more than ten percent of its funds as “ public support ” and has other circumstances that show the public nature of the organization ( for example , the public nature of the board , a strong program to solicit funds from the public or services that appeal to a broad segment of the public ) .
The IRS acknowledges that new organizations may not be able to meet the public requirements within the first years of their operations and so new nonprofits can apply for an advanced ruling of public support at the same time as they apply for recognition of tax exempt status .
Organizations that obtain the advance ruling must satisfy the public support test by the end of the five year period .
Organizations that cannot show that they are publicly supported at the end of the period will be required to pay taxes for the previous five year period .
3.5.3 Related and Unrelated Business Income
Nonprofits are also able to receive income from business activities , which can include , for example , selling educational materials , selling t- shirts or other merchandise and selling services .
If the business activities are furthering the nonprofit ’s corporate mission , the income is considered “ related business income . ”
Other activities are considered “ unrelated business income . ”
If the income is related business income , the income is not taxed .
Related business income is not considered in the public support test , which could be advantageous , since in the calculation of public support , as discussed above ( where the numerator is “ public support ” and the denominator is all of the organization ’s support ) , related business income is not included in either of the numerator or the denominator .
Related business income is limited in that a publicly supported charity must not depend primarily on gross receipts from related activities .
If the income is unrelated business income , the income will be taxed .
Generally , organizations that expect to receive more than $ 500 in unrelated business income must also pay estimated taxes .
In calculating public support , unrelated business income is included in the denominator but not the numerator , so the more unrelated business income that an organization recognizes , the more money it will need to show in public support to maintain its public charity status .
Additionally , if an organization receives most of its support from income , rather than donations , it will move from being a 509 ( a ) ( 1 ) organization to a 509 ( a ) ( 2 ) organization , in which case it will be subject to an additional test that less than a third of its total support must be from unrelated business activities .
For 509 ( a ) ( 2 ) organizations , the public support test is a little different for related business income in that it is included in both the numerator and the denominator instead of excluded ( there are exceptions to this including an exception that money from persons with certain relationships to the organization be excluded from the numerator ) .
3.6 Filings
Organizations must remain vigilant about staying compliant with all of the applicable federal and state laws and must be sure to make the appropriate filings on time .
Generally , an organization will need to make an annual federal tax filing , an annual state tax filing and often annual corporate filings .
For 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) tax exempt organizations , the federal government requires an Annual Information Return on Form 990 .
If the organization receives less than $ 100,000 a year , it may be eligible to submit a shorter form of this , called a Form 990 - EZ .
If the organization normally receives less than $ 25,000 per year , it may not be required to file the Form 990 at all .
An organization must file Form 990 - T if it has $ 1,000 or more of gross receipts from unrelated business during the year .
Nonprofits should check to make sure that they satisfy all appropriate state filings .
For example , many states require that organizations that receive over a certain amount of income must have an audit performed on their annual financials .
New York State , for example , requires that the audit and a copy of the financial statements be filed with the Charities Bureau .
If your organization has a significant income , it is recommended that you consult with an accountant and a lawyer to make sure that your organization is compliant with all of the appropriate requirements .
Chapter 4
Patent Defenses for FOSS Developers
There is a tendency both to overestimate and underestimate the threat that patents pose to FOSS .
Patent holders are unlikely to sue individual developers or nonprofit organizations associated with FOSS projects , since they do not hold substantial assets or enjoy a revenue stream from which substantial patent royalties could be extracted .
Nevertheless , such lawsuits are not without precedent and might be a tactic employed by proprietary software companies competing unsuccessfully with FOSS projects .
Moreover , commercial distributors and users of a FOSS project are a likely target for litigious patent holders , and suits against such parties may adversely affect the entire community surrounding the project , including the developers producing the software .
Furthermore , some patent - holding competitors of FOSS projects engage in non-litigious conduct calculated to disrupt such projects and their communities by fostering the perception that the projects carry significant patent risk .
This chapter provides guidance to FOSS developers who wish to protect their projects and their users against patent risk .
It focuses on defensive measures that developers can take if they have been threatened by a patent holder with allegations of patent infringement .
There are many other issues involving the relationship between patents and FOSS that are beyond the scope of this document .
This document deals solely with U.S. law .
Because we do not know the specifics of your project , we provide general information , and not legal advice .
If your project has a specific need for legal advice , please contact the Software Freedom Law Center or seek other legal counsel .
4.1 Structure of a Patent
This subsection briefly describes some of the more important features to look for when reviewing a patent .
The parts of the patent other than the drawings and claims are referred to as the specification .
Every patent has a title .
The title tends to be worded rather broadly , but it has essentially no legal significance .
Some FOSS developers mistakenly assume the title has some bearing on the content or scope of the patent claims ; it does not .
Each patent has a seven - digit number that identifies it .
The front page of the patent also lists the application number of the patent , which was used to identify the application before it issued as a patent .
The front page also lists the past U.S. patents and other past publications that were formally considered by the patent examiner during the examination or “ prosecution ” process .
( Such publications constitute a form of “ prior art . ” )
The abstract is supposed to provide a brief summary of the invention disclosed in the patent .
As with the title , many non-lawyers make the mistake of assuming that the abstract defines the scope of the patent .
In fact , the abstract has little if any legal significance , although it may sometimes have some bearing on the interpretation of the patent claims .
The drawings accompany the body of the patent , and are supposed to help illustrate the implementation of the invention described in the body of the patent .
Drawings in software - related patents most commonly include system diagrams and flowcharts .
Some patents list related patent applications ( any of which might already have issued into a patent ) .
There are various ways in which patents might be related to one another .
For example , a patent application might have been divided into multiple “ divisionals ” if the patent examiner determines that the application claimed more than one invention .
In other cases , the patent applicant might have filed a “ continuation , ” with additional patent claims , based on the original application .
The family trees of patents can be very complex .
The main body of the specification usually includes sections purporting to provide the background of the invention and a summary of the invention , and always includes a section known as the detailed description .
The background of the invention historically tended to give the applicant ’s view of the prior art , but this has become increasingly uncommon as applicants fear that any statements about the prior art will be used to limit the scope of the patent .
Nevertheless , this section may be useful in indicating what is not covered by the patent .
The summary of the invention , despite its name , should not be assumed to give a reliable summary of the invention as claimed in the patent .
The detailed description is supposed to describe a particular implementation of the invention , and is supposed to provide enough information to enable a “ person having ordinary skill in the art ” to replicate the claimed invention without undue experimentation .
Whether the disclosures in most software - related patents actually meet this standard is open to question .
4.1.1 Claims
The claims , which are the most important part of the patent , appear at the end of the patent .
The claims define what the patent actually covers .
When you read a patent , it is usually a good idea to begin at the end , with the claims , and use the rest of the patent primarily as an aid in interpreting the scope of the claims .
( It is common for patent attorneys to draft claims before drafting any other part of a patent application . )
Each claim is a single sentence .
Claims begin with a “ preamble ” followed by one or more “ limitations . ”
The division between the preamble and the limitations is usually , but not always , clear .
The preamble might seem to restrict the claim in some way , such as by stating what might look to you like a field of use .
However , you cannot generally assume that the preamble will actually have any limiting effect .
Claims are classified as either independent or dependent claims .
Independent claims are those claims that make no reference to other claims in the patent .
Dependent claims explicitly incorporate the contents of other claims in the patent .
A dependent claim is necessarily narrower in scope than the claim from which it depends , because it includes an additional limitation not present in the incorporated claim .
Software - related patent claims in recently - issued patents often take the form of “ system ” or “ apparatus ” claims , “ method ” claims , and “ computer program product ” or “ computer - readable medium ” claims .
System claims recite the elements of a system ( which might include one or more computers ) as a kind of machine or static object .
Method claims are algorithmic in form .
Computer - readable medium claims typically duplicate the limitations found in corresponding system or method claims in the patent , but are intended to cover software embodied in a storage or distribution medium .
Such claims are particularly designed to make distributors directly liable for patent infringement .
Computer - readable medium claims are also often used when claiming inventions that focus on data structures and user interfaces .
4.1.2 File Wrapper
Not part of the patent itself , the file history or “ file wrapper ” of a patent collects all the written communication that took place between the patent applicant and the patent examiner during prosecution of the patent application .
It will include “ office actions ” mailed by the examiner , which may contain rejections of the patent application ’s claims based on prior art or other grounds , and “ amendments ” modifying the claims or counter - arguments submitted by the applicant .
File wrappers can be ordered from the USPTO through its Public PAIR website or from a commercial service .
Every statement made by the patent applicant that is recorded in the file wrapper potentially has a limiting effect on the scope of the patent .
The file wrapper can therefore be valuable when developing non-infringement determinations , discussed below .
4.2 Patent Infringement
To prove that you infringe a patent , the patent holder must show that you make , use , offer to sell , or sell the invention as it is defined in at least one claim of the patent .
As those verbs are understood , they overlap closely with the acts that FOSS licenses permit as a matter of copyright law .
( For example , “ selling ” includes any act of distribution , even if such distribution is free of charge . )
Informally , and for simplicity , we speak of the software itself as infringing a patent , although strictly speaking this is not correct , and it has probably given rise to misconceptions in the FOSS community regarding whether particular software is “ patent - encumbered . ”
For software to infringe a patent , the software essentially must implement everything recited in one of the patent ’s claims .
It is crucial to recognize that infringement is based directly on the claims of the patent , and not on what is stated or described in other parts of the patent document .
If a court determines that you have infringed a patent , the patent holder is entitled to have the court stop you from infringing and assess money damages that you must pay for past infringement .
Even if you modify the code to avoid the claims of the patent , you may still be liable for infringement that preceded the modification .
Lack of prior knowledge of a patent is not a defense to patent infringement .
It is also no excuse that you independently came up with the ideas implemented in your software .
( However , under current law , you may have a defense if you can prove that your independent invention preceded the patent holder ’s invention , or that your invention preceded the filing date of the patent by at least one year . )
4.3 Becoming Aware of a Patent
There are various ways in which you might become aware of a specific patent .
The patent holder might publicize it , a FOSS developer might call attention to it , a user might ask you about it , or you might discover it in a web search .
The patent holder might also contact you directly .
For example , the patent holder might send a letter accusing you of infringing a patent , or offering to license the patent to you .
The guidance given in this document is applicable regardless of how you learn of the patent .
If you receive threats from a patent holder , contact the Software Freedom Law Center or another lawyer immediately .
We generally do not recommend that you attempt to search patents or published pending patent applications .
U.S. patent law creates disincentives for searching , even though one of the main justifications given for the patent system is that the disclosure in the specification teaches the public how to practice an invention that might otherwise be secret .
Those who become aware of the existence of a patent are subject to enhanced damages if they are found to have subsequently infringed “ willfully . ”
Moreover , we find that developers often assume that the patents they discover are broader in scope than they actually are , and thus such developers become overly or needlessly worried .
If , despite this , you do intend to conduct a patent search , you should seek legal advice first .
4.4 Understanding the Claims
If you have become aware of a patent that you believe may threaten your project , your first step should be to ascertain the meaning of the claims .
This is not a simple task , because patent claims are drafted artfully , using jargon unique to patent attorneys , and are often deliberately drafted in an obscure manner .
You should first try to determine the “ plain meaning ” of the claims .
Terms in patent claims are presumed to have their ordinary and customary meanings , which include definitions in use in the relevant technical field .
If some of the words in the claims cannot be properly interpreted using the plain meaning approach ( for example , if a claim has multiple interpretations ) , you should interpret the claims based on definitions of terms in the patent specification , the file wrapper , or other sources , such as technical papers or your own technical expertise .
Depending on how artfully the patent application was drafted , this may prove to be a difficult task .
Patent attorneys sometimes make up their own terminology to obscure the relationship between the claims and the prior art , and they often use non-limiting examples rather than definitions in the specification .
If the patent examiner rejected claims in the patent application over prior art , the file wrapper might show that the prosecuting patent attorney supplied some definition of a term in order to avoid that prior art .
4.5 Building Defenses
Once you have some understanding of the scope of the claims , you should work with your attorney to develop defenses that will reduce the risk presented by the patent .
Four important defenses are license , non-infringement , invalidity , and unenforceability .
Of these , it is especially useful to develop and document an informed , good - faith argument that ( a ) even if the patent is valid , your software does not infringe it , and ( b ) the patent is not valid .
4.5.1 License
You may be able to show that you have a license to use the patent , or some similar immunity from suit by the patent holder .
Such promises may take a number of explicit and implicit forms in addition to formal patent license agreements .
For example , some patent - holding companies have issued general public pledges or covenants that apply to the use of FOSS .
The patent holder might have agreed with a standards body to provide royalty - free access to patents needed to implement the standard .
The patent holder might also have granted a license by contributing or distributing code under a FOSS license , as some FOSS licenses include explicit patent license grants .
A patent holder providing code under a FOSS license without an explicit patent license grant , such as GPLv2 , would nonetheless probably be held to have granted a license implicitly to recipients of the code , though the scope and coverage of such an implied license would be difficult to establish .
Your attorney should carefully examine the document that contains ( or implies ) the non-assertion promise to determine who and what are actually covered under it .
In many cases such promises are quite narrow and will provide no reliable protection for your project .
4.5.2 Noninfringement
A noninfringement determination is a showing that none of the patent claims actually “ read on ” your software .
In other words , your software does not actually implement what is recited in each claim .
To make a noninfringement determination , you normally need to show only that there is one limitation of each independent claim that is not practiced by your software .
Because a dependent claim is , by definition , narrower than the claim from which it depends , if your software does not infringe a particular claim , it necessarily cannot infringe any of that claim ’s dependent claims .
This saves you time in making the noninfringement determination , because for each claim that you demonstrate is not infringed , you can ignore the claims that depend from it .
For a claim , such as a method claim , that recites a series of steps , the order in which the steps are listed is generally irrelevant , unless the claim clearly indicates otherwise .
Ordinarily , then , if a claim recites a method for doing A , B , and C , you infringe the claim even though you do those steps in reverse order .
Moreover , except in unusual cases , it is not a defense to infringement of a claim that your software performs additional steps , or includes additional features , beyond those recited in the claim .
Claims typically include verbs like “ comprising ” or “ including ” ( often linking the preamble to the recited claim limitations ) , and those verbs are conventionally understood to be open - ended , meaning “ including , but not limited to . ”
The degree to which the patent claim elements must be read literally in determining infringement varies , depending on circumstances in the prosecution history of the patent .
In some cases , your software would have to implement each claim element exactly as described in the claim in order to infringe .
In other cases , your implementation need only be “ substantially equivalent . ”
This depends particularly on whether the patent applicant amended the claims during prosecution in order to get around prior art cited by the examiner .
Ask your attorney to examine this issue .
Prepare a Noninfringement Claim Chart
To show that your software does not infringe a patent , it is a good idea to make a “ claim chart ” for each independent claim .
In a noninfringement claim chart , the left column displays each element of a claim , while the right column contains a brief explanation of why your software does not practice that claim element , if that is the case .
For a given claim in your claim chart , you need only explain that your software does not practice one of the claim elements to establish that your software does not infringe the entire claim .
4.5.3 Invalidity
Under patent law , in order for a patent to be valid , the claimed invention must have been useful , reducible to practice , novel , and non-obvious to a “ person having ordinary skill in the art ” at the time that the invention was made .
An invalidity defense , therefore , shows that the patent failed to meet one of these requirements .
It is most useful for you to focus on determining whether the patent claims were not novel , or would have been obvious even though , in a strict sense , they were novel .
In a litigation context , it is generally more difficult to show that a patent is invalid than to show that you do not infringe it , because an issued patent is presumed to be valid .
The presumption of validity places the burden of proof on you as the challenger of the patent .
By contrast , patent holders bear the burden of proof of proving that you infringe the patent .
However , as we note below , if you request re-examination of the patent by the USPTO , and the request is granted , there is no presumption that the patent is valid during the re-examination proceeding .
In constructing an invalidity defense , the concept of the priority date of the patent is important .
The priority date is often , but not always , the same date as the application filing date .
In some cases the priority date is earlier , as when the patent issued from a divisional or continuation of an earlier - filed patent application , or when the patent is based on the disclosure given in an earlier - filed “ provisional application . ”
Ask your attorney to determine the priority date of the patent ; it will generally be the earliest filing date mentioned on the first page of the patent .
To show that a patent claim is not novel , you must produce a single relevant prior art reference that describes ( “ teaches ” ) each element of the claim .
While the statutory definition of invalidating prior art is somewhat complicated , in essence the prior art must either predate the priority date of the patent by at least one year , or predate the invention of the patent .
Normally you will not know the date of the invention , so , if possible , you should use prior art that was published at least one year before the priority date .
Although other forms of prior art exist , you are best off using earlier patents ( and published patent applications ) and other printed publications ( textbooks , journal articles , conference proceedings , technical reports , software manuals , source code , and so on ) that were actually available to the public before the relevant date .
If you are looking for material on the web to use as prior art , it is important for you to be able to establish the date of the publication , which is sometimes difficult for material posted online .
If you cannot ascertain that the date of a particular publication is on or before the relevant date , you should look for another source of prior art .
( It is a good idea for you to establish good dating practices for your own code and documentation in case you or others will wish to use them as prior art in a future challenge or defense to a patent .
Use of a revision control system that includes the system date and time on each operation , as Subversion does , is one way to do this . )
If at all possible , you should use prior art references that were not considered by the patent examiner during prosecution of the patent .
Patents are presumed valid against any prior art of record .
Although the prior art considered by the examiner is generally listed at the beginning of the patent , you should check the file wrapper to be sure that your prior art was not already considered .
Obviousness
To show that a claim is not novel , you must produce a single prior art reference that clearly anticipates each element of that claim .
If you need to use two or more prior art references to cover all the claim elements , your argument must be that , in light of the prior art , the claimed invention would have been obvious to to a person having ordinary skill in the art at the time the invention was made .
In essence , you are arguing that the claim is merely an obvious combination of elements that were already well - known in the relevant technical field .
It is more difficult to demonstrate invalidity based on obviousness than on lack of novelty .
A recent decision of the United States Supreme Court , KSR International Co. v. Teleflex , Inc. , addressed the appropriate standard for determining obviousness , rejecting a rigid formula that had been applied for many years by the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ( the appellate court having exclusive jurisdiction over appeals concerning patent law , which is generally seen as having had a pro-patent bias ) .
Although it is too early to know what impact KSR will have on U.S. patent law , it should now be easier to make successful arguments that a patent claim was obvious over combinations of prior art references .
Prepare an Invalidity Claim Chart
As with noninfringement determinations , in constructing an invalidity defense it is helpful to make a claim chart .
The first column of the claim chart again contains each claim element .
In the second column , for each claim element , you summarize the prior art that discloses , and therefore invalidates , that claim element .
Be specific about the page number or ( in the case of patents and published patent applications ) column and line numbers of the prior art reference you are using .
Unlike noninfringement analysis , however , to prove a patent entirely invalid , you must show prior art for each element of each claim , including all dependent claims .
If you can only show invalidity for some of the claims , you should prepare noninfringement determinations for the rest if you can .
Invalidation of one claim will not necessarily help you in invalidating others .
4.5.4 Noninfringement and Invalidity Opinions
In addition to making noninfringement and invalidity determinations , you should obtain a formal opinion concerning noninfringement and invalidity from a patent attorney who is familiar with the patent , its file history , the relevant prior art , and your project .
Such opinions of counsel are important under U.S. law because they reduce the likelihood that an accused infringer will be found to have committed willful infringement , which can lead to enhanced damages of up to three times the amount of damages found or assessed .
Ordinarily , damages will not be enhanced if an infringer , having actually learned of the patent , exercised “ due care ” by investigating the patent and forming a good - faith belief that the patent was invalid or not infringed before engaging in further infringing acts .
Obtaining noninfringement and invalidity opinions , and beginning or continuing activity that might infringe a patent in reliance on such opinions , are a way of fulfilling this duty of due care .
4.5.5 Unenforceability
With your attorney ’s help , you may be able to show that the patent is unenforceable in either a strict sense or a practical sense .
For example , the patent might have been invalidated by a court .
If the patent is being subjected to a re-examination by the USPTO , the patent holder as a practical matter generally has a more difficult time enforcing the patent while the re-examination is pending .
Moreover , if the patent has expired , it can not be infringed .
While recently - issued patents expire by default 20 years from the filing date , they can expire earlier if the patent holder has failed to pay maintenance fees , which are due every four and a half years .
It is estimated that a third of all patents are not maintained beyond the eleventh year of the term .
However , even though the patent has expired , if you were infringing the patent before it expired , the patent holder can seek damages for infringements occurring up to six years in the past .
There may be other grounds for unenforceability .
For example , the inventors and others closely associated with the patent application might have failed to satisfy their “ duty to disclose ” to the USPTO all relevant and material prior art of which they were aware .
4.6 Other Measures
In addition to establishing defenses against assertion of the patent , it may be worthwhile to take other measures to minimize your risks from a patent .
Two examples are designing around the patent and filing a re-examination .
4.6.1 Designing Around
If it is practical to do so , you may wish to consider ways of “ designing around ” the patent claims : changing your code to avoid having it fall within the scope of the claims .
However , the patent holder will still be able to assert that you infringed the patent prior to implementing the workaround .
Designing around may be impractical , however , if it is too difficult to ascertain the precise meaning of the claims , or if the claims are relatively broad .
( However , the broader a claim is , the easier it will be to construct an invalidity argument based on prior art . )
If you have made a strong invalidity determination , you may wish to ask a patent attorney to help you file a patent re-examination request with the USPTO , which potentially results in cancellation of the patent claims , although the filing fees may be out of reach for many nonprofit projects .
The USPTO will grant the request and order re-examination of the patent if it considers your request to raise a “ substantial new question of patentability ” regarding the patent claims .
The request must be based on prior art in the form of patents or printed publications ; other forms of prior art can not be used .
If the USPTO orders re-examination , prosecution of the patent begins all over again for the patent holder .
In a re-examination , the patent claims lose their presumption of validity .
The most common form of re-examination is ex parte re-examination , in which a third party requester whose request is granted has no further opportunity to make submissions in the proceeding , apart from the right to submit a reply if the patent owner files a response to the order granting the request .
The current fee for filing a request for ex parte re-examination is $ 2520 .
A much more expensive form of re-examination , inter partes re-examination , is also available for more recently - granted patents ; the current fee is $ 8800 .
It offers the requester opportunities to submit arguments during the course of the re-examination , though it has certain drawbacks in addition to its higher fee .
Re-examinations are usually successful at least in causing the patent holder to narrow the patent claims .
It may then become marginally easier for you to make a noninfringement determination for those claims , or to design around those claims .
On the other hand , re-examination carries some risk that the patent claims will survive unscathed .
In that case , the patent emerges with an even stronger presumption of validity , because it has withstood a challenge based on additional prior art .
4.7 Should FOSS Developers Apply for Patents ?
While hostility towards software - related patents is especially prevalent throughout the FOSS community , FOSS developers occasionally ask whether they should apply for their own patents to defend themselves and their projects against patents held by others .
Usually this will not be advisable , for several reasons .
The costs of applying for and maintaining a competently - drafted patent may be out of reach for an individual developer or nonprofit FOSS project .
Moreover , a FOSS project whose developers file for and obtain patents may suffer considerable political damage within the FOSS community , given prevailing community attitudes towards software - related patents .
Two other reasons , however , are even more significant .
First , the novelty requirement for patentability is fundamentally in tension with the nature of FOSS development .
FOSS development is done in a collaborative , distributed and public fashion .
If an invention arises out of such FOSS development activity , the inventors would have to act very quickly to file a patent application , since otherwise relevant public code , documentation and discussions would eventually ( or immediately , in most countries outside the U.S. ) constitute prior art to the invention , rendering it unpatentable for non-novelty .
Second , merely owning a few patents will not provide an effective defensive counterweight to a hostile competitor that holds hundreds or thousands of patents .
It will also be entirely ineffective against so - called patent trolls .
Patent trolls are companies that acquire , sue on and license patents but do not produce any products that might infringe others ’ patents .
Chapter 5
Common Trademark Issues
Like other products , FOSS applications develop reputations over time as users come to associate an application ’s name with a particular standard of quality or set of features .
Trademark law can help protect this relationship of trust and reliance that a project develops with its users ; it allows the project to maintain a certain amount of control over the use of its brand .
This document is intended to explain how FOSS developers can make effective use of their trademarks .
However , because we do not know the specifics of your project , this document provides general information and not legal advice .
If your FOSS project has a specific need for legal advice , please contact the Software Freedom Law Center or seek other legal counsel .
5.1 Choosing a Mark
The purpose of a trademark is to identify the source of a product .
FOSS projects often use their names or logos to indicate that a particular distribution , module , or upgrade is an official release of the project .
In order to make such indications meaningful , trademark law enables a trademark ’s owner to prevent others from using the mark in ways likely to cause confusion among potential users of the software .
Because the law only protects a mark insofar as it serves this identifying function , the most important quality of a good trademark is distinctiveness .
A name , logo , or phrase that does not distinguish your program from other products with substantial similarities is unlikely to be afforded trademark protection .
For this reason , generic marks consisting of common words that describe the project ( e.g. , a music player called “ Music Player ” ) are generally poor choices .
The “ strongest ” marks ( those afforded the most protection under trademark law ) are those which have no other associations , such as a made - up word or an abstract design .
Such marks are the least likely to cause consumer confusion because their only meaning is to identify the product .
However , these marks might be undesirable from a marketing perspective , even though it is a strong mark from a legal perspective .
Often a project will want its mark to say something about the product ’s purpose .
A project need not avoid descriptive marks entirely , but should avoid marks that consist largely of words and images that are generic to the industry or are very similar to those already used to identify similar products .
If two entities are using the same mark on similar goods ( such as two software applications ) , the law favors the one who used it first .
Therefore , in stark contrast to patents ( see Chapter 4 ) , FOSS developers should perform a thorough search before choosing a mark ; it behooves a FOSS project to be as certain as possible their chosen mark is not already in use .
The best search is one performed by an experienced trademark specialist , largely because she knows where to look .
However , resources are also available for those who wish to search on their own .
The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office ( USPTO ) provides the Trademark Electronic Search System ( TESS ) , which allows users to freely search the USPTO ’s database of registered trademarks .
A search of registered trademarks is not enough , however , since U.S. law also provides some trademark protection in the absence of registration .
Consequently , you should also perform a thorough web search to determine whether anyone is using that unregistered mark .
5.2 Registered v. Unregistered Marks
Though unregistered marks have some legal protections ( called “ common law ” rights ) , they are limited to those geographical areas where consumers actually identify the trademark with its source .
Traditionally , a mark ’s geographic reach is defined by criteria such as where the product is sold and where it can be found in brick and mortar stores .
Such metrics apply poorly to products which are only ( or primarily ) distributed online , and consequently their geographic reach for the purposes of unregistered trademarks is generally uncertain .
You can minimize this uncertainty by registering your trademark with either a state or the federal government .
Registration grants much stronger protections for your trademark if someone else uses the mark in connection with goods similar to the ones described in your registration application .
Registration with a state government grants these protections within the state , while registration with the federal government grants them throughout the nation .
The protections conferred through registration are not absolute .
If someone establishes that they were using the mark before you , their rights to the use of their unregistered mark will still apply .
A thorough search prior to registration can help you avoid this situation and any resulting territorial conflict .
For the vast majority of FOSS projects , especially those distributed on the web , federal registration is preferable and sufficient .
Though federal registration fees are significantly higher — $ 275 per mark per goods classification for a federal mark versus an average of $ 50 for state registration — distribution is rarely or never limited to a particular state .
In addition to broader applicability , federally registered trademarks can be enforced in federal courts , and provide a better position from which to register and enforce trademarks internationally .
5.3 The Federal Registration Process
The USPTO ’s trademark registration process is relatively simple .
You do not need a lawyer , and the entire process can be done online ( in fact , online registration is strongly preferred ; the USPTO charges an additional $ 100 for paper filing ) .
Most of the registration requirements are straightforward — a jpeg image of the mark , the date you first used the mark , etc .
In addition to this basic information , the application requires that you provide a “ specimen ” demonstrating your use of the mark in association with a product .
For a software product , the specimen can be :
A picture of the software ’s physical packaging bearing the mark , if the product has been distributed physically ;
A screenshot of a webpage displaying both the mark and a download link ;
An advertisement for the product ; or
Any other image which demonstrates “ the overall context ” of how you have used the mark in association with the product .
The specimen requirement only applies if you are currently using the mark .
You may also register a trademark based on an intent to use the mark in commerce within six months of registration .
Next , you should make sure that your project fits within one of the descriptions in the USPTO ’s Acceptable Identification of Goods & Services manual .
This manual classifies goods first by a general international goods class , and then by a more specific identification within that class .
There are 34 goods classes , but most FOSS projects will be concerned exclusively with class 9 , which applies broadly to computing goods .
While some projects will relate to other classes ( e.g. games , or software intended for use in the medical industry ) , even for these projects it is generally sufficient to register only in class 9 .
If upon searching the identification manual you are not able to find an identification that applies to your project , you must request that an applicable identification be added to the manual before you can register .
You may find several applicable identifications within class 9 , as many are quite broad .
Make note of all of them so as to make your application as comprehensive as possible ; though you must pay a registration fee for each class within which you register a mark , you may select several identifications within a class without paying an additional fee .
After you have all of the above information , you should be able to complete the application without any problem .
In order to file the ( less expensive ) online application , you must pay when you apply , either with a credit card or by setting up a deposit account with the USPTO prior to filing .
5.4 Using Your Mark
If a mark is no longer useful to distinguish one source of goods from another , it can lose its trademark protection , regardless of registration .
This can happen either through abandonment or genericide .
Abandonment occurs if the trademark holder stops using the mark for an extended period of time ( usually over three years ) , or fails to monit
The other day I read an amazing statistic ?
It said that as many as half the people who end up divorced had a strong feeling before the wedding that they were doing the wrong thing but they were too embarrassed to pull out at the last minute .
The fear of embarrassment is a powerful influence in the lives of most people .
Imagine that you slipped over in a public street , what would your first reaction be ?
If you are like most people you would look around to see who saw you .
Another , well known , statistic is that fear of public speaking is the number one fear that people have , but is it true ?
I suggest that their fear of public speaking is really a fear of being embarrassed publicly if they mess up .
So what ’s all this got to do with being broke ?
In order to become wealthy you need to set a goal to become wealthy .
Since having lots of money is a lot more fun than being broke why does n’t everyone set a serious goal to be rich ?
The reason is that they are afraid of the embarrassment if they tell everyone that they are going to be rich and then they fail .
It seems crazy to let your life be controlled by the fear of what other people may think of you , yet that is exactly what most people are doing .
What about you ?
Are you letting the fear of embarrassment keep you from reaching your full potential , financially or otherwise ?

The first step to getting rid of the fear of embarrassment is to accept that you will never gain the approval of everyone .
You could paint your house white and some people will love it but others will think you would have been better painting it blue or yellow .
You ’ll never please everyone .
If you ca n’t get the approval of everyone then whose approval should you seek ?
There is only one person ’s approval that you need and that person is you .
Happiness comes from within .
Wealth comes from within .
Success comes from within .
When you set financial goals it is your life that you are aiming to improve .
Sure there is the chance that you will fail , but failure is only temporary .
If you learn a bit more , and work a bit smarter then you can turn that failure into victory .
There is only one failure that is terminal .
That is the failure to try in the first place .
If you are letting fear of embarrassment rob you of your potential wealth then you truly are a failure because you do n’t have the courage to set a goal and give it your best shot .
Make a decision to say goodbye to the fear of embarrassment .
And while you ’re at it make a decision to say goodbye to any of your friends who would think worse of your for setting a worthwhile goal and falling short .
Set a financially worthwhile goal .
Give it your best shot and if you fall short then take it on the chin and learn some more and then give it another shot .
And if anyone criticizes you for that then move on and find a better class of friend .
The bathroom is the one room in the house we all use , but we all seldom talk about .
It is a room that is supposed to be inviting , relaxing and private .
Over time however , our bathrooms will become decayed or outdated .
When this happens , bathroom remodeling omaha is going to be the solution that best fits your needs .
Who is going to use the room most ?
The first question that you need to ask yourself is , who is going to be using the room most ?
If you are going to be the primary user , then you can pretty much go to town on its design .
If you are going to have others use the bathroom such as a guest room , then you will want to design the room around them .
Colors
You want to think of the colors you use in your bathroom .
You want to have colors that are comforting and relaxing .
If you have harsh colors , then these will play with the eyes and emotions of people who use your bathroom .
You want to have a subtle color pallet .
Depending on the size of the room you want to focus on lighter colors compared to darker ones .
Fixtures
You will then want to look at fixtures .
If you have someone with special needs using the room then you will want to have one type of fixture .
If you have an elderly person then you may want to consider another type .
One thing that you will want to change around are the knobs on your sink .
If you have difficulty with your hands having a lever that can be lifted up and placed back down will be your best bet .
When it comes to the bathroom you do n’t want to make it the most beautiful room in the house but adding a little style to its function will make it a delight to use .
UNDER the gaze of troops armed with automatic rifles , bayonets and batons , residents of Lhasa 's old Tibetan quarter are now being allowed outdoors after many hours of cowering in their homes .
Burnt - out buildings , smashed shop - fronts and piles of looted property are ubiquitous reminders of an orgy of anti-Chinese rioting .
Lhasa is back under control , but with a heavy hand .
Security is particularly intense in the Tibetan quarter itself .
Helmeted riot police are posted every few metres along its narrow , winding alleyways .
Residents are subjected to identity checks as they walk around .
In the heart of the district , in front of the Jokhang temple , which is Tibet 's holiest shrine , two armoured personnel carriers are parked .
On the front of one big red Chinese characters read : “ Stability is Happiness ” .
On the other it says “ Separatism is Disastrous . ”
The road around the temple , normally packed with pilgrims spinning their prayer wheels and murmuring prayers , is now nearly empty .
At one point those trying to walk around it — an act of piety — were required to walk through a column of gun and baton - toting troops , one by one , and present their identity cards .
Your correspondent saw several turned away — usually , it appeared , pilgrims from out of town — before the circuit was blocked to all .
The pious had no choice but to turn back , retracing their steps around the temple in an anti-clockwise direction ( to Tibetans unholy ) .
Beyond the Tibetan quarter , it is now possible to survey the full extent of the damage caused by the rioting of Friday and Saturday .
It extends well into areas of the city where ethnic Han Chinese form the majority .
Your correspondent saw a Bank of China branch with its windows smashed , the guardroom of the Tibet Daily , the Communist Party 's main mouthpiece in the region , similarly damaged , a multi-storey internet café gutted by fire , and shop after Chinese - owned shop burned or destroyed .
The scale of the unrest was probably the biggest the city had seen since the Tibetan uprising of 1959 which prompted the Dalai Lama to flee into exile .
The troop presence in Lhasa is similarly extensive .
Some are members of the People 's Armed Police , an anti-riot force .
Some could be regular soldiers .
China wants to give the impression that the unrest is being handled by the police .
But the licence plates of some military - looking vehicles are covered or missing ( army and police licence plates are readily distinguishable ) .
They are patrolling along streets , stopping cars and pedestrians to check papers and sealing off some areas to all but residents .
There must be hundreds if not thousands deployed .
Access to monasteries on the edge of Lhasa , where the unrest first began on Monday March 10th , remains blocked by police .
Your correspondent was stopped several hundred metres away from the entrance to one of them , Sera , and was taken to a police station for brief questioning and inspection of documents before being released .
Troops stopped him and deleted his photographs ( foreigners , he said , were not allowed to take them ) .
Government officials visited your correspondent at his hotel and advised him not to go out “ for the sake of security ” .
Some Han Chinese in the city remain nervous .
A Han taxi driver ( Hans , rather than Tibetans , dominate the taxi business ) was reluctant to drive close to the Tibetan quarter despite the intense security .
A
Han shopkeeper more than a kilometre away from the Tibetan - dominated area said he would remain in Lhasa , his home for the past 20 years , but many other Hans would leave .
A Han acquaintance , he said , had been knifed to death during the riots .
An exodus of Hans — and a drying up of tourism from other parts of China — would deal a body blow to the city 's economy .
The authorities have set a deadline of midnight on Monday local time for rioters to hand themselves over ( if they do so by then apparently they can expect more lenient treatment ) .
This has aroused fears among Tibetans of widespread and indiscriminate arrests in the days to come .
Some Tibetans say house - to - house searches and arrests have already started .
But the authorities are trying their best to give the outside world an impression of normality .
Unlike their response to a big outbreak of anti-Chinese unrest in 1989 , this time they have not declared martial law , nor even announced any curfew or measures to expel foreigners ( some are being told by their Chinese travel agencies to leave , however ) .
Your correspondent , the only foreign journalist with official permission to be in Lhasa ( which was applied for and granted well before the unrest erupted ) is still allowed to remain .
But in practice the city 's daily life is being controlled by troops ( from elsewhere in China ) , foreign journalists are being barred from entering and the most repressive measures in 20 years are in force .
The Patriots and receiver Randy Moss finalized a three - year , $ 27 million contract today , ensuring that a key piece of the team 's record - setting offense returns .
The contract includes a $ 12 million signing bonus and $ 15 million in guarantees , according to Moss 's agent , Tim DiPiero .
" Randy is grateful to Mr. Kraft , Coach Belichick and Scott Pioli for agreeing to the terms of this contract , " DiPiero wrote in an email to reporters .
" Randy was serious about wanting to stay .
Because of Randy 's record - breaking year , the interest in him was very high .
Randy took less than he could have to rejoin his teammates . "
In a statement that confirmed Moss 's re-signing , Patriots coach Bill Belichick touched on Moss 's return .
" What Randy did for our team last year was outstanding , " Belichick said in a statement .
" He is one of our most consistent , competitive and team - oriented players and it is undoubtedly a relationship we are excited to continue . "
On his website , therealrandymoss.com , Moss said : " I want to take time out to thank all of the fans for their support and for wishing me well in my return to New England .
I 'm ready to get back .
We have some unfinished business to take care of . "
The sides had been close since the start of free agency , having agreed on the overall value of the pact .
The main sticking point was in the amount of guaranteed money included in the deal .
However , there are indications Moss tested the free - agency waters .
The Philadelphia Daily News reported today that Moss spoke extensively with Eagles head coach Andy Reid about the possibility of signing with Philadelphia .
Meanwhile , the Philadelphia Inquirer noted that the Eagles offered more than the three - year , $ 27 million contract that Moss signed with the Patriots , and " felt as if they were close to striking a deal with the star receiver before the news about the Patriots broke early this afternoon . "
The Patriots have seen several players sign with new clubs through the first three days in free agency -- a group that includes cornerback Asante Samuel ( Eagles ) , receiver Donte Stallworth ( Browns ) and cornerback Randall Gay ( Saints ) -- but their top priority remained Moss .
The first domino in the negotiation between the sides came when the Patriots elected to forgo placing the franchise tag on Moss last month , which would have restricted his ability to fully experience the open market .
In doing so , the Patriots sacrificed leverage but appeared to create a positive negotiating climate .
However , when the first three days of free agency passed without an agreement , it was natural to wonder if perhaps the team 's approach had backfired .
The receiver market exploded early in free agency , which could have been a factor in the delay in striking a deal .
Talks between the sides heated up today .
Moss , who turned 31 last month and enters his 11th NFL season , said several times last year how much he enjoys playing with quarterback Tom Brady .
He has privately wondered to friends how his career would have unfolded had he hooked with Brady and the parts the Patriots have assembled around the star quarterback earlier .
In his first year with the Patriots last season , Moss set a NFL record with 23 touchdown receptions .
He totaled 98 catches for 1,493 yards , playing in a whopping 88 percent of the team 's snaps .
His presence alone generally dictated how defenses defended the Patriots .
In another move today , the Patriots agreed to a two - year contract with former Bills receiver Sam Aiken , who is considered a solid special teams performer .

How do we feel about this campaign , by Keep A Child Alive , to encourage people to donate money to Africa on the basis that we are all African ?
( Apparently we only care about ourselves , so if we suggest that Africa is ourselves , then we 'll donate ? )
Dp Americans , many of whom are white people with privilege based in race , class , and nation , get to claim Africa as theirs ?
Do white people now get to have blackness too ?
Is this insulting ?
Some people think so .

Solar Panels and the Quest for $ 1 / Watt
March 31st , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
If solar panels cost $ 1 / watt , you can sell them ( installation included ) for $ 2 / watt .
Coal ( installation included ) costs $ 2.10 / watt .
To date , solar is still reaching to compete with coal , but the margins are closing .
To ( over ) simplify how this works , you need to ignore issues like subsidies , qualitative costs , or kinks in the supply chain , and boil it down to money .
Two hurtles that must be jumped before photo voltaic solar cells become cheaper than coal : efficiency and production cost .
Fortunately the solar industry has already made important gains in both .
Today , we ’re going to talk about two types of solar panels : silicon and thin - film , and solar ’s quest for $ 1 / watt .
Silicon Solar Panels
Silicon panels are the most recognizable form of solar , in part because they ’ve been around the longest .
Unfortunately , until the end of 2007 , they ’ve always had some issues with cost .
Popular Mechanic summarizes this much better than I could :
“ Traditional solar cells require silicon , and silicon is an expensive commodity ( exacerbated currently by a global silicon shortage ) .
What ’s more , says Peter Harrop , chairman of electronics consulting firm IDTechEx , “ it has to be put on glass , so it ’s heavy , dangerous , expensive to ship and expensive to install because it has to be mounted . ”
And up to 70 percent of the silicon gets wasted in the manufacturing process .
That means even the cheapest solar panels cost about $ 3 per watt of energy they go on to produce .
To compete with coal , that figure has to shrink to just $ 1 per watt . ” – courtesy of Popular Science ’s Michael Moyer
To clarify on that statement , the global silicon shortage has eased slightly , but supplies are still tight so the price of silicon is still relatively high .
The bonus behind silicon solar panels is efficiency and lifespan .
Silicon panels tend to be about 20 % - 27 % efficient , reliable , and they last for over twenty years .
That means with silicon panels you earn the cost of your investment back in the long term .
Depending on where you live and what kinds of panels you buy , “ long term ” can mean 10 - 40 years .
With cheaper solar panels , obviously , you would regain your investment sooner .
B.P. Solar offers a calculator to estimate your solar panel investment based on location , solar system , and home energy use .
Just keep in mind that their calculator can’t adjust for fluctuating variables like energy costs , public policy , or B.P. ’s competition ; it ’s a ball - park estimate at best .
Divide the total cost by annual energy savings to calculate your return - investment time frame .
( Mine was 35 years in an inefficient house )
In order to approach the magic $ 1 / Watt goal , solar producers have tried new manufacturing techniques to reduce waste , boost efficiency , and lower prices .
1366 Technologies aims to come close to the $ 1 / watt mark .
They want to innovate manufacturing processes to reduce cost without sacrificing efficiency .
With some investment money in their pocket , they ’ll be working hard to bring their silicon panels to market in the future .
Until then , or until more government support crops up , traditional solar panels are still best reserved for commercial ( buy in bulk ) and long - term investment .
Thin -film Solar Panels
These days thin - film technologies are all the rage in the solar industry .
The benefit of thin - film solar technology is cost .
By cutting the silicon out of the equation , companies remove a huge price barrier .
One of the issues with thin - film technology is that it tends to be less efficient with a shorter lifespan .
A new thin - film record was recently set at 19.9 % efficient , which matches silicon panels .
But unlike silicon solar , in this field the $ 1 / Watt barrier has been successfully breached .
Two companies can boast the achievement :
Nanosolar has already begun production of their famed solar product , which uses an innovative printing technology .
They literally print the solar panels onto sheets of metal , like ink on paper .
This technique allows for mass - production at an 80 % reduction of manufacturing cost .
They did n’t just reach the $ 1 / watt mark , they surpassed it .
Even the Department of Energy agrees : they compete with coal .
For now , Nanosolar is sold out into the foreseeable future .
In time we ’ll no - doubt see their products become increasingly common as they diffuse through the solar market .
So what ’s the catch ?
Critics point out that the technology relies on indium , which has a finite supply .
You can read some interviews , or watch a video for more information .
AVA Solar Inc. is another forerunner as they prepare to mass - produce their stream - lined solar panels .
Their technique requires fewer raw materials , causes less waste , and maintains high efficiency – 11 % - 13 % .
At under $ 1 / watt , AVA Solar has nearly completed a production facility to mass - produce their technology .
They promise “ efficiency and stability performance comparable to the leading CdTe - based modules currently on the market ” – CdTe is cadmium telluride , a popular thin - film composition .
Kudos go out to Professor W.S. Sampath at Colorado State for helping to bring this technology to market .
The demand for either type of technology is high – and likely to keep rising .
To draw from an example , Southern California Edison recently decided to invest in 65 million square feet of commercial roof space for solar panels .
Check out these graphs for information spanning the past decade .
Solar technology has entered the game with fossil fuels at a time when the technology has not yet reached its limits , as these recent innovations and improvements attest .
Unfortunately , it will probably be years before solar starts to reach its full potential .
Even without constrictions of silicon supply , building the production base will take time .
When ( not “ if ” ) photo voltaic solar starts to compete with coal on a large scale , it will be interesting to see how the older , entrenched industry reacts .
As oil falls out of favor , the coal industry sees an opportunity to expand , despite growing opposition to green house gases .
But let ’s be fair ; P.V. solar is not the silver bullet to clean energy .
Even the most efficient , affordable solar panels or films can only operate under the sun , and they require batteries to store excess energy .
That means P.V. solar works well during peak hours , when people are awake and using all their electric gadgets and appliances , but at night or in higher latitudes , more options are necessary .
Other solar technologies like solar - thermal could pick up the slack .
Solar thermal is experiencing its own revival , but all technologies come with their pros and cons .
So we turn to other energy sources : consider wind , geothermal , algae fuel , or wave power .
Each has the fundamental benefit of using renewable resources–energy that will never run out .
In contrast , what is the weakness of fossil fuels ?
Extraction of a finite resource with pollution as a byproduct , culminating in powerful contributions to climate change .
Which limitation would you choose in a technology ?
Infinite or finite source ?
What byproduct would you bet on ?
Equality of cost is coming in the energy industry ; for P.V. solar it is already here .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
If the alignment is especially perfect , any big planets attending the nearer star will get into the act , adding their own little bumps to the more distant starlight .
That is exactly what started happening on March 28 , 2006 , when a star 5,000 light years away in the constellation Scorpius began to pass in front of one 21,000 light years more distant , causing it to flash .
It was picked up by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment , or Ogle , a worldwide collaboration of observers who keep watch for such events .
Ogle in turn immediately issued a worldwide call for continuous observations of what is now officially known as OGLE - 2006 - BLG - 109L .
The next 10 days , as Andrew Gould of Ohio State said , were “ extremely frenetic . ”
Among those who provided crucial data and appeared as lead authors of the paper in Science were a pair of amateur astronomers from Auckland , New Zealand , Jennie McCormick and Grant Christie , both members of a group called the Microlensing Follow - Up Network , or MicroFUN .
Ms. McCormick , who described herself as “ an ordinary New Zealand mother , ” said she had done her observing with a 10 - inch Meade telescope from a shed in her back yard .
Somewhat to the experimenters ’ surprise , by clever manipulation they were able to dig out of the data not just the masses of the interloper star and its two planets but also rough approximations of their orbits , confirming the similarity to our own system .
David Bennett of Notre Dame , said , “ This event has taught us that we were able to learn more about these planets than we thought possible . ”
As a result , microlensing is poised to become a major new tool in the planet hunter ’s arsenal , “ a new flavor of the month , ” in the words of Dr. Seager .
The new system , she said , is just the tip of the iceberg and the odds are that a lot of the ones that will be discovered could be like ours .
Only six planets , including the new ones , have been discovered by microlensing so far and the Scorpius event was the first in which the alignment of the stars was perfect enough for astronomers to detect more than one planet at once .
Their success at doing just that on their first try bodes well for the future , astronomers say .
Alan Boss , a theorist at the Carnegie Institution of Washinton , said : “ The fact that these are hard to detect by microlensing means there must be a good number of them  solar system analogues are not rare . ”
OSLO ( Reuters ) - Eat a whale and save the planet , a Norwegian pro-whaling lobby said on Monday of a study showing that harpooning the giant mammals is less damaging to the climate than farming livestock .
Rune Froevik , of the Norwegian pro-whaling lobby the High North Alliance , inspects a package of whale meat in an Oslo shop , March 3 , 2008 .
The Alliance issued a study on Monday saying that harpooning whales for meat produces less greenhouse gas emissions than farming cows , pigs or chickens .
REUTERS / Alister Doyle
Environmental group Greenpeace dismissed the survey , saying almost every kind of food was more climate friendly than meat .
The survey , focused on whale boats ’ fuel use , showed that a kilo ( 2.2 lbs ) of whale meat represented just 1.9 kilo ( 4.2 lbs ) of greenhouse gases against 15.8 for beef , 6.4 for pork and 4.6 for chicken .
“ Basically it turns out that the best thing you can do for the planet is to eat whale meat compared to other types of meat , ” said Rune Froevik of the High North Alliance , which represents the interests of coastal communities in the Arctic .
“ Greenhouse gas emissions caused by one meal of beef are the equivalent of eight meals of whale meat , ” the study said .
The Norwegian - based Alliance said it was the first to measure the “ carbon footprint ” of whaling .
Fish and seafood was comparable to whale meat with relatively low emissions .
Norway and Japan , the two main whaling nations , are seeking new arguments to promote whale meat after years of condemnation from anti-whaling nations for breaking with a 1986 moratorium on all hunts meant to save many whale species from extinction .
Oslo says , for instance , that the small minke whales it hunts are plentiful in the North Atlantic and that a 2008 Norwegian quota of 1,052 animals will not harm stocks .
The meat is eaten mostly as steaks or in stews .
GREENPEACE DISMISSIVE
Greenpeace said the threat of extinction was more important .
“ The survival of a species is more important than lower greenhouse gas emissions from eating it , ” said Truls Gulowsen of Greenpeace .
“ Almost every food is more climate friendly than meat .
Most fish and seafood has similarly low emissions . ”
The Alliance survey , covering eight of Norway ’s 30 whaling vessels , said they emitted 885 tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2007 by burning diesel fuel and landed 461 tonnes of whale meat .
That meant an average of 1.9 kilos of emissions per kilo of meat .
By contrast , raising cows in developed nations requires use of tractors , ploughs and fertilizers to produce feed .
The animals themselves generate methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , in their digestive tracts .
The Alliance said that the “ carbon footprint ” was up to the first sale -- for whales the landing point and for livestock the farm gate .
Neither included processing or transport costs to shops .
The International Whaling Commission ( IWC ) will hold a special meeting in London this week to review deadlock between pro- and anti-whaling nations .
Froevik said the IWC had turned into a group devoted to banning whaling rather than allowing hunts under strict controls .
“ We compare it to a soccer club where the only rule is that soccer is forbidden , ” he said .

I ’ve believed for quite some time ( much to the amusement of the staff around here ) that John Edwards and Barack Obama would make a natural pairing on a presidential ticket because of the similarities in their messages .
The belief is heavily informed by the fact that when I was in Iowa , I saw Edwards frequently praise Obama on the stump , sometimes apropos of nothing at all .
The reason I bring this up now is because Edwards did it again at the Iowa Brown and Black Forum over the weekend :
“ The cause of ending poverty in America is a cause that ’s very central to what I want to do as president , and central to my life . …
And there is at least one other candidate on this stage who has also spoken , strongly and eloquently , about doing something about poverty in America , and it ’s Senator Obama . ”
Candidates are not in the business of lavishing completely unnecessary praise on their opponents , especially not opponents beating them in the polls .
It ’s doubly weird for Edwards to make this statement because poverty is his signature issue .
In saying that Obama has spoken “ strongly and eloquently ” about it , Edwards dilutes his brand .
And Edwards ’ last line just fuels my speculation .
Speaking of Obama , he said :
“ I think our voices together are more powerful than our voices alone . ”
I think I have a legit case .
Now if I could only get someone to take me seriously around here …

WASHINGTON  President Bush on Saturday further cemented his legacy of fighting for strong executive powers , using his veto to shut down a Congressional effort to limit the Central Intelligence Agency ’s latitude to subject terrorism suspects to harsh interrogation techniques .
Mr. Bush vetoed a bill that would have explicitly prohibited the agency from using interrogation methods like waterboarding , a technique in which restrained prisoners are threatened with drowning and that has been the subject of intense criticism at home and abroad .
Many such techniques are prohibited by the military and law enforcement agencies .
The veto deepens his battle with increasingly assertive Democrats in Congress over issues at the heart of his legacy .
As his presidency winds down , he has made it clear he does not intend to bend in this or other confrontations on issues from the war in Iraq to contempt charges against his chief of staff , Joshua B. Bolten , and former counsel , Harriet E. Miers .
Mr. Bush announced the veto in the usual format of his weekly radio address , which is distributed to stations across the country each Saturday .
He unflinchingly defended an interrogation program that has prompted critics to accuse him not only of authorizing torture previously but also of refusing to ban it in the future .
“ Because the danger remains , we need to ensure our intelligence officials have all the tools they need to stop the terrorists , ” he said .

Stewart and McCain got into a brawl in this segment …
Do you think any of the talking heads would have this kind of debate with McCain ?
Check out the second half of the interview around the six minute mark for the fireworks to begin ...
Stewart tries to explain a few things to St. McCain about fighting a civil war :

" … but that assumes that we 're fighting one enemy — they 're fighting each other .
We 're not surrendering to an enemy that has defeated us .
We 're saying , how do you quell a civil war when it 's not your country ? "
McCain got very angry that Stewart called them out for using the " you 're not supporting the troops , " theme and was trying to filibuster the segment …
He tried to use the troops as a wedge .
Stewart got hot and fought back …
McCain started to stutter .

I was thrilled to see the book Beautiful Code : Leading Programmers Explain How They Think show up in my Amazon recommendations .
It seems like exactly the type of book I would enjoy .
So of course I bought a copy .
Unfortunately , Beautiful Code was n't nearly as enjoyable of a read as I had hoped it would be .
It is by no means a bad book , but there 's something about it that 's not quite right .
Part of the problem is that it's a compilation of disconnected essays , much like The Best Software Writing I .
Because there are thirty - three different authors , there 's naturally going to be a lot of variance in tone , content , and quality .
How you feel about the book is largely dicated by how much you like the individual essays .
There 's certainly no lack of quality in the authors .
There are plenty of famous , highly regarded programmers represented here : Brian Kernighan , Yukihiro Matsumoto , Jon Bentley , Charles Petzold , and many others .
Despite all that , I loved The Best Software Writing ; why can't I love Beautiful Code ?
I was n't able to put my finger on exactly what the deeper problem was with Beautiful Code until I read this eloquent reader review from Dmitry Dvoinikov .
I suddenly realized what ultimately trips up Beautiful Code .
It was right there in front of me , all along .
It 's even in the title : Code .
With rare exception , the authors do n't even mention the word " beautiful " in their essays .
They allude with " There , we have this system , it works like this . "
What exactly the author finds beautiful about it , and why , remains a secret .
The chapter written by Yukihiro Matsumoto , the creator of Ruby , was the most impressive standout .
It is three pages in which he simply writes about what he believes beautiful code is .
He explains his understanding of beautiful code to you .
This is what the book should be !
Instead , many chapters just reprint a few pages of code and conclude - see , it is beautiful !
Many times I was unable to grasp the problem - what was it that required that so - called beauty to emerge ?
I could n't see the whole picture , but the authors presume I do .
Any possible appreciation of beauty requires deep understanding .
What if I show you a magnified fragment of Mona Lisa 's background , an area of 3x3 blackish pixels ?
No doubt Leonardo had to paint them too .
But where is the beauty ?
Only a few authors were wise enough to use pseudocode , something that anyone can read , no matter from which camp .
It 's just weird when the authors present their beatiful code in Ruby or Perl or Lisp .
Look , I have n't touched Ruby yet , I hate Perl and I can't imagine using Lisp in practice .
Nevertheless the authors repeatedly say something like " It 's easy , I 'll show you , this bracket does this and that character does something else .
Now do you see how beautiful it is ? "
They literally show you a piece of poetry in a foreign language and ask you to appreciate it .
A classical example of awful poetry in Russian is ( transliterated ) Ya poet , zovus ' Neznajka ,
ot menya vam balalajka .
Can you tell whether this is good or bad and why ?
What if I told you it 's beautiful ?
Would you believe ?
Does it appeal to your sense of beauty ?
Ideas are beautiful .
Algorithms are beautiful .
Well executed ideas and algorithms are even more beautiful .
But the code itself is not beautiful .
The beauty of code lies in the architecture , the ideas , the grander algorithms and strategies that code represents .
The code samples presented are indeed clear , readable , and well written .
But they are weak evidence of beauty ; it 's not the language that is inherently beautiful .
Barroom doggerel expressed in French or Russian is never automatically elevated to the level of poetry .
So when the Beautiful Code authors proffer pages of code -- real live production code -- and ask us to see the beauty , the code does n't help .
It gets in the way .
It 's been a long time since I found * dst++ = * src++ beautiful .
Focusing on the code is exactly the wrong approach .
It 's like a detailed technical description of the paints , brushes , and techniques used to paint the Mona Lisa , without any of the historical or artistic context that makes it such an important painting .
Ca n't we expect readers to see past the language ?
I 'd ask the very same question of the authors .
So many of them got mired in the minute details of the code and language that they never got around to the " why " underneath -- the beautiful ideas and concepts that code represents .
I 'd also ask the same question of every working programmer today .
I can scarcely post any code snippets in Visual Basic today without a slew of comments complaining about how awfully horrible Basic syntax is , how their eyes are bleeding , it 's unreadable , the horrors of End If versus curly brackets , etcetera , etcetera , ad nauseam .
Never mind the language -- what about the underlying algorithmic concept I am trying to represent in code ?
How does that look ?
Apparently , for many of us , beauty really is skin deep .

Say goodbye to Kuro as we knew ( and loved ) it , as Pioneer officially announced that after panel production of the next series of models is complete , it 's ending all in - house plasma panel production and will build HDTVs based on panels bought elsewhere .
The source went unnamed pending a final agreement , but Panasonic will likely follow up the 42 - inch it 's providing with plasmas of up to 60 - inches .
Due this fall are Kuro-edition LCDs , combining Pioneer 's ultra - thin speakers and exacting picture quality standards with screens built by Sharp ( hopefully this time sans - banding issues ) that should see release Europe first .
Other businesses affected are car audio , DJ equipment and Blu-ray players , but by streamlining operations and working closely with Sharp , it expects a return to profitability in 2010 .

WASHINGTON
Everyone here is flummoxed about why the president is in such a fine mood .
The dollar ’s crumpling , the recession ’s thundering , the Dow ’s bungee - jumping and the world ’s disapproving , yet George Bush has turned into Gene Kelly , tap dancing and singing in a one - man review called “ The Most Happy Fella . ”
“ I ’m coming to you as an optimistic fellow , ” he told the Economic Club of New York on Friday .
His manner  chortling and joshing  was in odd juxtaposition to the Fed ’s bailing out the imploding Bear Stearns and his own acknowledgment that “ our economy obviously is going through a tough time , ” that gas prices are spiking , and that folks “ are concerned about making their bills . ”
He began by laughingly calling the latest news on the economic meltdown “ a interesting moment ” and ended by saying that “ our energy policy has not been very wise ” and that there was “ no quick fix ” on gasp - inducing gas prices .
“ You know , I guess the best way to describe government policy is like a person trying to drive a car in a rough patch , ” he said .
“ If you ever get stuck in a situation like that , you know full well it ’s important not to overcorrect , because when you overcorrect you end up in the ditch . ”
Most fans of modern medicine do not realize how similar in appearance was ancient medicine :
While the Greeks left a vast legacy of medical texts in a familiar language , we know of only 12 from the time of the pharaohs – written on papyrus in a vanished language that scholars are still grappling with .
From their descriptions of diseases and treatments , the texts have left little doubt that the ancient Egyptians had considerable medical skills , but weighing up their pharmaceutical knowledge has proved trickier : although the papyri include some 2000 prescriptions , doubts surround the identity of many of the ingredients listed . ….
Focusing on four key papyri , which contain 1000 prescriptions and date from 1850 BC to around 1200 BC , Campbell analysed each prescription and compared it with contemporary standards and protocols .
…
After five years of painstaking analyses , …
Of the original 1000 prescriptions , she could now say exactly how 550 were made and whether they would work .
For another 156 , she knew all but a minor ingredient – enough to say if the remedy worked . …
The Egyptians ’ choice of ingredients has certainly stood the test of time .
When Campbell consulted Martindale ’s Extra Pharmacopoeia – the 1977 edition , when drugs were still prepared in a dispensary – she found that 62 per cent of ingredients named in the papyri were still in use in the 1970s .
…
The formulations stood comparison too .
Checking against the 1973 British Pharmaceutical Codex , which lays down standards and protocols for making up medicines , Campbell found 67 per cent of the ancient Egyptian remedies complied , with one proviso – the Egyptians knew nothing of the need for sterility .
…
They had enemas , draughts and linctuses , lotions and liniments , creams , ointments and mouthwashes . ….
Ignorant of the causes of most diseases , ancient Egyptian doctors inevitably focused on symptoms . …
Knowing the drug , the dose , how it was to be administered and what it was prescribed for meant it was possible to compare its effectiveness with modern remedies .
Campbell was impressed .
" Sixty - four per cent of the prescriptions had therapeutic value on a par with drugs used in the past 50 years .
In many cases even the dosing was right . "
The following is a technique I used while assembling a circuit to be installed where space was very limited .
Make sure your circuit design is finalized .
Changes will be extremely difficult once the circuit is complete .
I based the circuit around the largest component .
I bent the pins to prepare the IC .
This technique involves a lot of thinking ahead .
I first joined the common pins of the IC knowing that this area will not be accessible for much longer .
Every component needed to be prepared before installation .
Occasionally , I had to insulate component leads .
Looking at the schematic , one would expect this circuit to be much larger than a quarter .
UPDATE :
Shortly after this was featured on Hack - A - Day , I began receiving email asking about this circuit .
This is a revised version of my original DR - 110 sync mod .
The original design bypassed the internal clock with divided down sync 24 clock signals which were provided by an external master clock device feeding into the 110 via a standard Roland Din Sync ( five pin din ) port .
And , they said it could n't be done .
The schematic above is a revision which also utilizes the incoming Din Sync Run / Stop signal to control the Start and Stop functions on the DR - 110 .
If ever I revisit this project , I 'll be sure to use SMD components for an even smaller circuit .
I intentionally made the schematic virtually indecipherable .
Why ?
Back in 1997 , when I first developed the mod , I posted the schematic with a full description of how it worked along with the necessary steps one would take to interface this circuit with their 110 .
My goal was to bring the DR - 110 into the studio by enabling it to sync with other gear , as I have done with other devices .
After receiving email from musicians asking me to perform the mod on their DR - 110s , I eventually decided to do so via snail mail .
This was to supplement my funds , or lack thereof , while I was in college .
Apparently , the pocket change I earned was enough to gain the attention of a few companies specializing in modding ( usually butchering ) analog synths .
These chop - shops used my design to offer DR - 110 sync modding service with a ridiculous premium .
Of course , they based their work off of my original design .
Therefore , 110's modded by them lack the ability to utilize the run / stop feature .
So , I 'm keeping the revised version of the mod under my hat for awhile . ;)
To this day , I still receive email requesting that I perform the mod .
Although , I have officially stopped doing that , I did bust a few out for a handful of 110 owners a few years ago .
If you had me mod yours after 2004 , you have the new revised circuit , shown above , in your 110 right now !
So , there are a few " Second Generation " DR - 110 's floating around out there .
And , if anyone manages to figure out how it works by analyzing the images on this page , then , I guess they will have earned the knowledge .
- Alpha
UPDATE UPDATE !:
I 've had a change of heart .
There is no sense in keeping modders from the information they have asked for .
If someone wants to thief my work again , have at it .
Anyone with experience in electronics may find this circuit odd .
And , it is .
At first glance , it does n't look like it would work .
Especially the Start / Stop portion of it .
I assure you that it does .
I did n't want to involve a microcontroller , since that would be overkill ( even though everybody does so now ) , and I wanted to be sure not to introduce any latency by passing the original incoming din sync Clock and Start - Stop signals to the 110 .
I had to use some trickery to pull it off .
Enjoy .
I recommend adding an opto-isolator if you have other gear sharing an unbuffered Din Sync line ( EG. if you 're using a passive splitter ) .
This will assure that the above 110 Sync Circuit does n't interfere with the incoming ( shared ) sync signal .
I 've experienced a little of this .
Isolation will easily remedy any issues .
Also , you SHOULD be able to get away with swapping out the 2N2222 transistors with the more common 2N3904 .
The 2N2222 can handle more amps , but is otherwise identical in design .
The same can be said for the 2N2097 transistor verses a 2N3906 .
All are very common components , and you should n't have trouble finding any of them .
Depending on what you have on hand , you may find this bit of info handy .
For a moment , it looked like party leaders were marching toward a Florida revote .
But Obama 's campaign signaled today that the mechanics would be an obstacle , and Florida 's congressional delegation just took a hard line against a re-vote in a joint statement :
Washington , DC – The Members of Florida ’s Democratic Delegation in the U.S. House of Representatives issued the following statement regarding the seating of Florida ’s delegates at the DNC National Convention this August .
“ We are committed to working with the DNC , the Florida State Democratic party , our Democratic leaders in Florida , and our two candidates to reach an expedited solution that ensures our 210 delegates are seated .
“ Our House delegation is opposed to a mail - in campaign or any redo of any kind . ”
The Observers , a publication of France 24 TV , has documented Yahoo !
China and MSN posting banner ads and prominent photos of Tibetans the Chinese government have identified as “ most wanted ” in connection to recent protests inside Tibet .
Yahoo !
China pasted a “ most wanted ” poster across its homepage today in aid of the police ’s witch - hunt for 24 Tibetans accused of taking part in the recent riots .
MSN China made the same move , although it did n’t go as far as publishing the list on its homepage . …
The “ most wanted ” poster has been published on several Chinese portals like Sina.com and news.qq.com .
It reads “ The Chinese police have issued a warrant for the arrest of suspected rioters in Tibet ” and provides a phone number for informants to use in total anonymity .
Along with the text are photos of Tibetans taken during the riots .
Of the 24 on the list , two have already been caught .
Yahoo Inc was quick to contact The Observers and say that they did not post any pictures of wanted Tibetans .
Of course , they do n’t deny that Yahoo !
China , their subsidiary , did – and nowhere in The Observers ’ report do they say that Yahoo Inc was the perpetrator .
Yahoo and MSN have a long and troubled history when it comes to respecting human rights in China .
Both outlets , though Yahoo more prominently , have handed over private user data and emails to help China persecute cyber dissidents .
Yahoo has given managerial control of Yahoo !
China to Alibaba , a Chinese internet company , who evidently has far lower consideration for human rights and privacy than an American company like Yahoo !
But the key distinction is that in a situation where Yahoo Inc could have had strong protections for Chinese users and high standards for content created in China , they refused the power in lieu of a set up that allows the Chinese government to use Yahoo !
China as an extension of their police state .
A couple of years ago there was a hearing in the House of Representatives , lead by Tom Lantos and Chris Smith , into the business practices of American internet technology companies in repressive countries like China .
They and other members of Congress harshly criticized the partnership between companies like Yahoo , Google , Microsoft , and Cisco with governments like China .
The basic premise was that American companies should not do things in other countries that they would n’t do here in the US .
As a result , the Global Online Freedom Act of 2006 was authored , and reintroduced in 2007 , though it has never become law .
Congressman Lantos put it well at the time , “ When I hear these companies say they have changed China , I think that China has changed them — for the worse . ”
Reading Yahoo !
Inc ’s pathetic self - defense to The Observers ’ reporting makes me think that Lantos was entirely correct .
The best Yahoo !
Inc can offer is a soft defense that there is a wall separating them from control over who acts in their name .
What Yahoo do not offer is that their Chinese edition will cease to help the Chinese government find people who seek independence from China ( be they Tibetan or Uighur ) , Han Chinese dissidents who seek democracy and the rule of law , or practitioners of the Falun Gong who want religious freedom .
It saddens me that Congressman Lantos is not alive today , because I know that he would have met the flailing self - defense of Yahoo !
Inc ’s complicity in China ’s hunt for Tibetans who stood up for their human right of self - determination with a condemnation of unquestionable moral clarity .
TALLAHASSEE , Florida ( CNN ) --
Softball , drunken orgies and a prison system run like the mafia .
That 's what Florida 's former prison secretary says he inherited when he took over one of the nation 's largest prison systems two years ago .
This house , on prison grounds in Florida , is described as a party house where prison officials held orgies .

In fact , on his first day on the job , James McDonough says he walked into his office -- the same one his predecessor used -- and there was crime scene tape preventing anyone from entering .
" That was an indication we had a problem in the department , " McDonough told CNN in an exclusive interview before he stepped down last Thursday .
McDonough revealed a startling list of alleged abuses and crimes going on inside Florida 's prisons :
• Top prison officials admitting to kickbacks ;
• Guards importing and selling steroids in an effort to give them an edge on the softball field ;
• Taxpayer funds to pay for booze and women ;
• Guards who punished other guards who threatened to report them .
" Corruption had gone to an extreme , " McDonough said , saying it all began at the top .
" They seemed to be drunk half the time and had orgies the other half , when they were n't taking money and beating each other up . "
Watch a corrupted prison system »
He added , " Women were treated like chattel in this department . "
McDonough described a bizarre prison culture among those that ran the system -- one that he says seemed obsessed with inter-department softball games and the orgies after games .
" I can not explain how big an obsession softball had become , " he said .
" People were promoted on the spot after a softball game at the drunken party to high positions in the department because they were able to hit a softball out of the park a couple times . "
" The connection between the softball and the parties and the corruption and the beatings was greatly intertwined . "
The parties and orgies were often carried out at a waterfront ranch house built on prison grounds for a former warden with taxpayer dollars , McDonough said .
The house was complete with a bar , pool table and hot tub .

McDonough is a former Army colonel who commanded troops in Vietnam and Africa .
He served as Florida 's drug czar before taking on the job as the head of Florida 's prison system , which oversees 90,000 inmates .
He left his post last Thursday as secretary of Florida 's Department of Corrections because , he says , he feels he has cleaned up the corruption .
It 's time , he said , " to turn this over to law and order people that have made this their life 's goal . "
A Brooklyn , New York , native , McDonough says he witnessed the way the mafia worked in his youth and it provided him a keen insight into how his prison predecessor , James Crosby , operated .
" It reminded me of the petty mafia I saw on the streets of Brooklyn when I was growing up in the late 1950s , early 1960s -- petty , small - minded , thugish , violent , dangerous , outside the law , and completely intolerable for a society such as ours in the United States of America , " he said .
Crosby would later plead guilty to bribery charges in relation to kickbacks from a prison vendor .
He 's now locked up in a federal prison .
He refused CNN 's request for an interview for this report .
" He 's serving time in a federal prison .
I hope he reforms and gets out and prospers , " McDonough said .
He added , " When you have a rotten guy at the top , or gal at the top , it can be very invasive , and it's a cancer that needs to be excised . "
And getting rid of this " cancer " is exactly what McDonough says he did .
McDonough fired 90 top prison officials -- wardens , supervisors , colonels and majors -- claiming they were corrupt or , at the very least , not to be trusted .
He demoted 280 others .
Criminal charges were filed against more than 40 others , and most were convicted .
In addition to the orgies and other misconduct outside the cell blocks , there were other allegations of prisoners being harmed , McDonough said .
" In some of the pockets of corruption that we found , they [ prisoners ] were being abused , " he said .
Among those arrested were seven officers accused of beating inmates , including five accused of forcing a prisoner to drink toilet water .
All have pleaded not guilty .
Tina Hayes , the director of the prison 's department initiatives who has worked in the prison system for 28 years , said the atmosphere before McDonough arrived was " a little tense " with workers " always on edge . "
She said employees who did n't attend softball games or play on the teams were " isolated " and " pushed aside . "
" I used to tell staff day in and day out : Keep your head high ; do what 's right ; you know what morally is right ; you 've got some ethics ; do n't bow down to it , " Hayes told CNN .
McDonough , she said , brought " standards back into the department . "
" People can speak out now without being afraid to say what they need to say . "
McDonough says the majority of the prison system 's 28,000 employees were honest , hard - working people who were n't corrupt at all .
But he says many of the top prison officials were n't and he believes he has weeded out " an organized vein of corruption . "
" They were like frat boys out of control . "

REUTERS / Toby Melville
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Oil company Royal Dutch Shell Plc and U.S. bioscience firm Virent Energy Systems are to research a gasoline alternative from non-food crops that would reduce CO2 emissions without driving up food prices .
Shell said in a statement that unlike ethanol , currently the main biofuel alternative to gasoline , the fuel it and Virent aim to develop will be able to run in existing vehicles without the need to modify their engines .
Today ’s gasoline engines can usually only run on a small amounts of ethanol blended with gasoline -- typically 5 percent .
Much higher percentages can be used with modification .
The project follows a trend of major oil companies , including San Ramon , California - based Chevron and London - based BP , investing in plans to produce motor fuels from crops .
The companies are mainly focusing on second - generation biofuels , which will be produced from non -food crops which can be grown on land not suitable for wheat or sugar cane .
Environmentalists critical of the oil companies say the investments , which are at most around 1 percent of the companies ’ total capital expenditure , are public - relations stunts aimed detracting attention from the environmental damage caused by producing and burning hydrocarbons .
Shell and Virent did not disclose the amount they are investing in the project and gave no targets for achieving commercial production of the new fuel .
Last May , Shell and Madison , Wisconsin - based Virent announced a partnership to develop processes to manufacture hydrogen from biomass , using the same technology which the partners hope will now produce “ biogasoline ” .
Graeme Sweeney , executive vice president , future fuels and CO2 at Shell , told reporters on a media call that the collaboration on hydrogen was still active .

Were n't the number of unvoted ballots indicated on the outside of the box , along with other information ?
As posted elsewhere , that appears to be the law : 659:95 Sealing and Certifying Ballots .
I. Immediately after the ballots cast at a state election have been tabulated and the result has been announced and the return has been made , the moderator or the moderator 's designee , in the presence of the selectmen or their designee , shall place the cast , cancelled and uncast ballots , including such ballots from any additional polling places , and further including the successfully challenged absentee ballots still contained in their envelopes , in the containers provided by the secretary of state as required by RSA 659:97 and shall seal such container with the sealer provided by the secretary of state as required by RSA 659:97 .
The moderator or the moderator 's designee SHALL THEN ENTER IN THE APPROPRIATE BLANKS ON SUCH SEALER ON EACH CONTAINER THE NUMBER OF CAST , CANCELLED AND UNCAST BALLOTS in such container and shall endorse in the appropriate place on such sealer a certificate in substance as follows : Enclosed are the ballots from the state election in the town of ( or in ward____ in the city of ) held on ________,19 required by law to be preserved .
The moderator and the selectmen or their designees shall sign their names in the appropriate blanks on the sealer .
Kucinich should n't have to ask for those other ballots - they should have been in the boxes and accounted for .
How can news organizations even imply that the New Hampshire primary went OK when the state law was disregarded so many ways ?
Oh , I forgot , they do n't read the law themselves , just ask the parties involved if everything was hunky dory .
That 's not reporting , that 's passing on hearsay - and hearsay is not evidence .
{ED NOTE : Do n't know if they were on the outside of the box or not .
But if they were , and if the unvoted ballots were inside , SoS Bill Gardner did not allow them to be counted .

You will laugh at what we are allowed to contribute ... January of 07 Elections Canada came out with new rules ...
Corporations , trade unions , associations and groups may not make political contributions .
The amount an individual may contribute to a registered political party has been reduced to $ 1,100 a calendar year .
Also an annual limit of $ 1,100 on the total an individual may contribute to registered associations , the nomination contestants and the candidates of a registered political party .
A party leadership contestant may make an additional $ 1000 contribution in total per contest to his or her own campaign .
Cash contributions of more than $ 20 to registered political entities have been banned ...
Unfortunately Elections Canada has adopted ( 2007 ) Voter ID ... if the voter does n't have ID with picture they must show two pieces of identification to establish identity and residence and if they do n't have that , be sworn in by someone who does .
I am not sure who 's idea that was but Frank Luntz has coached Harper so maybe that 's where it came from .

It bothers me that the counting done so far has been so little and so slow .
I feel it is highly embarrassing for the SOS office and they may be trying everything they can think of to slow down or avoid the Democratic race discrepancies just to get the heat off them .
They would LOVE to count the Republican ballots first I imagine as they tallied up well with the exit polls .
They are hoping I think that we will all forget about NH by the time the Dems are finally counted , if they ever even allow that to happen .
NH voters should be outraged .

Off - topic , but very important : Today is FISA D - Day .
Senate Majority Capitulator Harry Reid is once again ready to give away the rights of U.S. citizens in return for giving the telcos retroactive immunity ... retroactive immunity for crimes undisclosed and unconfessed , but known to include the selling to the Bush administration of the access , personnel and equipment it needed for its warrantless surveillance of American citizens .
Retroactive immunity for the telcos and , perforce , retroactive immunity for Bush and company for these crimes .
Retroactive immunity ... and a green light for future claims of unlimited presidential power .
Once again Senator Chris Dodd has vowed to fight this nightmare in the making , promising to filibuster any bill with telco immunity until he drops ... and once again Harry Reid has been busy stacking the deck in the Republicans ' favor .
The administration figures that it has already won this battle and has already moved on to the next step ... as was obvious in recent Administration statements urging the need for total surveillance of all internet activity .
Understand this : the Bush regime has stated , repeatedly , that they wo n't stop any of this b>unless they 're made to stop .

Thank you for your great reporting .
I was so glad to hear that Kucinich camp is pursuing the further recount .
One thing I noticed in your report :
As well , the hand counts revealed 100 fewer votes actually existed for Barack Obama , in the town of Wilton , than were actually recorded for him on the night of the election ...
This mistake was a simple transcription error for the recount number ( the number on the night of election was correct ) and corrected at the NH recount site within a few days .
Wilton has a great system of hand counting , and the people there will not be happy to see that you are indicating some big issue with their counting .
I hope you correct your report .

The economic Katrina will preclude many if not most cities and states from improving the catastrophic status quo of electioneering :
Facing a collapse in the subprime mortgage market that has pockmarked their cities with vacant houses and crippled their budgets , the nation ’s mayors pleaded Wednesday for a huge infusion of federal aid .
The United States Conference of Mayors ( usmayors.org )
As more than 250 mayors gathered in Washington for the winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors , many agreed that the collapse of the subprime market had left a growing problem of vacant houses , depressed property values , tighter credit , and a need to cut services to close municipal budget gaps .
“ It ’s an economic tsunami that is hitting our cities , ” said Mayor Douglas H. Palmer of Trenton , the president of the conference .
“ We need federal action not six months from now , but within the next 30 days . ”
( NY Times , emphasis added ) .
The promiscuous overbuilding which the bushies touted as a " booming economy " gave new meaning to " boom " .
The " boom " was the economic explosion caused by bushie madness .
I do n't expect the Kucinich approach to work in the current economic crisis .

Brad , how come those massive error % have n't kicked in a statewide recount of the evote totals , including all uncounted , spoiled ballots , and pollbook numbers ?
An error is an error is an error , no matter what excuse you give !
And the fact that the memory cards are still unaccounted for is beyond belief .
It just goes to show the general public does not understand how easy it is to rig evoting .
With these % error rates exposed it seems to me the burden of proof is now on the state , not Kucinich .
I do n't care what the reason for the error , an ERROR over the acceptable error rate has occured .
New Englanders are suppose to be down to earth common sense people , well here 's their chance to do the down to earth common sense thing .
GET ALL THE FACTS , AS IN UNCOUNTED AND SPOILED BALLOTS PLUS POLLBOOK NUMBERS !
The alternative is just have faith your vote was counted in the next presidential election !
Disclaimer : I did not allege fraud took place , just the possibility it can , which in a sane world should be enough to get laws corrected .

An " error rate " in voting is unacceptable .
It does not matter if it did n't change THIS election - it darn well could change another .
And how about who gets how many delegates ?
There is no reason for anyone to trust an election in New Hampshire again .
You do n't get trust by never looking into something - you get trust by checking it out and correcting the problems .
Every time anti-election integrity people carry on about damage to trust in elections , they really mean do n't reveal the system for what it actually is - disfunctional .
Do n't worry your little heads but do trust us .
They never , never want the facade lifted so that problems can be corrected and real trust instilled .
Mandatory recounts , by law , gee , just happen to fall UNDER the most commonly admitted error rate .
How convenient is that ?
New Hampshire , you need a new SOS pronto .
Might I suggest a Libertarian or Green party person ?
If anything , the amount of error found , whether machine or human , the ways the laws were not followed , only serve as vindication that vigorous hand counting of ballots to audit the process is critical along with a complete trail of chain of custody for all materials .
There can be no reconciliation between number of ballots printed and number voted when the SOS wo n't give out the necessary information , the information required by law .
You can't tell if the process is working if you never check on it .
It does n't matter if the problem is error or fraud - if there is a problem it has to be found and dealt with .
And I do NOT mean paperless voting systems , the most offered " solution " - because paperless does away with evidence ergo , " no problem . "

Following up on comment # 3 by BADGER quoting section 659:95 of the NH statutes , besides listing the votes on the outside of the box , the boxes themselves are by statute to have been provided by the SOS in advance of the elections , per the Section quoted below .
What is a " state election " ?
a statewide federal primary , e.g.?
Section 659:97
659:97 Secretary of State to Prepare Containers , Sealers . –
The secretary of state shall , before any state election , prepare and distribute to each town and ward clerk containers to be used for preserving ballots and sealers to seal each such container .
He shall prepare special containers and sealers to be used for preserving any special and separate ballots for questions to voters .
The secretary of state shall prescribe the size and form of such containers and sealers and shall prescribe the form of any endorsement blank printed upon the sealers , provided that the blank is in substance consistent with the provisions of RSA 659:95 .

Bradblog still working on this vital issue .
I 'm amazed at how few people know how easy it is to corrupt our voting system through Diebold , as another poster brought up .
The MSM facade shields the wrongdoers .
By minumizing exposure , accountability can be forestalled at least until the next rigged election is allowed to conclude .
Help America Vote
Act was simply part of the political side of the facade , with the added benefit to Diebold of demanding access for vote hacking machines throughout the nation .
Leon County , Florida 's Ion Sanchez deserves mega credit for his role in standing up to the Feds , who'd threatened to take hundreds of thousands in HAVA money for not certifying Diebold machines .
The fight is more with politicians and the MSM who are knowingly ignoring the problem .
We see this reactionary cadre controlling so much of the national media and political narratives today .
Confrontation is avoided at all costs -- hence the Reid / Pelosi sell - out on Iraq and other vital issues like vote integrity .

Once again : Let 's remember that because of advances in statistical methodology ( and the technology to accomplish it quickly ) , a national election could be stolen efficiently : Pinpoint just a few precincts ( machines ? ) in a couple ( swing ) states , and only tamper with those .
Remember how close 2000 was , just in Florida , in one county in Florida ...
They knew ahead of time that the illegal butterfly ballot there would throw those local results , and that this would be enough to throw the whole national election .
If you can find it , take a look again at Bush ( W ) sitting near his father that night .
See him claiming that counter to what the exit polls were saying , he had not lost Florida ...
The MSM ( tv ) were already saying he HAD lost Florida , so how did he know that , hmmm ?
Then take another look and see how his father , at that moment , rolls his eyes at the stupidity of W giving it away like that .
My point , again , is that they only need to tamper with just a few machines --- and it is relatively simple to know which ones --- to fix the national election .
Or primaries .
Budget for recounts wherever it might be necessary .
Count every vote , accurately !

The_Zapkitty , I am sorry if you take personal offense to anything I said .
I certainly did n't mean to personally attack you .
If you would like to read more about where I found that article from , you can go here , a blog for scientists in every field from all over the country .
I can only say that since I took statistics a million years ago , I can't even pretend to understand it now .
And , as I remember , population statistics are exceedingly complicated ( I worked in conservation biology for more than two years and am now pursuing a PhD in medicine ) .
So when someone with a much better grasp of it tells me that there may be no significant anomalies attributable to the Diebold machines , depending on how the data is analyzed of course , I tend to have doubts about whether or not these differences we see here were intentionally done or whether or not we are just looking at bad statistics .
Am I wrong about " intentional manipulation " being the theme suggestion here ?
If I 'm wrong , I sincerely apologize .
I am all for vote recounting if acceptable levels of error have been exceeded , and I do n't think that they should have to be paid out of pocket by anyone 's campaign fund , but , again , I 'm just skeptical of the idea that it 's because it was necessarily intentional .
I thought other people in this blog might be interested in seeing what the statisticians were saying about this as well .
And , of course , I 'm not necessarily standing by their credentials either .
Lastly , I was not trying to distort any facts here ( and I do n't really see how I did ) .
It is precisely why I linked to the original article , with the original statistics , and not the one I just linked to above .
I 'm all for people drawing their own conclusions , and as this blog allows comments , I thought I 'd state my own POV .
But I 'm disappointed in your comments , which appear to be close - minded to me , so this will likely be the last time I comment again here as I am now really turned off by this exchange .
And I 'm sorry to the rest of you for the long comments .

Sena ( and interested parties )
I have read all these sources and bradblog , dailykos , Bluehampshire , and several other competing sources , and the bottom line is that there are several non-intersecting interests stating things which have been inadequately challenged .
On one side , the statisticians couch their findings in terms of probabilities , and some miss / exclude the possibility that unused factors actually influence the error rates .
Certainly in this thread , people correctly quote error deviances , but misuse them in arguments - eg. a single ballot error cannot adequately be construing as attributable to any particular candidate , so quoting an error rate for Richardson in one precinct is relatively meaningless .
In fact arguing error rates across precincts would also be meaningless without controls .
On the other side , you have individuals who are not so much concerned with the competitive outcomes , but rather question the accuracy of the technology .
The fact is that simple recounts can neither solve this question nor dissuade them from the possibility .
The only solution here is to do truly double - blind tests on both methods ( hand counting and machine counting ) and test under severely controlled conditions .
That having been done , use only proven technology under guidelines that must always be enforced .
I believe BradBlog correctly questions validity of the machines , partly because , absent any Proof otherwise , it appears a fair assumption .
But I do not derive any of this from the New Hampshire Primaries .
I derive this opinion because of inadequate responses by state , local and federal agencies to provide a substantial study otherwise .
Finally , this is not a criticism but rather an observation .
When you have a political system that is heavily driven by money , and the election system involving private companies , suspicion about validity will always crop up .
That is simply the nature of the beast .
Even with strong controls , you will not eliminate conspiracy theorists .
The current problem is that the conspiracy theorists are mixing in with the reasonable questioners .

Frankly I ’ve seen more transparency at a blackjack table in Vegas .
The election process is clearly flawed , perhaps even rigged .
Now I know what it must have felt like to live in Iraq and watch Sadam win the Iraqi elections year after year .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 March 22
Explanation : Staring across interstellar space , the alluring Cat's Eye Nebula lies three thousand light - years from Earth .
One of the most famous planetary nebulae in the sky , the Cat's Eye ( NGC 6543 ) is over half a light - year across and represents a final , brief yet glorious phase in the life of a sun- like star .
This nebula 's dying central star may have produced the simple , outer pattern of dusty concentric shells by shrugging off outer layers in a series of regular convulsions .
But the formation of the beautiful , more complex inner structures is not well understood .
Here , Hubble Space Telescope archival image data has been reprocessed to create another look the cosmic cat 's eye .
Compared to well - known Hubble pictures , the alternative processing strives to sharpen and improve the visiblility of details in light and dark areas of the nebula and also applies a more complex color palette .
Of course , gazing into the Cat's Eye , astronomers may well be seeing the fate of our Sun , destined to enter its own planetary nebula phase of evolution ... in about 5 billion years .
TESLA INVENTED RADIO ?
1992 William Beaty
> In all of the mass comm books I have used over the past 20 years , credit
> for early development in radio goes to Marconi , Fessenden , De Forest
> and Armstrong .
On occasion , and seldom at that , Tesla is mentioned .
But
> he is never discussed as a major player in the beginnings of radio .
The books do n't mention that the powerful spark transmitters used by Marconi were Tesla coils , or that Marconi used Tesla 's invention of grounded aerials , nor do they point out that Marconi 's central radio patents were later struck down because of Tesla 's prior art .
Marconi won the Nobel for inventing radio , but if this was a mistake , the whole science community ( as well as numberless historians and textbook authors ) would have to eat lots of crow before deciding to correcting it .
Or admitting it .
For example :
Hm , we can't just steal Tesla 's oscillator and pretend it 's ours .
I know !
Let 's re-name it .
We 'll just call it something besides " Tesla Coil . "
Got it .
" The Spark Transmitter . "
Geeeeenius !
Got a rotary spark gap ?
Check .
Tuned primary and secondary coils ?
Check .
HV power supply ?
Yep .
A ground connection , and an elevated aerial antenna ?
Check .
So , obviously it 's a " Spark Transmitter "
If we call it " spark transmitter " for long enough , everyone 'll assume it 's a Marconi invention .
Push that name , Sparktransmitter sparktransmitter sparkgransmitter !
" Tesla coils ? " LOL , those things are only good for generating lightning bolts in monster movies .
High school science projects , for kids only .
Hey GE Corp , why not take Tesla 's AM radio transmitter and call it the " Alexanderson Alternator ? "
Tesla 's patents on the Alexanderson Alternator just expired , so now you 're free to invent the Alexanderson Alternator twenty years after Tesla invented the Alexanderson Alternator , and everyone will laugh if Tesla claims to have already invented Alexanderson 's Alternator .
Invented by Alexanderson .
Otherwise it would have a different name , now would n't it ?
Tesla 's main problem was that he set his sights too high .
He did n't bother with simple and low - cost radio communication between transmitter and receiver .
Instead he was aiming for industrial dollars ; for a high power centralized * worldwide * radio communication system and wireless power distribution system .
His device more resembled a power plant than a Morse code set .
He failed .
Another major problem was that Tesla apparently did not take Marconi seriously as an opponent , and so Tesla did not fiercely defend his work when it was being stolen .
Only after a decade did he bring a lawsuit .
The history of invention is written by the winners , and since the winners ' success in Radio was based on their use of Tesla 's transmitter and grounded antennas , they all certainly avoided mentioning Tesla !
In his Nobel Prize speech , do you think Marconi would give any credit to the ripped - off inventor on which his system was actually based ?
Also , people commonly assume that any victims will fiercely fight against theives .
Since Tesla did n't fight , they assume that there must not have been any theft .
And finally , Tesla 's ideas were used to make money by far more people than just Marconi .
When an entire community steals ideas , they all try to make themselves feel better .
They justify their theft by ridiculing / marginalizing the ideas even as they profit from them .
They pretend that the ideas were " in the air , " or were just some " obvious methods " which anyone could see .
Historians reading the material written by such people will not notice all their lying and subterfuge .
It takes a historian with rare insight ( or perhaps one with paranoid distrust of fellow humans ) to cut through the BS and dishonesty of idea - theives and to interpret the evidence without that bias .
Initially Tesla rejected fame and wealth , and freely gave away his ideas via public science lectures , rather than employing the secrecy and courtroom patent - battles of fellow inventors .
Perhaps his upbringing as a minister 's son gave him too much trust and altruism to be a sharp businessman or secretive inventor .
That may explain why he freely signed over 51 % of the Wardenclyffe project , as well as all future patent rights , to that oh so charitable JP Morgan , the king of robber barons .
And not being a professional scientist , Tesla did n't preserve his priority by publishing his research papers in physics journals .
He also made the mistake of attempting to perfect his entire system before releasing it to the world , rather than releasing crude versions immediately and then improving over time .
He made radio possible , but his own dreams failed .
He invented modern radio , but made such serious business mistakes that the recognition ( to say nothing of the money ! ) all went to others .
The simplified history : Tesla , the expert in high frequency power systems , follows a vision of worldwide instantaneous communication and invents a radio " spark transmitter " whose output wattage will far exceed anything of the time .
This spark transmitter is based on several key Tesla techniques : rotary spark gap , " primary tank " resonance ( rather than antenna resonance , ) capacitor energy storage , an elevated antenna , and most importantly , a ground connection .
Tesla also invents a mechanical AC generator or " alternator " capable of broadcasting high power radio waves , even waves with AM voice modulations .
Of course radio recievers already existed : the coherer , ( NOT invented by Marconi but by Branly and others . )
Earlier experimental systems such as that of Hertz and Stubblefield also existed , but they had extremely limited range .
Tesla 's amazing spark transmitter put out 1000 to 10,000 times the power of existing transmitters , and made worldwide communication feasible .
Yes , radio existed before Tesla , but was mostly a lab - curiosity , and the signalling only happened over miles .
Nobody could span the English Channel , much less the Atlantic .
Today we call Tesla's 2 - coil spark - gap transmitter by the name " Spark transmitter " ... otherwise known as " Tesla Coil . "
Such was the status in 1893 , with several patents granted to Tesla in 1898 and on .
Besides the spark transmitter , the high frequency alternator , and the grounded antenna , Tesla 's inventions also included the four tuned circuits of all modern radio systems : a transmitter and receiver at both ends of a radio link , all four using 2 - stage tuning .
The 2 - stage tuning at the transmitter end lets the antenna put out hundreds , even thousands of watts .
At the receiver end it produces enormous " effective aperature , " so the antenna can up far more milliwatts than an untuned antenna .
Next stage : Marconi takes the Branly coherer and Tesla 's spark transmitter and antenna inventions , commercializing them .
He attracts publicity by transmitting messages all the way across the English Channel .
Then he hits world newspapers by spanning the Atlantic .
But Tesla ignores this threat , believing that his completed " world system " will be far superior to Marconi 's ocean - spanning demonstration .
And besides , Marconi is blatently using Tesla 's patented circuitry , and patents automatically protect the original inventor , right ?
Right ?
Therefore Tesla pursues centralized power transmission rather than simple communications alone .
He says something to the effect " good luck to Marconi , he 's using seventeen of my patents . "
Perhaps Tesla had a point , since Marconi did see his own patents rejected numerous times by the US Patent Office .
The patent officer thought it ridiculous that Marconi claimed to know nothing about " Tesla Coils . "
But then mysteriously Marconi 's patents were suddenly accepted .
Tesla also remained aloof from the community of early radio developers while single - mindedly pursuing his own vision .
Nearly twenty years later Tesla finally takes Marconi to court .
He can't afford powerful lawers and a long court case .
Dr. Pupin of Columbia turns against him , lies on the stand , tried to get Tesla declared insane .
Tesla loses !
As many other inventors have found , the winner in a patent battle is usually the side with the deeper pockets .
Tesla could n't afford to continue the court case , although it trundled on for another twentyfour years .
Also , though Tesla 's patents were prior to Marconi , Marconi had the press behind him .
Marconi also had both the US government as well as big business behind him .
The country wanted point - to - point radio , while the inventor of the spark transmitter wanted only centralized power broadcast stations .
Tesla also wanted to keep control of radio by patenting his work .
One can imagine that the government and commercial sectors would search for a way to get such an important invention loose from Tesla 's hands by breaking the patents .
This probably was the reason why Marconi's US radio patents suddenly went through in the first place after being rejected .
Finally , to the public , Tesla was an unknown in Radio when compared to Marconi , and the judge was very probably not a technical expert , and could be easily swayed by expert testimony by Tesla 's enemies in academia .
Tesla loses his R&D financing in later decades , while Marconi 's international companies are wildly successful .
It 's not a conspiracy theory to say " whoever has the gold , makes the rules . "
Tesla is not vindicated until 1943 , when the US Supreme court reverses the old decision , strikes down the Marconi patents , and awards priority to Tesla # 645,576 .
This was no altruism , since large amounts of government money rode on the possibility that Marconi 's existing companies could lose their patents and the invention become Public - Domain .

Also : " Tesla , Man out of Time " , Margaret Cheney , especially " The Great Radio Controvery . "
This book references as a thorough account an article " Priority of Invention of Radio - Tesla vs. Marconi " , from The Antique Wireless Association No. 4 , March 1980 .
( I have n't tracked this down . )
Why is Tesla ignored today ?
Of course there 's the old saw that " history is written by the winners " .
This remains true even if the winners used dishonest means .
But there are better explanations .
First , names have immense power , and we do n't call the Spark Transmitter by it's real name : the Tesla coil .
We might have Edison lamps , but nobody says that a grounded radio antenna is a " Tesla antenna . "
Tesla 's mechanical generator also aquired the name " Alexanderson alternator " ( Twenty years after Tesla 's invention , Alexanderson of Edison 's General Electric company patented an improvement which reached above 100KHz , while Tesla 's version only ran at up to 50KHz . )
There is another reason why Tesla is ignored today .
Tesla lectured about his discoveries , and in a very short time his ideas were incorporated into the technical culture of the period .
When this happens , people of the time tend to deny that a single inventor originated the ideas .
They can't benefit from historical hindsight , of seeing their own times from the viewpoint of an outsider .
Instead they tend to believe that the ideas simply arose spontaneously in many places , or by unnoticed team effort .
Historians of much later decades are particularly prone to this mastake .
The history of the Wright Brothers followed a similar path ; the Wrights published articles about their boxkite - winged glider , and within a few years everyone was copying it and assuming that biplanes were the " natural way to proceed . "
Only in hindsight does the overwhelming influence of the Wrights ' wing - warping biplane become obvious .
And so with radio , inventors copied Tesla without realizing it ; assuming that his methods of resonant coil and grounded antenna were simply the " obvious way " it should be done .
High - power transmitter systems , high frequency resonanant tuning and grounding , the keys to successful radio , were thought to be " in the air . "
Only through modern hindsight can we see that Tesla , and not Marconi , was the one who put them there .
I 'm going to indulge in some unsupported speculation .
My own experience as a textbook consultant points to another reason why Tesla is ignored : reference books support each other .
Groups of Reference books in many ways strive for consistency rather than for truth .
They try not to contradict each other or raise critical questions about apparently well - known history .
To an extent they are " inbred " , and to an extent their information is not absolute truth , but rather is a consensus perception of the truth .
However , most authors would vigorously deny this embarrassing view , and would prefer to believe that reference books contain only truth .
In other words , since most books say the same thing , they must all be correct , no ?
No , not if their authors place the goal of consensus higher than the goal of accuracy or even honesty .
If concensus is more important than fact , then the books would be expected to all agree with each other , whether their concensus facts were correct or not .
For this reason it is nearly impossible to alter the contents of text and reference books , even if the material in them is clearly erroneous .
If all the books say the same thing , no single author is willing to buck the majority and stand out from the crowd .
After all , that many books could n't be wrong !
Yet if they * are * wrong , then acknowledging this fact would rub our noses in the fragility of the foundations of our whole system of knowledge .
And so we maintain a unified front of " illusory truthfulness . "
Maintaining the illusion becomes more important to us than the correcting of any mistakes .
If we must maintain respect for reference books at any cost , then whenever they all make the same major flub , we do n't correct that flub .
We do n't even see it , since we automatically indulge in unsupported disbeliefs which lead to blindness and denial .
If a major mistake regarding Tesla 's priority to inventing Radio is made in 1915 , and if this mistake is not officially righted until 1943 , then reference books and textbooks had thirty years to mistakenly elevate Marconi as the inventor of radio .
How many decades do you think it would take before the thirty years of Marconi - worship finally wears off , before the textbook concensus shifts and begins to recognize Tesla ?
Well , fifty years have passed , and clamor to recognize Tesla is finally starting to be heard .
PBS even presented Tesla 's radio history in the recent " Tesla : Master of Lightning . "
However , the major players currently dismiss the Tesla revision as " conspiracy theories " coming from fringe groups and " Tesla worshippers . "
I suspect that it will take far longer than fifty years before all the new textbooks finally reverse themselves .
It can only happen slowly , so nobody is threatened or embarrassed .
Politics and face - saving becomes far more important than historical accuracy !
The real story must invade the books slowly , so no one is directly forced to confront the staggering extent of this historical error .
To say that I am a patient man would be an understatement .
Seventeen years sat watching and waiting on the shores of Loch Ness for one decent sighting of the monster has to be considered dedication in anybody 's eyes .
To me , however , it is more a dream come true : this subject has fascinated me since a family holiday in 1970 , when I was seven .
It was then that we visited the Loch Ness Investigation Bureau , a team of volunteers who each summer set up a makeshift camp on the lochside near Urquhart Castle , from where they mounted round - the - clock surveillance in the hope of filming Nessie .
What really caught my imagination was the platform they had built , on which they had mounted a cine camera and tripod ; the lens alone must have been a metre long .
Grown men looking for monsters ?
Fantastic .
Noticing my interest , and knowing that it would be a long drive back home to Dorset , my father bought me the bureau 's information pack , a folder that I still have , filled with copies of sighting reports and reprints of iconic photographs .
I was hooked .
Over the next decade my interest grew , fuelled by classroom debates and several more family holidays to the Scottish Highlands .
I would return to the loch many times , first as a child and then , when I was an adult , on two - week " expeditions " , armed with a very basic camera and my grandfather 's second world war binoculars , fully expecting to be able to solve the mystery before I had to return to work .
Little did I realise that it could take a lifetime .
I might have been content to visit the loch periodically , get my fix of monster hunting , then return to work , had I remained in the creative occupations that I pursued for the first eight years of my working life , first as a potter , then as a bookbinder and finally as a graphic artist .
However , by 1987 , when I was 24 , I had a house and a steady girlfriend , and when it was suggested that I join my father setting up a company installing burglar alarms , I jumped at the chance to make some serious money .
Pretty soon , I realised I was in the wrong job , but the thing that got to me most while working in people 's homes was the number of retired folk who would say , " Oh , I wish I 'd gone and lived in America when I was your age " , or climbed Mount Everest , or whatever .
What would I regret not having done when I reached 70 ?
It was obvious : I knew where I was at my happiest , and what I was most interested in .
So I quit the relationship , and put the house on the market .
To make absolutely sure that what I was planning was right for me and not just a pipe dream , I loaded up the works van and , in the summer of 1990 , went on a three - week hunt to the loch .
I had the time of my life .
The day the cheque from the sale of my house went into the bank , I told my parents I would be leaving the , by now , lucrative family business .
" Oh , and by the way , I 'm going to search for the Loch Ness monster instead . "
" Told you , " my mother said to my father .
I needed something to live in .
Within days my brother had located the perfect thing , a 20 - year - old former mobile library , wood - lined and with a potbelly stove .
In this , I would be able to move around the loch between vantage points , and follow up any new sightings .
On June 19 1991 , I arrived at the loch and became a full - time monster hunter .
I had never been happier .
To fund myself , I hit on the idea of making little Nessie models out of modelling clay , sitting the monsters on rocks gathered from the shore .
I was sure that tourists would buy them , but in the first year I found it hard to sell any .
The problem was that nobody knew what I was doing , or why .
Fortunately , while planning this quest , I had phoned the BBC for advice about which video format I should use if I wanted my results to be broadcast - quality .
I was put through to the team making the Video Diaries series .
Spotting the potential for a good story , they kitted me out with enough equipment and batteries to film the whole of my first year in my new life .
As soon as this programme , Desperately Seeking Nessie , was aired in August 1992 , I knew that everything would be OK .
People started turning up wanting to buy a model from the guy who had given up his comfortable life to follow a dream .
I still get visitors who remember it .
I never set a time limit , but I suppose I thought that within the first three years I would surely see and film something .
I now know that was a wee bit optimistic .
The loch is more than 23 miles long and , realistically , one man can only be looking at about a mile of it at any time .
I have tried other methods of hunting over the years ; using a boat with some fairly decent echo sounders on board I have had contacts with objects in mid-loch that appear to be much larger than the resident fish .
But an echo sounder will never reveal what it has found , but just give a rough idea of how big it is .
I have also got a good friend who owns a microlight , but it is not much use when you are looking for a very dark object in very dark water .
So nowadays I watch and wait mostly from the shoreline .
I would love to have my own boat , but to generate enough money to buy one , I would first have to film Nessie .
For most of the first decade my van remained mobile , which gave me the chance to move between three or four lochside villages .
However , I increasingly found myself drawn to the village of Dores , on the south shore , from where I had the best view of Loch Ness that anyone could wish for .
About 10 years ago the van failed its last MOT , and so I decided it was time to become static .
The Dores Inn car park was perfect , backing on to the beach as it does and , thanks to the owners ' kindness , I had permission to spread out a bit , build some decking out of old pallets , and incorporate a large piece of driftwood to display my models on .
Utopia .
Now I have my perfect lochside base , as well as my own postcode and council tax bills .
There is no running water or electricity , but the pub has an outside tap , and car batteries charged by a solar panel enable me to run my lights , radio and laptop .
My shower consists of two buckets of loch water and a saucepan heated on the stove .
The loch deposits driftwood for my stove right outside my door , ( much needed , as I 've seen temperatures reach minus 17C ) and a great big concrete patio table on my " decking " makes sitting out on a summer 's day my favourite pastime .
I breakfast at this table , put my models out for sale , and wait to see what adventures will turn up .
Tourists arrive to ask me questions , friends come to sit and chat , then maybe there is a Mediterranean - style buffet , an evening campfire , a starry night sky , and , best of all , sometimes the northern lights .
Then , when everyone has gone and I have the loch to myself again , I stand at the shoreline and feel the energy that pours off the place , before retiring to watch the night sky through the skylight above my bed .
That , to me , is a perfect day .
The Highland weather does not always permit such joys , in which case I find that I can keep myself admirably busy inside my van .
I make a few models , possibly do a watercolour painting that I can later sell , read , listen to the radio , maybe even watch the occasional osprey feeding right outside my door .
As soon as I feel boredom coming on , I change tack , and anyway I have long since realised that in this life the unpredictable is never far away , be it the Chinese State Circus dropping by for a photo shoot or Billy Connolly inviting me to be a guide for half a dozen of his A - list chums for a day .
Film crews and journalists from all over the world turn up on a regular basis , and I answer all their questions , but they are invariably focused on one subject : is there a monster , or is n't there ?
Which is perfectly understandable , but it frustrates me that I never have the chance to get an equally important point across : that if you have a dream , no matter how harebrained others think it is , then it is worth trying to make it come true .
I 'm living proof that it might just work .
Have I ever regretted my decision ?
Never , not for one second .

If possible , include a phone number .
On Wednesday morning , DFA sent out a national message from our Santa Cruz Organizer Chris Finnie calling for Sen .
Feinstein to be held accountable :
The message read in part :
The first vote on retroactive immunity for phone companies is Thursday .
Please take action today .
Senator Feinstein wo n't vote with Democrats against the Bush administration 's abuse of power .
Ask Senator Reid to replace her with someone who will .
We were tracking the calls to Sen.
Reid 's DC Office and after about 10 minutes , we knew something special was happening .
Carl from San Diego wrote the typical feedback :
voicemail box full 2 ) staffer busy signal 3 ) staffer busy signal
Thousands were trying to get through to Sen Reid and the line was busy .
But , instead of giving up , you called his Nevada offices to deliver the message .
You led the way , and we responded by putting up Sen.
Reid 's Carson City , Las Vegas , and Reno numbers as well .
Still , we could not have expected what happened next .
The comments flowed in and soon , all four numbers were busy and the voicemail was full
As our Political Director Liveblogged :
With only minutes left before the Nevada offices close , we 've made over 1900 calls in 8 hours .
And , two comments in the feedback really caught our attention :
Jerry M wrote :
I called the Reno office and got a cheerful staffer who said he'd had 242 calls , all of them against amnesty for the phone companies .
He understood Senator Feinstein was also getting a lot of calls .
Said he would be calling Senator Reid before closing the office to let him know the count .
Said he'd not had a single call in favor .
Michael R wrote :
Spoke with a staff member in the Reno office , he indicated he has gotten other calls on the issue - he said Reid will address the issue directly with Senator Feinstein now and at the beginning of the next session .
And then , it came full circle , and we knew we had a shot .
DFA member Chris Finnie ( the author of the original email ) called Senator Feinstein 's office on Wednesday evening and here 's what happened .
Here 's part of her comment
When I called Feinstein 's office , a rather testy staffer told me the senator had n't decided on her vote yet .
I said , " then she should n't have told the newspapers she had .
And , if her vote is still in question , she 'd better vote to protect my rights instead of AT&T's .
They can't vote for her , I can . "
The rest , as they say , is history .
After a number of procedural gimmicks Sen.
Feinstein voted for a bill without telecom immunity .
Of course , there was one final interesting twist .
Remember Chris , the DFA member who wrote the original email , and gave us the heads up that Sen.
Feinstein might be rethinking her vote ?
Well here 's how she found out about our victory :
I did n't know about the vote until I saw Art Torres , chair of the California Democratic Party , at an event tonight .
Asked him if he 'd seen the DFA email .
He said yes and , with a smile said , " You must be pleased .
Senator Feinstein voted against immunity .
Congratulations ! "
So I thought you 'd all like to know we did get their attention -- and even congratulations !
Great work everyone !
And , if you want to help DFA continue running such campaigns , please contribute $ 15 today .
Update 1 : A lot of comments have asked for some positive reinforcement for Sen. Feinstein .
Please give her DC Office a call : ( 202 ) 224-3841

Welcome to BushWorld , an Orwellian nightmare of epic proportions .
As has been so astutely pointed out , facts have a liberal bias , so the press conference that Bush held yesterday was completely devoid of any liberal bias .
As Keith Olbermann says :
1984 had new - speak .
We have Bush - speak .
Rhetoric designed to obfuscate reality and to quell dissent . [..]
The country was treated to a full 45 minute dosage of it this morning .
The President holding a news conference to once again reiterate his own version of events : the surge in Iraq is working , the Iraqi government is making progress , America is not heading towards a recession , and of course , Democrats are trying to kill us all by not giving telecom companies immunity .
Watch how truly bizarre the press conference was to anyone who has two braincells to rub together .
Note too that while Bill Plante and David Gregory asked the kind of questions we should see from a press corps , few -- if any -- media outlets took the time that Olbermann did to show how contradictory and without substance the President 's words were .
Ruby Cheat Sheets
By Peter Cooper
Ruby is an easy language to learn , but it 's often necessary to look up something we 've forgotten .
A combination of Google plus any Ruby books we have on our shelves can help , but sometimes it 's handy to refer to a simpler set of notes - such as a " cheat sheet . "
This post attempts to cover the most interesting ones .
The idea for this initial list came from Scott Klarr 's own list .
Scott has been quite prolific lately in putting together lists of cheat sheets .
Some of his lists are : Apache cheat sheets , MySQL cheat sheets , PHP cheat sheets , and JavaScript / AJAX cheat sheets .
On with the Ruby cheat sheets :
" Essential Ruby " RefCard ( PDF )
Essential Ruby is a combination of a cheat sheet and a tutorial .
It 's six pages long , but features a mini Ruby introduction and tutorial , as well as the myriad of tables you 'd expect from a cheat sheet .
It 's like a whole Ruby beginner 's reference and tutorial in a single PDF .
The only " catch " is that you need to be a user of DZone ( the " Digg for Developers " ) or JavaLobby to get it , but there 's a very simple signup form you can fill in if you 're not .
Ruby Cheatsheet ( PDF and PNG )
This cheat sheet ( homepage ) covers types , exceptions , expressions , variable types , operators and precedence , constants , regular expressions , predefined / special variables , arguments accepted by the Ruby interpreter , reserved words , and a large collection of Object , String , Kernel , Array , Hash , Test : : Unit , File , Dir and DateTime methods .
Extremely suitable for printing and / or wall chart use .
Ruby QuickRef ( HTML )
I often use this one myself !
A ridiculously comprehensive " cheat sheet " created by Ryan Davis covering syntax rules , reserved words , regular expression terminology , class and method definitions , predefined variables and constants , control and logic expressions and formations , exceptions , the standard library , and a whole ton of useful stuff .
Ruby Reference ( PDF )
More of an extremely brief reference than a truly comprehensive cheat sheet , but still useful , especially for beginners .
5 pages long , so not suitable for printing ( Also available to view on the Web at Scribd . )
Cheat : Ruby Cheat Sheets on your Terminal !

Over the past 200 years , the stock market 's steady upward march occasionally has been disrupted for long stretches , most recently during the Great Depression and the inflation - plagued 1970s .
The current market turmoil suggests that we may be in another lost decade .
The stock market is trading right where it was nine years ago .
Stocks , long touted as the best investment for the long term , have been one of the worst investments over the nine - year period , trounced even by lowly Treasury bonds .
The Standard & Poor 's 500 - stock index , the basis for about half of the $ 1 trillion invested in U.S. index funds , finished at 1352.99 on Tuesday , below the 1362.80 it hit in April 1999 .
When dividends and inflation are factored into returns , the S&P 500 has risen an average of just 1.3 % a year over the past 10 years , well below the historical norm , according to Morningstar Inc .
For the past nine years , it has fallen 0.37 % a year , and for the past eight , it is off 1.4 % a year .
In light of the current wobbly market , some economists and market analysts worry that the era of disappointing returns may not be over .
Until last fall , many investors had viewed the bursting of the tech - stock bubble as a nasty but short - term setback .
The market had resumed its upward march , reaching new highs in October .
Giz is fair and balanced , so here 's Mac vs. PC , Republican - style .
Huckabee 's a PC ( duh ) ; Ron Paul is PC ( no Linux ? ) ; Mitt Romney somehow manages to slide in both ( surprise ! ) ; and McCain is a Luddite who does n't touch the bizarre , blinking gizmos .

The day after I finished " Final Fantasy VII , " I sat down for lunch with some friends who had also completed the game .
We all enjoyed it , but felt it was n't all it could have been .
We thought we -- a group of jobless , inexperienced students with no resources -- could do better .
I was the only one who had ever flipped through a book on C++ , so I became lead developer .
Tony , who'd never used a computer for anything except playing " The Oregon Trail , " had a knack for drawing and became lead artist .
Everyone else ( Dan and Tim ) was split up between writing ( Dan ) and marketing ( Tim ) .
How hard could it be ?
Well , it turns out that all those people thanked in the end credits actually knew how to do stuff .
A humbling experience like that is necessary for most early developers .
Stephen C. was a lot like me .
There was one difference between us , though ; he had a job .
Prodigy at Work
Stephen was working as a programmer for a small credit agency in the Southwest .
He was building a midsize mod_perl application ( a Perl module for the Apache HTTP server ) to parse HTML - based credit reports for automated input into the company 's reporting system .
Stephen had gotten a job offer in his senior year of high school and started work immediately after graduation .
Of course , his title of " Senior Programmer , " which he liked , was n't based on experience .
The company was a startup , and the founder was a bit of a luddite , who thought Stephen was a " genius . "
Stephen 's bravado was n't much of a burden at first .
He designed and built the first version of their software in a few months , and except for a few bugs everything ran fine .
Revenue was coming in and they started hiring more developers for phase two .
One component of the project was developing a module to parse HTML ; a common problem with many available solutions including HTML :: Parser .
But that 's written in C , thought Stephen .
It would be too slow .
Stephen did n't test to verify this , but he'd heard somewhere that calls from Perl to C were unusable due to performance problems .
The founder had so much faith in Stephen , he was willing to follow any advice .
Stephen would develop a custom module .
Clever Script
HyperParser was built in a few days .
Stephen called it " HyperParser " because it was so fast .
It was a messy amalgam of regular expressions surrounded by " clever " Perl code .
Whatever , Stephen reasoned .
It was written to be fast , not pretty .
The proof would be in the performance .
Stephen drafted a quick HTML document and ran HTML :: Parser on it .
6 seconds .
An eternity .
HyperParser ? 0.2 seconds .
Success !
It was 30 times the efficiency !
Stephen excitedly hacked to integrate HyperParser into the main codebase .
And the application crashed .
After coding , benchmarking and writing " HyperParser " all over his notepad with lightning bolts all around it , he 'd never actually looked at the output .
He found the bug quickly , fixed it and noticed another bug .
His main loop had no code in it .
He 'd tested the speed of HTML :: Parser against the speed of doing absolutely nothing .
By that standard , his code was efficient , but not terribly practical .
The elation of annihilating HTML :: Parser 's speed was short - lived when Stephen benchmarked his corrected code .
Another 6 seconds .
And HyperParser ?
He gave up after 5 minutes .
Calling the thing " HyperParser " was like putting flame decals on a Geo Metro .
Angry at himself , Stephen integrated HTML :: Parser into the app in a few hours .
Parsing was handled by a third - party library , which meant less code on their end , and less work to maintain .
As he thought about how much worse the app would 've been with HyperParser , a valuable lesson was cemented in his head : Clever coding is n't worth it .
The founder learned from the experience , too .
He 'd put too much faith in a junior developer , wasting time and money on a module that would 've been more of burden than help .
Calling an inexperienced programmer " Senior Programmer " does n't make it so .

Ladies and gentlemen , thank you … thank you very much … thank you …
Good people of New Hampshire , I stand before you today with two things : a simple message and a dire need .
The message is one that I ’ve been delivering for nearly 40 years .
It ’s a message that I know is familiar to you , it ’s your state motto : “ Live Free or Die ” .
Yes , it ’s a little strange for me to be delivering your own motto to you , but that ’s where the dire need comes in , so bear with me .
The people of New Hampshire are needed .
The people of New Hampshire are desperately needed .
America needs you to stand up and say that enough is enough .
America needs you to live up to your reputation and put your votes where your mouths are .
American needs you to exemplify the “ Live Free or Die ” philosophy .
You ’ve lived under the motto , now America needs you to live the motto .
We ’ve reached a point , in this country , where small , incremental changes have chipped away at our personal freedoms .
We ’ve reached a point , in this country , where huge , sweeping mistakes have destroyed our international reputation .
We ’ve reached a point , in this country , where our economy is grinding to a halt , our currency is collapsing and our prosperity is disappearing .
America needs New Hampshire to say “ Enough ! ” America needs New Hampshire to claim back our freedoms .
( Pause – applause )
The country ’s need is strong enough that I ’m going to be blunt with you here ; you only have two choices in the Republican Party Primary .
You can vote for me or you can continue to see your country ’s future squandered .
Now , I ’ll admit I ’m not much of a politician .
I ’m not smooth , polished or particularly inspiring speaker but I do n’t need to be … because the message of freedom speaks for itself !
( Pause – cheering )
I am the only Republican candidate who voted against the war .
( Pause – cheering )
I have never voted to provide more funding for the war .
( Pause – cheering )
Most importantly , listen carefully to this , when I am elected I will bring our troops back home to their families .
I will end this war !
( Pause – pandemonium )
You want freedom ?
I support legalizing drugs and abolishing the IRS !
( Pause – shouting , cheering )
You want prosperity ?
I will restore this country ’s economic power with responsible fiscal policies .
You know ?
Like a Republican is supposed to .
( Pause – laughter )
You want honesty , integrity and commitment ?
I ’ve been married to my lovely wife for 50 years and I ’ve been a congressman for 40 of those years .
I ’ve voted according to the constitution without exception , for those 40 years because that ’s what I was elected to do !
( Pause – cheering )
The time has come , New Hampshire , for you to decide whether “ Live Free or Die ” is a motto or a way of life .
The time has come , New Hampshire , for you to decide whether our future will be filled with freedom or fear , prosperity or war , truth and honesty or more of the same we ’ve been getting for 8 years .
Enough is enough New Hampshire .
New Hampshire , there is n’t another candidate who supports freedom like I do .
There is n’t another candidate who has a track recording of voting for freedom like I do .
So I ask you today , New Hampshire , are you ready ?
Are you ready to stand up and be counted ?
Are you ready to lead our country out of this dark hour ?
Is it just a motto New Hampshire , or are you truly ready to Live Free or Die ?
Thank you .
Thank you . ( etc )
( Mayhem ensues )

Mr Chavez has been mediating hostage releases with the rebels
Speaking on his weekly television show , President Chavez also said Venezuela 's embassy in Colombia would close .
Mr Chavez said he was reacting to the " cowardly murder " of a leading Farc rebel by Colombian forces in a raid just inside Ecuador on Saturday .
Later , Ecuador recalled its ambassador to Bogota in protest at the incursion .
Raul Reyes and at least 16 other rebels were killed in the operation , which took place about 1.8 km ( one mile ) inside Ecuadorean territory .
' Invasion '
Mr Chavez has been mediating with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia - or Farc - to secure the release of hostages the rebels hold , and six have so far been freed under this initiative .
But he lamented the killing of Reyes - whom he called a " good revolutionary " - when he spoke on his show , " Alo , Presidente " .
Colombia 's defence minister had described the death of Reyes as the " biggest blow so far " to Farc .
But Mr Chavez described the strike as " a cowardly murder , all of it coldly calculated " .
He said Colombia " invaded Ecuador , flagrantly violated Ecuador 's sovereignty " .
Mr Chavez addressed his defence minister , asking him to " move 10 battalions to the border with Colombia for me , immediately " - a deployment likely to involve several thousand soldiers .
" The air force should mobilise .
We do not want war .
But we are not going to let them ... come and divide and weaken us . "
He ordered the Venezuelan embassy in Bogota closed and said all embassy personnel would be withdrawn .
Mr Chavez had earlier warned Bogota that any incursion into Venezuelan territory similar to Saturday 's operation would be a " cause for war " .
Ecuador anger
Later , Ecuador announced that it too was taking punitive measures against what it terms an illegal incursion , and had recalled its envoy to Colombia .
But this is not a full severance of ties , as commercial relations will remain intact , said officials at the country 's foreign ministry .
In his address , Mr Chavez said Ecuador 's President Rafael Correa had also agreed to send troops to the border , Associated Press news agency reported .
President Correa has complained to the Colombian government about its incursion , calling it " scandalous " , and a formal protest has been lodged with Bogota .
Colombia 's government has received billions of dollars in aid from Washington to fight the guerrillas - as the US , along with the EU , views Farc as a terrorist organisation .
Colombian troops have recently retaken control of areas previously held by rebel groups , but Farc retains a strong hold over Colombia 's more remote regions .
Mission
GOOOH stands for ' Get Out of Our House ' and is pronounced like the word ' go ' .
It is a NON - PARTISAN plan to place citizen representatives on the ballot in 2012 , ideally in the primary against the incumbent , competing for a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives .
The members of each district will have an honest opportunity to replace the career politicians who have taken over OUR House and are destroying our nation .
If you are tired of career politicians , GOOOH is for you .
If you believe money has corrupted Washington , GOOOH is for you .
If you believe politicians have too much power , GOOOH is for you .
If you are weary of the death grip the two parties have on our government , and are ready to return control of our government to the people , then GOOOH is for you .
GOOOH is NOT a political party .
It is a system that will allow you and your neighbors to choose , among yourselves , a candidate who will truly represent your district .
Members will select a citizen representative to serve their district .
How our candidates get on the ballot will be dependent on when we reach our membership goal .
Our preference is to compete in the primaries against the incumbent .
It is possible candidates may choose to run in some other way ; the candidates will make that decision based on the situation in their district .
It is important to clearly state that we are not a third party .
We have no platform and are a bottom - up organization .
We are a process for selecting and funding candidates .
This is an evolving system and your input is requested .
The questions are changing based on the feedback of members like you .
Participate in the forums .
Send us your thoughts .
This is YOUR system .
We will perfect it with your input .
This is a new system created by an innovative engineer who has developed complex computer systems his entire career that change the way we do things .
The founder developed software for a spy satellite system , helped invent the first credit - card - reading gas pump system , and worked at Dell as the company grew to a $ 55 billion technology giant .
This system leverages the internet and social networking to allow " we the people " to select true representatives , not choose between the politicians the two parties offer .
If we continue to elect career politicians who represent their party , the special interests that fund them , and themselves , nothing will change .
This is a non-partisan process that will enable the change we all seek .
GOOOH will allow you to :
Help select your Representative - while being considered yourself if you like Hold your Representative accountable Replace career politicians with true representatives
Take the money out of politics
Our process allows Americans of every political leaning to participate in the selection of their District 's Representative while being considered themselves .
Through our Candidate Selection Sessions you and your peers will select the candidate in your district who best represents your district 's views .
Even if you do not wish to become your district 's representative you will want to participate in the process and have a direct say in who is chosen to represent your district .
We will fund a single national campaign to promote our candidates ( one from each district ) who are selected to run against the party politicians .
Because we are a process for selecting representatives ( not a " party " ) w e expect a socially moderate candidate to be selected in San Francisco and a socially conservative one in Colorado Springs .
We expect fiscally conservative candidates to be chosen in just about every district -- but it will be up to the members in each district to decide .
Originally , our founder proposed excluding lawyers , members of political families , and individuals with more than $ 11.5 million in assets ( 250 times the median income ) .
They were not to be excluded because they are bad people , but because they are overly represented in government today and , generally speaking , no longer seem to represent the common man .
However , based on input from our members , the Question Committee has voted to remove the exclusion of lawyers and the wealthy .
It will be up to the participants in each pool to decide whether or not that is of concern .
We believe this change is indicative of the continuing evolution of our system .
We hope you will join GOOOH today and help us take our House back from the politicians !
For GOOOH to succeed we need donating members .
We encourage each member to donate $ 100 now and help us get the advertising efforts started .
We will choose candidates for 2012 in any district with 250 or more members and a leader .
We will continue to build our base of supporters until a month before the filing deadline in each state , at which time we will begin the selection process .
Our first candidates will be chosen in Texas , beginning on Nov ember 5th - Texas has the earliest filing deadline in the nation .
In most states , candidates will run as a Republican or Democrat , competing in the primary .
In some states our candidates could run as an Independent , though they will be advised that the odds will be stacked heavily against them if they do .
They could run on some other Party ’s ticket , such as the Libertarian Party or the Constitution Party , but again , we will not advise taking that route ; Republicans and Democrats win 99.9 % of the time .
The rules in each state and the willingness of established parties to cooperate will help determine how to access the ballot .
New evidence suggests second shooter killed RFK David Edwards and Nick Juliano
Published : Wednesday March 26 , 2008

Print This Email This Forty years after Democratic rising star Robert F. Kennedy was killed at a Los Angeles hotel during his presidential run , new evidence suggests the man serving a life sentence for his murder did not fire the shots that killed the charismatic senator .
Forensic scientists met at a conference in Connecticut this week to discuss their independent findings that cast serious doubt on the Kennedy assassination .
Sirhan Sirhan is serving a life sentence in Kennedy 's death , but the conference presenters argue he could not have fired the fatal shot that killed Kennedy .
One investigator , Dr. Robert Joling , has studied the Kennedy assassination for nearly four decades .
He determined the fatal shot came from behind Kennedy , while Sirhan was four to six feet in front of the senator and never got close enough to shoot him from behind , an NBC affiliate reports .
Analysis by another forensics engineer , Philip Van Praag , of a Canadian journalists tape recording , known as the Pruszynski recording , determined that 13 shots were fired while Kennedy was killed , although Sirhan 's gun only held eight bullets , according to the NBC reporter .
This suggests that a second shooter was involved in the assassination .
Van Praag 's analysis led him to conclude that a second gun that was fired matched a type owned by one of the security guards in Kennedy 's entourage .
" When that security guard was asked about owning that gun at first he admitted , ' Yes I owned that kind of gun but I got rid of it two months before the assassination . ' " correspondent Amy Parmenter said on MSNBC Wednesday .
" It turns out upon further investigation , in fact , he did not get rid of that gun until five months after the shooting .
Of course , you can see where we 're going with this .
...
That security guard , was in fact behind Senator Kennedy when the fatal shot was fired . "

Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger called Friday for the reversal of a recent appellate court decision banning parents from educating their children at home if they lack a teaching credential .
If the state Supreme Court fails to act , the governor vowed to push through legislation guaranteeing families ’ right to home school .
“ This outrageous ruling must be overturned by the courts and if the courts do n’t protect parents ’ rights then , as elected officials , we will , ” he said in a written statement .
Schwarzenegger ’s comments about the ruling came as home schooling families and national conservative leaders expressed increased concerns over the practice that they believe every parent has a fundamental right to exercise .
On Feb. 28 , the 2nd District Court of Appeal ruled that parents must have a teaching credential to home school their children .
The decision has not yet gone into effect and it is unlikely to be enforced pending appeals to the state Supreme Court by attorneys representing Phillip and Mary Long , the Lynwood couple at the center of the case , and others .

The California Department of Education allows home schooling as long as parents file paperwork with the state establishing themselves as small private schools , hire credentialed tutors or enroll their children in independent study programs run by charter or private schools or public school districts while still teaching at home .
California does little to enforce those provisions and insists it is the local school districts ’ responsibility .
In addition , state education officials say some parents home school their children without the knowledge of any entity .
The Pacific Justice Institute , which is representing a parochial school that is popular with home schoolers , including the Long family , plans to appeal the ruling .
The institute estimates that there are as many as 166,000 California students who are home schooled .
State education department officials , whose Sacramento offices were picketed by home schooling families Friday , said there is no way of knowing the true number .

State Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell spoke out about the ruling for the first time Friday at a news conference in Alameda in which he reaffirmed his support for parents to educate their children as they see fit while urging them to work with institutions to ensure that their children will be successful .
“ Whatever works best for that family , he would support as long as the children are getting a good education , ” department spokeswoman Pam Slater said .
“ He wants home school parents to make sure they have partnerships with school districts or charter schools to make sure they have the right curriculum , everything a child needs to succeed and get into college , ” Slater said .
Conservative leaders across the nation also weighed in on the matter , with evangelist James C. Dobson interrupting his “ Focus on the Family ” radio program ’s regular programming to discuss the ruling .

“ What has occurred is yet another egregious decision handed down by a California appeals court that strikes at the very heart and soul of families and their children , ” he said Friday morning .
“ The court has assaulted parental rights again and this time with a sledgehammer . ”
The Virginia - based Home School Legal Defense Assn. also started an online petition to urge the state Supreme Court to “ depublish ” the ruling , meaning it would apply only to the family in question and not set a precedent .
Thousands of supporters from across the nation were signing the petition every hour , and by 6:30 p.m. , it had more than 82,000 signatures .
In California , hundreds of worried home school families have been inundating the state Department of Education , the offices of the governor and state legislators as well as home school advocacy groups with phone calls and e-mails .

“ We ’re very busy ” answering phones , said Susan Beatty , co-founder of the Norwalk - based Christian Home Educators Assn. of California .
“ Most of them are confused and just want to be reassured .
There is some talk that home school is illegal after today , which is , of course , not true . ”
Beatty said the group was telling parents , “ There ’s no reason to be afraid , they can continue to home school as they have in the past . ”
The appellate court ruling stemmed from a case involving the Longs , who were repeatedly referred to the Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services over various allegations , including charges of physical abuse involving some of their eight children .
A lawyer appointed to represent two of the Long ’s young children requested that the court require them to physically attend a public or private school where adults could monitor their well - being .

The appellate court ruled that a parochial school ’s occasional monitoring of the children ’s education is insufficient to qualify as being enrolled in a private school , and because Mary Long does not hold a teaching credential , the court determined that the family is breaking state law .

Who Is Responsible for the
World Food Shortage
ARTICLES IN THIS FEATURE :
Introduction
by Marcia Merry Baker
This week 's cover photo , showing corn piled on the ground , out in the open , near Minnesota grain elevators , is representative of the disintegration of the food supply system the world over .
While the U.S. Midwest corn and soybean harvests were coming in this fall , the U.S. rail freight system broke down .
After years of financial mergers , asset stripping , and rail track removal , such companies as Union Pacific , which are considered to be financial " successes , " failed miserably on the economic front , and could not even supply engines to move the grain cars .
Millions of bushels of grain are sitting , rotting on the ground .
This grain transport breakdown is but one recent example of breakdown in the food supply in what is considered the most food - secure nation in the world , and illustrates the fact that " natural disasters " — bad weather , floods , droughts — are not the cause of the world 's food crises .
These examples , and equivalent situations all around the world , are " unnatural " disasters , caused by years of takedown of agriculture infrastructure under wrong policies and assumptions , in particular , serving the interests of private financial and commodities control circles , centered mostly in London .
The worldwide food crisis is measurable in the decline of grains , of all types , produced per capita yearly .
To provide every person with a daily diet of their preference , with sufficient calories and nutrients , would require well over 3 billion tons of grain produced annually .
But as of around 1990 , less than 1.9 billion tons were being produced yearly , and since then , world annual production has declined .
An estimated 800 million people are suffering from some degree of malnutrition .
Besides the nearly continentwide food supply crisis in Africa , there are other locations , such as Russia and former Soviet bloc nations , plunged into crisis .
Even under the Soviet command economy , Russia 's annual grain production averaged 100 million tons .
But output has fallen each year since 1991 , to only around 65 million tons this year .
No paradox
What does the international community say ?
Officially , the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) and sister U.N. agencies — the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade ( GATT ) , and the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) — blame hunger on " poverty . "
The FAO gala conference in Quebec City in October , for the FAO 's 50th anniversary , celebrated the fact that world tonnages of food have increased over five decades , but lamented that 800 million people do n't have enough to eat — a " paradox , " according to the conference speakers .
But most of the 100 or more agriculture ministers present knew better .
The last 25 - 30 years have seen a consistent decline of agriculture output potential in almost all countries .
Necessary ratios of infrastructure ( water , transport , electricity ) and inputs ( chemicals , mechanization , quality seeds and stock ) have fallen , to the point where output per capita is sharply declining .
At mid-century , after World War II , there were mobilizations to improve agriculture output potential on every continent .
In western Europe , the Common Agriculture Policy ( CAP ) of the European Community saw spectacular rises in agriculture productivity .
In Africa , the wave of newly independent nations , such as Sudan ( 1956 ) , made technology - based agriculture the keystone of national development plans .
The " Atoms for Peace " movement backed such designs as the continental electrification of Africa , and the provision of nuclear - power - based energy grids in Egypt , Iran , and other countries .
In North America , plans were drawn up for the North American Water and Power Alliance ( Nawapa ) , which would divert river runoff from flowing into the Arctic Ocean , southward .
The Mexico College of Engineers produced plans for sister hydraulic projects .
In Eurasia , blasting was started on Siberian water diversion projects to channel flow southward from the Ob and Irtysh watersheds , to relieve the endangered Aral Sea Basin .
Development of the Mekong River in Southeast Asia , and improvements in the Indian subcontinent , were outlined .
But by 1975 , most of these projects were shelved .
In the eyes of today 's " countercultured " generation , they have receded into the mists of science fiction , if they 've heard of these projects at all .
Over the 1970s , the shift was made to " post - industrial " policies , casino economics ( speculation , derivatives ) , and free trade demands , enforced by the IMF Bretton Woods system .
And now that financial system itself is in the process of blowout .
The food crisis is the evidence .
Dozens of nations , once self - sufficient in many food staples , have been forced into food import dependency over the past 30 years .
And now , neither the food stocks , nor the financing , exists for their food supplies .
The GATT launched the " Uruguay Round " for free trade in 1986 , under the slogan , " One World , One Market , " which culminated in the creation in 1995 of the World Trade Organization .
But the cupboard of the " World Market " is bare .
Nevertheless , in 1996 , the U.N. plans another World Food Summit , on the theme of " food security , " while millions more people go hungry .
Behind the scenes , the private financial interests served by the U.N. , IMF , and other Bretton Woods agencies , are making sweeping moves to acquire food stocks for hoarding , and to take controlling positions in food commodities production , processing , and shipping .
This is the last phase of an era of food - as - a - weapon politics , officially ushered in in 1974 , when then - U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger ( now Sir Henry KCMG ) gave the keynote speech at the Rome World Food Conference , the predecessor to the 1996 Food Summit .
In 1974 , Kissinger publicly talked of food security , while privately he worked to use food control as a weapon against a target list of nations .
Name the names
In this Special Report , we have assembled the documentation required to understand the crisis situation in depth , in order to intervene , and reverse it .
We provide :
the statistical overview of the past 30 years of forcing food import dependency on nations ;
the record of Henry Kissinger and the use of food control as a weapon ;
the names of the companies and individuals who make up the financial and commodities cartels controlling food supply lines .
These reviews are not the usual representation of today 's food crisis .
The " common - sense " reasons for food shortages that you usually hear — bad weather , backwardness , civil strife , etc. — are all wrong .
Worse , the " authorities " on food and agriculture who are usually presented by the media , will tell you specific lies that have been pre-approved for public consumption by the financial and commodities cartel interests that created and continue to back such bogus authorities .
For example , Lester Brown , of Worldwatch Institute , who spoke at the U.N. FAO 50th anniversary , is constantly in the media , charging that the world 's population has outstripped the world 's resources base , and demanding that population be cut because it can not be fed .
We supply the pedigree of Lester Brown , and other hired hands of the food cartels , so you know where the lies are coming from .
Emergency measures required
The information below ( with more to come in follow - up reports in 1996 ) , has been assembled in order to spur the mobilization for emergency financial and economic measures to deal with food shortages and the overall physical economic breakdown .
Several rear - guard actions were launched in 1995 .
They are well motivated , but they will not do the job .
A bill is before Congress , sponsored by Sen. Tom Daschle ( D - S.D. ) and others , to create a special commission to investigate control over the U.S. food supply by a " concentration " of processors .
An Agriculture Department investigation is under way of the monopolistic actions of IBP , the Nebraska - based , London - associated , largest meat processor in the world .
The Justice Department Anti-Trust Division has grand juries working on international price - fixing charges against the London - associated cartel companies Cargill Inc. , ADM , Tate & Lyle ( A.E. Staley ) , and CPC .
But dealing with the famine - scale food crisis , and financial disintegration , requires more than prosecution of isolated acts of wrongdoing , or mere " bigness . "
Read on , to find out what every citizen needs to know to do the right thing .

Wal - Mart pulls ' Superbad ' DVDs with ' Hawaii ' prop
Advertiser Staff
The DVD is packaged with a plastic card that resembles a Hawai 'i driver 's license .
The card was a prop used by one of the characters in the movie .
" We 're very pleased that Wal - Mart has taken prompt , corrective measures to comply with the city 's request to protect the integrity of our driver 's license .
It was foolish of the movie studio to include this prop in the DVD , particularly because it could be used by unscrupulous people to deceive others who are unfamiliar with our driver 's license .
For example , those who saw ' Superbad ' know the underage teenager used his fake Hawai 'i license to buy liquor . "
Hannemann yesterday had objected to the inclusion of the pseudo driver 's license  which serves as the primary identification card for most Hawai 'i residents  and sought Wal - Mart cooperation in removing the product from its shelves .
The mayor said , " We 're grateful that Wal - Mart was very responsive to our concerns and even took this matter to the very top of the corporate headquarters .
We hope Sony Pictures , which produced and marketed the film , will be as responsive . "
Under state law , anyone convicted of using a fake Hawai 'i driver 's license faces misdemeanor penalties of up to one year in prison and a fine of up to $ 1,000 .
Anyone convicted of forging a license faces Class B felony charges , with penalties of up to 10 years in prison and fines of up to $ 25,000 .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
If you want to know what 's going to happen to the labor market , do n't ask an economist - ask your neighbor or co-worker .
And right now , those non-experts are likely to be telling you that things do n't look very good .
Surveys show that Americans are growing increasingly glum about the availability of jobs .
And history shows that workers know what they 're talking about on this point - meaning that the unemployment rate is likely to increase sharply in the coming months .
Another sign from workers that the labor market is getting difficult :
There has been a sharp decline in the number of workers willing to quit their jobs .
Economists surveyed by Briefing.com forecast that Friday 's report will show that employers added only 25,000 jobs to payrolls in February , after a 17,000 drop in employment in January .
And the unemployment rate is expected to climb to 5 % from 4.9 % in January .
To some economists , even 5 % unemployment is considered close to full employment .
But here , the view of the public is far less optimistic than the experts .
A Conference Board survey of 5,000 Americans in February found that their view of the job market went from bullish to bearish since the January reading .
Those saying jobs are " hard to get " rose to 23.8 % from 20.6 % , as that pessimistic take now outnumbers the 20.6 % claiming jobs are " plentiful , " down from the 23.8 % who saw a good market in January 's reading .
In addition , when asked about the outlook for jobs six months from now , those who said they expected fewer jobs in the months ahead spiked 6 percentage points to 27.9 % , and now outnumbers those who expect more jobs by better than three - to - one margin .
In the 40 - year history of the monthly survey , there have only been 18 other months with a 5 percentage point or larger jump in those who believed the job outlook was going to get worse six months down the road .
And in 14 of those cases , they were right , with the unemployment rate rising on average by 0.8 in the following six months , a statistically significant rise that is typically associated with a recession .
Economists say that kind of increase is n't a big surprise , that workers know of trouble ahead well at their own jobs before they start showing up in more traditional readings such as jobless claims or employer payroll counts .
" People know what 's happening in their own office better than anyone else , sometimes better than the boss , " said David Wyss , chief economist for Standard & Poor's .
Wyss said that another reason that expectations of a tougher job market proves out is that consumers worried about their jobs pull back on spending , which causes employers to respond by cutting staff or hiring plans .
Of course it's not just employees ' view of the labor market that is pointing to a weak jobs report this Friday .
One of the Labor Department 's lesser - watched reports is the Job Openings and Labor Turnover report , which reports on the percentage of employees quitting their jobs .
It includes those who move immediately to another job as well as those who leave without another position immediately available .
The " quit rate " fell to a seasonally - adjusted 1.8 % in December , as the number of those quitting was down about 11 % from a year earlier .
Some battered industries , such as construction , have seen the quit rate fall to the lowest levels on record .
" When the quit rate is low , it 's a very bad sign , " said economist Robert Bruca of FAO Economics .
" The quit rates change slowly .
When you see big changes , they 're surprising . "
Payroll services firm ADP 's February Employment Report also showed a drop of 23,000 private sector jobs , the first decline in payrolls in the two years it has been reported .
ADP crunched numbers that predate the survey that showed February was the worst month since April 2003 , when the labor market was still in the midst of the so - called jobless recovery and the unemployment rate was 6 % .
Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisors , which processes the ADP payroll services data to produce the report , says what is notable is the decline in employment among medium size employers , those with 50 to 499 employees .
They saw a net 4,000 decline in their staffing levels as a group .
" It 's the small and medium firms that have been posting increases even as the large firms were weak and even negative , " said Prakken .
" But whether you slice it by sector or size of firm , there 's softness there . "
Prakken does n't believe this is the end of job losses in the ADP report .
" It would n't surprise me if over the next six months we see no change or a modest decline in establishment employment over the entire period , " he said .
They were the 15 youthful Tibetan monks – three still in their teens – who sparked a rebellion by daring to speak out against China 's repression of their homeland .
The group paraded peacefully down Barkhor Street in Lhasa old town on 10 March handing out leaflets , chanting pro-independence slogans and carrying the banned Tibetan flag .
Their demand was that the Chinese government that has ruled Tibet since 1951 should ease a " patriotic re-education " campaign which forced them to denounce the Dalai Lama and subjected them to government propaganda .
The reaction of the authorities , desperate to snuff out the most serious uprising against Chinese rule for almost half a century , was rapid and brutal .
The group was detained on the spot , with eyewitnesses reporting that several of the monks suffered severe beatings as they were arrested and taken away .
They have not been seen since .

Amnesty International called last night for their immediate release , along with all the other anti-Chinese demonstrators picked up in the past three weeks .
The human rights organisation said they were at " high risk of torture and other ill treatment " and called on supporters to write to Hu Jintao , the Chinese President , with copies to the Chinese embassy in London .
Steve Ballinger , a UK spokesman for Amnesty , said : " China 's reaction to peaceful protests in Tibet and neighbouring provinces – detaining demonstrators , flooding the area with troops and reportedly using violence – does not bode well for the Olympics .
Some protests may have turned violent and the Chinese authorities have a responsibility to protect the lives and property of people in the region .
But locking up peaceful protesters and locking out journalists is totally unacceptable .
These monks must be released immediately and all those detained in recent weeks must be accounted for .
If basic human rights are not respected , China 's promises to clean up its act ahead of the Olympics will seem very hollow indeed . "
The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy ( TCHRD ) , which operates in exile from India , expressed its " deepest fear " that monks face " extreme inhumane treatment " in Chinese detention centres .
It said : " Torture is a regular exercise in Chinese - administered prisons and detention centres in Tibet . "
The plight of the monks was being seen as a key symbolic test for the Chinese government as it tries to bring calm to the country before this summer 's Olympic Games in Beijing .
Yesterday the Olympic flame was lit in Greece and began a global journey to the Olympic stadium in Beijing .
But its progress risks being overshadowed by protests if China continues apparently to ignore the human rights of those who protest against it .
The monk 's march – on the 49th anniversary of a failed uprising against Chinese rule – was among the first in Lhasa .
Amid the chaos , police ordered traders in the market to go home and soldiers were drafted in .
The action was futile as protests began in other monasteries in support of the 15 monks and lay people began marching in support of Tibetan rights .
The monks – who were visiting Lhasa 's Sera monastery – have not been seen since their arrest .
Nothing is known of their condition or whereabouts .
With the province " locked down " by the police and army , and all foreign journalists and observers forbidden from travelling to Tibet , there is little firm information about the extent of the uprising .
But unconfirmed reports suggest there have been more than 1,000 arrests in the province and about 100 deaths in clashes between Tibetans and the authorities .
Many other groups of monks have taken to the streets complaining that the authorities were increasingly restricting their religious freedoms .
They were soon joined by groups of civilians protesting that their Tibetan identity was being eroded by a deliberately policy of flooding the area with the minority Han Chinese ethnic group .
The protests erupted into rioting four days later which Tibet 's exiled government said claimed 80 lives .
Beijing appears to have quelled the unrest for the moment by sending troops to Tibet and the provinces of Gansu , Qinghai and Sichuan .
But pressure is mounting on China to begin talks with the Dalai Lama , whom it has blamed for inciting the unrest .
A group of 29 Chinese dissidents have signed an open letter calling for talks with Tibet 's spiritual leader and demanding a UN investigation into the situation .
Support is also growing for a boycott of the Olympics if Beijing persists in its brutal treatment of dissent .
Opinion
Failure suits George W. Bush
That idiotic " what me worry ? " look just never leaves the man 's visage .
Once again , there was our president , presiding over disasters , in part of his making and totally on his watch , grinning with an aplomb that suggested a serious disconnect between his worldview and reality .
Be it in his announcement that Iraq is being secured on a day when bombs ripped through that sad land , or posed between his Treasury secretary and the Federal Reserve chairman to applaud the government 's bailout of a failed investment bank , President Bush was the only one inexplicably smiling .
Failure suits him .
It is a stance he learned to wear well while presiding over one failed Texas business deal after another , and it served him splendidly as he claimed the title of president of the United States after losing the popular , and maybe even the electoral , vote .
It carried him through the most ignominious chapter of U.S. foreign policy , from the lies about Iraq 's weapons of mass destruction to his unprecedented defense of torture by a U.S. president .
The arrogance of unwarranted assurance was there this week as the U.S. dollar fell into the toilet , which , along with the debacle of Iraq and his other failed Mideast policies , pushed oil prices to record highs .
The Europeans , who did n't support the U.S. intervention , are doing much better , not having to pay to guard besieged oil pipelines while U.S. taxpayers are saddled with trillions of dollars in future debt , not to mention the loss of 4,000 U.S. servicemen and servicewomen and the 30,000 wounded in a war the Bush administration had promised would be paid for with Iraqi oil revenues .
Even in Baghdad last week , there was n't enough oil to keep the lights on for more than a few hours .
But the president is happy because his legacy issue , the war on terrorism , is intact .
No matter that last week the Pentagon was forced to release a report conducted over the last five years that concluded , after surveying 600,000 official Iraqi documents captured by U.S. forces , that there is " no smoking gun " establishing any connection whatsoever between Saddam Hussein and al Qaeda .
The report was so embarrassing that we taxpayers were not going to be told of its existence , even though the explosive conclusions were declassified , until ABC News forced the administration to post it on the Joint Forces Command Web site .
The network reported that the Pentagon had canceled plans to issue a press release on the report or make it available by e-mail or online because , as one Pentagon official put , it the study is " too politically sensitive . "
Damn right it is - Bush squandered U.S. treasure and lives in an effort that had nothing to do with the infamous attack on America .
As for the real war on terrorism against the real al Qaeda , those folks are very much on the rebound - just where they were before the 9/11 attack , building their bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan .
Meanwhile , back on the home front , Wall Street is crumbling , not because of planes crashing into buildings but because the outrageous knaves of finance freed from the most minimal requirements of public accountability have been permitted to destroy America 's reputation in the world for financial probity .
In the name of ending what was claimed to be onerous banking regulations imposed after the Great Depression , this administration accelerated a bipartisan pattern of allowing Wall Street to betray investors with impunity while abandoning the federal government 's obligation , once accepted equally by conservatives and liberals , to ensure out national solvency .
This tendency , well under way for decades to give the bankers what they wanted - codified in the Financial Services Modernization
Act signed into law by President Bill Clinton permitting the banks , stock brokers and insurance companies to merge - was exacerbated by Bush 's appointment of rapacious corporate foxes to watch the corporate henhouse .
They will take care of their own , which is why Bush was smiling , happily posed in that photo op between Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve chief Ben Bernanke , as he announced the Bear Sterns bailout .
That action was made possible only by the federal government using your tax dollars to pick up the bad debt of the banks .
Tape that picture to your wall to remind you , when you open a credit - card bill with a 30 percent interest rate - not the 2 percent the fed will charge banks - or see the increase in your adjustable - rate mortgage , of just what your government will do for the really big guys that it will never do for regular folks .
In the years to come , as millions lose their retirement income and homes , we will have occasion to remember Georgie Porgie , who kissed the taxpayers and made them cry before he ran away .
Moving a grand piano safely A friend of ours , Jake , recently shifted a house to one of the outskirts suburbs of Brisbane from an apartment in the Melbourne CBD area as he was offered a great job by another music instrument company as a store manager .
He told me that moving a house itself was not that hard as he only had a relatively small amount of stuff .
The only thing he felt pretty difficult was to move his own grand piano that he has been playing ever since he was 12 years old .
Yes , he is actually a semi- professional piano player as well and he ’s been playing in local pubs and restaurants for many years .
Jake told us that his grand piano is probably the most important possession that he ever owned s it had to be taken care of very very carefully when shifting it to his new place .
Naturally , he had to hire one of the very best professional piano removalists for this big and sensitive job .
He said that he initially got on Google and typed in “ piano removalists in Melbourne ” and called a few that he found on the top page of the Google results page .
But for some reasons he could not get the right “ Vibe ” from any of them despite their very sort - after websites .
So instead , he went ahead and Googled “ best piano removalist Brisbane ” and contacted a few of those piano removal companies there .
Jake said it was quite weird that the very first one that he spoke with happened to be a guy who went the same high school that Jake went , on top of that he found out that this piano removalist is also a piano player himself , playing in the Brisbane area for over a decade .
Jake really liked this guy so in no tie he hired this piano removalist who said is happy to do the job from Melbourne to Brisbane .
Needless to say , they did a great job and Jake ’s grand piano was safely brought to his new place without a scratch .

Epoxy Coated Floors and Its Advantages Epoxy floors have the advantage of being very environment - friendly as compared to other coated floors as they require less water and consume fewer pesticides .
Epoxy is the term used for both , the monomer and polymer of epoxy resins .
Epoxy resins are a class of polymers containing a chemical functional group called the epoxide group .
The various ways in which the different types of polymers are manufactured leads to a wide variety of uses for epoxy .
For example , it is used in metal coatings , electronic appliances , adhesives , insulation , etc .
The epoxy coatings can be heavy duty , i.e. taking on extreme heat and temperature variations , as well as load , and are thus a favorite among floor coatings in garage floors , warehouse floors and manufacturing floors .
The epoxy coated floors usually comprises of three components : the epoxy resin , a hardener , and filler .
The resin is the main polymer that provides the base solvent for the coating .
It is light , odor - free and colorless .
The hardener helps in the final solidification of the coating , and is dark and has a strong smell .
The filler is a mixture of chemicals that even out the final composition of components and help create the chemical reaction required for the formation of the final coat .
Epoxy floors have the benefit of protecting the underlying concrete from mechanical or chemical deterioration and chemical corrosion .
Due to its high mechanical properties , it can take on heavy vehicles while reducing maintenance time .
As the coating is smooth and resistant to surface abrasions , it allows for easy movement and prevents tires of heavy vehicles from wear .
To top it all , it is seamless and has excellent slip resistant properties .
Although brimming with benefits , there are some major disadvantages while coating concrete floors with epoxy .
There always arises the issue of air bubbles being trapped within the layer of the coating resulting in surface deformities such as pinholes .
The air bubbles might become trapped due to non-uniform mixing or due to passing out from the cement .
Thus , it is always necessary to de-air the entire area before applying a coat of epoxy .
This naturally adds to the epoxy flooring cost per square metre for laying out epoxy , negating some of its benefits .
DIY Roof Repairs and Gutter Guard Repairs

Cosmetic Surgery and Rhinoplasty in Demand Cosmetic surgery has been becoming almost norm in our western society especially among ladies .
There is a lot of debates in terms of changing the way they look instead of appreciating what they have already got that has been given by their parents .
There are some good things of accepting the way you look as you were born with , and live with it no matter whether you happen to be easy on eyes or not .

At the end of the day , what you can see physically makes you respond to it emotionally .
Now there are many different types of plastic or cosmetic surgery procedures such as breast implants , liposuction , nip - tuck and so on , but one of the most popular and quite easy to be done is called rhinoplasty , also commonly known as a nose job surgery .

The bizarre - looking creature , dubbed Rhynochocyon udzungwensis , is a type of giant elephant shrew , or sengi .
The cat - sized animal , which is reported in the Journal of Zoology , looks like a cross between a miniature antelope and a small anteater .
It has a grey face , a long , flexible snout , a bulky , amber body , a jet - black rump and it stands on spindly legs .
" This is one of the most exciting discoveries of my career , " said Galen Rathbun , from the California Academy of Sciences , who helped to confirm the animal was new to science along with an international team of colleagues .
They are so bizarre - looking and a lot of their behavioural ecology is so unique and interesting , you kind of get wrapped up with them
Galen Rathbun
Despite its name , the creature , along with the 15 other known species of elephant shrew , is not actually related to shrews .
Dr Rathbun told the BBC News website : " Elephant shrews are only found in Africa .
They were originally described as shrews because they superficially resembled shrews in Europe and in America . "
In fact , the creature is more closely related to a group of African mammals , which includes elephants , sea cows , aardvarks and hyraxes , having shared a common ancestor with them about 100 million years ago .
" This is why they are also known as sengis , " explained Dr Rathbun .
The new species was first caught on film in 2005 in Ndundulu Forest in Tanzania 's Udzungwa Mountains by a camera trap set by Francesco Rovero , from the Trento Museum of Natural Sciences in Italy .
Dr Rathbun said : " I got these images , and said to myself : ' Boy , these look strange ' .
But you can't describe something new based just on photographs , so in March 2006 , we went back in and collected some specimens . "
Flashy creatures
He told the BBC that it quickly became apparent that the creatures were new to science .
He said : " Elephant shrews are almost all distinguished by distinctive colour patterns , and this is especially true of the forest - dwelling giant sengis .
The animal uses its long snout for scooping up insects
" They are all quite flashy - one species has a bright golden rump , another checkers along the rump - so when you have a colour pattern that just is n't similar to what is out there , you know it is fairly obvious that you have got something new .
" And this one , with its grey face and black rump , was pretty different . "
As well as its distinctive colouring , the new species is also larger than other species of giant elephant shrew , weighing 700g ( 25 oz ) and measuring about 30 cm ( 12 in ) in length .
It uses its long , flexible nose and tongue to flick up insects , such as termites , and it is most active in daylight .
Dr Rathbun added : " They are behaviourally fairly simple - they are not like a dog or cat you can interact with - but they are so bizarre - looking and a lot of their behavioural ecology is so unique and interesting , you kind of get wrapped up with them . "
The scientists say there is still much to learn about the Rhynochocyon udzungwensis , but they hope further research will help to answer questions about how many of the animals exist , their range and how closely the animals live together .
Tanzania 's Udzungwa Mountains are biodiverse - rich .
In addition to this new species , a number of other new animals have been found there , including the Udzungwa partridge , the Phillips ' Congo shrew , and a new genus of monkey known as Kipunji as well as several reptiles and amphibians .
Dr Rathbun said it was vital the area and its inhabitants in this biodiversity " hotspot " were protected .
Treasury Secretary refuses actions to strengthen dollar Nick Langewis and David Edwards
Published : Sunday March 16 , 2008

Print This Email This Fox News ' Chris Wallace assails Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson on this morning 's Fox News Sunday about the implications behind the federal bailout of troubled investment firm Bear Stearns .
" We 've got strong financial institutions , " insists Paulson .
" Our markets are the envy of the world .
They 're resilient , they 're ... innovative , they 're flexible .
I think we move very quickly to address situations in this country , and , as I said , our financial institutions are strong . "
On being asked if the government will step in to bail out any additional firms , Paulson refuses to " speculate " on what " might happen , " but insists : " Our focus , our priority ...
No. 1 priority , is the stability of our financial systems . "
" What we 're working to do , " he continues , " is to minimize the impact of what 's going on in housing , what 's going on in the capital markets , on the real economy . "
" But , " pushes Wallace , " is n't the result of this that U.S. taxpayers might end up holding billions of dollars in bad mortgage securities ? "
" I 'm not going to speculate about the outcome of this specific situation , " reiterates Paulson .
" You 're going to have to wait and see .
Conversations are going on -- over the weekend -- I 'm very involved in those conversations . "
" I 'm confident that this was the right thing to do , " he continues .
" Sometimes there are difficult decisions ; this , in my judgment , was not a difficult decision .
It was a right decision .
And , again , our markets are very important . "
" Why should the government , " asks Wallace , " and thereby , U.S. taxpayers , bail out lenders and borrowers who made bad decisions ; and , if they know they 're going to be bailed out , what does that do to the ' moral hazard ' argument that they do n't end up paying a price ? "
Paulson insists he understands the " moral hazard " argument , and tells Wallace he is jumping to conclusions when it comes to the taxpayer cost of the Bear Stearns bailout , and to " wait and see . "
Paulson further defends protecting the " capital markets , " and thereby , he says , the economy .
" Why not , " asks Wallace of the plunging U.S. dollar , " take a more aggressive stance and support a stronger and stable dollar , and even implement policies to -- prop up the dollar ? "
" A strong dollar is in our nation 's interest , " responds Paulson .
" Our long - term fundamentals in this country -- economic fundamentals - - are strong .
Our economy has its ups and downs like any other economy , but I believe that that long - term strength is going to be in the dollar . "
Paulson touts " pro-growth tax " and openness to free trade ( including a pending free trade agreement with Colombia ) .
He concludes : " Anything we can do to enhance confidence in our marketplace ; in our capital markets ; in our economy ; are -- the policies that increase confidence in our economy over time . "

Professor claims New Hampshire decision on ballot order sealed Clinton win RAW STORY
Published : Wednesday January 9 , 2008
del.icio.us |
Print This Email This A Stanford University professor of political science and psychology claims a decision New Hampshire made to change the ordering of their primary ballot may have pushed Sen. Hillary Clinton ( D - NY ) over the top .
Clinton 's New Hampshire victory left pundits scratching their heads , citing polls that showed Obama with a relatively consistent lead .
Writing Wednesday on ABC News , professor Jon Krosnick believes he has part of the answer .
Until this year , he says , the Granite State rotated candidate 's names on the ballots , citing a statistical analysis that showed those who were listed earlier generally did better .
" Without a doubt , a big source of the discrepancy between the pre-election surveys and the election outcome in New Hampshire is the order of candidates ' names on the ballot and in the surveys , " Krosnick wrote .
" Our analysis of all recent primaries in New Hampshire showed that there was always a big primacy effect -- big name , big - vote - getting candidates got 3 percent or more votes more when listed first on the ballot than when listed last . "
" Until this year , New Hampshire rotated candidate name order from precinct to precinct , which allowed us to do that analysis , " he added .
" This year , the secretary of state changed the procedure so the names were alphabetical starting with a randomly selected letter , in all precincts . "
The randomly selected letter for 2008 was Z. Thus , Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) was listed first , with Clinton near the top -- " the first serious contender listed " -- and Sen. Barack Obama ( D - NH ) close to last of the 21 candidates .
" I 'll bet that Clinton got at least 3 percent more votes than Obama simply because she was listed close to the top , " he writes .
" More importantly , if New Hampshire had rotated name order in the voting booth as it has always done in the past , the race would probably have been too close to call without a recount and might even have been an Obama victory . "
Still , the professor 's analysis does n't account for the fact that pre-election polls showed Obama with as much as a nine - point lead prior to the vote .
After struggling for months to dent Senator Barack Obama ’s candidacy , the campaign of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is now unleashing what one Clinton aide called a “ kitchen sink ” fusillade against Mr. Obama , pursuing five lines of attack since Saturday in hopes of stopping his political momentum .
The effort underscores not only Mrs. Clinton ’s recognition that the next round of primaries  in Ohio and Texas on March 4  are must - win contests for her .
It also reflects her advisers ’ belief that they can persuade many undecided voters to embrace her at the last minute by finally drawing sharply worded , attention - grabbing contrasts with Mr. Obama .
After denouncing Mr. Obama over the weekend for an anti-Clinton flier about the Nafta trade treaty , and then sarcastically portraying his message of hope Sunday as naïve , Mrs. Clinton delivered a blistering speech on Monday that compared Mr. Obama ’s lack of foreign policy experience to that of the candidate George W. Bush .
“ We ’ve seen the tragic result of having a president who had neither the experience nor the wisdom to manage our foreign policy and safeguard our national security , ” Mrs. Clinton said in a speech on foreign policy at George Washington University .
“ We ca n’t let that happen again . ”
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Bush administration on Friday formally rejected California ’s bid for a waiver from U.S. law to set its own tailpipe emissions standard to reduce global warming .

The Environmental Protection Agency released a regulatory notice signed by Administrator Stephen Johnson , canceling California ’s plans to impose a state law that would have forced automakers to reduce emissions by making cars that achieve sharply higher gas mileage beginning next year .
The decision also affects 18 other states that wanted to adopt the measure .
The announcement was expected .
Johnson had announced in December he would deny the waiver because the state ’s pollution problems , in his view , did not merit special consideration .
“ While I find that the conditions related to global climate change in California are substantial , they are not sufficiently different from conditions in the nation as a whole to justify separate state standards , ” Johnson wrote .
He ruled against California even though internal documents released by Congress in January revealed that EPA staff concluded the agency would probably lose if the state went to court .
California sued in January .
Environmental groups said the formal denial , which outlined the agency ’s legal argument , was inexplicable .
“ Johnson ’s excuse that global warming is not unique to California is both factually and legally wrong , ” said David Doniger , policy director for the National Resources Defense Council .
Doniger said no other state can claim the same “ severe impacts ” from smog , wildfires , water supply problems , and agricultural losses .
“ The combination and severity of these impacts makes California ’s conditions compelling and extraordinary , ” he said .
REDUCE GREENHOUSE GASES
Environmental groups estimate the California standard , if applied nationally , would reduce greenhouse gases from new vehicles by 40 percent by 2020 .
A new U.S. energy law , cited by Johnson in December as adequate to address national pollution concerns , would cut emissions by 31 percent over the same period , environmentalists said .
Both measures would cut pollution by sharply increasing auto mileage targets .
Struggling U.S. auto manufacturers and overseas car companies have fought the California proposal , saying it would hurt their business , especially if adopted by other states .
Automakers said trying to meet both federal efficiency standards and another , stricter standard adopted by states would add huge production costs and increases prices .
The federal Clean Air Act allows California to enact pollution laws that are stricter than U.S. government standards in certain circumstances but only if the state receives EPA clearance first .
California has been granted waivers in the past , but Johnson said those were to address factors associated with local or regional pollution problems .
California Democratic Sen. Barbara
Boxer said the EPA decision would not stand up in court but would result in “ more delay in cleaning up our air and tackling the challenge of global warming . ”
Emacs and alists
[ This article is a few weeks old now .
I wrote it and forgot to publish it at the time . ]
Yesterday I upgraded Emacs , and since it was an upgrade , something that had been working for me for fifteen years stopped working , because that 's what " upgrade " means .
My .emacs file contains : ( aput ' auto - mode - alist " \\.pl\\ ' " ( function cperl - mode ) ) ( aput ' auto - mode - alist " \\.t\\ ' " ( function cperl - mode ) ) ( aput ' auto - mode - alist " \\.cgi\\ ' " ( function cperl - mode ) ) ( aput ' auto - mode - alist " \\.pm\\ ' " ( function cperl - mode ) ) ( aput ' auto - mode - alist " \\.blog\\ ' " ( function text - mode ) ) ( aput ' auto - mode - alist " \\.sml\\ ' " ( function sml - mode ) )
I should explain this , since I imagine that most readers of this blog are like me in that they touch Emacs Lisp only once a year on Saint Vibrissa 's Day .
An alist ( " association list " ) is a common data structure in Lisp programs .
It is a list of pairs ; the first element of each pair is a key , and the second element is an associated value .
The pairs in the special auto - mode - alist variable have regexes as their keys and functions as their values .
Whenever Emacs opens a new file , it scans this alist , until it finds a regex that matches the name of the file .
It then executes the associated function .
Thus the effect of the first line above is to have Emacs enable the cperl - mode function on any file whose name ends in " .pl " .
The aput function is for maintaining alists .
It takes an alist , a key , and a value , scans the alist looking for a matching key , and then if it finds it , it amends the corresponding value .
Otherwise , it appends a new association onto the front of the alist .
When I upgraded emacs , this broke .
The aput function was moved into a separate package , which I now had to load with ( require ' assoc ) .
I asked about this on IRC , and was told that the correct way to do this , if I did not want to ( require ' assoc ) , was to use the following abomination : ( mapc ( lambda ( x ) ( when ( eq ' perl - mode ( cdr x ) ) ( setcdr x ' cperl - mode ) ) ) ( append auto - mode - alist interpreter - mode - alist ) )
The effect of this is to scan over auto - mode - alist ( and also interpreter - mode - alist , a related variable ) looking for any association whose value was the perl - mode function , and using setcdr to replace perl - mode with cperl - mode .
( This does not address the issue of what to do with .t files or . blog files , for which no association exists yet , presumably , but I did not ask about those specifically on IRC . )
I was totally boggled .
Choosing the right editing mode for a file is a basic function of emacs .
I could not believe that the best and simplest way to add or change associations was to use mapc lambda gobhorn oleo potatopudding quote potrzebie .
I was assured that this was indeed the only correct method .
Struck almost speechless , I managed to come up with " Bullshit . "
Apparently the issue was that if auto - mode - alist already contains an association for " .pl " , there is no guarantee that my new association will be found and preferred to the old one , unless I somehow remove the old one , or edit it to be the way I want .
This seemed very unlikely to me .
You see , an alist is a list .
This means that it is searched from head to tail , because this is the only way a list can be searched .
So in particular , if you cons a second association to the front of the list , which has the same key as a later ( older ) association , the search will find the new one first , and the older one becomes inoperative .
I asked if there was not a guarantee that the alist would be searched from front to back .
I was told that there is not .
I looked in the manual , and reported that the assoc function , which is the getter that corresponds to aput , taking an alist and a key , and returning the corresponding value , is expressly guaranteed to return the first matching item .
I was told that there was no guarantee that assoc would be used .
I pondered the manual some more and found this passage : However , association lists have their own advantages .
Depending on your application , it may be faster to add an association to the front of an association list than to update a property .
That is , it is expressly endorsing the technique of adding a new item to the front of an alist in order to override any later item that might have the same key .
After finding that the add - to - the - front technique really did work , I reasoned that if someday Emacs stopped searching alists sequentially , I would not be in any more trouble than I had been today when they removed the aput function .
So I did not take the advice I was given .
Instead , I left it pretty much the way it was .
I did take the opportunity to clean up the code a bit : ( push ' ( " \\.pl\\ ' " . cperl - mode ) auto - mode - alist ) ( push '( " \\.t\\ ' " . cperl - mode ) auto - mode - alist ) ( push '( " \\.cgi\\ ' " . cperl - mode ) auto - mode - alist ) ( push '( " \\.pm\\ ' " . cperl - mode ) auto - mode - alist ) ( push '( " \\.blog\\ ' " . text - mode ) auto - mode - alist ) ( push '( " \\.sml\\ ' " . sml-mode ) auto - mode - alist )
The push function simply appends an element to the front of a list , modifying the list in - place .
But wow , the advice I got was phenomenally bad .
It was bad in a really interesting way , too .
It reminded me of the advice people get on the #math channel , where some guy comes in with some question about triangles and gets the category - theoretic viewpoint on triangles as natural transformations of something or other .
The advice was bad because although it was correct , it was completely devoid of common sense .
[ Addendum 20080124 :
It has been brought to my attention that the Emacs FAQ endorses my solution , which makes the category - theoretic advice proposed by the #emacs blockheads even less defensible . ] [ Addendum 20080201 : Steve Vinoski suggests replacing the aput function . ]

Spanish scientists have come up with a new hypothesis on to explain the rate of expansion of the universe : time is - literally - slowing down !
A decade ago , astronomers noticed that distant supernovae - exploding stars on the very fringes of the universe - seemed to be moving faster than those nearer to the centre , suggesting that they were accelerating as they shot through space .
Dark energy was suggested as a possible means of powering this acceleration of the expansion of the cosmos .
The problem is that no - one has any idea what dark energy is or where it comes from , and theoreticians around the world have been scrambling to find out what it is , or get rid of it .
The team 's proposal , which will be published in the journal Physical Review D , does away altogether with dark energy .
Instead , Prof Senovilla says , the appearance of acceleration is caused by time itself gradually slowing down , like a clock that needs winding .
" We do not say that the expansion of the universe itself is an illusion , " he explains .
" What we say it may be an illusion is the acceleration of this expansion - that is , the possibility that the expansion is , and has been , increasing its rate . "
Instead , if time gradually slows " but we naively kept using our equations to derive the changes of the expansion with respect of ' a standard flow of time ' , then the simple models that we have constructed in our paper show that an " effective accelerated rate of the expansion " takes place . "
How did we manage to mire ourselves in the midst of Mesopotamia , enmeshed in a three - sided ( at least ) civil war , with vanishing hopes of extrication  and the putative Republican presidential nominee hailing a hundred - year occupation ?
The key to this mystery may be traced back to an earlier act of " liberation " effected through the vehicle of the Kosovo Liberation Army .
Sunday ’s official declaration of independence by Kosovo  which will no doubt be immediately recognized by the United States and the EU nations , along with the Islamic bloc  underscores the folly of our interventionist foreign policy .
This policy was forged and made possible by an alliance  a popular front , as the lefties used to call it  of neoconservatives and liberal " hawks , " and its first project was gathering support from the Right and the Left for the Kosovo Liberation Army .
Chalabi and the " liberation " of Iraq came later , but it was the same sort of game , with the same players , using roughly the same moralistic lingo .
Only the locale was changed : the neocon - liberal alliance remained constant , and grew stronger .
By Sept. 11 , 2001 , this popular front was ready , willing , and able to propel us headlong into the Middle East .
I remember quite distinctly when I confronted Rep. Nancy Pelosi in 1996  I was her Republican opponent that election year  over the question of going to war against Serbia .
Since she refused to debate the issue , or any other , I had to track her down at one of her orchestrated " public " meetings .
There I asked her : why is this war worth a single life , either American or Serbian ?
Her answer consisted of a single word : " Genocide ! "
This , indeed , was the rationalization the Clinton Democrats used , to great effect , in order to make their war palatable .
The cry was taken up by the neoconservatives , who added their own special fillip to the war propaganda that filled the airwaves and the opinion pages of the nation .
This would be , said the neocons , a much - needed demonstration of American power in the post - Cold War world , an occasion , as Bill Kristol memorably put it , to " crush Serb skulls . "
As it turned out , there was no " genocide "  the International Tribunal itself reported that just over 2,000 bodies were recovered from postwar Kosovo , including Serbs , Roma , and Kosovars , all victims of the vicious civil war in which we intervened on the side of the latter .
The whole fantastic story of another " holocaust " in the middle of Europe was a fraud .
This is clear when we examine the progression of claims made by the Clinton administration and its amen corner in the mainstream media .
Initially , we were told that as many as 100,000 Albanian Kosovars had been victims of this " genocide , " but that heady moment soon gave way to more conservative estimates  50,000 , 25,000 , 10,000  and at that point the War Party stopped talking numbers altogether and just celebrated the glorious victory of " humanitarian intervention . "
This parallels the propaganda campaign that led up to the invasion of Iraq , with some slight variations .
The principal casus belli against Saddam Hussein was his supposed possession of weapons of mass destruction , but this charge was mixed in with the moral case that we could n’t abandon the Iraqis to someone who had used poison gas " against his own people , " as Bush and his Democratic enablers repeated endlessly .
This mobilized the liberal " hawks " while The Weekly Standard ‘s series of essays by Stephen Hayes , bolstered by the obsessive book - length missives of Laurie Mylroie , rationalized a diversion away from al - Qaeda and directed American power against Iraq .
Hillary Clinton often points to Kosovo as an example of interventionism done the right way .
Yet if we look at the actual results , in practice , of nation - building , Clinton - style , it has been no more successful than the Republican version , albeit far less bloody and on a smaller scale .
The ethnic cleansing that followed the military victory of NATO forces left the Serbian inhabitants of Kosovo living in a state of siege and sent them fleeing by the thousands .
In the meantime , the rise of a virulently nationalistic regime in Pristina created an ethnically pure and fiercely militaristic state , which embodies the " principle " of gangsterism both in substance and style .
Here again , the parallels with Iraq  where a Shi’ite majority has largely succeeded in driving the Sunnis out of Baghdad and into the hinterlands and surrounding countries  are all too tragically obvious .
Another , more ominous parallel is that both the Kosovar and Shi’ite states birthed by U.S. military action are regional destabilizers due to the expansionist ideology that energizes their partisans .
The independent " republic " of Kosovo , added on to Albania and sections of bordering countries , such as Macedonia , is a component of what Kosovar militants refer to as " Greater Albania , " a vision of mini-empire that they intend to realize by force .
The same is true of the Iraqi Shi’ite state , which is now said to be a part of what Washington ’s grand strategists point to with alarm as the " Shia Crescent "  an evolving " threat " that would never have come into being in the first place if we had simply stayed out .
Furthermore , the creation of these states has had regional and even global consequences , none of which are benign .
In the case of the Kosovars , the U.S. appears to have endorsed the concept , if not the full - scale implementation , of " Greater Albania . "
It remains to be seen whether the U.S. will endorse or otherwise encourage Kosovo ’s designs on its neighbors .
When it comes to the " Shia Crescent , " however , we are told that this is a danger that must be fought , as the creation of a Shi’ite super - state consisting of Iraq and Iran is considered inimical to U.S. interests .
From the Balkans to the site of ancient Babylon , our interventionist policies have set us up for confrontations with groups and nations that seek to stem U.S. hegemony , principally Russia and Iran .
We are , it seems , presently engaged in a two - front " civilizational " conflict : with the Slavic world , in central and eastern Europe , as well as in the rest of Russia ’s " near abroad " ; and with Sunni insurgents and Shi’ite Iranians , i.e. , a good deal of the Islamic world .
How did we get to this point ?
The grand convergence of Left and Right interventionists during the Clinton years led directly to what Gen. William E. Odom has described as the biggest strategic disaster in American military history .
As Jacob Heilbrunn puts it in They Knew They Were Right : The Rise of the Neocons :
" As [ Lawrence F. ] Kaplan and Kristol depicted it in their [ 2003 ] book [ The War Over Iraq ] , the main issue that should unite the liberal and conservative hawks was the belief that American power , which had liberated the Balkans from Serbian aggression , should be redeployed against Iraq .
Once again , morality was the key as well as the putative link between Osama and Saddam . "
" Such bellicose rhetoric , " Heilbrunn points out , " was adopted by numerous liberal hawks , including Paul Berman . "
Such militancy was n’t confined to a few left - liberal intellectuals who suddenly imagined themselves as their generation ’s version of George Orwell .
It also infected the mindset of more than one liberal politician , e.g. , Hillary Clinton , whose pro-war rhetoric at the time of the invasion , as well as her vote to authorize the strike , reflected the new bellicosity on the Left .
It was Hillary , you ’ll recall , whose pressure on her husband to do something about the alleged " genocide " was the decisive factor in launching the bombing campaign against Serbia .
The neoconservatives often get the whole of the blame for the unfolding disaster in Iraq , but the reality is that they could n’t have pulled it off all by themselves : they needed , sought , and got the support of the liberals .
Have liberals learned their lesson ?
Not if calls for intervention in Darfur or Kenya can be taken seriously .
Iran and Pakistan loom large as potential sites of future U.S. military action , but I doubt whether we can count on opposition from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party , either in Congress or as represented among the pundits .
The neocon - liberal popular front lives on and is bound to be an endless source of schemes for yet more overseas wars in which we have no national interest .
NOTES IN THE MARGIN
Rather than hector you about the need to donate to our current fundraising drive  which is , much to my dismay , moving into its second week 
I am simply going to point out that it did n’t used to take two weeks to make our goal .
As recently as two fundraisers ago , we made it inside of a single week .
Whether this is due to the steadily worsening economy or other factors such as election season , I wo n’t venture to guess : I ’ll just say that we ’ve been soldiering on to the best of our ability , in the face of a threatening shortfall in our income that could force us into major cutbacks  and even call the continued viability of Antiwar.com into serious question .
Please do n’t let this happen .
We ’ve been carrying the banner of peace and a noninterventionist foreign policy since 1996  and now , of all times , is not the moment to falter .
We simply must make our fundraising goal , which is why you need to make your contribution today .
You can tell a lot about the concerns of society regarding science by the kinds of topics that bring people to sites like ours .
Not a day goes by that people do n't arrive using Google searches looking for answers about organic food .
The top query is something like ' what is organic food ? ' and it seems odd that after hundreds of millions of dollars in advertising and $ 20 billion in sales , no one is sure what organic food is .
There are two sides to the organic food issue to most people ; genetics and chemicals .
I do n't worry too much about organic food from a genetics standpoint , for example , but I am not a fan of most chemicals .
I am not even a fan of other people touching my food .
If I had my way , I would grow , kill , clean and cook everything my family eats but that is n't always practical .
I can't grow my own coffee beans , for example , so there has to be some some level of trust that other people are n't using poisons in our food but generally I have no problem with pesticides .
What is organic food ?
The genetic - organic issue occupies a different segment .
There are people rightfully concerned that genetic modification of fruits or vegetables can lead to unknown consequences .
I understand that concern - messing with genes or weather or economies when you are n't absolutely certain what will happen can lead to disaster - only activists insist some action is better than no action regardless of consequence .
In looking at the history of agriculture , almost everything is ' genetically modified ' , they just use a different name for it .
Tomatoes would be the size of our thumbs without genetic modification .
A genetically modified , or even cloned , cow that digests grain and produces milk is not in any way producing ' genetically modified ' milk that can harm anyone .
Anyone believing otherwise believes that there are different elements that compose the ' natural ' world and the world of science and that just is n't the case .
It 's all living matter , built of the same carbon , oxygen , and hydrogen atoms .
Professor Lee Silver is a columnist here and author of Challenging Nature :
The clash of biotechnology and spirituality ( 2006 ) and he put it much more succinctly than I can :
... organic food is defined not by any material substance in the food itself , but instead by the " holistic " methods used on organic farms .
Furthermore , the physical attributes of the product and any effects it might have on environment or health are explicitly excluded from U.S. , European , and international definitions .
The implicit , unproven assumption is that organic agriculture is -- by its very nature -- better for the environment than so - called conventional farming .
Well , if you are convinced that organic food is better for the environment and for your health it introduces a third organic issue ; honesty .
If you choose to believe that genetically modified corn that has been engineered to kill pests naturally will harm the ecosystem of rivers or that instead genetic modification can make crops grow in places it otherwise would n't and therefore feed more people capitalism has a solution for you .
And you should know what food meets your standards and get what you pay for ; that takes us outside the science realm and into policy but even then science can try to help .
In a recent study ( 1 ) , scientists used nitrogen isotopic discrimination to determine if synthetic fertilizers were used on sweet pepper plants .
Yet the study ran into some problems ; soils in various climates with varying biotic and abiotic factors could exceed an arbitrary designation of ' organic fertilization ' even if no fertilizer at all was used .
The US government does n't make it any easier .
Last summer , the definition of ' organic food ' was extended to include 38 more inorganic ingredients .
I am not knocking the USDA for allowing celery powder and frozen lemongrass but it makes the point that a lot of people talking about ' organic ' food do n't know what it means .
It 's made even more difficult when the definition is in flux .
I 'll boil it down .
All food is organic and no one has gotten e. Coli from a genetically modified food , unlike ' organic ' spinach ( 2 ) .
I am not too concerned about genetically modified corn or purple roses .
If we want to have less global warming we clearly need to genetically engineer cows that fart less .
It will make no difference at all in the milk they produce .
None .
Nature does not work that way .
Is my food ' organic ' ?
We 've already established that all food is organic but there is a science definition and a colloquial one and the colloquial one means ' free of pesticides . '
So if you buy some organic food and it says the pesticide was Pyrethrin or Rotenone , should you watch out ?
They 're certainly toxic chemicals .
Except organic farmers use them all of the time , because Pyrethrin is made from chrysanthemums and rotenone comes from a native Indian vine .
You may still get Parkinson 's Disease but you will have gotten it ' organically . '
Go with Strycnine instead .
It is organic too and it will kill you faster .
If you truly want organic food you had better know the farmer .
And you 're going to pay a lot if no pesticides of any kind , natural or synthetic , were in use .
So be prepared to accept the following ( 3 ) if you are paying extra for organic food and you did n't personally watch the farmer weed the rows .
First , and most important , the ' organic ' label has nothing at all to do with the food itself .
The national organic standards address the methods , practices , and substances used in producing and handling crops , livestock , and processed agricultural products .
The requirements apply to the way the product is created , not to measurable properties of the product itself .
Crops
Preference will be given to the use of organic seeds and other planting stock , but a farmer may use non-organic seeds and planting stock under specified conditions .
Crop pests , weeds , and diseases will be controlled primarily through management practices including physical , mechanical , and biological controls .
When these practices are not sufficient , a biological , botanical , or synthetic substance approved for use on the National List may be used .
So your organic food can have synthetic fertilizers as long as it's on the list .
And the seeds do n't have to be organic if the farmer does n't have any .
Livestock
Vaccines to prevent illness in animals are organic yet antibiotics to cure illness are not .
Vitamin and mineral supplements are allowed .
Processing
It 's that pesky ' organic if it's available ' qualification again .
Labelling
Products labeled as " 100 percent organic " must contain ( excluding water and salt ) only organically produced ingredients .
However , below is the list of non-organic ingredients that actually qualify as organic .
Please keep in mind that the ' organic ' label really means ' 95 % organic ' - the list of non-organic things you could be ingesting is quite extensive .
And the list of completely natural ways you can come to harm , namely getting e. Coli from all - natural manure , means you should examine your food with more than just your reactionary cap on .
Common sense and some knowledge of how the science and the politics are reconciled on policy making will allow you to maintain a critical perspective on what ' organic ' really means to you and your family .

newswire article reposts global 9.11 investigation ISRAELIS were 9 - 11 short sale stock buyers , betting on WTC terror strikes , story killed ... author : Mossad watch FYI .
Makes sense to me .
Particularly when the Mossad cells were watching the " Al - CIAda " cells the whole time from Virginia to the 9 - 11 day - of when they were filming the towers being hit and collapsing , celebrating all the while .
Of course Rabbi Chertoff of the Homeland Security Department now ( then , the second in command under Ashcroft at the DOJ ) let the Mossad budding filmmakers out of the country , without explanation , without much media coverage .
trenchant quote : " Between August 26 and September 11 , 2001 , a group of speculators , identified by the American Securities and Exchange Commission as Israeli citizens , sold " short " a list of 38 stocks that could reasonably be expected to fall in value as a result of the pending attacks .
These speculators operated out of the Toronto , Canada and Frankfurt , Germany , stock exchanges and their profits were specifically stated to be " in the millions of dollars . " "
Mossad emblem attempting to co-opt Jewish heritage : " by way of deception " SEC SECRET PROBE OF STOCK DEALINGS BEFORE 9/11
Between August 26 and September 11 , 2001 , a group of speculators , identified by the American Securities and Exchange Commission as Israeli citizens , sold " short " a list of 38 stocks that could reasonably be expected to fall in value as a result of the pending attacks .
These speculators operated out of the Toronto , Canada and Frankfurt , Germany , stock exchanges and their profits were specifically stated to be " in the millions of dollars . "
Short selling of stocks involves the opportunity to gain large profits by passing shares to a friendly third party , then buying them back when the price falls .
Historically , if this precedes a traumatic event , it is an indication of foreknowledge .
It is widely known that the CIA uses the Promis software to routinely monitor stock trades as a possible warning sign of a terrorist attack or suspicious economic behavior .
A week after the Sept.11 attacks , the London Times reported that the CIA had asked regulators for the Financial Services Authority in London to investigate the suspicious sales of millions of shares of stock just prior to the terrorist acts .
It was hoped the business paper trail might lead to the terrorists .
Investigators from numerous government agencies are part of a clandestine but official effort to resolve the market manipulations
There has been a great deal of talk about insider trading of American stocks by certain Israeli groups both in Canada and Germany between August 26 and the Sept.11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
Lynne Howard , a spokeswoman for the Chicago Board Options Exchange ( CBOE ) , stated that information about who made the trades was available immediately .
" We would have been aware of any unusual activity right away .
It would have been triggered by any unusual volume .
There is an automated system called ' blue sheeting , ' or the CBOE Market Surveillance System , that everyone in the business knows about .
It provides information on the trades - the name and even the Social Security number on an account - and these surveillance systems are set up specifically to look into insider trading .
The system would look at the volume , and then a real person would take over and review it , going back in time and looking at other unusual activity . "
Howard continued , " The system is so smart that even if there is a news event that triggers a market event it can go back in time , and even the parameters can be changed depending on what is being looked at .
It 's a very clever system and it is instantaneous .
Even with the system , though , we have very experienced and savvy staff in our market - regulations area who are always looking for things that might be unusual .
They 're trained to put the pieces of the puzzle together .
Even if it 's offshore , it might take a little longer , but all offshore accounts have to go through U.S. member firms - members of the CBOE - and it is easily and quickly identifiable who made the trades .
The member firm who made the trades has to have identifiable information about the client under the ' Know Your Customer ' regulations ( and we share all information with the Securities and Exchange Commission . ) "
Given all of this , at a minimum the CBOE and government regulators who are conducting the secret investigations have known for some time who made the options puts on a total of 38 stocks that might reasonably be anticipated to have a sharp drop in value because of an attack similar to the 9/11 episode .
The silence from the investigating camps could mean several things :
Either terrorists are responsible for the puts on the listed stocks or others besides terrorists had foreknowledge of the attack and used this knowledge to reap a nice financial harvest from the tragedy .
Adam Hamilton of Zeal LLC , a North Dakota - based private consulting company that publishes research on markets worldwide , stated that " I heard that $ 22 million in profits was made on these put options ... "
Federal investigators are continuing to be so closed - mouthed about these stock trades , and it is clear that a much wider net has been cast , apparently looking for bigger international fish involved in dubious financial activity relating to the 9/11 attacks on the world stock markets .
Just a month after the attacks the SEC sent out a list of stocks to various securities firms around the world looking for information .
The list includes stocks of American , United , Continental , Northwest , Southwest and US Airways airlines , as well as Martin , Boeing , Lockheed Martin Corp. , AIG , American Express Corp , American International Group , AMR Corporation , Axa SA , Bank of America Corp , Bank of New York Corp , Bank One Corp , Cigna Group , CNA Financial , Carnival Corp , Chubb Group , John Hancock Financial Services , Hercules Inc , L - 3 Communications Holdings , Inc. , LTV Corporation , Marsh & McLennan Cos. Inc. , MetLife , Progressive Corp. , General Motors , Raytheon , W.R. Grace , Royal Caribbean Cruises , Ltd. , Lone Star Technologies , American Express , the Citigroup Inc. , Royal & Sun Alliance , Lehman Brothers Holdings , Inc. , Vornado Reality Trust , Morgan Stanley , Dean Witter & Co. , XL Capital Ltd. , and Bear Stearns .
The Times said market regulators in Germany , Japan and the US all had received information concerning the short selling of insurance , airlines and arms companies stock , all of which fell sharply in the wake of the attacks .
City of London broker and analyst Richard Crossley noted that someone sold shares in unusually large quantities beginning three weeks before the assault on the WTC and Pentagon .
He said he took this as evidence that someone had insider foreknowledge of the attacks .
" What is more awful than he should aim a stiletto blow at the heart of Western financial markets ? " he added .
" But to profit from it ?
Words fail me . "
The US Government also admitted it was investigating short selling , which evinced a compellingly strong foreknowledge of the coming Arab attack .
There was unusually heavy trading in airline and insurance stocks several days before Sept.11 , which essentially bet on a drop in the worth of the stocks .
It was reported by the Interdisciplinary Center , a counter - terrorism think tank involving former Israeli intelligence officers , that insiders made nearly $ 16 million profit by short selling shares in American and United Airlines , the two airlines that suffered hijacking , and the investment firm of Morgan Stanley , which occupied 22 floors of the WTC .
Apparently none of the suspicious transactions could be traced to bin Laden because this news item quietly dropped from sight , leaving many people wondering if it tracked back to American firms or intelligence agencies .
Most of these transactions were handled primarily by Deutsche Bank - A.B. Brown , a firm which until 1998 was chaired by A. B. " Buzzy " Krongard , who later became executive director of the CIA .
More serious was an article in the Sept. 28 , 2001 edition of the Washington Post stating that officials with the instant messaging firm of Odigo in New York confirmed that two employees in Israel received text messages warning of an attack on the WTC two hours before the planes crashed into the buildings !
The firm 's vice president of sales and marketing , Alex Diamandis said it was possible that the warning was sent to other Odigo members , but they had not received any reports of such .
The day after , the Jerusalem Post claimed two Israelis died on the hijacked airplanes and that 4,000 were missing at the WTC .
A week later , a Beirut television station reported that 4,000 Israeli employees of the WTC were absent the day of the attack .
This information spread across the Internet but was quickly branded a hoax .
On Sept. 19 , the Washington Post reported about 113 Israelis were missing at the WTC and the next day , President Bush noted more than 130 Israelis were victims .
Finally , on Sept. 22 , the New York Times stated " There were , in fact , only three Israelis who had been confirmed as dead : two on the planes and another who had been visiting the towers on business and who was identified and buried . "
Investigators from numerous government agencies are part of a clandestine but official effort to resolve the market manipulations
There has been a great deal of talk about the insider trading of American stocks by certain Israeli groups both in Canada and Germany between August 26 and the Sept.11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon .
Government investigators have maintained a diplomatic silence about a Department of Justice ( DOJ ) probe of possible profiteering by interested parties with advance knowledge of the attack .
On Sept. 6 , 2001 , the Thursday before the tragedy , 2,075 put options were made on United Airlines and on Sept. 10 , the day before the attacks , 2,282 put options were recorded for American Airlines .
Given the prices at the time , this could have yielded speculators between $ 2 million and $ 4 million in profit .
The matter still is under investigation and none of the government investigating bodies - including the FBI , the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) and DOJ - are speaking to reporters about insider trading .
Even so , suspicion of insider trading to profit from the Sept. 11 attacks is not limited to U.S. regulators .
Investigations were initiated in a number of places including Japan , Germany , the United Kingdom , France , Luxembourg , Hong Kong , Switzerland and Spain .
As in the United States , all are treating these inquiries as if they were state secrets .

The 2.6.24 kernel is out
At long last , Linus has released the 2.6.24 kernel .
Highlights of this release include control groups ( formerly process containers ) , the i386/x86_64 architecture merger group scheduling in the CFS scheduler , network and PID namespaces kernel markers , the removal of the modular security interface , and much more .
See LWN 's list of merged patches for more detail , or the always - amazing KernelNewbies Linux Changes page for much more detail .
Linus also notes that he 's about to head south for linux .
conf.au , but that he plans to open the 2.6.25 merge window as usual .
The next development cycle will probably start a bit more slowly than it normally would , though .
When he became the church 's 15th president in March 1995 at 84 years old , Hinckley essentially had been leading the church for more than a decade because of the frail health of his predecessors .
He was determined to defy the view of LDS presidents as feeble , secretive and quaintly parochial .
He dazzled people - members and outsiders alike - with his encyclopedic memory and almost superhuman work ethic .
During his nearly 13 years as president , Hinckley gave more than 2,000 speeches , visited more than 150 countries , and greeted hundreds of diplomats and ambassadors .
He was interviewed by journalists from nearly every major American newspaper , charming many with his folksy wisdom and self - deprecating humor .
Here 's a little example of what I call Flat Earth News .
In June 2005 , Fleet Street told its readers about a gang of feral child bullies who had attempted to murder a five - year - old boy by hanging him from a tree ; the boy had managed to free himself .
This story was not true .
Indeed , it was obviously not true from the moment it started running .
There was the commonsense problem that even a fully grown man with 10 years of SAS training who found himself hanging by the neck would have the greatest difficulty in reaching up and lifting his entire body weight with one hand while using the other to remove the noose .
How would a five - year - old boy do it ?
More than that , there was the evidence in the story itself .
From the first day , the police refused to say the boy had been hanged .
The parents and neighbours , who told the press how shocked they were , never claimed to know what had happened .
The one and only line on which the whole story was built was a quote from the boy 's adult cousin , who said he had told her : " Some boys and girls have tied a rope around my neck and tried to tie me to a tree . "
That 's " tie me to a tree " , not " hang me from a tree " .
It was a nasty case of bullying but not an attempted murder .
A 12 - year - old girl had put a rope around the boy 's neck and led him round like a dog , pulling on it hard enough to leave marks on his neck .
That was clearly dangerous .
But the boy never claimed she had hanged him from a tree .
Indeed , he never even claimed that she had tied him to a tree , only that she had tried to .
To double check , we spoke to Professor Christopher Milroy , the Home Office pathologist who handled the case .
He said : " He had not been hanged .
That was not correct and I could n't understand why the press were insisting that he was . "
Nevertheless , the tabloids ran all over it ; and TV and the rest of Fleet Street joined in .
The London Evening Standard called it a lynching ; the Mail , Guardian and Times ran headlines which stated boldly that the boy had been hanged ; the Independent ran a moody feature about fear descending on the boy 's estate .
Sundry columnists joined in with solemn comment about the youth of today and the impact of violence on television .
The ingredients in this little story run routinely through a stream of other small stories , through stories as big as those about the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction , and then into a flood of media commentary that feeds into government policy and popular understanding - falsehood as profound as the idea that the Earth is flat , widely accepted as true to the point where it can feel like heresy to challenge it .
There never was a time when news media were perfect .
Journalists have always worked with too little time and too little certainty ; with interference from owners and governments ; with laws that intimidate and inhibit the search for truth .
But the evidence I found in researching my new book , Flat Earth News , suggests our tendency to recycle ignorance is far worse than it was .
I commissioned research from specialists at Cardiff University , who surveyed more than 2,000 UK news stories from the four quality dailies ( Times , Telegraph , Guardian , Independent ) and the Daily Mail .
They found two striking things .
First , when they tried to trace the origins of their " facts " , they discovered that only 12 % of the stories were wholly composed of material researched by reporters .
With 8 % of the stories , they just could n't be sure .
The remaining 80 % , they found , were wholly , mainly or partially constructed from second - hand material , provided by news agencies and by the public relations industry .
Second , when they looked for evidence that these " facts " had been thoroughly checked , they found this was happening in only 12 % of the stories .
The implication of those two findings is truly alarming .
Where once journalists were active gatherers of news , now they have generally become mere passive processors of unchecked , second - hand material , much of it contrived by PR to serve some political or commercial interest .
Not journalists , but churnalists .
An industry whose primary task is to filter out falsehood has become so vulnerable to manipulation that it is now involved in the mass production of falsehood , distortion and propaganda .
And the Cardiff researchers found one other key statistic that helps to explain why this has happened .
For each of the 20 years from 1985 , they dug out figures for the editorial staffing levels of all the Fleet Street publications and compared them with the amount of space they were filling .
They discovered that the average Fleet Street journalist now is filling three times as much space as he or she was in 1985 .
In other words , as a crude average , they have only one - third of the time that they used to have to do their jobs .
Generally , they do n't find their own stories , or check their content , because they simply do n't have the time .
Add that to all of the traditional limits on journalists ' trying to find the truth , and you can see why the mass media generally are no longer a reliable source of information .

Think of it as Wikipedia ’s police department hotline .
The " encyclopedia anyone can edit " includes a page where you can instantly alert the site ’s brain trust to foul play .
It ’s called the " Conflict of Interest Noticeboard . "
If you suspect someone has rigged the system , using the encyclopedia to push their own agenda , this is where you turn .
But there 's a catch .
One of the site ’s leading administrators bears an extreme conflict of interest , but you ca n’t expose him from the Conflict of Interest Noticeboard .
He created the Conflict of Interest Noticeboard .
This administrator , Jossi Fresco , is a longtime student of Prem Rawat - formerly Guru Maharaj Ji - the India - born spiritual leader who styled himself as the " Perfect Master " and fostered a worldwide religious movement encouraging followers to call him " Lord of the Universe . "
Jossi Fresco openly acknowledges he 's employed by an organization " related " to Prem Rawat , and according to an ex-Rawat - follower and former friend , he served on the guru 's personal staff and built the guru 's first web site .
Nonetheless , Fresco maintains strict control over Wikipedia ’s Prem Rawat article and countless related articles , keeping criticism of his guru to a bare minimum .
Fresco denies any conflict of interest .
He argues that his contributions to Wikipedia 's Rawat - related articles do not violate the site 's conflict of interest policy , which allows such conflicts if editors disclose them and continue to edit " neutrally . "
" I have acted in a transparent and straightforward manner with regard to Wikipedia " , he told us over email .
In a way , he has acted in a transparent and straightforward manner .
He edits Wikipedia under his real name .
And he acknowledges a connection to Rawat on his Wikipedia user page .
But he wo n't say how deep this connection goes , and as part of Wikipedia 's inner circle , or " ruling clique " , he has the power to shape site policies - including the conflict of interest policy .
Fresco also denies he has the power shape site policies , even though he is the third most frequent contributor to the conflict of interest policy - even though he removed the clause that forbade guru followers from editing articles about their gurus .
So why is Wikipedia 's treatment of Prem Rawat so one - sided ?
Jossie Fresco , in an image from his Wikipedia page1
The inspirational speaker formerly known as ...
Prem Rawat 's religious movement is widely recognized as a cult or former cult - by independent academics and the mainstream media as well as ex-Rawat - followers .
And such sources say that within the movement , Rawat is or was regarded as a divine being .
For example , in their 1982 book Strange Cults : The Great American Cult Scare - well reviewed by The New York Times - David Bromley and Anson Shupe Jr. profiled Rawat 's Divine Light Mission alongside the Unification Church , the Children of God , the Hare Krishnas , the Church of Scientology , and the People 's Temple .
" At one point , Ji was referred to by [ Mission ] members as Lord of the Universe and was regarded as a living avatar , " wrote Bromley , the chairman of sociology at the University of Hartford , and Shupe , an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas .
And yet the word " cult " does not appear in the guru 's Wikipedia biography .
Wikipedia bills itself as an encyclopedia with a " neutral point of view . "
And co-founder Jimmy " Jimbo " Wales has publicly said that neutrality can't be maintained where there 's an obvious conflict of interest , coming down hard on outsiders who 've dared cross the line , including Microsoft and the ill - fated MyWikiBiz .
But clearly , within the site 's inner circle , such conflicts are allowed - even when it comes to editing site policy .
BitTorrent is supposed to be hassle free , that 's why it 's so attractive right ?
Sadly , it is also used by by scammers to generate money , often through trickery and deception .
Recently , a new ring of BitTorrent rip off sites has sprung up , this time related to movie codecs .
Spamming BitTorrent sites with fake movies is nothing new .
We ’ve reported before how people download movies only to find out that they require a special media player to play it , or others , which are bundled with malware to infect their PC when they install it .
Today , sadly , we have to report on a new ring of BitTorrent scam sites .
This particular brand notifies people who try to play a video file they ’ve just downloaded that they need to download a codec if they want to play the file .
The site they are redirected to is of course a scam , most of them are filled with annoying ads .
Thousands of downloaders have already fallen for this scam , and new reports keep coming in .
The downloaded files are simply huge uncompressed videos , named after a popular release .
This is what the message looks like : “ Warning : HD Codec not detected .
Please get the correct codec from [ insert site here ] . ”
The following sites have been related to these scams , but there are probably a few more .

Although we dispute the claim that your PC will be filled with spyware and viruses when you use BitTorrent , there are some basic steps people should know in order to avoid running into them .
Below are two examples , for a detailed overview and more tips and tricks , check our tutorial on how to avoid fake torrents and other scams .
1. Read Comments
This is a simple but effective way to find out if the . torrent is legit or not .
It only takes a few seconds but it ’s time well spent .
Very often there are requests from previous downloaders for a password to access the file or some might be asking where to download a special video player to view it .
2. Verify the Source
A good way to find out if a . torrent is real or not is to find out who uploaded the file .
There are several well known users that always release torrents on a regular basis , EZTV is a good example .
Happy torrenting ..

BBC News , Irbil , Iraq
Like their colleagues across Iraq , the doctors and nurses at the Emergency Management Centre in Irbil work relentlessly .
Activists say self - immolation reflects Kurdish experience under Saddam
The medical specialisms at this hospital are war surgery and burns .
With the continuing violence in nearby Mosul and Diyala province , war surgery is in great demand .
So too is the burns unit .
The chief nurse , Ahmed Mohammad , has done the tour of the women 's intensive care unit many times before .
" This is ICU burns , " he said .
" We have four patients here . "
In the corner of the ward lies a girl swaddled in bandages .
" The upper part of her body is burnt .
So are her head and her arms , as well as one of her thighs , " he said .
Eighteen - year - old Sana has been here for nine weeks .
Only the tips of her fingers and a small part of her face are visible .
Alarming trend " I tried to commit suicide , " Sana said .
" I have been sick .
I had some mental problems and that is why I decided to burn myself . "
Sana 's state of mind and her story are confused - but in time it becomes clear that the pressure of exams at school became too much for her .
Can you imagine ?
You put kerosene on yourself and light it .
Some of them lock themselves in a room so that nobody can actually get to them and save them
Chilura Hardi
Head of women 's radio station and centre
One moment she blames herself .
The next she says that her family did n't support her .
The Kurdish region of northern Iraq is generally seen as a model for the rest of the country .
This semi-autonomous area is relatively safe , the economy is flourishing and it is regarded in the West as a liberal haven in an often - conservative region .
But since the fall of Saddam Hussein there has been an alarming trend - hundreds of women have died after setting themselves on fire .
Anecdotal evidence from medical sources and women 's activists indicate that on average a woman a day tries to kill herself in the Kurdistan region .
Most of them do so because of family problems .
Agonising death
The workers at Radio Khatuzeen have heard scores of stories like the one Sana tells .
" The way they kill themselves is a real tragedy , " says Chilura Hardi who runs the women 's radio station and centre .
" Can you imagine ?
You put kerosene on yourself and light it .
Some of them lock themselves in a room so that nobody can actually get to them and save them . "
The workers at the centre have several theories about why so many women try to kill themselves in such an agonising way .
Some believe that religion is to blame - if a woman does something wrong , so the theory goes , she faces burning in hell .
Others argue that in a conservative , patriarchal society , the pain of women is only recognised through dramatic gestures .
The kerosene heaters that are in every home provide a way to be noticed .
Anfal
There is also the horrific history of Iraq 's Kurds .
" When Saddam 's regime was in power he did everything to subordinate women , " Chilura Hardi says .
The medical centre specialises in war injuries and burns " The Anfal Campaign against the Kurds was exactly like that .
He actually killed all the men but let the women stay and live that sort of misery with their children .
There was 30 years of that kind of rule .
It will take a long , long time for that to change .
It is a very slow and painful process . "
The human rights minister in the Kurdistan region admits that immolation is a problem that his government is struggling to deal with .
There have been attempts to improve education and women 's shelters have been built , but it will take years to change long - held customs .
" Our community consists of all types , " Dr Yousif Shwan Aziz says .
" Fortunately most of them are liberal people .
They believe in the progress of women and men . " ' Feudal '
For many Kurdish women the optimism of the minister is not borne out by experience .
" There is widespread bad treatment of women , " said Chiman whose sister burnt to death .
" I do n't believe that women here have power .
The reports in the media are just talk .
The reality in our society is totally different .
It 's a fact that the government is too feudal .
It does n't have a solution for the problems . "
At times the challenges facing Iraq are simply incomprehensible .
As in other countries at war , it often seems that it is women who suffer most .
For the Kurds , the Kurdistan region is meant to be different - a place where this most persecuted of people are trying to build a safe future .
There is much that still needs to change for Kurdish women .

What are these ?
' Is n't it ironic ? '
You hear it all the time - and , most of the time , actually no , it is n't .
Hypocritical , cynical , lazy , coincidental , more likely .
But what is irony and why did pundits think it would die two years ago , after September 11 ?
Zoe Williams meticulously , sincerely , unironically , hunts it down
Taking its name from the Greek eironeia ( dissimulation ) , irony consists of purporting a meaning of an utterance or a situation that is different , often opposite , to the literal one .
Irony is a state of affairs or an event that seems deliberately contrary to what one expects and is often amusing as a result .
The New Oxford English Dictionary
Pretty much everything is ironic these days .
Irony is used as a synonym for cool , for cynicism , for detachment , for intelligence ; it 's cited as the end of civilisation , as well as its salvation .
Pretty much every form of culture claims to be shot through with it , even ( especially ) the ones that conspicuously are n't .
I read last week that Bruce Forsyth hosting Have I Got News For You was an " ironic statement " , as if you could ascend into irony just by being old , as you used to with wisdom .
I read , too , that it was ironic for Alan Millburn to leave his job to spend more time with his family , when the doctors and nurses under his care do n't have that facility ; well , it 's not ironic , it 's just standard - issue self - interest , with maybe a smattering of hypocrisy .
I 've read claims of an " ironic " interest in Big Brother - nope .
Lazy , maybe .
Possibly postmodern .
Not ironic .
We have a grave problem with this word ( well , in fact , it 's not really grave - but I 'm not being ironic when I call it that , I 'm being hyperbolic .
Though often the two amount to the same thing .
But not always ) .
Just looking at the definitions , the confusion is understandable - in the first instance , rhetorical irony expands to cover any disjunction at all between language and meaning , with a couple of key exceptions ( allegory also entails a disconnection between sign and meaning , but obviously is n't synonymous with irony ; and lying , clearly , leaves that gap , but relies for its efficacy on an ignorant audience , where irony relies on a knowing one ) .
Still , even with the riders , it 's quite an umbrella , no ?
In the second instance , situational irony ( also known as cosmic irony ) occurs when it seems that " God or fate is manipulating events so as to inspire false hopes , which are inevitably dashed " ( 1 ) .
While this looks like the more straightforward usage , it opens the door to confusion between irony , bad luck and inconvenience .
Most pressingly , though , there are a number of misconceptions about irony that are peculiar to recent times .
The first is that September 11 spelled the end of irony .
The second is that the end of irony would be the one good thing to come out of September 11 .
The third is that irony characterises our age to a greater degree than it has done any other .
The fourth is that Americans can't do irony , and we can .
The fifth is that the Germans can't do irony , either ( and we still can ) .
The sixth is that irony and cynicism are interchangeable .
The seventh is that it's a mistake to attempt irony in emails and text messages , even while irony characterises our age , and so do emails .
And the eighth is that " post - ironic " is an acceptable term - it is very modish to use this , as if to suggest one of three things : i ) that irony has ended ; ii ) that postmodernism and irony are interchangeable , and can be conflated into one handy word ; or iii ) that we are more ironic than we used to be , and therefore need to add a prefix suggesting even greater ironic distance than irony on its own can supply .
None of these things is true .
Now , after all that effort numbering and sub-numbering the points , I 'm going to deal with them in the wrong order .
That is n't ironic , it 's just a bit sloppy .
There are four important epochs of irony ( unless you count Hegel , Kierkegaard and Nietzsche , but to do that , I would need to have read them ) .
Phase one Socratic irony is simply part of a canon of rhetorical tools devised to distract people from the fact that they 've been sitting still listening to hard talk for an awfully long time .
The technique , demonstrated in the Platonic dialogues , was to pretend ignorance and , more sneakily , to feign credence in your opponent 's power of thought , in order to tie him in knots .
This is amazingly prevalent in contemporary social intercourse - every one of us , I 'd guess , has a friend who engages in an argument , waits patiently until you 've said something really trenchant and probably wrong , then cocks his ( or her ) head to one side and says , " Do you think that 's true ? " thereafter pursuing each one of your most ridiculous points and challenging them from a perspective of utter ( pretended ) ignorance .
Weirdly , this is never called irony , even though every other bloody thing that anyone ever says is .
Phase two Romantic irony was framed by Schlegel ( 2 ) the German philosopher .
Here , it became a much more complex philosophical tool , of which the nuts and bolts were that you simultaneously occupied two opposite positions ( what you say versus what is real ) .
There were problems with this as a direct path to truth later on , but I 'd need a more Socratic grasp of how not to be boring before I could go into them .
The point with Schlegel was that irony would give you a divided self , which in turn gives you a multiplicity of perspectives , which is the only way you will unlock the truth of the whole .
This romantic ( or " philosophical " ) irony had a great influence on the English Romantic poets - Coleridge 's Rime Of The Ancient Mariner , with its commentary running alongside the narrative , divides the perspective ( plus , he read Schlegel , so I 'm not just making that up ) .
But irony as part of the British literary tradition does n't , generally speaking , commence with Romantic irony , but rather with the device that has its roots in Socrates , viz , saying the opposite of what is true in order to underline the truth .
So , from this you 'd trace a line from Chaucer , through More , Sidney and Milton , arriving at Swift and Austen , where you can see a pleasing bifurcation of irony 's literary use .
Austen uses irony as a means of being understated .
Swift , by contrast , uses irony for polemical purposes , conjuring grotesque images ironically ( babies being eaten , mankind enslaved to the morally superior horse ) in order to state his case ( that the Irish were starving , that humanity was going to the dogs ) ever more forcefully .
Phase three Irony as a tool of dissent , a grim but failsafe gag and mainstay of popular culture , took hold during the first world war ( 3 ) .
The gross disjunction between patriotic rhetoric and the reality of the war itself led to a widespread use of irony as a means of puncturing deceitful propaganda .
Every convention of today 's ironic , satirical news forms ( from Private Eye , through Viz , to the Onion ) has a germ in the Wipers Times , the first world war trench newspaper ( established , independently of military authority , by Captain FJ Roberts of the Sherwood Foresters . )
At this point , irony was still purporting to be an overview - to be wading through the mulch of accepted wisdom and exposing its fraudulence .
So , for instance , the Wipers Times would print a list of Things That Were Definitely True , and it would contain a proportion of propaganda ( " 40,000 Huns have Surrendered " ) , a proportion of enemy propaganda ( " The Germans Have Plentiful and Tasty Meats " ) and a proportion of nonsense ( " Horatio Bottomley has accepted the Turkish Throne on condition they make a separate peace " ) , thus undermining any information coming from anywhere at all ( it 's interesting that the paper was caustically ironic on the subject of the war itself , but never deviated from the line that home leave was a blessed relief , when , in fact , most soldiers found it stressful and devastating to return to normality after the trenches - there is a limit to how far you can take irony before you have to shoot yourself ) .
Where irony springs up as a response to being lied to ( by authority , or prevailing culture , or whatever ) , it is still adhering loosely to Chaucer 's model - it states the lie in order to expose the lie , and is therefore a route to truth .
It has some moral import .
It may say " This belief is wrong " , but it does n't say " All belief is wrong " .
When people call ours the Age of Irony , that is not the kind of irony they are on about .
Phase four
Our age has not so much redefined irony , as focused on just one of its aspects .
Irony has been manipulated to echo postmodernism .
The postmodern , in art , architecture , literature , film , all that , is exclusively self - referential - its core implication is that art is used up , so it constantly recycles and quotes itself .
Its entirely self - conscious stance precludes sincerity , sentiment , emoting of any kind , and thus has to rule out the existence of ultimate truth or moral certainty .
Irony , in this context , is not there to lance a boil of duplicity , but rather to undermine sincerity altogether , to beggar the mere possibility of a meaningful moral position .
In this sense it is , indeed , indivisible from cynicism .
This is n't to say that " truth - seeking " irony has evaporated - many creative forms still use irony to highlight the sheer , grinding horror of pursuits or points of view that are considered " normal " ( like The Office , for instance ; and much of American literature is masterfully good at employing irony with a purpose - to choose at random , Pastoralia , by George Saunders , Infinite Jest , by David Foster Wallace , anything by Philip Roth , The Corrections , by Jonathan Franzen ) .
But other strands of media use irony to assert their right to have no position whatsoever .
So , you take a cover of FHM , with tits on the front - and it 's ironic because it appears to be saying " women are objects " , yet of course it is n't saying that , because we 're in a postfeminist age .
But nor is it saying " women are n't objects " , because that would be dated , over - sincere , mawkish even .
So , it 's effectively saying " women are neither objects , nor non-objects - and here are some tits ! "
Scary Movie 2 , Dumb And Dumberer , posh women who go to pole - dancing classes , people who set the video for Big Brother Live , people who have Eurovision Song Contest evenings , Char lie 's Angels ( the film , not the TV series ) and about a million other things besides , are all using this ludic trope - " I 'm not saying what you think I 'm saying , but I 'm not saying its opposite , either .
In fact , I 'm not saying anything at all .
But I get to keep the tits . "
As Paul de Man pointed out , some time before FHM , " This does not , however , make it into an authentic language , for to know inauthenticity is not the same as being authentic . " ( 4 ) .
So , we 're not the first age to use irony ( as some insist ) , but we are the first to use it in this vacuous , agenda - free and often highly amusing way .
September 11 and the End of Irony
Politicians especially ( but serious minds of all sorts ) dislike this newish twist of irony , since political rhetoric relies on moral framework - they may be spinning , they may be sexing up their evidence , they may be lying straight to our faces as we beseech them not to kill innocent Iraqis for no good reason ( as an example ) , but at least old - fashioned protest waits until it knows it has been lied to before it unleashes its irony .
Modern irony ridicules politicians regardless , for their sheer unironic - ness in holding a position in the first place .
So , upon the giant disaster , many people were glad to declare irony 's end .
Gerry Howard , editorial director of Broadway Books , said , " I think somebody should do a marker that says irony died on 9 - 11 - 01 . "
Roger Rosenblatt claimed , in an essay in Time magazine , that " one good thing could come from this horror : it could spell the end of the age of irony " ( 5 ) .
This is striking as the kind of American self - importance that leads people to think they have no sense of irony in the first place .
But there is legitimacy in the claim - for a very short time , the event seemed so earth - shattering that there did seem to be an absolute and clear dichotomy between good and evil .
Once you 've got one of those , then a ) the act of seeking the truth through irony is pointless , because the truth is staring you in the face ; and b ) the postmodern ironic distance that eschews concepts like " good " and " evil " has been trounced .
Naturally , irony was back within a few days , not least because of the myriad ironies contained within the attack itself ( America having funded al - Qaida is ironic ; America raining bombs and peanut butter on Afghanistan is ironic ) .
But even without those ironic features , irony would have resurfaced pretty soon - only a very fresh tragedy can silence it .
The end of irony would be a disaster for the world - bad things will always occur , and those at fault will always attempt to cover them up with emotional and overblown language .
If their opponents have to emote back at them , you 're basically looking at a battle of wills , and the winner will be the person who can beat their breast the hardest without getting embarrassed .
Irony allows you to launch a challenge without being dragged into this orbit of self - regarding sentiment that you get from Tony Blair , say , when he talks about " fighting for what 's right " .
Irony can deflate a windbag in the way that very little else can .
What people usually mean when they yearn for an end to irony is an end to postmodernism .
I 'm not sure this will ever happen , since it places itself after originality and progress ( what comes after the afters ?
Well , cheese , I guess ) .
Irony and America
There are a few reasons why we think the Americans have no sense of irony .
First , theirs is rather an optimistic culture , full of love of country and dewy - eyed self - belief and all the things that Europe 's lost going through the war spindryer for the thousandth time .
This is all faith - based - faith in God , faith in the goodness of humanity , etc - and irony can never coexist with faith , since the mere act of questioning causes the faith fairy to disappear .
Second , they have a very giving register that , with a sense of irony , would be unsustainable ( how can you wish a stranger a nice day with a straight face ? ) .
Third , because we think Canadian Alanis Morissette is American , and she proved some time ago , with her song Ironic , that she did n't know what irony meant ( this is so ironic - first , because we think we 're the more sophisticated and yet do n't know the difference between America and Canada , second because America sees Canada as such a tedious sleeping partner , and yet Canada is subversively sending idiots into the global marketplace with American accents .
Of course , I 'm being ironic .
Canadian accents are not the same as American ones ! )
In fact , this is absolute moonshine , since the consummate and well - documented superiority of US telly over British telly is largely due to their superior grasp of irony ( as well as the fact that they have more cash ) .
Take , for instance , the opening sequences of Six Feet Under versus the opening sequences of Casualty - they both start every episode with a vignette in which a stranger dies a horrible death or suffers a hideous accident .
In Six Feet Under , this will never be straightforward - the porn star will never die because her silicon implants explode , she will die in some way that could happen to anyone ; the wheezing , scared - looking sportsman will turn out to have been just a bit thirsty , while his amazingly strong team - mate will be dying in the background from heat stroke .
There 's always some cosmic irony , swiftly followed by ironic dialogue .
In Casualty , on the other hand - man leaves pub in middle of day ; commences dangerous - looking welding job ; burns own eye out in drunk accident .
Dur .
Germans and irony
Not speaking German , nor watching much German TV , nor having read any German literature apart from Bernard Schlink who , let me tell you , is about as ironic as a dog chasing a squirrel , it 's difficult to tell whether or not there 's any truth in the rumour that they have no sense of irony .
However , since they invented it ( well , they invented Schlegel ) , it 's more than likely that they 've got plenty .
To anyone who thinks I 'm insufficiently bigoted , I have serious doubts about the French .
Irony in emailing and texts
Texting is a truly tricky form for the ironist - very brief texts are difficult to make ironic simply because it 's difficult to inject many layers into seven words .
However , if you write a very long text , because it 's such a bugger to do , your extra effort suggests a sincerity - an undudelike urge to be understood - that sits all wrong with the irony .
To get round this , forms like " (! ) " and " Not " and " have evolved " , but they 're pretty dumb and basic .
With emails , people with a lot of time on their hands can , obviously , give themselves room to develop an ironic theme , but for people with jobs , e-etiquette demands instant response , which brings you down to the very rudiments of irony - I Love My Boss ; I 'm Delighted That My Ex Is Going Out With That Attractive Woman ; I Really Could n't Be More Pleased That You 've Lost a Stone .
Once it 's as bald as that , and you 're without extra signifiers like eyebrows , there is a danger of misunderstanding .
However , I think we 're actually more alert to irony than we are to its opposite , sincerity .
Take the case of Rena Salmon , who last year shot her husband 's lover , and then texted him to that effect .
Her words were , " I have shot Lorna .
This is not a joke . "
A perfect demonstration of my point ( I do n't get many of those ) - the first thing you think when you read a text is that it is a joke .
Situational irony
This article has almost exclusively been about rhetorical irony , which has much more fluidity and variety than situational irony .
That does not mean that situational irony is entirely straightforward - often , the appearance that God or Fate was attempting to make you think one thing when another was going to happen is down to your own misreading or wilful blindness , and therefore is n't ironic at all .
Furthermore , where rhetorical irony can be as simple as saying the opposite of what you mean , cosmic irony is not simply experiencing the opposite of what you thought was going to happen .
For instance , if I was having a party , and I thought my dad was going to come , and he did n't , that would n't be ironic .
If , on the other hand , I was having a party and I did n't want my dad to come , and I spent three weeks working on a brilliant cover story for why he could n't come , and then my sister accidentally blew my cover , so I had to invite him anyway , and then , on the way here , he got run over and died - that 's ironic .
I hope he realises that that example was , well , not ironic , but certainly meant with no ill will .
But , whatever ( here , with ludic irony , I 'm trying to get out of writing a conclusion by affecting the jargon of the slothful teenager .
Obviously , I do n't mean " whatever " - I do n't share the disaffected carelessness of the standard " whatever " user .
But I 'm still getting out of writing a conclusion .
To know inauthenticity is n't the same as being authentic .
Or even , just because you ironically know you 're wrong does n't make you right ) .

I would strongly urge you not to read any more footnotes , they are only here to make sure I do n't get in trouble for plagiarising .
2 . ' In it [ irony ] everything should be all jest and all serious - ness , everything guilelessly open and deeply hidden ...
It contains and arouses a sense of the indissoluble antagonism between the absolute and the relative , between the impossibility and the necessity of complete communication .
It is the freest of all licences , because through it one transcends oneself , but at the same time it is the most prescribed , because [ it is ] absolutely necessary . '
3 . This is obviously debatable , but Paul Fussell in The Great War And Modern Memory made the case compellingly .

As the war nears its fifth year , the steady upturn in the public mood stands to alter the dynamics of races up and down the ballot .
Support for war effort highest since 2006
American public support for the military effort in Iraq has reached a high point unseen since the summer of 2006 , a development that promises to reshape the political landscape .
According to late February polling conducted by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press , 53 percent of Americans — a slim majority — now believe “ the U.S. will ultimately succeed in achieving its goals ” in Iraq .
That figure is up from 42 percent in September 2007 .
Advertisement
The percentage of those who believe the war in Iraq is going “ very well ” or “ fairly well ” is also up , from 30 percent in February 2007 to 48 percent today .
The situation in Iraq remains fluid , of course .
A surge in violence or in troop deaths could lead to rapid fluctuations in public opinion .
But as the war nears its fifth year , the steady upturn in the public mood stands to alter the dynamics of races up and down the ballot .
The repercussions will be most acutely felt in the presidential contest .
Democrats Barack Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton remain committed to a staggered pullout , while Republican John McCain holds steadfast in his support for the Bush administration ’s military surge .
In recent years , election results have tracked perceptions about the progress of the war in Iraq .
The Democratic wave in the 2006 congressional elections correlated to a low point in the public ’s view of the war .
The resurgence of McCain ’s candidacy also tracks the decrease in U.S. fatalities in Iraq .
Monthly troop deaths have dropped by about two - thirds since the summer of 2007 , according to Department of Defense records .
Democrats ’ resolute support for the withdrawal of U.S. combat forces may soon position them at odds with independent voters , in particular , a constituency they need to retake the White House .
Half of self - identified independents polled now believe the United States should “ keep troops in Iraq until the situation has stabilized , ” according to polling data assembled by Pew at Politico ’s request .
Senior foreign policy aides to Clinton and Obama said in interviews that their candidates have no intention of reconsidering their pledges to withdraw troops from Iraq , despite the waning of public opposition .
As recently as Tuesday in Harrisburg , Pa. , Clinton reiterated her pledge to “ end the war in Iraq and bring our troops home . ”
She added , as she has for months , that she would “ carefully and responsibly ” start the withdrawal of those troops within 60 days of taking office .
“ There is no military solution , ” Clinton is prone to say , a sentiment echoed by Obama .
Obama has also proposed an end date for “ removing all combat brigades ” from Iraq .
The uptick in public support is a promising sign for Republican candidates who have been bludgeoned over the Bush administration ’s war policies .
But no candidate stands to gain more than McCain .
“ How could Democrats possibly hand McCain a better issue than to let him run on his record of advocating a robust U.S. presence in Iraq with all the positive battlefield news that is filtering out of that country ? ” asked Michael O’Hanlon , a national security adviser at the Brookings Institution who has been at the center of the Iraq debate since the war ’s outset .
“ Thinking about where we were at the time of the congressional elections , it ’s ironic that the Iraq issue could actually be the one that most favors the Republican and most other issues — including most foreign policy issues — could most favor the Democrats , ” O’Hanlon added .
“ Yet Democrats keep wanting to fight the Iraq debate . ”
The positions taken by Obama and Clinton reflect the majority sentiment in their party : Seven in 10 Democrats continue to believe the war in Iraq is going poorly .
Only about a quarter of Democrats support maintaining troop levels until “ the situation has stabilized , ” according to Pew polling data .
Views of the war in Iraq have long varied depending upon party affiliation , unlike during the Vietnam War .
Although even Democratic discontent has ebbed for the first time in more than a year — 29 percent now support keeping troops in , an increase of 8 percentage points since last summer — foreign policy advisers to both candidates dispute the idea that Democrats are in the unenviable position of disagreeing with the majority of Americans over whether the war in Iraq can succeed .
“ We have seen at great cost here that the surge has resulted in a reduction of violence .
That ’s indisputable , ” said a top Obama foreign policy adviser , who spoke on the condition of anonymity .
“ But we have not seen any of the political progress that will be necessary to have that long - term stability .
“ [ Obama ] believes the best way to induce change is to have this strategic redeployment , ” the adviser added .
While Democrats increasingly constitute the bulk of voters who support the withdrawal of troops , the public shift of opinion overall has been dramatic .
As many voters now believe that the war is going “ well ” as “ not well ” — 48 percent each , according to Pew .
Pew also found that 49 percent favor bringing the troops home as soon as possible , while 47 percent say the troops should stay in until the situation stabilizes — statistical parity between the two positions .
Late February polling conducted by CBS News has also shown that the public view of the war is better than at any point since August 2006 .
CBS recently found that 43 percent of the country believes the war is going “ well ” — less than Pew found but still double the level of last June .
Democrats remain in step with the public mood on the question of the decision to go to war .
Pew and CBS have found that a majority of Americans , including independents , continue to believe that the choice to wage war with Iraq was “ wrong ” — a figure that has held for years .
McCain is betting , however , that the public will view the war through a forward - looking lens .
For months , he has argued that Democrats intend to “ retreat ” in Iraq and ensure failure .
The public may soon come to view that as “ a correct narrative , ” said O’Hanlon , a Democrat whose views on the war have made him the bête noire of many in the anti-war liberal base .
Perhaps as a result of the uptick in support for the war or his own military record , McCain is well - positioned to retake the party ’s traditional advantage on national security issues .
Almost half of registered voters now believe it is “ very likely ” that McCain would be an “ effective commander in chief , ” according to CBS polling .
Less than one - quarter said the same of Obama and Clinton .
In addition , CBS found that a clear majority of Americans were “ confident ” that McCain could “ handle an international crisis ” — 56 percent said so for McCain , 47 percent for Obama and only 39 percent for Clinton .
The McCain campaign has signaled plans to continue highlighting his differences with Democrats over Iraq policy .
Meanwhile , Democrats plan to continue to frame McCain as a central player in the president ’s Iraq policy who is likely to continue in the same direction .
“ Sen . McCain is clearly going to try to depict the Democrat , whoever it is , as cut and run , ” the Clinton adviser said .
“ And Sen. Clinton , or whoever is the Democratic nominee , is clearly going to try to depict Sen.
McCain as one who would stay there for centuries . ”
For the time being , however , McCain can claim that roughly half of the public does not support a troop withdrawal — a first since the 2008 presidential race began .
I try to keep things at Slice apolitical .
After all , even the slimiest of Republicans and the skeeviest of Democrats enjoys good pizza .
But this is an important election , and I figure all you homeslices reading the site could use some guidance as to whom the best pizza candidate might be among the front - runners in each party 's nomination race .
My first step was to see how many times " pizza " was metioned on each candidate 's website and how often the candidate 's name and the word " pizza " came up together in a Google search .
I then contacted the candidates via their websites to ask four standard questions and one question specifically tailored to the candidate .
In alphabetical order , here are the emails I sent and responses I got :

[ Editor 's note : Each candidate received a variation of the following greeting ; I include it here with Senator Clinton 's correspondence but omit it in later correspondence , as only names and party affiliations were changed . ]
Dear Senator Clinton , I am editorial page editor of Slice , America 's favorite pizza weblog , and we are trying to decide which Democratic candidate to endorse before the all - important make - or - break March 4 round of primaries .
Because we focus specifically on pizza at Slice , I would like you to answer the following questions for the pizza - minded voters in our substantial audience :
Thin -crust or deep dish ?
Favorite topping or topping combo ?
Given your background — Illinois - born but representing the people of New York State and New York City — where do you fall on the Chicago vs. NYC issue ?
Can you name your favorite pizzeria ?
You once derided the consumption of pizza , characterizing it as unhealthy .
Would you like to take this opportunity to clarify your pizza position for Slice readers ?
I know how enormously busy you are ahead of Ohio , and I thank you for your time .
Good luck !
Hasta la pizza , Adam Kuban

ANALYSIS AND ENDORSEMENTS
Democratic Candidate : Barack Obama
Hillary Clinton gets points with us for her service to New York state , where pizza as we know it was essentially born .
And she gets bonus points for her .jpg signature .
We are , however , dismayed at her failure to respond to tough questions regarding her denigration of slices and pies .
While we understand that an all - pizza diet is not healthy , it is up to the individual to monitor her own diet while on the campaign trail .
Placing the blame for unhealthy eating on one of America 's iconic foods rather than where it belongs — on the candidate herself — does not bode well for someone whose accountability will need to be beyond reproach after eight years of unchecked negligence in the Oval Office .

And while we have concerns about Barack Obama 's experience , when we consider his pizza credentials , he wins our endorsement for the sheer number of supporters coming together at pizza meet - ups to work phone banks , organize get - out - the - vote drives , and make big talk about change .
Many of his supporters are college students , who , as we know so well , are among the nation 's largest pizza - eating bloc .
We also like that Obama visited Caesario's Pizza in Manchester , New Hampshire :
Link : Caesario's Pizza [ YouTube ]
Republican Candidate : John McCain
While we were dismayed by the lack of response from either Republican candidate , we must nonetheless choose one to support .
Mike Huckabee 's total on - site pizza count is double that of John McCain's .
But the senator from Arizona has some crucial pizza cred behind him in that he hails from an up - and - coming pizza state .
Believe it or not , Arizona has what is said to be one of the country 's best pizzerias ( Pizzeria Bianco ) and is home to a number of coal - fired pizza ovens .
While we do n't know if Mr. McCain partakes of such offerings ( shame on you for not answering us , Senator ! ) , we suspect that Governor Huckabee 's diet would limit him from consuming pizza in quantities that would befit a nominee that this site could endorse .
Therefore , our nod goes , by default , to Senator McCain .

These remarks from reader Liz conveniently summarize , more or less , my own views on sexy feminism .
She begins with quoted text from another commenter .
“ Sexy feminism ( aka sex - positivism ) is n’t about appealing to men and thus perpetuation [ sic ] the patriarchy through internalized sexism .
It ’s about claiming our own sexual pleasure and our own bodies .
It ’s about doing what we want despite the patriarchy .
It ’s about using our bodies for our own pleasure or to express our own thoughts , despite how you or anyone else interprets our bodies .
We ’re saying , ‘ It ’s my body and I get to decide how to use it . ’ ” [ Context ]
It ’s interesting that [ Twisty ] mention [s ]
Clinton and fun feminism in the same post , because people criticize Clinton as “ more of the same , ” and that ’s exactly how I feel whenever a feminist tries to convince me that “ sexy feminism ” is about having control over your own sexuality .
You know what would make me feel like I had control over my own sexuality ?
Having the same rights as guys to walk around topless on the beach without feeling afraid or ogled as some kind of sex object , or being able to breast feed my baby in public without that being offensive or risque or any kind of issue at all , or being able to walk home at night alone without being groped by some drunk asshole .
Instead , “ sex positive ” feminists focus on is the ability to accept themselves as sexual , which they only attain by presenting a version of themselves that others readily find acceptable and have since way before I was born .
Would you feel so empowered by your sexuality if you did n’t have a receptive audience ?
Nothing new here .
Nothing challenging .
I think our desire to gain control over our own sexuality is important ( and hopefully possible ) , but this whole “ sexy feminist ” movement completely misunderstands what that means .
I ’m “ sex positive , ” ( stupid term ) by the way , and I think that this label is completely misused by practically everyone as a way of insinuating that those who disagree with their self - exploitation are somehow anti-sex .
We already have the ability to use our bodies to turn ourselves on and others on .
What we do n’t have is the control over showing our bodies in a non-sexual way , because whenever the clothes come off , we ’re sexualized .
Being able to control that distinction is central to having true control over your body , yet “ sexy feminists ” never talk about that , and they just present us with more lame burlesque acts and sad porn sites .
As long as Liz brought it up , let me just say this one last thing about sexy feminism .
It ’s a too - too - tool of the patriarkay .
It ’s an expedient justification , a way to rebrand what everybody does when they ’re in their twenties , which is to drink too much and screw a lot , as a cool 21st - century - activist political activity .
This would just be kind of funny , you know , youthful hi-jinx and whatnot , except that , since it is entirely devoid of philosophic value , sexy feminism has sort of caught on .
It ’s had the untoward effect of diluting the message of actual feminism .
And the even more untoward effect of vilifying radical feminism .
And the even more untoward effect of strengthening patriarchal oppression .
What do I mean by “ sexy feminism ” ?
Suicide Girls .
Bust magazine .
BDSM .
The “ position ” that women should be free to “ choose ” femininity if that ’s what bangs their box .
The idea that embracing sexploitation is “ empowering . ”
The notion that women “ can do what we want despite patriarchy . ”
What I do n’t mean is : the effort to liberate women ’s sexuality from the clutches of its traditional , misogynist , male - defined constraints , i.e. the effort to define women ’s sexuality in terms of women , as opposed to men defining women in terms of sex .
These are issues of ongoing concern to serious feminists and committed spinster aunts , but , as it turns out , have nothing to do with the preservation of feminine submission as a lifestyle choice .
Let ’s face it , girls .
We ’re living in a war zone and orgasms are a dime a dozen .
The performance of pornulated , dude - appeasing sex moves just is n’t important enough to form the basis of an entire political ideology .
Particularly when that ideology presumes to co opt and dilute a movement which was formerly of some use to women .
Seeing as how feminism was originally founded on sound philosophical principles thought up by thinkers , and had the potential to liberate millions of women from an endless cycle of violence , persecution , and poverty .
Sexy feminism creates two groups of women , but , oddly enough , neither group is for women .
I allude to the “ sex - positive ” group and the “ anti- sex ” group .
The first benefits the status quo .
It reassures women who fear the burden of true liberation that femininity is a legitimate identity .
The second is the fictitious enemy of the first — a stand - in for the real oppressor — and functions as the dark , hairy background against which the glowing orgasmic accomplishments of the sexy feminists may glitter in the light of life ’s dudely disco ball .
Of course there is no real group of anti-sexites ; this is a fabrication that allows sexy feminists to indulge in patriarchy - appeasing misogyny on feminist blogs .
I propose third , easy - breezy alternative to the suffocating conformity demanded by this tiresome positive vs. negative binary thought system : sex-neutralism .
Get busy , do n’t get busy , whatever !
While recognizing that penis placement has enormous political , social , and economic ramifications , particularly for members of the sex caste , the sex - neutral feminist — and I may be the only one alive — puts the act itself on a par with sneezing .
Pleasant enough when it happens , but hardly worth elevating to the pinnacle of human acheivement , or devoting 98 % of an internet to .
“ Thoughts , ” as our first commenter suggests , may well be “ expressed ” through boinking , but whether such thoughts differ substantially in philosophic value from sneezal effluents is dubitable .
By the way , you ca n’t “ do what you want despite patriarchy . ”
Patriarchy declines to offer you full agency , even if — particularly if — you try to take it .
That ’s why patriarchy is bad .
It ’s sad to hear about layoffs at companies like Yahoo .
Right now it seems like a bad time to be laid off .
I ’m here to offer some hope .
I laid myself off in February 2002 .
Remember that time ?
It was far worse than what we ’ve seen so far in the economic turmoil of 2008 .
It seemed like EVERYONE was laid off .
There was even a Website , fuckedcompany.com , that tracked layoff after layoff .
No good news , like the funding of Automattic , was coming out .
9/11 just happened and it seemed to be particularly dire .
But even in that tough time I found a job working at NEC .
Here ’s some tips I learned from that time .
1 . Do n’t get lazy .
It might seem dire , but if you work it you WILL find a job .
Some of my friends went on vacation , started drinking , or generally just hung out with their families .
Those people took a LOT longer to find a job than the friends of mine who approached their time off with these tips .
2 . Make sure you spend at least 30 % of every day trying to find a job .
That means working on your resume .
Getting your cover letter finished .
Sending out resumes .
Searching the web for work .
Networking .
Etc.
At first your time spent on these tasks should be a lot higher , but after weeks of watching the job sites for jobs and having your resume checked over by 10 of your friends you will naturally have more time to spend on other things .
3 . Start a blog on the field you want to work in .
Want to be a PHP programmer ?
Start a PHP blog and make sure you put world class stuff there .
Link to EVERYONE who has a PHP blog .
But that ’s only the beginning .
4 . Do things that will get you to be recognized as a world leader in the field you want to be in .
Are you a programmer ?
Build something and put it up !
Share your knowledge on your blog ( give tips you ’ve learned ) .
Are you a program manager ?
Those jobs will be tougher to find , but you should demonstrate that you are a great manager of people as well as that you ’re expert on the kinds of things you want to do .
Demo ! Demo !
Demo !
5. Learn from Loic Le Meur .
How did he get thousands of videos uploaded on Seesmic everyday ?
He networked .
He visited tons of journalists , bloggers , executives .
He is a consumate networker ( you should watch him work the halls here at the World Economic Forum ) .
6 . Do a video everyday on YouTube that demonstrates something you know .
Loic does a video everyday .
If you ’re laid off you have absolutely no excuses .
Get a cheap Web cam and get over to YouTube or Seesmic .
7 . Show your friends your resume and cover letter .
Do n’t have any friends ?
Now is the time to make some .
Call up some interesting people and ask for an informational interview .
This is particularly key if you work at a big company and are getting laid off .
I watched people at Microsoft get laid off and the ones who had tons of internal informational interviews got new jobs fast .
The key is to meet people everyday and get in front of them .
Not to beg for a job , but to do research on the industry you want to work in .
You ’d be amazed how showing some interest in your industry will get noticed itself .
8 . Do the basics .
I got my NEC job by sending a resume into a job that I found on Craig ’s List .
Yes , my blog helped me AFTER I got the interview , but I got the interview just by having a great cover letter and an interesting resume .
9 . Do n’t feel bad about taking government assistance .
You ’ll need it to pay your bills .
I took it and it helped me get over that tough period .
10 .
Go to any job networking session you learn about .
All of them were valuable to me , even though they did n’t necessarily bring me a job .
Part of it is just feeling like you ’re doing everything you can to get back on your feet .
It ’s an attitude thing .
If you have an attitude that you ’re going to work at this that will come across and will bring opportunities to you .
11 . Go where the money is .
If you are laid off and you have n’t sent your resume to Matt Mullenweg this morning , why not ?
People with new funding are the ones who are hiring .
You want to work for them , so do what you can to at minimum get an informational interview .
Why do n’t you interview Matt for your blog ?
You never know , he just might give you an interview and that might lead to a discussion about how you could fit into his company .
Even if it does n’t , at least you get an interesting interview with someone in the industry who is seeing success .
Other employers want to be like Matt , so if you have some insights to his success you might be surprised by how that gets you job interviews .
12 . Take a little bit of time to work on family and health .
You probably have n’t been paying enough attention to these two things .
This is the time to start some healthy habits .
Give up smoking , if you ’re doing that .
Drink less ( the temptation will be to drink more , do n’t give in ) .
Get more exercise .
Yes , I should take my own advice ( I went for a long walk this morning in Davos and had fish last night ) .
13 . Volunteer .
Let ’s say you are going to be out of work for six months .
What could you do with six months of your time ?
Make sure you come away with it with a great project under your belt .
Why not volunteer your time with a charity that could use your skills ?
Not only will you feel good about yourself , you ’ll come away with job experience so you wo n’t have a hole in your resume ( building an IT system for the Red Cross looks damn impressive — saying you were “ on the beach ” for six months does not ) .
Plus you ’ll make great friends with people who are trying to improve the world ( they are typically the kinds of friends you should have anyway ) .
14 .
Make sure you take advantage of any help your former employer is offering .
Sometimes they have retraining or other programs that might help you land an even better job .
15 .
See if you can keep coming into the office .
This is n’t open to everyone , but at Userland I kept coming into work everyday after the paychecks stopped .
That made me feel better , plus it gave me the ability to use phones , stay away from negative situations ( do you really want to be around family all day , everyday , who might remind you that you need to find a job ? ) as well as give you a place to work hard on finding your new job .
16 . Go to every business event you can attend .
Ca n’t afford to get in ?
Me neither and I have a job !
Hang out in the hallways .
You never know who you might meet .
At minimum you ’ll get interesting interviews for your blog .
Have your resumes ready .
17 . Always have your suit ready .
Some interviews happen fast “ can you be here this afternoon ? ”
The one who is ready will get the interview .
On your resume and cover letter .
I found a TON of tips online for how to improve yours .
Those tips work .
Listen to them .
My cover letter is what got me my interview ( the guy who ran the group told me that later ) .
My cover letter ’s approach came off of tips I found online .
Do Google searches for things like “ how to write a great cover letter . ”
Do you have any tips ?
Help out people by posting your own blogs and linking to them in my comment area here .
Good luck and keep your head up .
Lots of people have gotten fired .
I ’ve talked with quite a few CEOs here at the World Economic Forum and you ’d be surprised at how many of them have had bad times in their careers .
I ’ll be asking business leaders this week for their tips and will come back to this topic later in the week .
The Gilbert and Sullivan charade of statesmanship played out by George W. Bush and his enabler , Condoleezza Rice , as they wander the Middle East is a fitting end to seven years of misrule .
Despots stripped of power are transformed from monsters into buffoons .
And this is the metamorphosis that is eating away at the Bush presidency .
Bush stood in Jerusalem , uncomfortable and palpably bored .
He mouthed platitudes about a peace settlement that mocked the humanitarian crisis he aided and abetted in Gaza , the rapacious land grab by Israel in the West Bank and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The diminished George Bush , increasingly irrelevant at home and abroad , is fading into insignificance .
A year from now one half expects to see him stand up at the next president ’s inauguration and screech “ I ’m melting !
I ’m melting ! ” as he sinks into a puddle of slime .
He will return , I expect , to his ranch , where he will be able to spend the rest of his life doing the only task for which he has shown any aptitude — cutting down brush with a chain saw .
He may yet rise again to torment us with an attack on Iran , condemning more innocents to slaughter .
He and his cigar - smoking soul mate Ehud Olmert would like to go out with one more flash of mayhem and violence .
But even this will not ultimately save him .
Bush will soon be reduced to the cipher he once was , left to spend the rest of his life trying to salvage a legacy of shame and deceit .
In a just world he would be put on trial , if not by the International Criminal Court of Justice then by the U.S. Congress .
He would be forced to face up to his lies and wars of aggression .
But the moral rot that infects the nation has seeped into the bowels of the legislative as well as the executive branch .
World leaders , including those whom Bush desperately wants to intimidate , now dismiss him .
Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said a few days ago that relations with the United States are of “ no benefit to the Iranian nation .
The day such relations are of benefit , I will be the first one to approve of that . ”
Bush will have flown from Israel to Palestine to Kuwait to Bahrain to the United Arab Emirates to Saudi Arabia to Egypt in search of a legacy , one that he hopes will lift up his name in history .
But , isolated and deluded , he has yet to grasp that he and the United States are reviled and detested for our violence , arrogance and greed .
The bands played on the tarmac .
He was toasted at state dinners .
But even our allies , including Kuwait and Egypt , know Bush is a danger to himself and others .
He publicly displayed his inability to connect rhetoric with reality .
He promised peace and cooperation , a new era , a Palestinian homeland .
He promised solutions that will arise from negotiations that do not exist .
Negotiations , in his eyes , are always about to begin .
They were about to begin a year ago .
They were about to begin with Annapolis .
They are about to begin now .
The messy issues between the Israelis and Palestinians that he and his administration have never attempted to address — the borders , the expanding Jewish settlements and outposts , the plight of Palestinian refugees and Jerusalem — will all be seamlessly solved … one day .
But the brutal reality of the Israeli occupation barrels forward .
The Jewish settlements and outposts continue to be expanded .
The crisis in Gaza , with the cuts in fuel and electricity , the deadly army incursions and airstrikes , has turned the world ’s largest walled prison into a swamp of human misery .
And huge new settlements , like Har Homa , continue to rise up on Palestinian soil .
When Bush met with the Palestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah he blithely defended the patchwork of Israeli roadblocks that have turned the West Bank into a series of ringed Palestinian ghettos .
The roadblocks , he told Abbas , are necessary for Israeli security .
He announced that the 1949 Green Line , the borders established by the United Nations , would never be restored .
There would be no discussion , he said , of the status of Jerusalem .
And the plight of Palestinian refugees would be solved by setting up an international fund , meaning , of course , that none would ever return .
In short , he offered an unequivocal endorsement of right - wing Israeli policy with not a murmur of dissent .
And the Palestinians can either have it rammed down their throat or rot .
Bush will be back , he has promised , in May to celebrate the 60th anniversary of the founding of the Jewish state .
Olmert , no doubt , will again be fulsome in his praise , which is probably what Bush ’s trip to the Middle East is , at its core , really about .
Bush desperately wants someone to pretend with him that he is an agent for peace and statesmanship .
Olmert , who knows the callow American leader will give him everything he desires , is happy to oblige .
But as Bush basks in the glow of his own fantasy , the suffering in Gaza , one of the world ’s worst humanitarian disasters , along with the savage occupation of Iraq , continues to fuel widespread anger and rage .
Bush has spent his time in office bolstering the Middle East ’s most despotic regimes , including that of Gen. Hosni Mubarak in Egypt .
He approved a $ 20 - billion arms package for these states .
He has backed efforts to crush mainstream Islamic groups that have electoral legitimacy and popular support .
He has stood by as these regimes have stifled democratic dissent , and he has , with Israeli encouragement , isolated governments , even friendly governments , in the Middle East that raised feeble protests .
But his day is past .
There is open revolt .
Opinion polls show that two - thirds of Palestinians , and three - fourths of Israelis , do not believe Bush can affect events in the Palestinian territories .
The agenda of the Bush White House is exposed as irrelevant , myopic and counterproductive .
Most Arab countries are in open defiance of Washington and are actively reaching out to Iran .
“ As long as they [ Iran ] have no nuclear program … why should we isolate Iran ?
Why punish Iran now ? ” Arab League Secretary - General Abu Moussa told The Washington Post .
The chief of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohamed ElBaradei , is in Iran for talks .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad attended December ’s Gulf Cooperation Council summit .
The Iranian president attended the just - completed hajj in Mecca at the invitation of the Saudi monarch , King Abdullah .
Tehran is exploring the resumption of diplomatic ties with Egypt , cut since the 1979 revolution , and has offered to cooperate with Cairo in the production of nuclear energy .
And the Syrian and Lebanese governments have ignored Washington ’s warnings to sever ties with Hezbollah and Hamas .
It is the end of the road for George Bush .
The world takes less and less notice of him .
He strutted and swaggered across the stage .
He bellowed and raged .
He plundered and murdered .
And now he wants to be anointed as a peacemaker .
His presidency , like his life , has been a tragic waste .
But he at least he has a life .
There are tens of thousands of mute graves in Gaza , Lebanon , Iraq and Afghanistan that stand as stark testaments to his true legacy .
If he wants to redeem his time in office he should kneel before one and ask for forgiveness .

Skeptical Republicans calling for review of Iran intel Nick Juliano
Published : Friday December 7 , 2007
del.icio.us
Print This Email This Meanwhile , pro-Israel groups fear softening approach with news of nuke abandonment Republicans who accepted with open arms the 2002 assessment of Iraq 's weapons capabilities -- which was later shown to be flawed -- that led to a US invasion of that country have suddenly grown skeptical of a newly released report on Iran that is seen as tamping down calls for military action there .
Meanwhile , Israel is warning Iran that it is still considering a military strike on the rogue regime .
" No option needs to be off the table , " Israeli deputy defense minister Matan Vilnai told Army Radio Friday , according to The Guardian .
" Several of Israel 's Iran experts say the American rethink on the threat posed by Iran had ruled out a US military strike and probably an Israeli strike too , at least for now , " reports the paper 's Jerusalem correspondent Rory McCarthy .
" However , Israel 's political hawks continue to keep the threat of action alive . "
Back in the US , legislation is expected in the Senate next week that would establish a bipartisan , political commission to examine the conclusions of this week 's National Intelligence Estimate on Iran and evaluate the raw intelligence that formed it , the Washington Post reports Friday .
" Iran is one of the greatest threats in the world today , " insisted Sen. John Ensign ( R - NV ) , days after the most - up - to - date assessment of the US intelligence committee found the country 's nuclear weapons program has been dormant since 2003 .
" Getting the intelligence right is absolutely critical , not only on Iran 's capability but its intent , " Ensign continued in an interview with the paper .
" So now there is a huge question raised , and instead of politicizing that report , let 's have a fresh set of eyes -- objective yes -- look at it . "
The GOP 's newfound skepticism towards intelligence estimates starkly contrasts the approach lawmakers took toward Iraq in late 2002 .
A National Intelligence Estimate that found -- incorrectly , it turned out -- Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear programs and possessed chemical and biological weapons .
That NIE was printed on Oct. 1 , 2002 , and it took less than two weeks for Congress to send President Bush a resolution authorizing his pending invasion of the country .
Intelligence agencies learned from their mistakes of 2002 in producing this week 's latest estimate on Iran .
But Republicans in congress , neoconservative commentators and pro-Isreal advocates are now accusing US intelligence agencies of cooking the books or politicizing intelligence .
" The summary strikes me as more of a political document as distinguished from an intelligence document , " neoconservative Norman Podhoretz , a foreign policy adviser to Rudy Giuliani 's presidential campaign and vocal proponent of bombing Iran , told the Post .
Meanwhile , American Jewish organizations are scrambling to modify their message on Iran now that intelligence analysts believe it does not have an active nuclear program .
While acknowledging the new intelligence estimates , Jewish and pro-Israel groups should " continue explaining in an intelligent way why a nuclear Iran would be dangerous , " Malcolm Hoenliein , executive vice president of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish Organizations told the group 's members in a conference call this week , according to The Jewish Daily Forward .
Leading politicians in Israel -- which believes Iran would launch an attack on it if Tehran acquires nuclear weapons -- have gone further in questioning the NIE 's findings .
It is in total contradiction to what we know , and it is in many ways self - contradictory , because it claims the nuclear program stopped but that uranium enrichment continues to this day ,  Ephraim Sneh , a Labor Party stalwart and member of the Knesset intelligence committee , told reporters , according to the Forward .
 Uranium enrichment is the key , so what exactly did they stop in 2003 ?
Do these analysts buy the argument that Iran needs nuclear facilities to produce energy ?
Do they believe [ Iranian President Mahmoud ] Ahmadinejad ? 
ALBANY , N.Y.  New York Lt. Gov. David Paterson wo n't officially take the oath of office as the state 's new governor until Monday , but he made it clear Thursday that he 's started the transition process .
Paterson will succeed Gov. Eliot Spitzer , who resigned Wednesday amid a sex scandal .
The lieutenant governor met with leaders and received updates on the state budget process .
Patterson , 53 , told a packed room of reporters at the state Capitol , " It is time to get back to the business of the state . "
" I promised the governor yesterday that I would commit myself to the people of this great state , " he said , " that we would have stability and continuity in those challenges that lie ahead .
Now we have to get New York back on track . "
Paterson will officially be sworn in at 1 p.m. Monday .
" I am prepared , " he said .
On policy issues , Paterson generally backed several initiatives laid out by Spitzer during his 14 months in office .
He said he would not support an income tax increase on people making more than $ 1 million a year , as proposed by Assembly Democrats .
He said he would consider a property tax cap being explored by a commission Spitzer established .
Paterson said he was committed to a $ 1 billion upstate economic development fund .
The lieutenant governor said he wanted the five - day transition to get up to speed on state business .
" There may be a five - day transition period , but we are hard at work at this moment putting together a budget that will help New York to thrive , " he said .
Paterson , a Democrat from Harlem , will become New York 's first African - American governor and the nation 's first legally blind chief executive .
He admitted that his ascension comes " not the way most people would want . "
Paterson lightened the mood with his wit and sense of humor .
He joked , " On Monday at 1 p.m. , I will have the oath of office administered to me in the Assembly chamber .
" Most of you are invited . "
Paterson received a national security briefing Thursday morning , allowing him to receive confidential security details in the case of an emergency .
He said he plans to meet with leaders around the state in the next few days .
Earlier in the day , Paterson said he had a feeling of " guilt " over the way he became the state 's first African - American governor .
Yet , he said , maybe he can serve as an inspiration for other people of color and those with disabilities .
" There were many African - Americans , men and women , who throughout the past couple of centuries , had the ability , worked hard enough , had the acumen to run the state but because of the most petty and most banal aspects of human existence were n't afforded the opportunity , " he said on an Albany radio show .
" While it 's a personal achievement for me , it says that we are moving in the right direction , " he said , " but who knows what we could have accomplished if we had gotten there sooner . "
Former Republican governor George Pataki said he has confidence in Paterson .
" He knows state government , and he knows it not just from the executive branch as lieutenant governor , but the legislative branch from his years of service in the Senate , " Pataki said .
" As governor you have executive power and there are things you can do with that executive power , but if want to change anything legislative , you need to have both houses .
I think Gov. Paterson understands that . "
A ban on the sale of cigarettes to anyone who does not pay for a government smoking permit has been proposed by Health England , a ministerial advisory board .
The idea is the brainchild of the board 's chairman , Julian Le Grand , who is a professor at the London School of Economics and was Tony Blair 's senior health adviser .
In a paper being studied by Lord Darzi , the health minister appointed to oversee NHS reform , he says many smokers would be helped to break the habit if they had to make a decision whether to " opt in " .
The permit might cost as little as £ 10 , but acquiring it could be made difficult if the forms were sufficiently complex , Le Grand said last night .
His paper says : " Suppose every individual who wanted to buy tobacco had to purchase a permit .
And suppose further they had to do this every year .
To get a permit would involve filling out a form and supplying a photograph , as well as paying the fee .
Permits would only be issued to those over 18 and evidence of age would have to be provided .
The money raised would go to the NHS . "
Le Grand said the proposal was an example of " libertarian paternalism " .
The government would leave people free to make their own decisions but it would " nudge them " in the right direction .
He said there was a parallel in pensions law .
If workers were automatically enrolled in a pension scheme , few would choose to opt out .
But if they had to make a conscious decision to opt in , most people would stay out .
" Breaking the new year 's resolution not to smoke would be costly in terms of both money and time ... [ This ] would probably have a greater impact on poor smokers than on rich ones , hence contributing to a reduction in health inequalities . "
The paper , written by Le Grand and Divya Srivastava , an LSE researcher , acknowledges : " Administratively it would require addressing the problem of the existing black markets and smuggling in tobacco ; but this should probably be done anyway . "
They add : " Politically , this might be viewed by some as giving people a ' licence ' to smoke ; and by full - blooded libertarians as a subtle and hence even more dangerous form of paternalism - paternalism squared .
" On the other hand , the popularity even among smokers of the smoking ban in public places suggests that firm actions in this area can lead to political as well as health pay - offs . "
The paper also proposes incentives for large companies to provide a daily " exercise hour " for employees and a ban on salt in processed food .
A Department of Health spokeswoman said last night : " We will be consulting later this year on the next steps for tobacco control .
Ministers are looking for input from a full range of stakeholders . "

PASSAU , Germany , March 26 , 2008  --
Celebrity polar bear Knut is making headlines again , this time not for being cute and cuddly but rather for an apparent human fixation .
" Knut needs to leave Berlin Zoo , the sooner the better .
He 's had so much contact with humans in his young life that he does n't realize he 's a polar bear , he needs to get used to a life without the people who brought him up , " one of his keepers , Markus Roebke , told German tabloid Bild Zeitung .
According Roebke , who helped hand - rear Knut in the Berlin Zoo , Knut is a " publicity - addicted psycho " who needs the show , the human adulation .
" He actually cries out or whimpers if he sees that there is no audience outside his compound ready to ' ooh ' and ' aah ' at him , " Roebke said in the Tuesday edition of Bild Zeitung .
" When the zoo had to shut because of black ice everywhere he howled with rage until staff members stood before him and calmed him down . "
But the veterinarian charge with the polar bear 's upkeep contradicts Roebke 's dire appraisal .
" Not so , " Andre Schuele , the zoo 's vet in charge of Knut , told ABC News in a telephone interview about Roebke 's comments .
" I can't confirm that at all .
Knut is making very good progress , he 's growing up just fine , he 's a very healthy animal , and everything is really normal . "
Knut , now 15 months old , was rejected by his mother after he was born in December 2006 , prompting some animal activists to say it was better for him to die than to be hand reared .
Zoo officials decided instead to bring him up , and the cuddly cub has become the darling of the Berliners and a major attraction , pulling in some $ 10 million in revenue so far .
Lonely Without Keepers
His keepers began the difficult task of weaning him a few months ago , when he became simply too big and too dangerous to have contact with them .
The human keepers were forbidden to play with him for their own safety , and the celebrity bear has been finding it extremely hard to cope ever since .
According to Roebke , Knut has been howling plaintively " whenever he picks up his handler 's scent .
Because he 's been so much in contact with his main handler , Mr. Doerflein , he will always regard him as his father "
Animal protection activists challenging Schuele 's claim of Knut 's " normality . "
" We are observing Knut 's situation with concern , " said Steffen Boys , spokesman for the animal protection association Deutscher Tierschutzbund .
" What 's happening now was to be expected .
A cuddly polar bear cub makes for a great marketing tool , which helps zoos to make a lot of money , but that has nothing to do with responsible , ethical treatment of animals .
It 's really sad that people do n't realize that polar bears do not belong in a zoo but rather need the natural habitat to live a good life . "
But Schuele insists that Knut will have a good life .
" He weighs only 150 kilograms and he 's simply not grown up yet , " he said .
" But we 're talking to other zoos already preparing for his move , for when he 'll be old enough and strong enough to mate with some young female polar bears at another zoo . "
Some amusement parks use fantasy as theme ; others go for adventure .
And others still , like the Danish amusement park Bon Bon Land , use the crassest visual gags possible .
The concept of the park is that a candy maker creates his confections involving animals and objects , and these characters populate the nasty little world .
One of the most popular rides is the " Hundeprutterutchebane " , which translate to Dog - Fart - Coaster .

The shitting dog the riders encircle is Henry Hound .
He 's always letting out some embarrassing gas and feeling embarrassed .
Henry , you 're so loveable , if only there were a way to interact with you .
And luckily for us there is , because at one turn of the coaster 's track , riders are treated to being farted all over by Henry .
Using speakers and the latest advancements in fart replication everyone leaves happy , assuming " everyone " is a mental defective .
But the fun , and toilet humor , does n't stop there .
Hop on the crazy Turtle .
Or ride the carousel featuring these cute characters .
Yes , it seems everywhere you look something is about to throw up , in the act of throwing up or exposing itself .
Uh oh Mr. Seagull , is there something you 'd like to add to the depravity ?

You rascal , shitting into the alligator 's mouth , a clever ruse indeed .
The trip is n't one you 'll soon forget , no matter how tight you close your eyes while damning the images burned into your memory .
Watch these tourists visit to Bon Bon Land and enjoy the sights ( cow titties ) and sounds ( dog farts ) .
Keep an eye out for the exciting " self operated " rides .
Exciting because you could die !
Amusement parks need to always meet one goal , make the customer happy .
If the Danish people consider topless cattle and huge piles of dog shit fun , then they better be the biggest tits and tightest - wound shit piles possible .
Excellence is all a customer can demand , and that 's what Bon Bon Land delivers .
Tacky , vulgar excellence .

By Mark O’Neill
On Sunday evening , I received the most nerve - wracking instant message of my life , even though I knew right from the start that it was a fake .
I decided to write this article in case you get hit by this online scam too .
Being computer - based creatures , I figured some of the GAS readership were high risk targets .
When it happened , I was sitting where I always sit – in front of the computer , chatting via IM , and researching some possible blog stories .
It was then that a new IM window popped up with the following message :
I am hitman .
I been paid lot of money to kill you by good friend of yours .
They waiting f0r your funerael announcement .
What I want too know is how much youre life is worth ?
Now I would be lying if I said that by this point my heart was n’t threatening to explode and my hands were n’t shaking .
But I knew that this was what the FBI was warning everyone not to fall for so I decided to call this joker ’s bluff .
I was first tempted to correct his grammar ( I AM a writer after all ) but I decided to get right to it .
Me : Maybe I should be phoning Interpol and passing on my chat logs to them ?
Last time I checked , death threats were a serious crime .
Him :
They ca n’t help you .
I kill you first .
One shot to head .
Police come to your funerael .
OK , it was time to see how good an assassin he really was .
I ’ve read Day of the Jackal .
I ’ve seen the movie , where De Gaulle almost gets it .
I know what assassins do .
Let ’s see if this 15 year old in Nigeria with bad acne even knows what end of the gun the bullet comes out of .
Me : So I guess having read Day of the Jackal from cover to cover , you ’ve done your homework on me then ?
Him : ??????
Me : Fake ID , hair colouring , false teeth , or maybe even a sex change …..
Him : $ 40,000 to cancel contract on you .
Deal ?
OR DO YOU DIE ?
Me : Only $ 40,000 ?
Man , I ’m insulted .
Am I only worth $ 40,000 ?
Him :
You want to pay more ?
You very rich ?
OK then !!!!!!
$ 60,000 !!!!!
Or I KILL YOU .
Me : I ’m feeling generous .
Let ’s make it a nice round $ 100,000 .
But first you have to answer two questions .
Get them all right and you get your cash .
Look upon it as a game show .
You do have game shows in Nigeria do n’t you ?
Him :
What you want to know ?
Me : OK , let ’s go .
Question one .
Where do I live ?
If you are going to kill me , you have to know where I am .
I want you to tell me my full address including street , house number , city , region and country .
< no answer .
I waited for close to 3 minutes . >
Me : Question two .
What do I look like ?
I want hair colour , height , body weight , age , nationality and any distinguishing features .
I mean , as a serious assassin , concerned with your international professional reputation , you do n’t want to kill the wrong guy now do you ?
Him : LISTEN YOU BASTARD .
YOU PAY ME MY F** KING MONEY OR I KILL YOU WITH ONE BULLET TO THE HEAD ?
DO YOU PAY ME OR NOT ??!!
THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE !!!
Me : Sorry , that was the wrong answer .
Thank you for playing “ Spot the Fake Assassin ” .
You go back home empty - handed .
Goodbye ”
Then I blocked him from my IM client .
Now a lot of people have since criticised me for being so cavalier with him , saying that he could have been truly dangerous and that he may very well know where I live , that I may have pissed him off so much that he will now Definitely come after me .
Indeed , some have told me that my best course of action would have been to block him without saying a word , others have told me to contact the police immediately .
Personally I am inclined to ignore it and enjoy the laugh I had .
My mind automatically files these idiots away with viagra offers and male organ enhancement sales pitches .
Offering to cancel ficticious contracts on your life is just another way to extort money out of you and if you do n’t give in to it , they ’ll soon move on to the next scam .
These brainless oafs only stick with what works .
What do you think ?
If this joker had contacted you , what would you have done ?
Would you have contacted the police ?
Would you have blocked him from your IM ?
Or would you have had some fun with him , like I did ?
Have you been a victim of a scam like this , or do you know someone who has ?
For decades , it has been generally accepted that the My Lai massacre of as many as 400 Vietnamese civilians by U.S. Army troops on Mar. 16 , 1968 was a violation of official policy directives on the treatment of civilians in South Vietnam .
That was the conclusion reached in the most definitive official account of why My Lai happened  the final report by Gen.
William Peers , who investigated the question of responsibility for the massacre in late 1969 and early 1970 for the Department of the Army and the Army Chief of Staff .
Documentary evidence from U.S. army archives shows , however , that the Peers report misrepresented a key directive from the top commander in Vietnam , Gen. William C. Westmoreland , describing it as calling for a blanket policy of humane treatment of civilians in villages controlled by the Communist movement .
The directive in question , a copy of which has been obtained by IPS , makes it clear that the policy of humane treatment did not extend to civilians in areas which had been under long - term Communist rule , as was the case with My Lai .
That revelation would have placed the responsibility for the orders on the My Lai operation squarely on Westmoreland s shoulders .
The Peers report found that the troops who entered My Lai and three other hamlets of the village of Son My had been led to believe that everyone in the village should be killed .
Testimony before the Peers inquiry also showed that the platoon leaders involved in the operation had been given that same message by two company commanders .
The report concluded that the Task Force commander responsible for the operation , Col. Frank Barker , had failed to " make clear any distinctions between combatants and noncombatants in their orders and instructions . "
The result , it stated , was that he had " conveyed an understanding that only the enemy remained " in My Lai .
The report asserted , however , that there was no higher command responsibility for what happened in My Lai .
It concluded that the policy guidance from Gen. William Westmoreland , the commander of all U.S. forces in Vietnam , was " consistent in adhering to the humane standard of protecting the civilians within the combat zone . "
The most important document cited by the Peers report in support of that conclusion was Directive 525 - 3 from the Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( MACV ) , called " Combat Operations : Minimizing Noncombatant Battle Casualties . "
The Peers report said that one of the " significant points " of the directive , first issued on September 7 , 1965 and reissued in slightly revised form on Oct. 14 , 1966 , was that " Specified strike zones should be configured to exclude populated areas . "
" Specified strike zones " was the term that replaced the original term " free fire zones " created in 1965 to refer to zones where air strikes and artillery fire could be used freely with the approval of the province chief  approval which was routinely given to U.S. forces .
That description of a key point in the directive , which avoided direct quotation from the document , made it appear that the noncombatant population was to be protected from indiscriminate U.S. firepower in all Viet Cong hamlets .
The report stated without any qualification that " specified strike zones " were " usually free of any known populace . "
But the actual text of Directive 525 - 3 , a copy of which was obtained from the U.S. Army Military History Institute in Carlisle Barracks , Pennsylvania , makes it clear that the intention of Westmoreland and the U.S. military command in regard to hamlets like My Lai was exactly the opposite .
The five - page directive was explicit about its concern with minimizing such casualties in contested areas , where the population had not been under long - term Communist influence .
As the directive explained , " The use of unnecessary force leading to noncombatant battle casualties in areas temporarily controlled by the VC [ Viet Cong ] will embitter the population , drive them into the arms of the VC , and make the long - range pacification more difficult and more costly . "
But the directive made it clear that this motivation for humane treatment of civilians did not apply to those who had been under long - term Communist rule .
A key point in the directive said , " Specified strike zones should be configured to exclude populated areas , except those in accepted VC bases . "
The term " accepted VC bases " referred to large parts of South Vietnam , including Son My village and most of Quang Ngai province , where the Viet Minh movement had mobilized the population to fight against the French and where the Communist movement had strong organizations throughout the Diem regime and in the early years of the U.S. war in Vietnam .
The directive thus made it clear the U.S. military command ’s policy was to consider the civilian population in long - term Communist base areas as the enemy which could be subjected to the same treatment as Communist military personnel .
The Peers report description  which avoided quoting directly from the document  effectively covered up the actual intention of the command ’s policy toward noncombatants in places like My Lai .
Directive 525 - 3 is not the only piece of evidence pointing to a military command policy of treating noncombatants in Viet Cong base areas as subject to indiscriminate violence .
In his own memoirs published in 1976 , General Westmoreland himself wrote that , once the " free fire zones " were established , " anybody who remained had to be considered an enemy combatant , " and operations in those areas " could be conducted without fear of civilian casualties . "
Westmoreland was even more explicit in a visit to a unit of the 101st Airborne Division called the Tiger Force in Quang Ngai province in 1967 .
As recounted by members of the Tiger Force who were present , and reported by Pulitzer Prize - winning Toledo Blade journalists Michael Sallah and Mitch Weiss , Westmoreland told them , " [ I ] f there are people who are out there  and not in the camps  they ’re pink as far as we ’re concerned .
They ’re Communist sympathizers .
They were not supposed to be there . "
That message gave the Tiger Force officers the idea that they were authorized to kill anyone who chose to remain in Viet Cong base areas .
Sallah and Weiss found that Tiger Force had carried out no fewer than 19 killing sprees against civilians in " specified strike zones . "
The unit commanders justified the wanton murder of civilians to Army investigators by explaining that the creation of a free fire zone gave U.S. troops the right to " kill anything that moved . "
The Peers report recommended disciplinary action against 30 Army officers , including two generals and four colonels .
But when it came to his treatment of Westmoreland s policy directives , Gen .
Peers had a strong incentive to absolve him of any responsibility for My Lai .
James K. Walsh , Jr. , who was Special Counsel to the Peers investigation , recalled in an interview with IPS that Peers had hoped to become commander of the 8th Army in South Korea after his service in Vietnam .
That meant that he had to have the support of the Gen .
Westmoreland , who had become the Army Chief of Staff in 1968 and thus was in a position to determine whether he would get the choice assignment he wanted .
Unfortunately for Peers , Westmoreland was replaced as Chief of Staff by Creighton B. Abrams in June 1972 , and Abrams was openly hostile to the whole Peers investigation , according to Walsh .
Peers never got the 8th Army command and chose early retirement .

Some recycling ends up in landfill sites
Shocking new figures reveal that while some householders face stiff fines for breaching recycling laws , many councils are simply dumping huge quantities of the paper , glass and plastic they collect . [ > [>
In some areas one item in every eight put out for recycling ends up being sent for landfill or incinerated . [ > [>
Local authorities last night blamed residents for putting the wrong rubbish in the wrong bin or failing to clean the material they try to recycle . [>
[>
If recycling is “ contaminated ” , the bags are simply dumped anyway . [> [>
Critics said the revelations made a mockery of Gordon Brown ’s attempts to be seen as a green crusader with the recycling drive and his plans to phase out free plastic bags . [ > [>
Shadow Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles said : “ I think families across the country will be shocked to learn that the cans and bottles they dutifully put out for recycling are being secretly dumped . [ >
[> “ Most people want to do their bit but this sort of thing undermines confidence .
It also raises real questions about the Government ’s Big Brother approach over fines and bin taxes . ” [ > [>
The figures showed that 240,000 tons of material put out for recycling last year ended up being dumped or burned . [>
[>
This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg as almost half of all councils did not release figures , including major authorities such as Birmingham , Bradford , Hull and Warwickshire . [ > [>
In Worcestershire , 14,509 tons were dumped – equivalent to more than one eighth of the 110,459 tons put out for recycling . [> [>
Similar amounts were dumped by Tynedale and Wansbeck councils in the North - east and Kings Lynn council in Norfolk . [ >
[> Derek Prodger , member for the environment at Worcestershire County Council , said large loads of recycling could be written off by a small element of “ contamination ” . [> [>
He said it was not cost effective for the council ’s waste contractor Severn Trent to clean up contaminated loads .
“ If any part of the load has contamination in it , then you lose the whole load .
That is a worry for us , ” he said . [>
[> “ We have to have a better system but it has to start with the householder .
If people are not careful how they recycle , then this is the result . ” [ > [>
Mr Prodger said the county ’s recycling record remained one of the best in the country , with more than 30 per cent of waste recycled . [>
Homes Worth Less Than Their Mortgages Eight million Americans must deal with this mortgage nightmare .
Feb. 22 , 2008  --
It 's a real estate reality facing millions of Americans .
Their homes are now worth less than what they owe on them .
Mark Zandi , chief economist of Moody's Economy.com , said , " The last time we saw so many homeowners with so many home values that were worth less than the amount of mortgage they owed was back in the Great Depression . "
Economists believe nearly 8.8 million Americans are now saddled with homes worth less than their mortgages .
Chere Ferraiulo is among them .
She , her husband and three teenage children live in Littleton , Colo. , on a street where inside home after home live homeowners facing the same disturbing scenario .
When the Ferraiulos took out a new mortgage on their home in 2005 , it was worth $ 244,000 .
Just three years later , theirs is a much different story .
" I think I 've lost $ 25,000 to $ 30,000 dollars , if not more , " Chere Ferraiulo said .
They 've begged their mortgage lender to modify their loan as they try to stave off foreclosure .
Pressure in Washington to help hundreds of thousands of families is mounting , because lawmakers know home values are bound to consumer confidence and spending .
But with homes worth less than what people owe , how can they spend elsewhere ?
The lenders and banks could voluntarily refinance mortgages , but the banks would take a major hit .
The lenders could sell the mortgages to the federal government , which could then refinance those mortgages with fixed rate federal loans .
Again , the lenders would take a major loss .
" We have to reduce the mortgage amount that 's owed by the borrower , " Zandi said .
" Under the current terms , the borrower is n't going to make it . "
In Christine Canavan 's case , it was she and her husband who took that loss .
Canavan remarked , " We actually had to come to the table with about $ 20,000 . "
They wanted out of their adjustable rate mortgage to avoid foreclosure .
Even as they hammered out details on a new fixed rate mortgage , they watched their home value drop .
" While we were waiting for our rate to lock in , the home was dropping day by day by day , " Canavan said .
" It just kept dropping . "
In just two weeks ' time , the value of her home dropped from $ 250,000 to $ 220,000 in value .
The Canavans are just hoping , like millions of others , that the market will recover .
But those same economists we talked with today say this 10 percent figure -- the 8 million people who are paying more than their home is worth -- is only going to rise .
Jobs have been cut in many industries
Employers cut 17,000 jobs from their payrolls in January , Labor Department figures showed .
Economists had been expecting a rise of 80,000 .
The US economy has slowed sharply in recent months as a housing market slump has dented consumer spending .
US interest rates have been cut twice in nine days to boost growth .
" Serious signs "
In a speech in Kansas on Friday , President George Bush acknowledged that the US economy was going through a rough patch and urged lawmakers in Washington to pass an economic stimulus package .
" Inflation 's low .
Productivity 's high , but there are certainly some troubling signs , serious signs that the economy is weakening and that we 've got to do something about it , " Mr Bush said .
US Congress and the Bush Administration have agreed an economic stimulus package which would add $ 150 bn in tax rebates .
The measure has already been passed by the House of Representatives but is still awaiting Senate approval .
Recession mode
The job losses were across all sectors of the economy including manufacturing and professional services .
" The economy is in recession mode , " said Peter Morici , an economist at the University of Maryland .
The unemployment rate fell to 4.9 % from 5 % in December , a two - year high , but overall the number of people in the labour force declined .
We should expect to see more bad news on the labour market
Nigel Gault , Global Insight
The Federal Reserve cut interest rates to 3 % from 3.5 % on Wednesday .
It followed an emergency unscheduled cut last week , when the Fed slashed the cost of borrowing by the largest amount in 25 years to prevent the economy from slowing further .
" We should expect to see more bad news on the labour market , at least through the middle of the year , before the heavy doses of monetary and fiscal stimulus begin to kick in , " said Nigel Gault , an economist at Global Insight .
10 ways to raise a green baby
Photo credit : paul goyette
Being eco-friendly is not just about saving the planet , it ’s about creating a healthy environment for yourself and your children .
Having a baby is a great time to start over and as a time of new beginnings , the perfect time to bring some positive green steps into your lives .
1. Breastfeed for as long as possible
Breast milk is the most eco-friendly way to feed your baby .
There are no additives , and no packaging .
Breast milk is perfectly formulated by nature to give your baby the best start in life , protecting her against allergies and illnesses and providing the right nutrients at the right time .
To protect your clothes from leaky breasts in the early days of breastfeeding , opt for washable breast pads .
They ’re just as effective as disposable ones , but far more environmentally friendly .
If you absolutely cannot breastfeed your baby , consider buying glass bottles rather than plastic to avoid potentially harmful substances leaching from the plastic into the milk that you feed your baby .
2. Eat organic
Choosing organic produce is the best way to avoid chemicals , pesticides and GM foods .
Eat organic yourself to keep your breast milk free of these substances , and when you wean your baby , be sure to buy organic for her too .
Get yourself a baby cookbook like the Organic Baby & Toddler Cookbook and make your own baby food with locally grown organic produce .
3 . Choose reusable nappies
Fabric nappies are getting more and more popular with parents who are concerned about our environment .
There are so many options available , some with poppers , some with Velcro , and you can choose from washable all - in - ones or prefolds which involve a fabric lining with a waterproof outer cover .
They ’re easy to machine wash , or you can use a nappy service .
If you have decided that reusable nappies are not for you , then consider opting for greener disposables like Moltex or Bambo .
4 . Go for organic natural fibres
These days the choice is not just between synthetic and natural fibres , you can also choose organic baby clothes to further minimise your baby ’s exposure to pesticides and chemicals , and to protect the environment and the workers who manufacture the products too .
Natural fibres last longer , so offer used clothes to friends with younger children , or save them for your next child if you are planning to have any more .
5. Clean green
Choose natural shampoos , creams and toiletries for your baby and all the family .
Look for products that contain no artificial fragrances and colours , mineral oils , parabens and SLS .
Green products are kinder to your baby ’s skin , kinder to the environment , and are usually not tested on animals .
6. Avoid pollution hazards
There ’s pollution everywhere and it is impossible to protect your baby from it completely , but you can make an effort to minimise exposure .
Instead of pushing your baby around in a pushchair right down with the exhaust fumes , carry her in a sling to keep her up and out of harms way .
7 . Give up smoking
Subjecting your baby to second - hand smoke will put him at a higher risk of getting respiratory illnesses and allergies .
And if you are breastfeeding you ’ll be getting him addicted to nicotine too .
Giving up smoking will be one of the most precious gifts that you can give your baby .
8. Reduce , reuse , recycle
Recycling is simple these days with councils making doorstep collections , and all you need to do is get organised enough to store your recycling between collections .
If you are n’t provided with a wheelie bin by your local authority , pick yourself up some recycling sorters and teach your children how to recycle from a young age .
With children , there are lots of opportunities to reuse too , use cereal and egg boxes for craft projects , and yoghurt pots for painting .
9 . Choose eco-friendly toys
Cut down on plastic making its way to landfill by limiting plastic toys and instead choosing more environmentally sound wooden toys for your child .
Toys made of wood and other natural and sustainable materials like cotton and wool are also chemical and toxin free and so better for your baby than plastics that contain PVC and other chemicals .
Other household objects make great toys too , like cardboard boxes , pots and pans , wooden spoons and sieves .
10 .
Be a good example
Walk the walk and your child will follow in your footsteps .
Here are some ideas for inspiring your child to care for our planet :
Choose reusable , recycled and biodegradable products wherever possible .
Do n’t waste paper .
Bring home used paper from work for children to draw on the back of , and use both sides of paper yourself .
Give you child ’s unwanted clothes to a friend with younger children or to charity .
Refuse unnecessary packaging in shops , and shop with your own shopping bags to avoid plastic bags .
Donate your unwanted furniture to charity , or get rid of unwanted items on Freecycle .
Only buy what you need , and always recycle what you can .

Stealthy surveillance robots designed for police , military David Edwards and Chris Tackett
Published : Friday March 28 , 2008

Print This Email This With rising casualties in Iraq and Afghanistan and violations of privacy in the United States and abroad being popular discussion topics , advances in military robotics and spy technology have also become a popular topic of news coverage .
One video that has received a great deal of press coverage and been seen at least three million times in recent days is of a new robot called " Big Dog " that was designed by Boston Dynamics .
The robot , which has four legs and a remarkable ability to keep its balance - even when kicked hard by a human , as demonstrated in its popular internet video debut - is meant to be a " pack mule " and carry large loads for the military .
Because of the interesting way it moves , the video demonstration , which shows it walking up steep , snow - covered terrain , has been a viral video phenomenon , even sparking one business to use it as a source for their marketing efforts ..
Good Morning America featured another one of these new robots .
The " StickyBot " is a robot inspired by the gecko lizard that uses dry adhesive ' hands ' to grip smooth surfaces , such as a window , allowing it to scale buildings or other objects .
The machine , which was designed by Stanford University on behalf of the Pentagon , could be used for search and rescue missions , intelligence gathering , or other uses .
Another robot that advances spy tech is the " RoboSwift " , a bird - like flying robot that includes a video camera for aerial spying .
Below is a video from Reuters of the " RoboSwift " in action .
With its ' morphing ' wings that allow it to make fast turns , it is one of the most - advanced birdlike robots .
Other flying spy machines made news , when it was reported that tiny , dragonfly - like machines were seen flying among anti-war protesters in Washington , DC .
Earlier this week it was reported that the Miami - Dade Police Department is seeking approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to use a pilotless drone to help fight crime , according to Reuters .
Videos of the " Big Dog " robot can be seen here .
Investors fuel gasoline price increase
Drivers , open your wallets .
Gasoline prices , driven higher by a runaway bull market for crude oil , stand poised to smash records throughout the Bay Area in the next week and could reach $ 4 a gallon this summer .
Santa Rosa set a record Friday - regular gasoline sold in the city averaged $ 3.45 per gallon .
San Francisco is just 3 cents shy of its record of $ 3.63 , while San Jose is 2 cents short of topping its $ 3.50 record set in May .
In much of the area , prices are climbing more than 2 cents every day .
Never mind that fuel usually is less pricey this time of year .
Twelve months ago , San Francisco drivers were paying $ 3.03 on average for a gallon of regular , according to the AAA automotive service .
Two years ago , the price was less than $ 2.50 .
" I grew up with a love affair with the automobile - now it 's gone , " said Mallory Gaston , 37 , of Oakland as he filled up his Nissan Pathfinder on Friday for $ 3.66 per gallon in San Francisco .
" I will ride my bike if I have to . "
To reach record heights so early in the year is a bad omen .
Last year 's astonishing run-up in prices nationwide did n't hit its peak until May , a time of year when Americans typically buy more gasoline than they do in March .
If early spring can bring such high prices , summer could easily bring $ 4 gas .
" It may not be the whole state , but there are going to be pockets of $ 4 , " said Denton Cinquegrana , who tracks West Coast gasoline markets for the Oil Price Information Service .
Blame the bulls on the New York Mercantile Exchange , where contracts to buy oil are traded .
The most commonly watched price of crude oil sold on the exchange jumped 11 percent in the past month to close Friday at $ 101.72 per barrel .
It set a nominal record of $ 102.59 on Thursday .
Adjusted for inflation , oil prices have soared this high just once before - in 1981 , during the Iran - Iraq war .
Many oil market analysts consider the current prices overblown .
Speculative traders , they say , have ignored economic trends that should be pushing prices lower , not higher .
Most importantly , the slowing economy has helped cut gasoline sales , meaning the country has ample supplies of gas and crude oil .
Oil as investment
But the bulls are n't focusing on that .
Instead , they 're keeping their eyes on long - term growth in demand in China and India .
And they 're viewing oil strictly as an investment vehicle , not as a fuel .
" Just like every other commodity , it 's seen as a hedge against inflation , " said Amanda Kurzendoerfer , a commodity analyst for the Summit Energy consulting firm in Louisville , Ky .
" There 's a sense that oil is a perpetually bullish commodity in the long term . "
For every gallon of gas that Californians buy , about $ 2.35 now goes to cover the cost of the crude oil that refineries buy and process into fuel .
A month ago , it was $ 2.13 per gallon , according to the California Energy Commission .
Retail gasoline prices have surged faster in California than they have elsewhere in the nation .
The national average has risen about 6 percent in the past month to reach $ 3.16 per gallon .
California 's average is up 9.6 percent , hitting $ 3.44 on Friday .
That puzzles many analysts .
California uses its own pollution - fighting blend of gasoline made only at a limited number of refineries , and the state 's drivers typically pay about 25 cents more per gallon than do other Americans .
But the state now has plenty of gasoline in stock .
" The increase we 've seen in gas prices would generally be what you 'd expect given how much oil has gone up , " said Sean Comey , spokesman for AAA of Northern California .
" But it seemed to happen more quickly than the typical time it usually takes . "
The role of crude oil costs in the current gasoline price increase makes this run-up fundamentally different from last year's .
Oddly enough , that difference offers some hope to cash - strapped commuters .
Last year 's record - setting price spike was driven not by crude oil prices but by mechanical failures at gasoline refineries throughout the country .
Production fell , and profit margins at healthy refineries soared .
The average gasoline price nationwide jumped more than $ 1 per gallon , peaking at $ 3.23 in late May .
California 's average reached $ 3.49 , an all - time record .
But so far this year , production has n't been an issue .
Gas sales decreasing
Last week , California 's refineries produced 2.3 percent more gasoline than they did during the same week of 2007 , according to the California Energy Commission .
The state 's overall supplies of gasoline are almost a third higher than they were a year ago .
The country 's supplies are the highest they 've been in 14 years .
If oil prices this spring hold steady just above $ 100 or fall slightly , gasoline prices should n't rise much further , at least not until demand increases in the summer .
And if the country 's economy worsens , that seasonal increase in gas sales may fizzle , possibly pushing down the price of both gasoline and crude oil .
Gasoline sales are already falling , down about 1.1 percent in the past month , according to the federal Energy Information Administration .
" The U.S. consumes about 25 percent of the global oil market , so the fact that demand is slowing down is really significant , " Kurzendoerfer said .
" The spring and the summer months , those are the strong months for gasoline demand , and if that demand is n't there , ( traders ) would begin to take a second look at this . "
Then again , if gasoline refineries suffer another round of breakdowns , gas prices could keep climbing .
Likewise , another substantial increase in oil prices - for whatever reason - could hit drivers hard .
" It 's starting to hurt , " said Irene Perez , 24 , of Richmond , filling her Chevy Cobalt on Friday .
" You have to spend more money every week .
It 's too much . "
The Gmail CAPTCHA has been cracked — albeit not easily — raising new concerns about spammers ' ability to abuse Google 's e-mail services .
Websense Security Labs pointed out the security breach late last week , noting that spammers have a lot to gain by being able to use bots to automatically sign up for new accounts .
Google 's free e-mail services and a highly - desirable gmail.com domain — one that is unlikely to be blacklisted by anybody 's spam filters — are just two of the features that induced spammers to crack the CAPTCHA and have bots do all the work .
On the upside , it apparently was n't easy — Websense says that it required two bot hosts to crack instead of just the one that recently cracked Windows Live Mail 's CAPTCHA ( Websense believes that the same group was involved with both ) .
It also believes that the two hosts are required because the first host may fail at cracking the code the first time around ( and possibly time out ) , but the second host may also be required to check the work of the first .
Additionally , only one in every five CAPTCHA - breaking requests on Gmail succeeded .
Still , a 20 percent success rate is relatively high when you consider that spambots are trying to register hundreds ( or thousands ) of e-mail addresses at a time .
Your typical CAPTCHA
The CAPTCHA test — Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart — is one we 're all familiar with .
When signing up for new services , we are often asked to decipher a series of letters and numbers embedded in an image that is supposed to be difficult for computers to read .
But , while the CAPTCHA has worked well in the past , hackers are getting better at programming computers with the ability to read them .
That 's why there has been some attention focused on creating stronger , harder - to - break CAPTCHAs .
There are , of course , audio - based ones that read something aloud and require the user to enter it back into a text box .
But there 's also a more complex image - based CAPTCHA that requires the user to select a number of similar images before proceeding .
Of course , neither of these options are perfect , as the former does n't take into account hard - of - hearing computer users , and the latter makes it all but impossible for blind users to sign up without assistance .
But for now , there are few other options to block spammers from getting through while the traditional CAPTCHA continues to be cracked .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President George W. Bush on Wednesday vowed to veto another temporary extension of a domestic spying law and pressed Congress for a long - term fix to shield phone companies that cooperated with his warrantless eavesdropping program .
President Bush walks into the Oval Office to make a statement on the Protect America Act , February 13 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Kevin Lamarque
But the House of Representatives was prepared to defy Bush and vote itself three more weeks to review a White House - backed bill passed by the Democratic - led Senate on Tuesday that would grant phone companies retroactive immunity for having aided Bush ’s anti-terrorism effort .
“ The time for debate is over , ” Bush told reporters in the Oval Office .
“ I will not accept any temporary extension . ”
Democrats who control
House said they needed up to three weeks to review and possibly offer revisions to the Senate ’s bill , which would put into law the government ’s expanded powers to track communications between terrorism suspects .
The bill would also shield telecommunication companies from potentially billions of dollars in civil damages .
About 40 civil lawsuits have been filed accusing AT&T Inc. , Verizon Communications Inc. and Sprint Nextel Corp. of violating Americans ’ privacy rights by helping the warrantless domestic spying program that Bush secretly began shortly after the September 11 attacks .
The Senate passed - bill would replace the 6 - month - old Protect America Act , set to expire on Saturday , that broadened the ability of U.S. authorities to eavesdrop on enemy targets without a court order .
It also provides new protection of civil liberties of Americans swept up in the hunt for terrorists .
Heated debate over the eavesdropping law comes in an election year in which Bush and his fellow Republicans want to use issues such as domestic spying to paint the Democrats as weak on counterterrorism and national security .
“ It is time for Congress to pass a law that provides a long - term foundation to protect our country and they must do so immediately , ” Bush said .
He repeated his warnings that enemies of the United States were plotting new attacks that would dwarf September 11 , but Democrats in Congress have insisted on better protections for Americans ’ civil liberties .
WRANGLING FOR MONTHS
The White House and Congress have been wrangling for months over whether to make permanent a program that allowed surveillance of communications between people in the United States and others overseas if one had suspected terrorist ties .
The most controversial provision in the bill approved by the Senate is retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies that agreed to participate in Bush ’s secret surveillance program .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
“ If these companies are subjected to lawsuits that could cost them billions of dollars , they wo n’t participate , they wo n’t help us , they wo n’t help protect America , ” Bush said .
Backers say the firms should be thanked , not punished , for helping protect the United States .
They also warn permitting them to be sued would make it difficult to recruit private companies in such efforts in the future .
Immunity foes argue the courts should decide if the phone companies violated the law .
The 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Act requires that the government receive the approval of a secret FISA court to conduct surveillance in the United States of suspected foreign enemy targets .
But Bush authorized warrantless surveillance of communications between people in the United States and others overseas if one had suspected ties to terrorists .
When the Larsen B Ice Shelf in Antarctica collapsed in 2002 , the event appeared to be a sudden response to climate change , and this long , fringing ice shelf in the north west part of the Weddell Sea was assumed to be the latest in a long line of victims of Antarctic summer heat waves linked to Global Warming .
However in a paper published in the Journal of Glaciology , Prof. Neil Glasser of Aberystwyth University , working as a Fulbright Scholar in the US , and Dr Ted Scambos of University of Colorado 's National Snow and Ice Data Centre now say that the shelf was already teetering on collapse before the final summer .
“ Ice shelf collapse is not as simple as we first thought , ” said Professor Glasser , lead author of the paper .
“ Because large amounts of meltwater appeared on the ice shelf just before it collapsed , we had always assumed that air temperature increases were to blame .
But our new study shows that ice - shelf break up is not controlled simply by climate .
A number of other atmospheric , oceanic and glaciological factors are involved .
For example , the location and spacing of fractures on the ice shelf such as crevasses and rifts are very important too because they determine how strong or weak the ice shelf is ” .
The study is important because ice shelf collapse contributes to global sea level rise , albeit indirectly .
“ Ice shelves themselves do not contribute directly to sea level rise because they are floating on the ocean and they already displace the same volume of water .
But when the ice shelves collapse the glaciers that feed them speed up and get thinner , so they supply more ice to the oceans , ” Prof .
Glasser explained .
Professor Glasser acknowledges that global warming had a major part to play in the collapse , but emphasises that it is only one in a number of contributory factors , and despite the dramatic nature of the break - up in 2002 , both observations by glaciologists and numerical modeling by other scientists at NASA and CPOM ( Centre of Polar Observation and Modeling ) had pointed to an ice shelf in distress for decades previously .
“ It 's likely that melting from higher ocean temperatures , or even a gradual decline in the ice mass of the Peninsula over the centuries , was pushing the Larsen to the brink ” , said co-author Ted Scambos of University of Colorado 's National Snow and Ice Data Centre .
The focus of further study is now moving to the Larsen C shelf , a much thicker and apparently more stable area , and while there are at present no signs that this shelf is likely to collapse , Professor Glasser ’s paper will play an important role in informing future study .
The keen interest expressed in the paper has also been a boost to Professor Glasser ’s hopes of raising funds to travel to Antarctica this year to conduct some of his research in the field .
WCAX — This year ’s Town Meeting Day addressed an issue far broader than the local school budget — should Vermonters call for the impeachment of the president and vice president ?
Thirty - seven towns voted yes .
A poll conducted for Channel 3 News posed the same question to 400 likely voters .
61 % said they would be in favor of Congress beginning impeachment proceedings against President Bush .
33 % opposed it , and 6 % were not sure .
The numbers for Vice President Cheney were slightly different .
64 % favor impeachment , while 31 % oppose it .
“ I ’m really overjoyed by this , ” said Jimmy Leas , a South Burlington lawyer who has been a vocal advocate of impeachment .
“ Your poll really shows that here in Vermont , nearly two - thirds of the public understand we have a serious problem , and the way to address this is to remove the officials who are usurping power . ”
“ The impeachment results are somewhat surprising , frankly , to me , ” political scientist Eric Davis said .
“ Even though their terms are ending in a little bit more than a year , a majority of Vermonters do n’t want to even see them remaining in office until January 20 , 2009 . ”

DES MOINES , Iowa ( AP ) -- Jane Hambleton has dubbed herself the " meanest mom on the planet . "
After finding alcohol in her son's car , she decided to sell the car and share her 19 - year - old 's misdeed with everyone -- by placing an ad in the local newspaper .
The ad reads : " OLDS 1999 Intrigue .
Totally uncool parents who obviously do n't love teenage son , selling his car .
Only driven for three weeks before snoopy mom who needs to get a life found booze under front seat .
$ 3,700 / offer .
Call meanest mom on the planet . "
Hambleton has heard from people besides interested buyers since recently placing the ad in The Des Moines Register .
The 48 - year - old from Fort Dodge says she has fielded more than 70 telephone calls from emergency room technicians , nurses , school counselors and even a Georgia man who wanted to congratulate her .
" The ad cost a fortune , but you know what ?
I 'm telling people what happened here , " Hambleton says .
" I 'm not just gonna put the car for resale when there 's nothing wrong with it , except the driver made a dumb decision .
" It 's overwhelming the number of calls I 've gotten from people saying ' Thank you , it 's nice to see a responsible parent . '
So far there are no calls from anyone saying , ' You 're really strict .
You 're real overboard , lady . " '
The only critic is her son , who Hambleton says is " very , very unhappy " with the ad and claims the alcohol was left by a passenger .
Hambleton believes her son but has decided mercy is n't the best policy in this case .
She says she set two rules when she bought the car at Thanksgiving :
No booze , and always keep it locked .
The car has been sold , but Hambleton says she will continue the ad for another week -- just for the feedback .

Millions of taxpayer dollars distributed to battleground congressional districts coincide with White House briefings on GOP political strategy in the run up to the three congressional elections during the Bush Administration , McClatchy 's Washington Bureau reports .
Top officials from both the Bush Commerce and Treasury Departments appeared with GOP candidates while disbursing millions in federal grants to battleground states -- soon after receiving White House political briefings enumerating White House efforts to get Republicans elected .
" Political appointees in the Treasury Department received at least 10 political briefings from July 2001 to August 2006 , officials familiar with the meetings said .
Their counterparts at the Commerce Department received at least four briefings  all in the election years of 2002 , 2004 and 2006 , " McClatchy 's Marisa Taylor and Kevin Hall write .
These briefings are being investigated by the House Oversight Committee as a possible violation of the Hatch Act , which permits political briefings but prohibits taxpayer money being used for political campaigning .
" The briefings are part of the legacy of White House political adviser Karl Rove , who announced this week that he 's stepping down at the end of the month to spend more time with his family , " McClatchy adds .
" Despite Rove 's departure , investigations into the briefings are expected to continue .
One congressional aide told the reporters the investigation was revealing " a number of remarkable coincidences " similar to how Treasury and Commerce events appeared to coincide with the strategy in the political briefings .
Committee investigators have found that White House drug czar John Walters took twenty trips on taxpayers ' dime in 2006 alone to appear with GOP congressional candidates .
Administration officials denied in the article that any Treasury and Commerce department events were intended to help Republican candidates win office .
Commerce Department spokesman Dan Nelson said the meetings were " informational " and " not a call to action . "

LAS VEGAS  F.B.I. agents on Sunday searched a home and storage space in Utah for evidence that might explain why a man believed to have been exposed to ricin had the deadly substance and what he intended to do with it .
The case of the man , Roger Von Bergendorff , 57 , who remained critically ill in a local hospital Sunday , has set off a criminal and public - health investigation spanning two states after vials of ricin , along with castor beans from which the dangerous white powder is derived , were found Thursday in his room at an Extended Stay America hotel near the Las Vegas Strip .
While the F.B.I. has said the incident had nothing to do with terrorism , Mr. Von Bergendorff ’s room at the long - term hotel also contained several guns and a book on anarchy tabbed to a page explaining how to manufacture ricin , the Las Vegas police said .
Mr. Von Bergendorff has been hospitalized since falling ill from respiratory distress on Feb. 14 .
His cousin , Thomas Tholen of Riverton , Utah , found the ricin in the hotel room when he entered on Thursday to collect Mr. Von Bergendorff ’s belongings because hotel managers had started eviction proceedings .

まず前提として述べておきますが、 私は長年GNU Maintainerをやっていることからもわかるように、 フリーソフトウェアの熱烈な支持者です。 趣味で話すときにオープンソースという言葉を使うことは、
せいぜい相手に合わせたいときだけです。 オープンソースはビジネス用語と割り切ってます。
さて、 う めだもちおは DIS ら れるべきなの ?
に私なりのコメントをしておきます。
なぜオープンソースの妙な認識を広められると困るのか。
それはもちろん本来同じオープンソースであるべきものが、
誰かが広めたおかしな定義に基づいて、 「 それはオープンソース的でない」とか、 わけのわからない批判が現れるからです。
勝手に決めた視野の狭い定義にしたがって、
オープンソースの守備範囲を狭めることは、 百害あって一利なしです。
古くは GNU Deluxe Distribution に始まり、今でも配布物に対して対価を要求することは頻繁に行われています。 これはこれで、ちゃんとビジネスとして成り立っています。
あるいは、何らかの仕事を依頼されたとします。
それでオープンソースライセンスを適用していたとします。
実際に引き渡すとき、その労働に見合う対価を要求するのは自然なことです。
「 何でも無料」症候群はビジネスに対する大きな妨げです。
ソフトウェアの対価を放棄することはフリーソフトウェアの理念に反していますから（
Selling Free Software を参照）、 当然フリーソフトウェアを普及させる口実であるオープンソースにも引き継がれています。 すべからく無償でなければならない等という誤解は開発者を圧迫するだけです。
同じことが開発方式にも当てはまります。 ESRがオープンソースに注目させるための壮大な釣り記事として書いた 伽藍とバザール のおかげで、オープンソースとバザール方式の混同が頻繁に見られるわけですが、バザール方式は必須要件では全くありません。
オープンソースならこういうこともできて、それには何らかの利点があるかもしれない、というだけのこと。
オープンソースによって可能になることや、その意義について論じていただく分には何も問題はないのですが、
だからといって、それこそがオープンソースだ、などと宣われては迷惑千万です。
可能性を減らさないでください。
オープンソースにだって理念があるはずだと思われる人もいるでしょうが、 生越さん が 自己紹介---オープンソースは何であって何でないか
で述べられているように、オープンソースはそういう類のものは極力排除するように設計されているのです。
そうでなければオープンソースなどという造語をわざわざ生み出した草案者の苦労は何だったのだろうと思いますね。
哲学について論じたいならフリーソフトウェアについて語るべきだというのが私の考えです。
閑話休題。 はるかに個人的な見解についても、ついでに書いておきます。
私は上にも書いたように、フリーソフトウェアを支持しています。
フリーソフトウェアにとって重要なことは、
当然ながら、ソフトウェアの自由です。 不特定多数のコミュニティが開発しているとか、
どっかの団体が内部だけで開発しているとか、
そんなことはどうでもいいのです。 最終的に高い品質の自由なソフトウェアを利用し、
修正し、研究することができるようになるなら、
他のことはどうだっていいのです。 状況に応じて最適な方法を選びさえすればいいだけ。
しかしながら、フリーソフトウェアはビジネス方面での受けがよくなくて、それはそれで仕方がない側面があります。
またその一方で、経験的に商業ベースの方がうまく進むタイプのソフトウェアも存在するということがよくわかっています。
こうした状況の中で、オープンソースはよい解決策になり得ると思っていました。
あくまでビジネス上の良し悪しだけに注意を限定し、それ以外のことはあえて隠蔽するのも悪くないかもしれないと思いました。
あんまりこういうことを言っていると、RMSに怒られてしまいますが。
しかし、いつの間にやらオープンソースという言葉がひとり歩きして、
変な色をつけられつつあると感じています。
これでは本末転倒、当初の目的にふさわしくなくなってしまいます。
役に立たないなら、フリーソフトウェアという言葉だけを使っていた方がよっぽどマシです。
だから、オープンソースを支持したいと思っている人は、
誤解を広めないように気を付けていただきたいのです。
オープンソースにとってプラスにはなりませんから。
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Hillary Clinton will win Democratic primary elections in Pennsylvania , Kentucky and West Virginia in the coming weeks , but rival Barack Obama will ultimately capture the party ’s presidential nomination , traders were betting on Monday .
Traders on the Dublin - based Intrade prediction market also put their bets on the Democratic party to hold new primary elections before June 30 in Michigan and Florida , where earlier results were declared invalid in a fight over the date of the elections .
But even that , the traders were betting , would n’t be enough to help Clinton win the Democratic nomination to oppose Republican John McCain in the November general election .
Intrade traders gave Obama a 75 percent chance of winning the Democratic nomination for U.S. president , versus 23.5 percent for Clinton .
Traders on the Iowa Electronic Markets , a nonprofit exchange run by the University of Iowa for research purposes , gave Obama a 74 percent chance of winning , versus 24 percent for Clinton .
Prediction exchanges let traders buy and sell contracts on the likelihood of future events .
Contracts are structured so the prices can be read as a percent likelihood of an event occurring .
Studies of the prediction markets have shown they have an accuracy comparable to that of public opinion polls .
Traders on Intrade , which offers contracts on the outcome of individual state races , gave Obama , who would be the first black U.S. president , a 98 percent chance of winning the Mississippi presidential contest on Tuesday night .
Clinton was seen as having about a 2 percent chance of winning the state , where black voters are expected to make up more than half the Democratic turnout .
Clinton , a New York senator , was tipped to win the Pennsylvania primary on April 22 , with traders giving her an 81 percent chance versus 25 percent for Obama , trading data showed .
Pennsylvania would be an important victory for Clinton , who would be the first woman U.S. president .
She trails Obama in delegates to the party ’s nominating convention this summer .
More delegates are at stake in Pennsylvania than any other remaining contest , so the election offers her a chance to narrow the delegate gap with Obama , an Illinois senator .
OTHER STATE RACES
As the Obama - Clinton duel for the Democratic party nomination winds toward the August convention in Denver , the traders were betting Obama would carry North Carolina , Oregon , and Montana ; Clinton would carry West Virginia and Kentucky ; and Indiana was a tossup .
In previous presidential election years , the party contest has been sewn up long before primaries in these states .
No matter which candidate wins the nomination , traders on Intrade and the Iowa Electronic Markets were forecasting a Democratic victory in the November general election .
Intrade traders were giving the ultimate Democratic nominee a 61.5 percent chance of winning , versus about 39 percent for the Republican .
Traders on the Iowa markets saw a narrower race , with the Democrat having a 57 percent chance of winning , versus 47.4 percent for the Republican .
Trading in contracts such as whether Clinton or Obama will clinch the nomination has numbered in the hundreds of thousands on Intrade .
A vulnerability in the PlayStation Network may have given hackers access to PSN passwords as well as the personal info of the Network 's users , Sony revealed earlier today .
This " unauthorized access " is unlikely , though Sony maintains it is a possibility based on their findings .
The company maintains that the loss of vital credit card info is " very unlikely . "
Sony says it has since fixed the vulnerability and that players need no longer worry about the dangers of having their PSN account hacked , but it urges players to log into the service .
" If you can successfully sign in with your pre-set password , your account is not affected by this incident , " Sony states .
Anyone who has an issue logging in or other problems that may be related to this possible information leak should contact Sony 's Customer Service Department .

Youssif is able to smile again , and his scars are healing well .
Doctors are monitoring the swelling on his right ear .

WOODLAND HILLS , California ( CNN ) --
Youssif happily pulls off his plastic face mask and pats his cheeks , which were once covered by horrific burns .
" No hurt , " the 5 - year - old Iraqi boy says in English .
" No hurt . "
He then shows off his right hand .
It too had been marred by hardened scar tissue after he was attacked by masked men outside his central Baghdad home January 15 , 2007 .
Now , his hand is smooth .
Youssif flashes a proud grin .
A few moments later , he darts off and comes back toting his kindergarten portfolio .
In less than a month of schooling , he 's now writing the alphabet in upper - and lowercase .
See photos of a transformed Youssif »
He reads a book , repeating each word after the narrator .
When he gets to the word " you , " he gets tickled .
He points at the name " Youssif " and then covers the final four letters .
" You , " he says .
Youssif began attending an American school just last month , one year to the day after he was so savagely attacked in Baghdad .
In a recent letter to those who have helped his son , Youssif 's father described the anniversary as a " very hard day " to endure but one that also brought joy .
" But this year , it was the day for another miracle , Youssif 's first day of kindergarten .
It was a very happy day , " Youssif 's father said .
Youssif begins each day with his father strapping him into a bike trailer .
Dad then pedals him to school .
On one recent outing , his dad 's mobile phone blared Arabic music as Youssif quietly sat in the back , a helmet securely strapped to his head , the wind whirling past .
As soon as they reached the school , Youssif 's slow walk away from his father , his head held down , quickly changed into a sprint toward his classroom , and all you could see was the big red " S " on his Superman backpack flying away .
" Harry , " Youssif says in a small , muffled tone , reading the writing on the dry - erase board after receiving a little help from some classmates seated on the rug .
Watch Youssif - inspired music video »
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
He then receives a congratulatory high - five from one of his kindergarten teachers .
Youssif is adjusting well to school , able to write out the alphabet and count to 12 without hesitation .
He always finishes with an accomplished sigh , wide eyes and a smile so big , it 's as if he is making up for the 10 months he was not able to smile .
He is quick to show the pencil box on his desk , pointing to his name written on it and then pointing to himself with the same tiny finger and nodding his head , letting you know that it is his .
" The kids love Youssif .
They get more excited than he does when he learns a new word in English , and they brag about it for hours , " the mother of a classmate says .
Youssif is attending the school thanks to help from the Children 's Burn Foundation , the Grossman Burn Center and hundreds of thousands of dollars donated by you , the CNN.com user , to help bring him and his family to the United States for treatment .
Youssif has undergone more than half a dozen surgeries .
One removed the most massive scarring , which stretched about half a foot , from one of his ears to below his chin .
See how doctors removed Youssif 's scars »
He could undergo as many as 12 more procedures , his doctors say , mostly to tweak scars .
His right ear has swelled , and doctors are monitoring it to figure out the best way to keep it in check .
He wears a clear plastic face mask for much of the day to keep his skin tight and to allow it to heal correctly .
But the young boy 's transformation -- both in looks and in spirit -- is nothing short of remarkable .
Back at his apartment , Youssif peels a clementine .
He uses exaggerated motions as he plops each section in his mouth .
At one point , he places his hand on his hip and taps his foot , waiting for an acknowledgment of this feat .
When he came to America in September , he could n't eat -- or at least not like this .
He smiles again .
" Now , Youssif eats anything he wants , because he can open and close his mouth , " his father said in the letter .
" I have begun to see my son 's lively spirit return .
The surgeries have removed more than just external scars , they are also beginning to remove his internal scars .
" A few weeks ago we went to the park and Youssif rode on the merry - go - round .
Every time he passed by , he shrieked and laughed and waved wildly to me .
I thought my heart would burst with happiness . "

Members of We Are Change Colorado confronted a Denver advisory board for water about the ill health effects of fluoride , a known nero - toxin , as well as other related information , including the work of propagandist Edward Bernays to add it to the nation 's water supply ( his work also spurned approval for lead and asbestos usage ) .
The group gave a presentation filled with objective information and convincing arguments ... and standing up for the nation 's health in their actions .
" No one 's warning us not to drink the water , but they warn us not to ingest the toothpaste that has the same about of fluoride , " one member of Change argued .
The problems with public water supplies are well established -- for instance a recent controversy has arisen from an AP report that some 40 % of the nation 's water contains significant amounts of pharmaceutical drugs and other dangerous elements .
A detailed account of the meeting is posted here , but overall the board was quite sympathetic -- apparently pleasantly surprised that anyone from the public had bothered to show up .
That 's because it 's made up of volunteers :
The Citizens Advisory Committee ( CAC ) of Denver Water is a 10 - member volunteer committee whose function is to advise water department staff and commissioners on issues while encouraging and coordinating public participation in the water department 's policy making process .
One board member stated her agreement about fluoride concerns .
" I 'm getting to a point where I do n't know why we 're not looking at this . "
She proposed a full presentation on that issue as well as future action .
A We Are Change chapter in Ohio previously started a campaign calling for grocery giant Kroger to stop carrying fluoride - enhanced baby water ' Nursery ' .
These groups have helped point out that government officials are aware of the health risks posed by fluoride , yet it remains in the water supplies of most of the nation 's cities .
Several European nations have now banned its use in water .
Here are some of the hopeful statements from U.S. officials :
" Over the past ten years a large body of peer - reviewed science has raised concerns that fluoride may present unreasonable health risks , particularly among children , at levels routinely added to tap water in American cities . "
ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP , July 2005 .
" In summary , we hold that fluoridation is an unreasonable risk . "
US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY HEADQUARTERS ' UNION , 2001 .
" Carefully conducted studies of exposure to fluoride and emerging health parameters of interest ( e.g. , endocrine effects and brain function ) should be performed in populations in the United States exposed to various concentrations of fluoride . "

But the postracial style has its pitfalls .
‘ Acting Like He ’s White ’
Earlier this fall , the Rev. Jesse Jackson , an Obama supporter who ran for president twice , was quoted by a reporter as saying Mr. Obama “ needs to stop acting like he ’s white ” ( words that Mr. Jackson has variously said that he would never say and that were taken out of context ) .
He added , “ If I were a candidate , I ’d be all over Jena . ”
More recently , Mr. Jackson accused the Democratic candidates except for John Edwards of having “ virtually ignored ” the plight of blacks .
( His son , Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. , a national co-chairman of the Obama campaign , fired back in an op - ed column in The Chicago Sun - Times under the headline , “ You ’re wrong on Obama , Dad . ” )
“ A black candidate does n’t want to look like he ’s only a black candidate , ” the Rev. Al Sharpton , the civil rights activist , who ran for president in 2004 , said in an interview about Mr. Obama .
“ If he overidentifies with Sharpton , he looks like he ’s only a black candidate .
A white candidate reaches out to a Sharpton and looks like they have the ability to reach out .
It looks like they ’re presidential .
That ’s the dichotomy . ”
In a telephone interview , Mr. Obama denied that he had spoken less about race issues than other candidates .
But he said he focused when possible on “ the universal issues that all Americans care about . ”
His aim , he said , is “ to build broader coalitions that can actually deliver health care for all people or jobs that pay a living wage or all the issues that face not only black Americans but Americans generally . ”

He suggested that his critics were comparing him not with Mr. Edwards or Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton but with Mr. Jackson and Mr. Sharpton .
“ That comparison is one that is n’t appropriate , ” he said .
“ Because neither Reverend Jackson nor Reverend Sharpton is running for president of the United States .
They are serving an important role as activists and catalysts but they ’re not trying to build a coalition to actually govern . ”
Mr. Obama ’s legislative record does not diverge sharply from that of other black legislators , some who have studied it say .
For example , the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , which grades members of Congress on their support for its agenda , gave Mr. Obama a 100 percent score .
The difference between him and some others lies more in life experience , approach to politics and style .
Is it any surprise that we 've co-opted celebrity wombs ?
Consider the fact that most women 's bodies , even ordinary ones , are still considered public property by many .
Maybe what celebrities go through is just what most of us do , except with more cameras .
Jon Stewart , this year 's Oscar host , neglected to mention the record four women nominated for screenwriting awards .
But luckily for all of us , he did manage to make a stupid joke about four prominently pregnant actresses .
He had the camera zoom in on these unsuspecting — but expecting — women and as though they were vying for an Oscar , drew out an envelope and opened it slowly , saying " And the baby goes to … "
None of the reaction shots picked up particularly amused facial expressions .
I normally adore Jon Stewart 's wry commentary on the Daily Show , but this particular stab at humor was an unfortunate barometer of the times .
The bump - watch fad continues to flourish , and has shown no sign of abating .
From J - Lo's new twins to Jessica Alba 's belly - hiding gowns , from the pending addition ( biological this time ! ) to Angelina 's brood , to teen mama - to - be Jamie Lynn , their wombs belong to the public : to the first photographer who can get evidence , the first interviewer who can get proof , and then to everyone .
With every child conceived by a celebrity , the news cycle is fed on the biological processes of the female body .
There are months of doctor 's appointments to chronicle , expanding waistlines to eyeball , questions about prenatal smoking and caffeine to wag in these women 's faces .
Once the child is born , there 's the baby weight to drop , a process which , if you think about it , may be one of the most heinous social rituals ever invented : let 's remove all the physical evidence that you had a child and get you back to rock - hard abs , quick !
The whole childbearing cycle is a never - ending windfall for the paparazzi and the publications that keep them in business , and it's all fueled by a public claim to the physical knowledge , and metaphysical ownership , of women most of us have never met .
There have been lots of reasons posited for this growing obsession with the reproduction of the rich and famous .
A few years ago , even before Brangelina , Salon 's Rebecca Traister interviewed the top tabloid magazine editors who acknowledged that the public 's baby love was two sides of the same coin .
On one side is a desire for empathy and identification with stars who go through the very same physical transformations we all do .
On the other is a tinge of schadenfreude at seeing so - called " perfect " bodies get contorted and bloated like everyone else's .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .

The Terror Dream author Susan Faludi would likely add , and I 'd agree , that the current baby boom on screen and in the glossies must have something to do with the climate engendered by the war on terror .
The obstetrician 's office is the hip new backdrop for screwball comedy antics and perhaps , that office is the home front , too .
Every healthy baby produced by a rosy - cheeked American woman is a weapon against the " evildoers ! "
Like the images of domesticity and sainted motherhood that dominated pop culture during the height of the cold war in the 1950s , we may be turning towards images of female fecundity to assure ourselves that this country , and in fact the world , is n't headed towards apocalypse .
After all , if pop stars are procreating , than things can't be that bad , right ?
Ultimately , what underlies all the fertility - fixation is our massive social anxiety over the female body , its power to attract and change and reproduce .
Thus the obsessive pinpointing of the minute we can see the bump , the minute the last vestiges of baby weight melt away ; the details of women 's appearances and personal lives are on the public stage in a way that men's are n't .
And if you analyze which pregnant celebrities get stalked the most vigorously , they 're always the sex symbols , the paparazzi favorites to begin with .
Those figures whose bodies are already home to controversy always attract the most flashbulbs when they start wearing tunics instead of midriff - baring tops .
J- Lo , whose turbulent romantic history , unabashedly curvy body and reputation as a diva made her a target for years , and Jessica Alba , who is marketed as a male fantasy and who was recently victimized by the most invasive camera shot stalking imaginable , have been the hottest property for bump - watchers .
And then there 's bad - gal - gone maternal Jolie , who has managed to turn her image from wild child and home - wrecker to sainted mother .
But her newfound reprieve dangles over a precipice .
As the public obsession over her baby bump grows and scrutiny increases , it feels like an ominous warning .
One false step with her brood of kids and she could become like Madonna , whose decision to devote herself to motherhood has been criticized every step of the way , and who just got inappropriately , and idiotically , ambushed by Diane Sawyer in a fake gotcha - moment , reminding Madonna that she is still ours :
How can you write for children when you once wrote about sex ?
Is it any surprise that we 've co-opted celebrity wombs ?
Consider the fact that most women 's bodies , even ordinary ones , are still considered public property by many ( I 'm looking at you , Justice Kennedy ! ) , from co-workers and neighbors who criticize our clothing and appearance to public figures who moralize about our choices .
Maybe what celebrities go through is just what most of us do , except with more cameras .
The fact that many women can now go out in public proudly displaying their pregnancies , and swollen stomachs are now considered beautiful is fantastic and undeniable .
But it 's still the ultimate challenge for women to celebrate our bodies without being reduced to just our bodies - bumps , baby weight and all .

MW
By Osamu Tezuka
Rated 16 +
Vertical , $ 24.95
The opening scene of MW reminded me of a cheesy cop show from the 1970s : A car on a lonely bluff over the ocean , a truck swerving in from nowhere , a kidnapping plot gone awry , helicopters overhead , guys duking it out on the deck of a motorboat .
I kept expecting Tom Selleck or maybe Jill St. John to show up and join in , at least until things turned bloody at the end of the scene .
That 70s vibe continues throughout the book .
It ’s partly cosmetic : chief villain Yuki Michio ’s muttonchop sideburns and his stripey swingin ’ bachelor pad never let us forget what era this is , and Michio ’s chief pursuer is a flowing - haired detective who looks like he stepped out of a Peter Max painting .
The story is slick and shallow with plenty of action to keep the reader involved .
And while the book touches on issues that seem very contemporary — chemical weapons , the molestation of a child by a priest — these are merely story elements , dropped in without much commentary or angst .
It ’s hard to summarize MW without making it sound more outlandish than it actually is :
It ’s about a serial killer who plans to annihilate the entire earth — and the priest who loves him .
The story starts in the 1960s on an Okinawan island , where The Crows , a band of hippies straight out of Central Casting ( headbands , love beads , vest worn over bare chest ) kidnap a young boy , Michio , and send one of their number , Iwao Garai , to hide him in a cave .
During the night , Garai molests Michio , and when they emerge the next morning , everyone else on the island is dead , stopped in their tracks by what we later learn is a deadly gas , MW .
While Garai is spared , Michio is profoundly affected , physically and mentally , by MW , which has apparently burned away his conscience .
Tezuka skips the next 15 years and presents us with two characters who have apparently taken completely different paths : Garai is a priest , Michio works in a bank , where his planning abilities and utter cold - bloodedness are assets to his social and career climbing — and to his life of crime .
While some deeper themes are presented here , MW is really about watching Michio commit one heinous crime after another , pulling them all off with the same smirking competence .
Eventually it becomes clear that Michio is targeting those responsible for the MW incident and the subsequent coverup , but this is n’t about revenge ; Michio is dying , and he wants to take the rest of the world with him .
And he ’ll use MW to do it .
Most thrillers have something strongly pushing the action forward ; MW lacks that element of urgency until fairly late in the book , when the clock starts ticking and Michio is finally outwitted .
Tezuka has a great imagination , and he puts it to work devising an escalating series of adventures for Michio and Garai .
That does n’t mean he steers clear of the clichés of the genre :
When a reporter hot on the trail of MW agrees to meet Michio alone , late at night , in a garage , we know he ’s doomed .
And some of Michio ’s capers stretch even the credulity of a dedicated manga reader — such as when he murders a young woman , then puts on her dress and a wig and impersonates her so well that her parents are taken in .
Unfortunately , both main characters come across as pretty flat .
Michio is so cold - blooded and depraved that he ’s almost boring .
Whether he ’s dispatching his boss by hanging him from an iron bar and tossing lit matches in his face , setting up Garai in a gay sex club , or having sex with his dog , he does everything with the same smirking opacity , without ever slipping and showing us the inner man .
Garai has a conscience but does little with it ; the seal of the confessional provides a handy excuse for him to cover for Michio , but it ’s harder to understand why he repeatedly accompanies him and gets drawn into the action .
You ’d think he would learn after a while that this guy is trouble .
Garai and Michio ’s affair is the cheesiest part of the whole book .
Tezuka ’s figures are so smoothly polished that the sex scenes look almost abstract , and Michio does most of his seducing chastely clad in underpants , which make him look more comical than come - hither .
The biggest problem , though , is that Tezuka fails to establish a convincing emotional connection between Michio and Garai .
The general pattern is : Michio does something horrible , Garai decides to take a stand , Michio thwarts Garai and then says “ Oh come on , do n’t be mad , ” and they have sex .
The art in MW is smooth and straightforward , often dramatic but seldom outstanding .
Tezuka is at his best when he ’s working the whole page , and he has a few breathtaking turns here , but most of the time the action is contained in small panels and the illustrations are competing with the word balloons for space .
And there are a few places where he just punts .
You get the feeling his heart was n’t in it for big stretches .
Nonetheless , Vertical gives this volume the full treatment :
It ’s beautifully printed on creamy paper , with a luscious black and white and magenta cover and dust cover by Chip Kidd .
The artwork is flipped , which does n’t hurt the story much , and sound effects are translated and retouched so as to become part of the art .
MW reads pretty well as a caper story , not so well as literature .
It ’s entertaining enough to watch Michio pull off one clever but improbable plot after another , but he never really gets under your skin , and neither do the other characters .
It did n’t make me lose my religion , but it did keep me entertained enough not to want to put it down , which after all is exactly what comics are supposed to do .
This review is based on a complimentary copy supplied by the publisher .

Title • riverdance # 5
When I post a shot in my beachcombing category it 's normally quite a safe bet that nobody else has photographed the bucket , or piece of driftwood , or whatever else it is I happen to stumble across as I wander along the beach ; i.e. there 's no competition , and the shot stands or falls on its own merits ( or lack of them ) .
In this case though , there are hundreds of photographers taking photographs of this stranded ferry , so I wanted to make sure that I got at least one decent shot today – and I 'm pleased with this one .
Because of the angle it was taken from , it does n't do a great job of conveying the scale of this boat , but I 'm pretty pleased with the end result nonetheless .
I have n't posted the EXIF data , as this was an HDR constructed from three bracketed exposures , but all were taken at around 180 mm with my 70 - 200 mm zoom .
As always , let me know what you think .
It is no longer possible to have your irony meter redline when Karl Rove appears on TV .
He is so beyond the pale , so completely entrenched in his alternative reality that the only thing left to do is marvel at the brass cojones he must possess to pull off this appearance on The O'Reilly Factor .
Now that the Bush administration has officially endorsed Republican nominee John McCain , Bush 's Brain tells Billo that there 's a lot about McCain that the public does n't know , and those things would impress them .
For example , did you know that McCain adopted a dying baby from Bangladesh ?
Download Download ( h/t Bill W )
I do n’t think people know a lot about him .
They do n’t know about his views and values that informed him as a young man .
They do n’t know about what drew him to service in the United States Navy .
They do n’t know about all of the compelling story about the POW experience that he had .
They do n’t know what motivated him , but what people and places in Sedona touch his life .
Let me give you just one example : I think most of your viewers be shocked to hear the story about Cindy McCain in Bangladesh , visiting an orphanage , and she has a small dying child thrust into her hands and the orphanage … the people in the orphanage say we can’t , we ca n’t care for her , she ’s dying , we do n’t know what to do .
And Cindy McCain ’s impulse was to hold that …hug that child to her chest , get on an airplane and bring her home .
When she got off the plane , there was John McCain , and he said , “ What do you got ? ” and she said “ I ’ve got a child who ’s dying , we need to get her help … we need to get her care . ”
And John said , “ Well , who is she going to be staying with ? ” and Cindy McCain said , “ I was hoping that she could stay with us . ”
And today , that young child -- who was near death -- is their teenage daughter .
I do n’t think most people understand the compassion and love that would come from a moment like that .
There ’s a lot more of John McCain ’s story that he needs to tell .
Funnily enough , Rove felt that it was his job to tell McCain 's story about his daughter Bridget back in 2000 , and the version he told then was significantly different :
Rove invented a uniquely injurious fiction for his operatives to circulate via a phony poll .
Voters were asked , " Would you be more or less likely to vote for John McCain ... if you knew he had fathered an illegitimate black child ? "
This was no random slur .
McCain was at the time campaigning with his dark - skinned daughter , Bridget , adopted from Bangladesh .
UPDATE : Looks like Karl Rove and some other Bush cronies are informally advising McCain now .
How cozy .

Cato ’s Michael
Tanner takes a look at the guy who will , barring something truly extraordinary , be the Republican nominee for President :
While Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity sometimes portray McCain as a virtual clone of Ted Kennedy , the fact is that he is a true fiscal conservative — certainly more of a fiscal conservative than , say , Mitt Romney .
He is well known as an opponent of earmarks and pork barrel spending .
But perhaps more importantly , he has long been an advocate of entitlement reform .
He was early an ardent support of personal accounts for Social Security , and has pushed for serious Medicare reform , including means - testing .
Almost alone among Republicans , he opposed the disastrous Medicare prescription drug benefit .
Tanner also argues that McCain has good proposals , from a free market perspective , on health care and taxes and that , unlike guys like Mike Huckabee , he ’s a free trader .
But it ’s not all rosy :
John McCain frequently makes Dr. Strangelove look like a peacenik .
Its not just his desire to remain in Iraq “ for a hundred years . ”
It ’s his bellicosity toward every enemy and perceived enemy from Iran to North Korea .
He ’s a true believer in the neoconservative goal of remaking the world to fit our desires and beliefs .
At best on foreign policy he would be a competent Bush .
At worst , he appears a recipe for perpetual conflict .
On domestic policy , he has shown a disturbing predilection for elevating every personal pet peeve , from steroids in baseball to airplane service quality , to a federal issue .
And , he has embraced heavily regulatory environmental policies and compulsory national service
And then you get to the fact that McCain seems to view the First Amendment as optional and that he is , Tanner notes , a friend of government :
Most worrisome of all appears to be McCain ’s basic philosophy , which is unapologetically statist , as Matt Welch points out in his new book McCain : The Myth of a Maverick .
McCain once said “ each and every one of us has a duty to serve a cause greater than our own self - interest . ”
McCain believes that cause to be the good of the collective , often defined as the nation or the national community .
Tanner ends up saying that McCain is , at best , a “ mixed bag ” but I think it ’s worse than that .
As I noted back in March 2007 , John McCain is not a friend of liberty .
Unfortunately , he ’s got a very good shot at being the next President of the United States .
The moves , which emerged from recent business reviews , are the latest in a series of changes that Mr. Pandit has made since taking over for Charles O. Prince III in December .
Citigroup has been hard hit by the credit crisis , with more than $ 20 billion in write - offs and a 60 percent drop in its stock price over the last year .
Besides strengthening its balance sheet , Mr. Pandit has appointed a new chief risk officer and made changes in the way its mortgage operations and global wealth management unit are structured .
Even so , investors continue to raise concerns about its financial health as it braces for billions of dollars in additional losses .
The moves also illustrate the organizational and personnel challenges facing Mr. Pandit , who must be part psychologist and chess master overseeing Citigroup ’s brutally political culture .
“ By putting the right talent in the right places , we are enhancing Citi ’s ability to meet the needs of our institutional clients , ” Mr. Pandit said in a statement .
The appointment was reported Monday by The Wall Street Journal .
Mr. Klein is widely viewed as a brilliant relationship banker and has been enormously influential in helping Citigroup raise new capital with his strong ties to Middle East investors .
But he was considered a poor manager who did not like to share authority .
His spats with Thomas Maheras , his co-head at the investment bank , provided a steady stream of gossip throughout the company .
Mr. Klein has also threatened to quit on several occasions , according to people close to the company .
Last fall , as Mr. Prince considered a plan to name Mr. Pandit the head of the investment bank , he said he would leave if he were effectively demoted .
Mr. Klein denies that he ever threatened to leave , according to a person briefed on his thinking .
The Obama campaign raised the possibility of political motivation
Barack Obama
A spokesman for the department , Sean McCormack , said the cases were probably the result of " imprudent curiosity " .
Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told reporters she had apologised to Senator Obama .
A spokesman for Mr Obama suggested that the government could be using private information for " political purposes " .
The BBC's North America editor , Justin Webb , says it is an extraordinary lapse in security which allowed temporary state department employees access to personal information on a man who is guarded by the secret service day and night .
' Security breach '
The state department tracks those who access its passport database .
Breaches occurred on three separate dates - 9 January , 21 February and 14 March .
" We believe this was out of imprudent curiosity , so we are taking steps to reassure ourselves that that is , in fact , the case , " Mr McCormack said .
But he said it was not clear what the employees may have seen or what they were looking for .
Ms Rice said she had telephoned Mr Obama to apologise .
" I told him that I was sorry and I told him that I myself would be very disturbed if I learned that somebody had looked into my passport file , " she told reporters .
Bill Burton , a spokesman for Democratic contender Mr Obama 's campaign , called for a full investigation .
" This is an outrageous breach of security and privacy , even from an administration that has shown little regard for either over the last eight years , " he said .
" Our government 's duty is to protect the private information of the American people , not use it for political purposes . "
" We demand to know who looked at Senator Obama 's passport file , for what purpose , and why it took so long for them to reveal this security breach . "

The Wikileaks website , which publishes sensitive and censored material submitted by anonymous contributors , has experienced unprecedented levels of Internet traffic today through public interest .
This interest has caused the website 's servers to be unable to meet the demand of over 164 gigabytes of download traffic within twenty - four hours , leading the site to be temporarily inaccessible .
The film Fitna , directed and produced by Dutch politician Geert Wilders , has caused controversy for its presentation of Wilders ' negative view of Islam as being committed to world domination and acts of terrorism .
A trailer for the film was widely uploaded to many video sharing sites , including YouTube and Google Video ; this met with anger from Islamic nations , the debacle culminating in Pakistan 's government ordering the nation 's internet service providers to block the YouTube site .
This caused YouTube to be inaccessible to residents of other countries whose Internet service providers ' equipment automatically began routing traffic to YouTube via Pakistan Telecom 's servers , due to their ban accidentally propagating to other providers .
Ultimately , YouTube acquiesced to the demands made by Pakistan and other organisations , in exchange for access being restored .
The site LiveLeak originally hosted a copy of the trailer , which has now been replaced with a video message stating that the lives of their staff have been put at risk due to hosting it .
As a consequence of this censorship , Wikileaks mirrored the video , receiving heavy access traffic through hosting one of the few copies remaining on the Internet .
Wikinews has obtained an exclusive statement from a representative of Wikileaks , affirming that the site has not been taken off - line due to external pressure , and is instead suffering technical problems due to this high demand .
The representative gave the following statement :
“ It seems that due to a more than less overwhelming interest in the Fitna video and recent other media coverage from the protests in Tibet , as well as a few dozen new documents leaked on the portal in the last few days , parts of the portal have given up service and need a few warm words from a friendly Wikileaks operator .
Please standby , the portal will be back soon . ”
Wikileaks gained recent public attention in the Bank Julius Baer vs. Wikileaks lawsuit , following publication of leaked documents that were alleged to provide evidence of money laundering , tax evasion and asset hiding by Swiss financial institution Bank Julius Baer .
The documents are said to have been uploaded by Rudolf Elmer , a former chief operating officer of the bank 's Cayman Islands division , who was sacked following an investigation by the bank that involved polygraph testing .
Wikileaks has not , however , stated that Elmer was the source of the documents .
Bank Julius Baer sought an injunction against the operator of Wikileaks ' domain name , Dynadot , to remove access to the site from the Wikileaks.org domain ; this was granted by the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California .
The site was consequently inaccessible through this domain , although access could be obtained through many alternate addresses .
Following activity by organisations such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union , who sought to defend the right to free speech that Wikileaks relied upon , the lawsuit was dropped and access was restored .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
The House on Thursday quickly passed a Senate - approved economic stimulus package and sent the bill to the president 's desk for his signature .
Sen . Max Baucus said Democrats stripped down the stimulus bill to attract GOP votes .
The House voted 380 - 34 to accept the Senate 's $ 170 billion measure , just a few hours after Democratic and Republican senators reached accord and ended a days - long stalemate over the bill .
The deal , passed in the Senate on a 81 - 16 vote , includes rebate check amounts of $ 300 to $ 600 for people who have an income between $ 3,000 and $ 75,000 , plus $ 300 per child .
Couples earning up to $ 150,000 would get $ 1,200 .
But the plan also gives checks to more than 20 million Social Security beneficiaries and 250,000 handicapped veterans and their widows .
Two White House officials said President Bush will probably sign the bill next week .
Senior administration officials said the Internal Revenue service will start working to implement the rebate check program as soon as the final details are reached and will not wait for the president to sign the bill .
Officials said checks could be sent to millions of Americans this spring .
" I 'm very happy that the vast majority of the U.S. Senate agreed that we have to change the economic direction of this country , and we 've done that , " Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nevada , told reporters .
Do n't Miss
But he expressed dismay the package omits a number of provisions Democrats had sought , including an extension of unemployment benefits and checks for people aided by the food stamp program and the low - income home energy assistance program , measures that Senate Republicans and President Bush opposed .
" They 're following this president right off a cliff , " Reid said .
" What they do n't realize is he 's already over the cliff . "
Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he was happy with the outcome : " I think we 've demonstrated to the American people that we are , once in a while , able to come together and do something important to the country with a minimum amount of bipartisan bickering and do it in a timely fashion . "
McConnell said the Senate bill also fixed a " glitch " in the House bill that would have made it possible for illegal immigrants to receive checks .
Senate Democrats agreed to scale back their economic stimulus package in order to gain Republican support for the measure .
The measure stalled Wednesday over GOP concerns the bill was too big and loaded with special - interest provisions , said Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus , D - Montana .
Watch why the stimulus bill stalled »
Congressional leaders and the White House had hoped to pass a stimulus package quickly to address economic fears of recession .
The agreement came shortly after Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson urged Congress to move with haste on the package to reduce the odds of the nation 's economy descending into recession .
" We believe that a growth package must be enacted quickly , it must be robust , temporary and broad - based , and it must get money into the economy quickly , " he told the House Ways and Means Committee .
Earlier Thursday , House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - California , in an effort to get the Senate - blocked economic stimulus package rolling , said the House was ready to respond .
" We are eagerly awaiting the decision of the Senate as to how they will go forward .
...
If they do not , we stand ready to do so . "
Pelosi said .
" Decisions have to be made , and again we want this to be timely so that it makes a difference for people right away , targeted to those in the middle class , and those who wish to be in the middle class ; and ... [ timely ] , so that people will use it , " she said .
On Wednesday , seven Republicans joined 51 Democrats in supporting the broader Senate package , which would have injected about $ 50 billion more into the sagging economy than the plan President Bush and House leaders supported .
But the Senate ended up two votes short of the 60 votes needed to advance the bill in the face of a GOP filibuster .
The nearly $ 150 billion package Bush proposed last month was approved overwhelmingly by the House January 29 .

My Daughter , and Tibet , China and the Neocons
DIGG THIS
My daughter Hannah will soon receive her Ph.D. in neuroscience from a prestigious graduate school on the east coast .
She tells me what she is working on , but , dufus that I am on all such matters , I have n’t got the slightest idea of what she is talking about .
Something to do with spines , or brains ?
Maybe lesions on the brain ?
Something like that .
If you will forgive a proud poppa bragging about his baby girl , Hannah is a real bright woman , and very hard working , too .
When she was about 2 years old , before she learned to read , she memorized entire ( kiddie ) books , and tried to fool me into believing she could actually read them ( fooling her daddy was something she always took great delight in ) .
I knew she could n’t read since she was n’t word perfect .
At around this time I asked her if she wanted to invite Betty Bear to her upcoming birthday party .
She looked at me with real scorn and derision in her eye and said : " Betty Bear is n’t real . "
I think she thought then that in the lottery of daddies , she got a real stupid one .
( I ’m not sure she ’s changed her mind about this initial assessment . )
When she was about 8 years old , she would typically walk home from school with a book right in front of her face ; she was n’t really looking where she was going .
Needless to say , she was the valedictorian of her high school .
If memory serves , at university she received all A’s .
Or was there some one moron professor who once gave her a lower grade ?
I ’m not sure .
( I dare not ask her ; she ’s a world champion eye roller . )
In any case , I am so delighted with her course of study , I ca n’t tell you .
I hope that one day she makes a real contribution to solving some disease or other , probably having to do with the brain or spinal chord .
In this regard I once ( okay , okay , more than several times ) gave her marching orders : next year she would cure cancer ; the year after , AIDS ; then , she could work on MS , and after that some other dread disease .
When I first broached this subject she would roll her eyes and say " Yes , Dad . "
Nowadays , she does n’t even roll her eyes .
The other day some woman told me that her husband was dying of cancer .
I ’ll be damned if I did n’t draw some small amount of comfort from the " fact " that Hannah would soon be curing that disease , hopefully in time to save this precious life .
Weird how the mind works , sometimes .
What oh what does this have to do with the present brouhaha about Tibet , and China , and the neocon present saber rattling about that country ?
I ’m glad you asked me .
It is this .
I was ruminating the other day , thinking about my medical " assignments " to Hannah .
My mind , that is , what there is that is left of it , went off in the following direction : of course , she is not going to cure all diseases known to man .
( We joke around a lot in my family ; one of the early child books we used to read at bedtime concerned the " Clown Around " family .
Well , I suppose there are worse things than helping your kids develop a great sense of humor . )
If she has a very successful career , she may just be able to make a small contribution to dealing with just one of them .
But , suppose , just suppose , I could have my wishes come true in this regard .
What would I really ask her to do ?
Well , maybe , my " assignments " to her were n’t so off the wall after all , given her predilections .
But suppose I wanted more realism , while still being true to my wish list ‘ druthers .
Then , what would I ask for ?
Well , still , that is not a bad set of goals .
After all , who , really , opposes consigned to the dust bin of history every disease that has ever afflicted mankind ?
Not even Hitler , or Stalin , one would suppose .
But if I wanted to be even more realistic ?
That is , to ask for something that could actually come about , right now , if we were all of a mind to achieve it ?
See , the problem with curing all diseases is that it is really impossible given our present knowledge .
Even if all scientists around the world work full out on this problem , and many of them are , they still cannot solve it .
We exist in a context of ignorance .
There is , however , one problem that afflicts mankind pretty much on the same level as illness : we keep killing each other , often on truly massive scales .
The latest threat in this regard , it would appear ( I told you I ’d get the second point of this article ) is the fact that there is a very real danger of the U.S. bombing not Iran , but China .
( Okay , okay , both of these " evil empires . " )
Why China , for God ’s sake ?
Because they are being nasty to the Tibetans who want to secede .
Now let it be said , loud and clear , I favor secession ; heck , not only at the national level , but also including states , cities , boroughs , neighborhoods , families , even individuals ; see here , here and here .
Certainly , I support the Tibetan cause .
By all means , allow them to set up their own country .
And this goes for Taiwan as well .
Anyone who opposes this is certainly on the non-libertarian side of this debate .
But the call for a separate country of Tibet comes with particular ill grace from the neocons , and indeed , from any American .
If this attack on China for its rejection of Tibetan ( Taiwanese ) separation is to come with clean hands , we must support , domestically :
giving large swatches of the American southwest back to Mexico
allowing the confederate states to set up their own country
rescinding the unconstitutional Louisiana purchase
redoing our borders with Canada in favor of the latter ; " 54 - 40 or fight , " indeed
( Do n’t think that if we gave up all this territory , we would somehow cease to exist .
No , we could live better , and prosper to a greater degree , under much more salutary political arrangements . )
And , on the international scale , if we are to obviate the charge of hypocrisy , we must favor the separation of
the Basques from Spain
Chechnya from Russia
the Flemish and the Walloons
Scotland , Northern Ireland , and Wales from the UK
Unlike dealing with sickness , we could , if we were so minded , at one fell swoop , end all of man ’s brutality to man .
It would not require knowledge we do not have , merely an act of will .
There are worse places to start this process than getting off China ’s back regarding Tibet ( and Taiwan . )
Surely , China is in the wrong here .
But the U.S. is in no position to make this case .
Let us first get our own house in order , before blundering around the globe , setting things right everywhere else .
The Samuelson introductory economic text used to compare the U.S. and the USSR economy .
In the view of this pinko professor , the latter would soon overtake the former in terms of economic development .
Nonsense on stilts , of course .
However , if there were a similar comparison made between the U.S. and China , indicating , over time , patterns of freedom within the two respective countries , it would indicate that the former is falling , while the latter is increasing at a rate perhaps never before matched in all of human history .
Just a few short decades ago , the People ’s Republic was wallowing in Communism , totalitarianism , central planning and outright starvation .
Nowadays , there is a real question as to which is the freer country .
If this past pattern persists , there will soon be no doubt .
So , again , we have an anomaly : the US , bully boy to the world , where freedom is fast disappearing , is presuming to lecture China , which has no foreign military bases anywhere , and where domestic freedom is wildly on the upsurge .
With the neocons in full cry , it is possible , just possible , that Hannah and her colleagues will cure all physical ailments before we put a stop to the horrendous international slaughter — actual and threatened — that now infests our species .
